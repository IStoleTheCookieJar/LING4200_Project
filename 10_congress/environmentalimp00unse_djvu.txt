ABSTRACT 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  has  been  prepared  in  response  to  an  application 
submitted  on  May  25,  2010  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  by  PSEG 
Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP).  The  proposed 
actions  requested  in  the  PSEG  application  are  (1 )  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG 
Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  (2) 
U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit 
application  to  perform  certain  construction  activities  on  the  site.  The  USACE  is  a  cooperating 
agency  with  the  NRC  in  preparing  this  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team. 

This  EIS  includes  the  review  team's  analysis  that  considers  and  weighs  the  environmental 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  at 
alternative  sites  and  mitigation  measures  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  impacts. 
The  EIS  also  addresses  Federally  listed  species,  cultural  resources,  essential  fish  habitat 
issues,  and  plant  cooling  system  design  alternatives. 

The  EIS  includes  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed  action’s  impacts  on  waters  of  the  United  States 
pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899.  The  USACE  will  conduct  a  public  interest  review  in  accordance  with 
the  guidelines  promulgated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  under  authority  of 
Section  404(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  public  interest  review,  which  will  be  addressed  in 


November  2015 


NUREG-2168 


Abstract 


the  USACE  permit  decision  document,  will  include  an  alternatives  analysis  to  determine  the 
least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative. 

After  considering  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  proposed  NRC  action,  the  NRC  staffs 
recommendation  to  the  Commission  is  that  the  ESP  be  issued  as  requested. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  (1)  the  application  submitted  by  PSEG,  including  Revision  4 
of  the  Environmental  Report  (ER),  and  the  PSEG  responses  to  requests  for  additional 
information  from  the  NRC  and  USACE  staffs;  (2)  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and 
local  agencies;  (3)  the  staff’s  independent  review;  (4)  the  staffs  consideration  of  comments 
related  to  the  environmental  review  that  were  received  during  the  public  scoping  process  and 
the  public  comment  period  following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and  (5)  the  assessments 
summarized  in  this  EIS,  including  the  potential  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  ER  and  this 
EIS.  The  USACE  will  issue  its  Record  of  Decision  based,  in  part,  on  this  EIS.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  presents  the  results  of  a  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  environmental  review  of  an  application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  at  a 
proposed  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  In  support  of  its  proposed  action  of  issuing  a 
Department  of  the  Army  permit,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  participated  in  the 
preparation  of  the  EIS  as  a  cooperating  agency  and  as  a  collaborative  member  of  the  review 
team,  which  consisted  of  the  NRC  staff,  its  contractor  staff,  and  the  USACE  staff. 

BACKGROUND 

On  May  25,  2010,  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  submitted  an 
application  to  the  NRC  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope 
Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways 
Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  On  June  5,  2015.  PSEG  submitted  a  fourth 
revised  version  of  its  application,  which  also  included  an  Environmental  Report  (ER). 

Upon  acceptance  of  PSEG’s  initial  application,  the  NRC  review  team  began  the  environmental 
review  process  as  described  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52  by 
publishing  in  the  Federal  Register  on  October  15,  2010,  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  prepare  an  EIS  and 
conduct  scoping.  As  part  of  the  environmental  review,  the  review  team  did  the  following: 

•  considered  comments  received  during  the  60-day  scoping  process  that  began  on

Executive  Summary 


PROPOSED  ACTION 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1)  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  (2)  the  USACE  issuance  of  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  pursuant  to 
Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean  Water  Act  [CWA])  and  Section  10 
of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899,  as  amended,  to  perform  certain  dredge 
and  fill  activities  on  the  site. 

PURPOSE  AND  NEED  FOR  ACTION 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  NRC  proposed  action — issuance  of  the  ESP — is  to  provide  for 
early  resolution  of  site  safety  and  environmental  issues,  which  provides  stability  in  the  licensing 
process.  Although  no  reactor  will  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site  under  this  action  (the  ESP),  to 
resolve  environmental  issues  the  staff  assumed  in  this  EIS  that  one  or  two  reactors  with  the 
parameters  specified  in  the  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  would  be  built  and  operated.  Any 
new  nuclear  plant  would  provide  for  additional  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  need 
for  up  to  2,200  MW(e)  of  baseload  power  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  by  2021 . 

The  objective  of  the  PSEG-requested  USACE  action  is  to  obtain  a  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  to  perform  regulated  dredge  and  fill  activities  that  would  affect  wetlands  and 
other  waters  of  the  United  States.  The  basic  purpose  of  obtaining  the  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  is  for  PSEG  to  conduct  work  associated  with  building  a  power  plant  to  generate 
electricity  for  additional  baseload  capacity. 

PUBLIC  INVOLVEMENT 

A  60-day  scoping  period  was  held  from  October  15,  2010  through  December  14,  2010,  and  on 
November  4,  2010,  the  NRC  held  public  scoping  meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  during 
which  interested  parties  were  invited  to  provide  comments  on  the  applicant’s  ER.  The  review 
team  received  many  oral  comments  during  the  public  meetings  and  12  written  statements, 

7  letters,  and  1  e-mail  during  the  scoping  period  on  topics  including  surface-water  hydrology, 
ecology,  socioeconomics,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  air  quality,  uranium  fuel  cycle,  energy 
alternatives,  and  benefit-cost  balance. 

In  addition,  during  the  105-day  comment  period  on  the  draft  EIS,  the  review  team  held  public 
meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  on  October  1,  2014  and  in  Middletown,  Delaware  on 
October  23,  2014.  A  combined  total  of  approximately  75  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in 
New  Jersey,  and  approximately  140  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in  Delaware. 

A  number  of  attendees  at  each  meeting  provided  oral  comments. 

AFFECTED  ENVIRONMENT 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS 
and  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
PSEG  Site  is  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  about  1 8  mi  south  of  Wilmington, 
Delaware,  and  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  The  site  is  about  7  mi  east  of 
Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,

Cooling  water  for  any  new  nuclear  units  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  obtained  from 
the  Delaware  River.  These  units  would  use  either  mechanical  or  natural  draft  cooling  towers  to 
transfer  waste  heat  to  the  atmosphere.  A  portion  of  the  water  obtained  from  the  Delaware  River 
would  be  returned  to  the  environment  via  a  discharge  structure  located  in  the  Delaware  River  on

EVALUATION  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACTS 

When  evaluating  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  nuclear  power  plant  construction) 
and  operations,  the  NRC’s  authority  is  limited  to  construction  activities  related  to  radiological 
health  and  safety  or  common  defense  and  security;  that  is,  under  10  CFR  51.4,  the 
NRC-authorized  activities  are  related  to  safety-related  structures,  systems,  or  components  and 
may  include  pile  driving;  subsurface  preparation;  placement  of  backfill,  concrete,  or  permanent 
retaining  walls  within  an  excavation;  installation  of  foundations;  or  in-place  assembly,  erection, 
fabrication,  or  testing.  In  this  EIS,  the  NRC  review  team  evaluates  the  potential  environmental 
impacts  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  the 
following  resource  areas: 

•  land  use, 

•  air  quality, 

•  aquatic  ecology, 

•  terrestrial  ecology, 

•  surface  water  and  groundwater, 

•  waste  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  human  health  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  socioeconomics  and  environmental  justice,  and 

•  historic  and  cultural  resources. 

This  EIS  also  evaluates  impacts  associated  with  accidents,  the  fuel  cycle,  decommissioning, 
and  transportation  of  radioactive  materials. 

The  impacts  are  designated  as  SMALL,  MODERATE, 
or  LARGE.  The  incremental  impacts  related  to  the 
construction  and  operations  activities  requiring  the 
NRC  authorization  are  described  and  characterized, 
as  are  the  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  the 
proposed  action  when  the  effects  are  added  to,  or 
interact  with,  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  effects  on  the  same  resources. 

Table  ES-1  provides  a  summary  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  found 
that  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  would  be 
SMALL  for  several  resource  categories,  including 

demography,  nonradiological  health,  radiological  health,  severe  accidents,  waste,  fuel  cycle, 
decommissioning,  and  transportation. 


SMALL:  Environmental  effects  are 
not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that 
they  will  neither  destabilize  nor 
noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute 
of  the  resource. 

MODERATE:  Environmental  effects 
are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but 
not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes 
of  the  resource. 

LARGE:  Environmental  effects  are 
clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to 
destabilize  important  attributes  of  the 
resource.

(a)  The  entry  “None"  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts 

to  minority  or  low-income  populations  from  the  proposed  action.  Rather,  “None”  means 

that,  while  there  may  be  adverse  impacts,  those  impacts  do  not  affect  minority  or  low- 

income  populations  in  any  disproportionate  manner,  relative  to  the  general  population. 

The  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  for  physical  impacts,  infrastructure  and  community 
services,  and  air  quality  would  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  The  review  team  found  that  the 
cumulative  environmental  impacts  on  land  use,  surface-water  use  and  quality,  groundwater  use 
and  quality,  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be 
MODERATE.  However,  the  contributions  of  impacts  from  the  NRC-authorized  activities  would 
be  SMALL  for  all  of  the  above-listed  resource  areas,  except  for  land-use  impacts;  physical 
impacts,  infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources. 
The  new  cooling  towers  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  physical  impacts 
associated  with  aesthetics  in  certain  locations,  and  traffic  impacts  during  the  peak  periods  for 
building  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for 
infrastructure  and  community  services.

NUREG-2168 


Executive  Summary 


Incremental  impacts  associated  with  the  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission 
lines  would  be  the  principal  contributors  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for  land  use  and 
for  historic  and  cultural  resources.  Extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  water  from  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  the  primary  driver  for  the  MODERATE  impacts  for  surface-water  use 
and  quality.  Similarly,  extensive  past  and  present  groundwater  withdrawals  from  the  local 
aquifer  system  would  contribute  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  to  groundwater 
resources. 

Cumulative  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystem  impacts  would  be  MODERATE  because  of  the 
loss  of  habitat  from  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission  line  corridors.  The 
significant  history  of  the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had 
a  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities. 
Building  and  operating  any  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  in  conjunction  with  the 
operations  of  the  existing  HOGS  and  SGS  nuclear  units,  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  to 
LARGE  cumulative  impacts  to  aquatic  ecosystems. 

The  cumulative  impacts  to  taxes  and  the  economy  would  be  beneficial  and  would  range  from 
SMALL  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  the  region  to  LARGE  for  Salem  County. 

There  are  few  minority  or  low-income  populations  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  review  team 
identified  no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low- 
income  populations. 

The  cumulative  impacts  on  air  quality  would  range  from  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  to 
MODERATE  for  greenhouse  gases,  based  on  both  their  emissions  and  associated 
concentrations  in  the  atmosphere. 

NEED  FOR  POWER  AND  ALTERNATIVES 

The  review  team  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be  produced  by  the  proposed 
project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule  (i.e. ,  by  2021 ),  there  would 
be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor  design  in  the  PPE, 
such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (i.e.,  the  power  it  would  provide)  would  be 
realized. 

The  review  team  also  considered  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  alternatives  to 
issuing  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  alternatives  included  a  no-action  alternative  (i.e.,  not 
issuing  the  ESP),  as  well  as  alternative  energy  sources,  siting  locations,  and  system  designs. 

The  no-action  alternative  would  result  in  the  ESP  not  being  granted  or  the  USACE  not  issuing 
its  permit.  Upon  such  a  denial,  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  in  accordance  with  the  10  CFR  52  (10  CFR  52-TN251)  process  referencing  an  approved 
ESP  would  not  occur,  and  the  predicted  environmental  impacts  would  not  take  place.  If  other 
generating  sources  were  built  to  meet  the  need  for  power,  either  at  another  site  or  using  a 
different  energy  source,  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  those  other  sources  would 
eventually  occur.  The  review  team  also  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be 
produced  by  the  proposed  project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Executive  Summary 


(by  2021),  there  would  be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor 
design  in  the  PPE.  such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (the  power  it  would  provide) 
would  be  realized. 

Based  on  the  review  team's  review  of  energy  alternatives,  the  review  team  eliminated  several 
energy  sources  (e.g.,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass)  from  full  consideration  because  those 
technologies  are  not  currently  capable  of  meeting  the  baseload  electricity  need.  The  review 
team  concluded  that,  from  an  environmental  perspective,  none  of  the  viable  baseload 
alternatives  (i.e.,  natural  gas,  coal,  or  a  combination  of  alternatives)  is  clearly  environmentally 
preferable  to  building  new  baseload  nuclear  power  generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Table  ES-2  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  viable  energy 
alternatives. 

The  review  team  compared  the  cumulative  effects  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  PSEG  Site 
against  those  at  the  alternative  sites.  The  following  four  alternatives  sites  were  selected  for 
review  (see  Figure  ES-2): 

•  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey;  and 

•  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey. 

Table  ES-3  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  cumulative  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites. 
Although  there  are  differences  and  distinctions  between  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts 
of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  at  one  of  the 
alternative  sites,  the  review  team  concludes  that  these  differences  are  not  sufficient  to 
determine  that  any  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site 
for  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In  such  a  case,  the  PSEG  Site  prevails 
because  none  of  the  alternative  sites  are  clearly  environmentally  preferable. 

The  review  team  considered  various  alternative  systems  designs,  including  alternative  heat- 
dissipation  systems  and  multiple  alternative  intake,  discharge,  and  water-supply  systems. 

The  review  team  identified  no  alternatives  for  the  PSEG  Site  that  would  be  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  systems  designs  used  as  the  basis  for  analysis  in  this  EIS.  However,  if  at 
some  time  in  the  future  PSEG  requests  authorization  from  the  NRC  (e.g.,  a  combined  license) 
to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  the  review  team  will  need  to  compare  the 
specific  heat  dissipation  design  chosen  to  the  other  designs  that  were  included  in  the  PPE 
(Section  9.4.1  provides  more  detail  on  this  matter).

Executive  Summary 


BENEFITS  AND  COSTS 

The  review  team  compiled  and  compared  the  pertinent  analytical  conclusions  reached  in  this 
EIS.  All  of  the  expected  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  were  gathered  and  aggregated  into  two  final  categories:  (1)  the  expected 
environmental  costs  and  (2)  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  from  approval  of  the  proposed 
action.  Although  the  analysis  in  Section  10.6  of  this  EIS  is  conceptually  similar  to  a  purely 
economic  benefit-cost  analysis,  which  determines  the  net  present  dollar  value  of  a  given  project, 
the  intent  of  that  section  is  to  identify  potential  societal  benefits  of  the  proposed  activities  and 
compare  them  to  the  potential  internal  (i.e.,  private)  and  external  (i.e.,  societal)  costs  of  the 
proposed  activities.  In  general,  the  purpose  is  to  inform  the  ESP  process  by  gathering  and 
reviewing  information  that  demonstrates  the  likelihood  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed 
activities  outweigh  the  aggregate  costs. 

On  the  basis  of  the  assessments  in  this  EIS,  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  with  mitigation  measures  identified  by  the  review  team,  would  accrue 
benefits  (e.g.,  the  electricity  produced)  that  most  likely  would  outweigh  the  economic, 
environmental,  and  social  costs.  For  the  NRC-proposed  action  (i.e.,  the  issuance  of  the  ESP), 
the  accrued  future  benefits  would  also  outweigh  the  costs  of  preconstruction,  construction,  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

RECOMMENDATION 

The  NRC  staff's  recommendation  to  the  Commission  related  to  the  environmental  aspects  of  the 
proposed  action  is  that  the  ESP  should  be  issued  as  proposed. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  the  following: 

•  the  application,  including  the  ER  and  its  revisions,  submitted  by  PSEG; 

•  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies; 

•  consideration  of  public  comments  received  during  scoping  and  the  public  comment  period 
following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and 

•  the  review  team’s  independent  review  and  assessment  as  detailed  in  this  EIS. 

In  making  its  recommendation,  the  NRC  staff  determined  that  none  of  the  alternative  sites  is 
environmentally  preferable  (and  therefore,  also  not  obviously  superior)  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
NRC  staff  also  determined  that  none  of  the  energy  or  cooling-system  alternatives  assessed  is 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  action. 

The  NRC  staffs  determination  is  independent  of  the  USACE’s  determination  of  whether  the 
PSEG  Site  is  the  least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative  pursuant  to  CWA 
Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines.  The  USACE  will  conclude  its  analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite 
alternatives  in  its  Record  of  Decision.

6.0  FUEL  CYCLE,  TRANSPORTATION,  AND  DECOMMISSIONING 


This  chapter  addresses  environmental  impacts  from  (1)  uranium  fuel-cycle  and  solid-waste 
management  (Section  6.1),  (2)  transportation  of  radioactive  material  (Section  6.2).  and 
(3)  decommissioning  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey  (Section  6.3).  In  its  evaluation  of  uranium  fuel-cycle  impacts  from  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  Site,  at  this  early  site  permit  (ESP)  stage, 
PSEG  has  developed  a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  based  on  parameters  derived  from  one 
Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR),  one  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor  (U.S.  EPR), 
one  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (US-APWR),  or  two  Advanced  Passive  1000 
(API  000)  reactors.  Of  these  alternatives,  the  two  Westinghouse  API  000  reactors  provide  the 
bounding  case  for  the  evaluation  of  fuel-cycle,  transportation,  and  decommissioning  impacts. 
The  assessment  of  fuel-cycle  impacts  is  based  on  values  in  Table  S-3  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51 .51(b)  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250),  which  in  turn  assumes  an 
80  percent  annual  capacity  factor  referenced  to  a  1,000-MW(e)  light  water  reactor  (LWR), 
resulting  in  800  MW  of  electrical  output.  For  a  bounding  analysis  in  this  part  of  the 
environmental  review,  PSEG  assumed  a  96.3  percent  capacity  factor  for  each  of  two 
1 ,200-MW(e)  API 000  reactors  with  a  net  electrical  power  output  of  1 , 1 50  MW(e)  each  and 
scaled  the  impact  values  from  Table  S-3  by  an  appropriate  factor  (PSEG  2012-TN1720).  The 
results  reported  here  apply  to  the  impacts  from  two  API  000  units,  each  with  the  capacity  factor 
of  96.3  percent  assumed  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2014-TN3564). 

6.1  Fuel-Cycle  Impacts  and  Solid-Waste  Management 

This  section  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  from  the  uranium  fuel-cycle  and  solid-waste 
management  for  the  API  000  reactor  design.  The  environmental  impacts  of  this  design  are 
evaluated  against  specific  criteria  for  LWR  designs  in  10  CFR  51.51  (TN250). 

The  regulations  in  10  CFR  51.51(a)  (TN250)  state  that 

“Under  §51.50  every  environmental  report  (ER)  prepared  for  the  construction  permit  stage 
or  early  site  permit  stage  or  combined  license  stage  of  a  light-water-cooled  nuclear  power 
reactor,  and  submitted  on  or  after  September  4,  1979,  shall  take  Table  S-3,  Table  of 
Uranium  Fuel  Cycle  Environmental  Data,  as  the  basis  for  evaluating  the  contribution  of  the 
environmental  effects  of  uranium  mining  and  milling,  the  production  of  uranium 
hexafluoride,  isotopic  enrichment,  fuel  fabrication,  reprocessing  of  irradiated  fuel, 
transportation  of  radioactive  materials  and  management  of  low  level  wastes  and  high  level 
wastes  related  to  uranium  fuel  cycle  activities  to  the  environmental  costs  of  licensing  the 
nuclear  power  reactor.  Table  S-3  shall  be  included  in  the  environmental  report  and  may  be 
supplemented  by  a  discussion  of  the  environmental  significance  of  the  data  set  forth  in  the 
table  as  weighed  in  the  analysis  for  the  proposed  facility." 

The  new  nuclear  power  plant  evaluated  for  the  PSEG  Site  is  based  on  light-water-cooled 
reactors  that  use  uranium  dioxide  fuel;  therefore,  Table  S-3  (10  CFR  51 .51(b)  [TN250])  can  be 
used  to  assess  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle.  Table  S-3  values  are

(a)  In  some  cases  where  no  entry  appears,  it  is  dear  from  the  background  documents  that  the  matter  was 
addressed  and  that,  in  effect,  the  table  should  be  read  as  if  a  specific  zero  entry  had  been  made.  However, 
there  are  other  areas  that  are  not  addressed  at  all  in  the  table.  Table  S-3  does  not  include  health  effects  from 
the  effluents  described  in  the  table,  or  estimates  of  releases  of  radon-222  from  the  uranium  fuel  cycle,  or 
estimates  of  technetium-99  released  from  waste-management  or  reprocessing  activities.  These  issues  may  be 
the  subject  of  litigation  in  the  individual  licensing  proceedings. 

Data  supporting  this  table  are  given  in  the  Environmental  Survey  of  the  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle,  WASH-1248 
(AEC  1974-TN23);  the  Environmental  Survey  of  the  Reprocessing  and  Waste  Management  Portion  of  the  LWR

wastes  are  maximized  for  either  of  the  two  fuel  cycles  (i.e.,  uranium-only  and  no-recycle).  The  contribution  from 
transportation  excludes  transportation  of  cold  fuel  to  a  reactor  and  of  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  wastes  from  a 
reactor,  which  are  considered  in  Table  S-4  of  10  CFR  51  20(g).  The  contributions  from  the  other  steps  of  the  fuel

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


Specific  categories  of  environmental  considerations  are  included  in  Table  S-3  (see  Table  6-1). 
These  categories  relate  to  land  use,  water  consumption  and  thermal  effluents,  radioactive 
releases,  burial  of  transuranic  high-level  waste  (HLW)  and  low-level  waste  (LLW),  and  radiation 
doses  from  transportation  and  occupational  exposures.  In  developing  Table  S-3,  the  staff 
considered  two  fuel-cycle  options  that  differed  in  the  treatment  of  irradiated  (spent)  fuel  removed 
from  a  reactor.  The  no-recycle  option  treats  all  spent  fuel  as  waste  to  be  disposed  at  a  Federal 
waste  repository,  whereas  the  uranium-only  recycle  option  involves  reprocessing  spent  fuel  to 
recover  unused  uranium  and  to  return  it  for  use  in  new  fuel.  Neither  cycle  involves  the  recovery 
of  plutonium.  The  contributions  in  Table  S-3  resulting  from  reprocessing,  waste  management, 
and  transportation  of  wastes  are  maximized  for  both  of  the  two  fuel  cycles  (i.e. ,  uranium-only  and 
no-recycle);  that  is,  the  identified  environmental  impacts  are  based  on  the  cycle  that  results  in  the 
greater  impact.  The  uranium  fuel  cycle  is  defined  as  the  total  of  the  operations  and  processes 
associated  with  provision,  use.  and  ultimate  disposition  of  fuel  for  nuclear  power  reactors. 

The  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Act  of  1978  (22  USC  3201  et  seq.  -TN737)  significantly  affected 
the  disposition  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  by  deferring  indefinitely  the  commercial  reprocessing  and 
recycling  of  spent  fuel  produced  in  the  U.S.  commercial  nuclear  power  program.  While  the  ban 
on  the  reprocessing  of  spent  fuel  was  lifted  in  October  1981  by  the  Reagan  administration, 
economic  circumstances  changed,  reserves  of  uranium  ore  increased,  and  the  stagnation  of  the 
nuclear  power  industry  in  the  United  States  provided  little  incentive  for  industry  to  resume 
reprocessing.  During  the  109th  Congress,  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (42  USC  15801  et 
seq.  -TN738)  was  enacted.  It  authorized  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  conduct  an 
advanced  fuel-recycling  technology  research  and  development  program  to  evaluate 
proliferation-resistant  fuel-recycling  and  transmutation  technologies  that  minimize  environmental 
or  public  health  and  safety  impacts.  Consequently,  while  Federal  policy  does  not  prohibit 
reprocessing,  additional  government  and  commercial  efforts  would  be  necessary  before 
commercial  reprocessing  and  recycling  of  spent  fuel  produced  in  the  U.S.  commercial  nuclear 
power  plants  could  commence. 

The  no-recycle  option  is  presented  schematically  in  Figure  6-1.  Natural  uranium  is  mined  in 
either  open-pit  or  underground  mines  or  by  an  in  situ  leach-solution  mining  process.  In  situ 
leach  mining,  presently  the  primary  form  of  uranium  mining  in  the  United  States,  involves 
injecting  a  lixiviant  solution  into  the  uranium  ore  body  to  dissolve  uranium  and  then  pumping  the 
solution  to  the  surface  for  further  processing.  The  ore  or  in  situ  leach  solution  is  transferred  to 
mills  where  it  is  processed  to  produce  “yellowcake”  (U308).  A  conversion  facility  prepares  the 
U3O8  by  converting  it  to  UF6,  which  is  then  processed  by  an  enrichment  facility  to  increase  the 
percentage  of  the  more  fissile  uranium-235  isotope  and  decrease  the  percentage  of  the 
nonfissile  uranium-238  isotope.  At  a  fuel-fabrication  facility,  the  enriched  uranium,  which  is 
approximately  5  percent  uranium-235,  is  then  converted  to  uranium  dioxide  (UO2).  The  UO2  is 
pelletized,  sintered,  and  inserted  into  tubes  to  form  fuel  assemblies,  which  are  placed  in  a 
reactor  to  produce  power.  When  the  content  of  the  uranium-235  reaches  a  point  where  the 
nuclear  reactor  has  become  inefficient  with  respect  to  neutron  economy,  the  fuel  assemblies  are 
withdrawn  from  the  reactor  as  spent  fuel.  After  onsite  storage  for  sufficient  time  to  allow  for 
short-lived  fission-product  decay  and  to  reduce  the  heat-generation  rate,  the  fuel  assemblies 
would  be  transferred  to  a  waste  repository  for  internment.  Disposal  of  spent  fuel  elements  in  a 
repository  constitutes  the  final  step  in  the  no-recycle  option.

Figure  6-1.  The  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle:  No-Recycle  Option  (Source:  Derived  from 
NRC  1999-TN289) 


The  following  assessment  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  fuel  cycle  as  related  to  the 
operation  of  the  proposed  project  is  based  on  the  values  given  in  Table  S-3  (Table  6-1)  and  the 
staffs  analysis  of  the  radiological  impact  from  radon-222  and  technetium-99.  In  NUREG-1437, 
Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS) 

(NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289;  NRC  2013-TN2654)/1)  the  staff  provides  a  detailed 
analysis  of  the  environmental  impacts  from  the  uranium  fuel  cycle.  Although  NUREG-1437  is 
specific  to  the  impacts  related  to  license  renewal,  the  information  is  relevant  to  this  review 
because  the  advanced  LWR  design  considered  here  uses  the  same  type  of  fuel  as  considered 
in  the  staffs  evaluation  in  NUREG-1437.  The  staffs  analyses  in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654)  are  summarized  and  set  forth  here. 


Each  API  000  reactor  unit  is  rated  at  3,400  MW(t)  (Westinghouse  2008-TN496).  Considering 
the  bounding  case  of  two  API  000  reactors  located  on  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2012-TN1720),  the 
power  rating  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  6,800  MW(t).  For  this 
analysis,  the  net  electric  power  output  of  each  API  000  reactor  unit  is  presumed  to  be 
1 ,150  MW(e).  At  a  capacity  factor  of  96.3  percent  (PSEG  2012-TN1720),  each  AP1000  unit 
produces  an  average  of  1,107  MW(e).  For  two  AP1000  units,  this  corresponds  to  2,215  MW(e).

Fuel  Cycle.  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


The  fuel-cycle  impacts  in  Table  S-3  are  based  on  a  reference  1,000-MW(e)  LWR  operating  at 
an  annual  capacity  factor  of  80  percent  for  a  net  electric  output  of  800  MW(e).  As  explained 
above,  the  total  net  electric  output  for  two  API 000  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  2,215  MW(e), 
which  is  about  2.77  times  (i.e.,  2,215  MW(e)  divided  by  800  MW(e)  yields  2.77)  the  output  value 
in  Table  S-3  (see  Table  6-1).  For  added  conservatism  in  its  review  and  evaluation  of  the 
environmental  impacts  of  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle,  the  staff  multiplied  the  values  in  Table  S-3  by  a 
factor  of  3,  rather  than  a  factor  of  2.77,  providing  additional  assurance  that  this  analysis  bounds 
the  options  considered  in  the  PSEG  PPE.  Scaling  up  by  a  factor  of  3  is  referred  to  as  using  the 
1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model. 

Recent  changes  in  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  may  have  some  bearing  on  environmental  impacts; 
however,  as  discussed  below,  the  staff  is  confident  that  the  contemporary  normalized  uranium 
fuel-cycle  impacts  are  below  those  identified  in  Table  S-3.  This  assertion  is  true  in  light  of  the 
following  recent  uranium  fuel-cycle  trends  in  the  United  States. 

•  Increasing  use  of  in  situ  leach  uranium  mining,  which  does  not  produce  mine  tailings  and 
would  lower  the  release  of  radon  gas.  A  detailed  discussion  of  this  subject  is  provided  in 
Section  6.1.5. 

•  Transitioning  of  U.S.  uranium  enrichment  technology  from  gaseous  diffusion  to  gas 
centrifugation.  The  latter  process  uses  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  electrical  energy  per 
separation  unit  compared  to  gaseous  diffusion.  (U.S.  gaseous-diffusion  plants  relied  on 
electricity  derived  mainly  from  the  burning  of  coal.) 

•  Current  LWRs  use  nuclear  fuel  more  efficiently  due  to  higher  fuel  burnup.  Therefore,  less 
uranium  fuel  per  year  of  reactor  operation  is  required  than  in  the  past  to  generate  the  same 
amount  of  electricity. 

•  Fewer  spent  fuel  assemblies  per  reactor-year  are  discharged;  hence,  the  waste 
storage/repository  impact  is  lessened. 

The  values  in  Table  S-3  were  calculated  from  industry  averages  for  the  performance  of  each 
type  of  facility  or  operation  within  the  fuel  cycle.  Recognizing  that  this  approach  meant  that 
there  would  be  a  range  of  reasonable  values  for  each  estimate,  the  staff  followed  the  policy  of 
choosing  the  assumptions  or  factors  to  be  applied  so  that  the  calculated  values  would  not  be 
underestimated.  This  approach  was  intended  to  make  sure  that  the  actual  environmental 
impacts  would  be  less  than  the  quantities  shown  in  Table  S-3  for  all  LWR  nuclear  power  plants 
within  the  widest  range  of  operating  conditions.  The  staff  recognizes  that  many  of  the  fuel-cycle 
parameters  and  interactions  vary  in  small  ways  from  the  estimates  in  Table  S-3;  the  staff 
concludes  that  these  variations  would  have  no  impacts  on  the  Table  S-3  calculations.  For 
example,  to  determine  the  quantity  of  fuel  required  for  a  year  s  operation  of  a  nuclear  power 
plant  in  Table  S-3,  the  staff  defined  the  model  reactor  as  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR  operating  at 
80  percent  capacity  with  a  12-month  fuel-reloading  cycle  and  an  average  fuel  burnup  of 
33,000  MWd/MTU.  This  is  a  “reference  reactor-year’  (NRC  2013-TN2654). 

If  approved,  the  combined  license  (COL)  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
allow  40  years  of  operation.  In  NUREG-1437,  the  sum  of  the  initial  fuel  loading  plus  all  of  the 
reloads  for  the  lifetime  of  the  reactor  was  divided  by  a  60-year  lifetime  (40-year  initial  license 
term  and  20-year  license  renewal  term)  to  obtain  an  average  annual  fuel  requirement.  This 


November  2015

NUREG-21 68 


Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


approach  was  followed  in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289)  and  carried 
forward  into  NUREG-1437,  Revision  1  (NRC  201 3-TN2654),  for  both  boiling  water  reactors  and 
pressurized  water  reactors;  the  higher  annual  requirement,  35  metric  tons  (MT)  of  uranium 
made  into  fuel  for  a  boiling  water  reactor,  was  chosen  in  NUREG-1437,  Revision  1,  as  the  basis 
for  the  reference  reactor-year  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  The  average  annual  fuel  requirement 
presented  in  NUREG-1437,  Revision  1,  would  only  be  increased  by  2  percent  if  a  40-year 
lifetime  was  evaluated.  However,  a  number  of  fuel-management  improvements  have  been 
adopted  by  nuclear  power  plants  to  achieve  higher  performance  and  to  reduce  fuel  and 
separative-work  (enrichment)  requirements.  Since  the  time  when  Table  S-3  was  promulgated, 
these  improvements  have  reduced  the  annual  fuel  requirement,  which  means  the  Table  S-3 
assumptions  remain  bounding  as  applied  to  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

Another  change  supporting  the  bounding  nature  of  the  Table  S-3  assumptions  with  respect  to 
the  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  elimination  of  the  U.S. 
restrictions  on  the  importation  of  foreign  uranium.  Until  recently,  the  economic  conditions  of  the 
uranium  market  favored  use  of  foreign  uranium  at  the  expense  of  the  domestic  uranium 
industry.  In  the  1980s,  the  economic  conditions  of  the  uranium  market  resulted  in  the  closing  of 
most  U.S.  uranium  mines  and  mills,  substantially  reducing  the  environmental  impacts  in  the 
United  States  from  uranium-mining  activities.  More  recently,  there  is  renewed  interest  in 
uranium  recovery  in  the  United  States.  Between  2007  and  2014,  the  NRC  received  10  license 
applications  for  uranium  recovery  facilities  (NRC  2014-TN4054).  All  but  two  of  these 
applications  were  for  facilities  using  the  in  situ  recovery  process,  which  does  not  produce  mill 
tailings  that  would  have  released  radon  to  the  environment.  Factoring  in  changes  to  the  fuel 
cycle  suggests  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  mining  and  tail  millings  could  drop  to  levels 
below  those  given  in  Table  S-3;  however,  Table  S-3  estimates  remain  bounding  as  applied  to 
the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

In  sum,  these  reasons  highlight  why  Table  S-3  is  likely  to  overestimate  impacts  from  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  therefore  the  information  in  Table  S-3  remains 
adequate  for  use  in  the  bounding  approach  used  in  this  analysis.  Section  4.12.1.1  of  NUREG- 
1437,  Revision  1  (NRC  2013-TN2654),  and  Section  6.2  of  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288) 
discuss  in  greater  detail  the  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  since  issuance  of 
Table  S-3  on  the  environmental  impacts. 

6.1.1  Land  Use 

The  total  annual  land  requirement  for  the  fuel  cycle  supporting  the  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled 
model  is  about  339  ac.  Approximately  39  ac  are  permanently  committed  land,  and  300  ac  are 
temporarily  committed.  A  “temporary”  land  commitment  is  a  commitment  for  the  life  of  the 
specific  fuel-cycle  plant  (e.g.,  a  mill,  enrichment  plant,  or  succeeding  plants).  After  the 
decommissioning  of  the  nuclear  units,  such  land  can  be  released  for  unrestricted  use. 
“Permanent”  commitments  represent  land  that  may  not  be  released  for  use  after  plant  shutdown 
and  decommissioning  because  decommissioning  activities  do  not  result  in  the  removal  of 
sufficient  radioactive  material  to  meet  the  limits  in  10  CFR  Part  20  (TN283),  Subpart  E,  for 
release  of  that  area  for  unrestricted  use.  Of  the  300  ac  of  temporarily  committed  land,  66  ac  are 
assumed  to  be  disturbed  (NRC  1996-TN288).  In  comparison,  a  coal-fired  power  plant  using  the 
same  megawatt  electric  output  as  the  LWR-scaled  model  and  using  strip-mined  coal  requires 
the  disturbance  of  about  600  ac/year  for  fuel  alone.  The  staff  concludes  that  the  impacts  on 
land  use  to  support  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  would  be  minor.

6.1.2  Water  Use 

The  principal  water  use  for  the  fuel  cycle  supporting  a  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  is  that 
required  to  remove  waste  heat  from  the  power  stations  supplying  electrical  energy  to  the 
enrichment  step  of  this  cycle.  Scaling  from  Table  S-3,  of  the  total  annual  water  use  of 
3.41  x  1010  gal,  about  3.33  x  1010  gal  are  required  for  the  removal  of  waste  heat,  assuming  that 
a  new  unit  uses  once-through  cooling.  Also,  scaling  from  Table  S-3,  other  water  uses  involve 
the  discharge  to  air  (e.g.,  evaporation  losses  in  process  cooling)  of  about  4.80  x  108  gal/year 
and  discharge  to  the  ground  (e.g.,  mine  drainage)  of  about  3.81  *  108  gal/year. 

On  a  thermal-effluent  basis,  annual  discharges  from  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle  are  about  4  percent 
of  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  using  once-through  cooling.  The  consumptive  water 
use  of  4.80  x  io8  gal/year  is  about  2  percent  of  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  using 
cooling  towers.  The  maximum  consumptive  water  use  (assuming  that  all  plants  supplying 
electrical  energy  to  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle  use  cooling  towers)  would  be  about  6  percent  of  the 
1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  using  cooling  towers.  Under  this  condition,  thermal  effluents 
would  be  negligible.  The  staff  concludes  that  the  impacts  on  water  use  for  these  combinations 
of  thermal  loadings  and  water  consumption  would  be  minor. 

6.1.3  Fossil  Fuel  Impacts 

As  indicated  in  Appendix  K,  the  largest  source  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  associated 
with  nuclear  power  is  from  the  fuel  cycle,  not  operation  of  the  plant.  The  largest  source  of 
GHGs  in  the  fuel  cycle  is  production  of  electric  energy  and  process  heat  from  combustion  of 
fossil  fuel  in  conventional  power  plants.  This  energy  is  used  to  power  components  of  the  fuel 
cycle  such  as  enrichment. 

Table  S-3  in  10  CFR  51 .51  (TN250)  presents  data  for  evaluating  the  environmental  effects  of  a 
reference  I.OOO-MW(e)  light-water-cooled  nuclear  power  reactor  resulting  from  the  uranium  fuel 
cycle.  Table  S-3  does  not  provide  an  estimate  of  GHG  emissions  associated  with  the  uranium 
fuel  cycle  but  does  state  that  323,000  MWh  is  the  assumed  annual  electric  energy  use 
associated  with  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  for  the  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant  and 
this  323,000  MWh  of  annual  electric  energy  is  assumed  to  be  generated  by  a  45-MW(e) 
coal-fired  power  plant  burning  1 18,000  MT  of  coal.  Table  S-3  also  assumes  approximately 
135,000,000  standard  cubic  feet  (scf)  of  natural  gas  is  also  required  per  year  to  generate 
process  heat  for  certain  portions  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle. 

In  Appendix  K  of  this  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS),  the  NRC  staff  used  the  fossil  fuel 
usage  assumptions  presented  in  Table  S-3  to  estimate  that  the  GHG  footprint  of  the  fuei  cycle 
to  support  a  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR  with  an  80  percent  capacity  factor  for  a  40-year 
operational  period  is  on  the  order  of  10,100,000  MT  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent  (CC>2e). 
Scaling  this  footprint  to  the  power  level  and  capacity  factor  of  the  two  proposed  API  000  reactor 
units  using  the  scaling  factor  of  3  discussed  earlier,  the  review  team  estimates  the  GHG 
footprint  for  40  years  of  fuel-cycle  emissions  to  be  approximately  3.0  x  1 07  MT  of  C02e.  This 
rate  of  GHG  production  equals  750,000  MT  of  C02e  per  year,  less  than  1  percent  of  New 
Jersey’s  annual  CO2  emission  rate  and  0.01  percent  of  the  total  U.S.  annual  C02  emission  rate 
of  6.7  billion  MT  of  C02e  (EPA  2013-TN2815).

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


The  largest  use  of  electricity  in  the  fuel  cycle  comes  from  the  enrichment  process.  The 
development  of  Table  S-3  assumed  that  the  gaseous-diffusion  process  is  used  to  enrich 
uranium.  The  gaseous-diffusion  technology  is  no  longer  used  for  uranium  enrichment.  The  last 
gaseous-diffusion  enrichment  facility  in  the  U.S.  ceased  operations  recently  (USEC  2013- 
TN2765).  Current  enrichment  facilities  use  gas-centrifuge  technologies,  and  recent  applications 
for  new  uranium  enrichment  facilities  are  based  on  gas-centrifuge  and  laser-separation 
technologies.  The  same  amount  of  enrichment  from  gas-centrifuge  and  laser-separation 
facilities  uses  less  electricity  and  therefore  results  in  lower  amounts  of  air  emissions  (e.g.,  CO2) 
than  a  gaseous-diffusion  facility.  In  addition,  U.S.  electric  utilities  have  begun  to  switch  from 
coal  to  cheaper,  cleaner-burning  natural  gas  (DOE/EIA  1995-TN2996);  the  Table  S-3 
assumption  that  a  45-MW(e)  coal-fired  plant  is  used  to  generate  the  323,000  MWh  of  annual 
electric  energy  for  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  also  results  in  conservative  air  emission  estimates. 
Therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  values  for  electricity  use  and  air  emissions  in 
Table  S-3  continue  to  be  appropriately  bounding  values. 

On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  fossil  fuel  impacts,  including  GHG  emissions, 
from  the  direct  and  indirect  consumption  of  electric  energy  for  fuel-cycle  operations  would  be 
minor. 

6.1.4  Chemical  Effluents 

The  quantities  of  gaseous  and  particulate  chemical  effluents  produced  in  fuel-cycle  processes 
are  given  in  Table  S-3  (Table  6-1 )  for  the  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR.  According  to 
WASH-1248  (AEC  1974-TN23),  the  quantities  result  from  the  generation  of  electricity  for 
fuel-cycle  operations.  The  principal  effluents  are  sulfur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  and 
particulates.  Table  6-1  states  that  the  fuel  cycle  for  the  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR  requires 
323,000  MWh  of  electricity.  The  fuel  cycle  for  the  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  would 
therefore  require  969,000  MWh  of  electricity,  or  less  than  0.024  percent  of  the  4.1  billion  MWh 
of  electricity  generated  in  the  United  States  in  2012  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2540).  Therefore,  the 
gaseous  and  particulate  chemical  effluents  from  fuel-cycle  processes  to  support  the  operation  of 
the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  would  add  less  than  0.024  percent  to  the  national  gaseous 
and  particulate  chemical  effluents  for  electricity  generation. 

Liquid  chemical  effluents  produced  in  fuel-cycle  processes  are  related  to  fuel  enrichment  and 
fabrication  and  may  be  released  to  receiving  waters.  These  effluents  are  usually  present  in 
dilute  concentrations  such  that  only  small  amounts  of  dilution  water  are  required  to  reach  levels 
of  concentration  that  are  within  established  standards.  Table  S-3  (Table  6-1 )  specifies  the 
amount  of  dilution  water  required  for  specific  constituents.  In  addition,  all  liquid  discharges  into 
the  navigable  waters  of  the  United  States  from  facilities  associated  with  the  fuel-cycle 
operations  would  be  subject  to  requirements  and  limitations  set  by  appropriate  Federal,  State, 
Tribal,  and  local  agencies. 

Tailings  solutions  and  solids  are  generated  during  the  milling  process,  but  as  Table  S-3 
indicates,  effluents  are  not  released  in  quantities  sufficient  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the 
environment.

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


Based  on  the  above  analysis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  these  chemical 
effluents  (i.e.,  gaseous,  particulate,  and  liquid)  would  be  minor. 

6.1.5  Radiological  Effluents 

Radioactive  effluents  estimated  to  be  released  to  the  environment  from  waste-management 
activities  and  certain  other  phases  of  the  fuel-cycle  process  are  listed  in  Table  S-3  (Table  6-1). 
NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013-TN2654)  provides  the  100-year  environmental  dose  commitment  to 
the  U.S.  population  from  fuel-cycle  activities  for  1  year  of  operation  of  the  reference 
1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR  using  the  radioactive  effluents  in  Table  6-1.  Excluding  reactor  releases  and 
dose  commitments  because  of  exposure  to  radon-222  and  technetium-99,  the  total  overall 
whole  body  gaseous  dose  commitment  and  whole  body  liquid  dose  commitment  from  the  fuel 
cycle  were  calculated  to  be  approximately  400  person-rem  and  200  person-rem,  respectively. 
Scaling  these  dose  commitments  by  a  factor  of  about  3  for  the  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model 
results  in  whole  body  dose  commitment  estimates  of  1 ,200  person-rem  for  gaseous  releases 
and  600  person-rem  for  liquid  releases.  Therefore,  for  both  pathways,  the  estimated  100-year 
environmental  dose  commitment  to  the  U.S.  population  would  be  approximately 
1 ,800-person-rem  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model. 

Currently,  the  radiological  impacts  associated  with  radon-222  and  technetium-99  releases  are 
not  addressed  in  Table  S-3.  Principal  radon  releases  occur  during  mining  and  milling 
operations  and  as  emissions  from  mill  tailings,  whereas  principal  technetium-99  releases  occur 
from  gaseous-diffusion  enrichment  facilities.  PSEG  provided  an  assessment  of  radon-222  and 
technetium-99  in  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG’s  evaluation  relied  on  the  information 
discussed  in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288). 

In  Section  6.2  of  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  the  staff  estimated  the  radon-222  releases 
from  mining  and  milling  operations  and  from  mill  tailings  for  each  year  of  operation  of  the 
reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR.  The  estimated  release  of  radon-222  for  the  1 ,000-MW(e) 
LWR-scaled  model  is  approximately  1 5,600  Ci.  Of  this  total,  about  78  percent  would  be  from 
mining,  15  percent  from  milling  operations,  and  7  percent  from  inactive  tailings  before 
stabilization.  For  radon  releases  from  stabilized  tailings,  the  staff  assumed  that  the  LWR-scaled 
model  would  result  in  an  emission  of  3  Ci/reactor-year  (i.e.,  about  3  times  the  NUREG-1437 
(NRC  1996-TN288)  estimate  for  the  reference  reactor-year).  The  major  risks  from  radon-222 
are  from  exposure  to  the  bone  and  the  lung,  although  there  is  a  small  risk  from  exposure  to  the 
whole  body.  The  organ-specific  dose-weighting  factors  from  10  CFR  Part  20  (TN283)  were 
applied  to  the  bone  and  lung  doses  to  estimate  the  100-year  dose  commitment  from  radon-222 
to  the  whole  body.  The  estimated  100-year  environmental  dose  commitment  from  mining, 
milling,  and  tailings  before  stabilization  for  each  site  year  (assuming  the  1 ,000-MW(e) 
LWR-scaled  model)  would  be  approximately  2,800  person-rem  to  the  whole  body.  From 
stabilized  tailings  piles,  the  estimated  100-year  environmental  dose  commitment  would  be 
approximately  54  person-rem  to  the  whole  body.  Additional  insights  regarding  Federal 
policy/resource  perspectives  concerning  institutional  controls  comparisons  with  routine 
radon-222  exposure  and  risk  and  long-term  releases  from  stabilized  tailing  piles  are  discussed 
in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288).

The  staff  also  considered  the  potential  health  effects  associated  with  the  releases  of 
technetium-99  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  The  estimated  releases  of  technetium-99  for  the  reference 
reactor-year  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model  are  0.021  Ci  from  chemical  processing  of 
recycled  UF6  before  it  enters  the  isotope-enrichment  cascade  and  0.015  Ci  into  the  groundwater 
from  an  HLW  repository.  The  major  risks  from  technetium-99  are  from  exposure  of  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  and  kidney,  although  there  is  a  small  risk  from  exposure  to  the  whole  body. 
The  organ-specific  dose-weighting  factors  from  10  CFR  Part  20  (TN283)  were  applied  to  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  and  kidney  doses,  and  the  total-body  100-year  dose  commitment  from 
technetium-99  to  the  whole  body  was  estimated  to  be  300  person-rem  for  the  1 ,000-MW(e) 
LWR-scaled  model. 

Radiation  protection  experts  assume  that  any  amount  of  radiation  may  pose  some  risk  of 
causing  cancer  or  a  severe  hereditary  effect  and  that  the  risk  is  higher  for  higher  radiation 
exposures.  Therefore,  a  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response  relationship  is  used  to  describe  the 
relationship  between  radiation  dose  and  detriments  such  as  cancer  induction.  Health  Risks 
from  Exposure  to  Low  Levels  of  Ionizing  Radiation:  BEIR  VII — Phase  2,  a  recent  report  by  the 
National  Research  Council  (National  Research  Council  2006-TN296),  uses  the  linear,  no¬ 
threshold  dose  response  model  as  a  basis  for  estimating  the  risks  from  low  doses.  This 
approach  is  accepted  by  the  NRC  as  a  conservative  method  for  estimating  health  risks  from 
radiation  exposure,  recognizing  that  the  model  may  overestimate  those  risks.  Based  on  this 
method,  the  staff  estimated  the  risk  to  the  public  from  radiation  exposure  using  the  nominal 
probability  coefficient  for  total  detriment.  This  coefficient  has  the  value  of  570  fatal  cancers, 
nonfatal  cancers,  and  severe  hereditary  effects  per  1,000,000  person-rem  (10,000  person-Sv), 
equal  to  0.00057  effect  per  person-rem.  The  coefficient  is  taken  from  Publication  103  of  the 
International  Commission  on  Radiological  Protection  (ICRP  2007-TN422). 

The  nominal  probability  coefficient  was  multiplied  by  the  sum  of  the  estimated  whole  body 
population  doses  from  gaseous  effluents,  liquid  effluents,  radon-222,  and  technetium-99 
discussed  above  (approximately  5,000  person-rem/year)  to  calculate  that  the  U.S.  population 
would  incur  a  total  of  approximately  2.8  fatal  cancers,  nonfatal  cancers,  and  severe  hereditary 
effects  annually. 

Radon-222  releases  from  tailings  are  indistinguishable  from  background  radiation  levels  at  a 
few  kilometers  from  the  tailings  pile  (at  less  than  0.6  mi  in  some  cases)  (NRC  1996-TN288; 

NRC  1999-TN289).  The  public  dose  limit  in  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA) 
regulation,  40  CFR  Part  190  (TN739),  is  25  mrem/year  to  the  whole  body  from  the  entire  fuel 
cycle,  but  most  NRC  licensees  have  airborne  effluents  resulting  in  doses  of  less  than 
1  mrem/year  (61  FR  65120-TN294). 

In  addition,  at  the  request  of  the  U.S.  Congress,  the  National  Cancer  Institute  conducted  a  study 
and  published  Cancer  in  Populations  Living  Near  Nuclear  Facilities  in  1990  (Jablon  et  al.  1990- 
TN1257).  This  report  included  an  evaluation  of  health  statistics  around  all  nuclear  power  plants 
as  well  as  several  other  nuclear  fuel-cycle  facilities  in  operation  in  the  United  States  in  1981  and 
found  “no  evidence  that  an  excess  occurrence  of  cancer  has  resulted  from  living  near  nuclear 
facilities”  (Jablon  et  al.  1990-TN1257).  The  contribution  to  the  annual  average  dose  received  by 
an  individual  from  fuel-cycle-related  radiation  and  other  sources  as  reported  in  a  publication  of 
the  National  Council  on  Radiation  Protection  and  Measurements  (NCRP  2009-TN420)  is  listed 


NUREG-2168

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


in  Table  6-2.  The  contribution  from  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle  to  an  individual’s  annual  average 
radiation  dose  is  extremely  small  (about  0.1  mrem/year)  compared  to  the  annual  average 
background  radiation  dose  (about  311  mrem/year). 

Based  on  the  analyses  presented  above,  the  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of 
radioactive  effluents  from  the  fuel  cycle,  including  gaseous  and  liquid  releases,  are  minor.

6.1.6  Radiological  Wastes 

The  estimated  quantities  of  buried  radioactive  waste  material  (LLW,  HLW,  and  transuranic 
wastes)  generated  by  the  reference  1,000-MW(e)  LWR  are  specified  in  Table  S-3  (Table  6-1). 
For  LLW  disposal  at  land  burial  facilities,  the  Commission  notes  in  Table  S-3  that  there  would 
be  no  significant  radioactive  releases  to  the  environment.  The  PSEG  Site  is  in  the  State  of  New 
Jersey,  which  is  part  of  the  Atlantic  Interstate  Low-Level  Waste  Management  Compact  and  thus 
has  continuing  access  to  the  LLW  disposal  facility  at  Barnwell,  South  Carolina,  as  long  as  it 
remains  open.  Class  A  LLW  generated  by  the  PSEG  Site  could  also  be  shipped  to  the  Energy 
Solutions  disposal  facility  near  Clive,  Utah,  as  some  Class  A  LLW  generators  within  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  have  done  (DOE  2013-TN3120). 

The  Barnwell  facility  is  expected  to  be  closed  in  2038  to  LLW  generated  in  New  Jersey 
(CNS  2010-TN2682).  At  that  time,  PSEG  could  enter  into  an  agreement  with  another  licensed 
facility  that  would  accept  LLW  from  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Alternatively,  PSEG  could  implement  measures  to  reduce  the  generation  of  Class  B  and  C 
wastes,  extending  the  capacity  of  the  onsite  solid-waste  storage  system.  PSEG  could  also 
construct  additional  temporary  storage  facilities  on  the  site.  PSEG  could  also  enter  into  an 
agreement  with  a  third-party  contractor  to  process,  store,  own,  and  ultimately  dispose  of  LLW

from  the  new  nuclear  capacity  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  Waste  Control  Specialists,  LLC,  site  in 
Andrews  County,  Texas,  is  licensed  to  accept  Class  A,  B,  and  C  LLW  from  the  Texas  Compact 
(Texas  and  Vermont).  Waste  Control  Specialists,  LLC,  may  accept  Class  A,  B,  and  C  LLW  from 
outside  the  Texas  Compact  for  disposal  subject  to  established  criteria,  conditions,  and  approval 
processes  (Tex.  Admin  Code  31-675.23-TN731 ).  Because  PSEG  would  likely  have  to  choose 
one  or  a  combination  of  these  options,  the  staff  considered  the  environmental  impacts  of  each 
of  these  options. 

Table  S-3  addresses  the  environmental  impacts  if  PSEG  enters  into  an  agreement  with  a 
licensed  facility  for  disposal  of  LLW,  and  Table  S-4  addresses  the  environmental  impacts  from 
transportation  of  LLW  as  discussed  in  Section  6.2.  The  use  of  third-party  contractors  was  not 
explicitly  addressed  in  Tables  S-3  and  S-4;  however,  such  third-party  contractors  are  already 
licensed  by  the  NRC  or  Agreement  States  and  currently  operate  in  the  United  States. 

Experience  from  the  operation  of  these  facilities  shows  that  the  additional  environmental 
impacts  are  not  significant  compared  to  the  impacts  described  in  Tables  S-3  and  S-4. 

Measures  to  reduce  the  generation  of  Class  B  and  C  wastes,  such  as  reducing  the  service  run 
length  of  resin  beds,  could  increase  the  volume  of  LLW  but  would  not  increase  the  total  activity 
(in  curies)  of  radioactive  material  in  the  waste.  The  volume  of  waste  would  still  be  bounded  by 
or  very  similar  to  the  estimates  in  Table  S-3,  and  the  environmental  impacts  would  not  be 
significantly  different. 

In  most  circumstances,  the  NRC’s  regulations  (10  CFR  Part  50-TN249)  allow  licensees 
operating  nuclear  power  plants  to  construct  and  operate  additional  onsite  LLW  storage  facilities 
without  seeking  approval  from  the  NRC.  Licensees  are  required  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
environmental  impacts  before  constructing  the  facility  and  to  make  those  evaluations  available 
to  NRC  inspectors.  A  number  of  nuclear  power  plant  licensees  have  constructed  and  operate 
such  facilities  in  the  United  States.  Typically,  these  additional  facilities  are  constructed  near  the 
power  block  inside  the  security  fence  on  land  that  has  already  been  disturbed  during  initial  plant 
construction.  Therefore,  the  impacts  on  environmental  resources  (e.g.,  land  use  and  aquatic 
and  terrestrial  biota)  would  be  minimal.  All  of  the  NRC  (10  CFR  Part  20-TN283)  and  EPA 
(40  CFR  Part  190-TN739)  dose  limitations  would  apply  for  both  public  and  occupational 
radiation  exposure.  The  radiological  environmental  monitoring  programs  around  nuclear  power 
plants  that  operate  such  facilities  show  that  the  increase  in  radiation  dose  at  the  site  boundary  is 
not  significant;  the  radiation  doses  continue  to  be  below  25  mrem/year,  the  dose  limit  of  40  CFR 
Part  190  (TN739).  The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  doses  to  members  of  the  public  within  the 
NRC  and  EPA  regulations  are  a  minimal  impact.  Therefore,  the  impacts  from  radiation  would 
be  minor. 

In  addition,  the  NRC  staff  assessed  the  impacts  of  onsite  LLW  storage  at  currently  operating 
nuclear  power  plants  and  concluded  that  the  radiation  doses  to  offsite  individuals  from  interim 
LLW  storage  are  insignificant  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  The  types  and  amounts  of  LLW  generated 
by  the  new  capacity  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  very  similar  to  those  generated  by  currently 
operating  nuclear  power  plants,  and  the  construction  and  operation  of  these  interim  LLW 
storage  facilities  would  be  very  similar  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  currently 
operating  facilities.  Additionally,  in  NUREG-1437  (NRC  201 3-TN2654),  the  NRC  staff 
concluded  that  there  should  be  no  significant  issues  or  environmental  impacts  associated  with

interim  storage  of  LLW  generated  by  nuclear  power  plants.  Interim  storage  facilities  would  be 
used  until  these  wastes  could  be  safely  shipped  to  licensed  disposal  facilities. 

Current  national  policy,  as  found,  for  example,  in  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  (42  USC  10101 
et  seq.  -TN740),  mandates  that  HLW  and  transuranic  waste  are  to  be  buried  at  deep  geologic 
repositories.  No  release  to  the  environment  is  expected  to  be  associated  with  deep  geologic 
disposal  because  it  has  been  assumed  that  all  of  the  gaseous  and  volatile  radionuclides 
contained  in  the  spent  fuel  are  released  to  the  atmosphere  before  the  disposal  of  the  waste.  In 
NUREG-01 16  (NRC  1976-TN292),  which  provides  background  and  context  for  the  Table  S-3 
values  established  by  the  Commission,  the  NRC  staff  indicates  that  these  HLWs  and 
transuranic  wastes  will  be  buried  and  will  not  be  released  to  the  environment. 

As  part  of  the  Table  S-3  rulemaking,  the  NRC  staff  evaluated,  along  with  more  conservative 
assumptions,  this  zero-release  assumption  associated  with  waste  burial  in  a  repository,  and  the 
NRC  reached  an  overall  generic  determination  that  fuel-cycle  impacts  would  not  be  significant. 

In  1983,  the  Supreme  Court  affirmed  the  NRC’s  position  that  the  zero-release  assumption  was 
reasonable  in  the  context  of  the  Table  S-3  rulemaking  to  address  generically  the  impacts  of  the 
uranium  fuel  cycle  in  individual  reactor-licensing  proceedings  (Baltimore  Gas  and  Electric  Co.  v. 
Natural  Resources  Defense  Council,  Inc.  1983-TN1054). 

Environmental  impacts  from  onsite  spent  fuel  storage  during  the  licensed  life  of  the  plant  have 
been  studied  extensively  and  are  well  understood.  In  the  context  of  operating  license  (OL) 
renewal,  the  staff  (NRC  201 3-TN2654)  provides  descriptions  of  the  storage  of  spent  fuel  during 
the  licensed  lifetime  of  reactor  operations.  Radiological  impacts  are  well  within  regulatory  limits; 
thus,  radiological  impacts  of  onsite  storage  during  operations  will  be  minimal.  Nonradiological 
environmental  impacts  have  been  shown  to  be  not  significant  (NRC1989-TN3714).  Thus,  the 
NRC  staff  has  determined  that  disturbance  to  resource  areas  (e.g.,  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
ecology,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  and  land-use  resources)  that  may  be  associated  with 
potential  additional  onsite  operational  storage  would  not  alter  the  conclusions  presented  in 
Chapters  5  and  7  of  this  EIS.  However,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  may  require 
additional  mitigation  measures  for  any  disturbance  to  wetland  resources.  The  overall 
conclusion  for  onsite  storage  of  spent  fuel  during  the  licensed  lifetime  of  reactor  operations  is 
that  the  environmental  impacts  will  be  minor. 

On  August  26,  2014,  the  Commission  issued  a  revised  rule  at  10  CFR  51.23  (TN250)  and 
associated  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  Continued  Storage  of  Spent  Nuclear 
Fuel,  NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014-TN41 17).  The  revised  rule  adopts  the  generic  impact 
determinations  made  in  NUREG-2157  and  codifies  the  NRC’s  generic  determinations  regarding 
the  environmental  impacts  of  continued  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  beyond  a  reactor’s  OL 
(i.e.,  those  impacts  that  could  occur  as  a  result  of  the  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  at-reactor 
or  away-from-reactor  sites  after  a  reactor’s  licensed  life  for  operation  and  until  a  permanent 
repository  becomes  available). 

In  CLI-14-08  (NRC  2014-TN4303),  the  Commission  held  that  the  revised  10  CFR  51.23  (TN250) 
and  associated  NUREG-2157  cure  the  deficiencies  identified  by  the  court  in  New  York  v.  NRC 
(2012-TN2397),  681  F.3d  471  (D.C.  Cir.  2012)  and  stated  that  the  rule  satisfies  the  NRC's 
National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA,  42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  obligations  with

respect  to  continued  storage  for  actions  such  as  the  EIS  application  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  directed  by  1 0  CFR  51 .23(b)  (TN250),  the  impacts  assessed  in 
NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014-TN41 17)  are  deemed  incorporated  into  this  EIS. 

The  staff  s  evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  continued  storage  of  spent  fuel 
presented  in  NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014-TN41 17)  identifies  an  impact  level,  or  a  range  of 
impacts,  for  each  resource  area  for  a  range  of  site  conditions  and  timeframes.  The  timeframes 
analyzed  in  NUREG-2157  include  the  short-term  timeframe  (i.e.,  60  years  beyond  the  licensed 
life  of  a  reactor),  the  long-term  timeframe  (i.e.,  an  additional  100  years  after  the  short-term 
timeframe),  and  an  indefinite  timeframe  (see  Section  1 .8.2  of  NUREG-2157  [NRC  2014- 
TN4117]). 

The  analysis  in  Section  4.20  of  NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014-TN41 17)  concludes  that  the  potential 
impacts  of  spent  fuel  storage  at  the  reactor  site  in  both  a  spent  fuel  pool  and  in  an  at-reactor 
independent  spent  fuel  storage  installation  would  be  SMALL  during  the  short-term  timeframe. 
However,  for  the  longer  timeframes  for  at-reactor  storage,  and  for  all  timeframes  for  away-from- 
reactor  storage,  Sections  4.20  and  5.20  of  NUREG-2157  provide  a  range  of  potential  impacts  in 
some  resource  areas.  These  ranges  reflect  uncertainties  that  are  inherent  in  analyzing 
environmental  impacts  to  some  resource  areas  over  long  timeframes.  Those  uncertainties 
exist,  however,  regardless  of  whether  the  impacts  are  analyzed  generically  or  site-specifically. 

Appendix  B  of  NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014-TN41 17)  provides  an  assessment  of  the  technical 
feasibility  of  a  deep  geologic  repository  and  continued  safe  storage  of  spent  fuel.  That 
assessment  concluded  that  a  deep  geologic  repository  is  technically  feasible  and  that  a 
reasonable  timeframe  for  its  development  is  about  25  to  35  years.  The  assessment  in  NUREG- 
2157  noted  that  DOE’s  goal  is  to  have  sited,  constructed,  and  commenced  operations  of  a 
repository  by  2048  (NRC  2014-TN41 17).  If  the  current  proposed  action  is  approved  and  no 
renewals  are  granted  in  the  future,  the  short-term  timeframe  will  end  60  years  after  the  end  of 
the  licensed  period.  The  licensed  period  plus  the  short-term  timeframe  is  more  than  twice  as 
long  as  the  time  estimated  to  develop  a  deep  geologic  repository. 

The  most  likely  impacts  of  the  continued  storage  of  spent  fuel  are  those  considered  for  at- 
reactor  storage  in  the  short-term  timeframe.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  fuel  remains  on  the  site 
into  the  long-term  and  indefinite  timeframes,  the  ranges  in  NUREG-2157  reflect  factors  that 
lead  to  uncertainties  regarding  the  potential  impacts  over  these  very  long  periods  of  time  (NRC 
2014-TN41 17).  Based  on  the  analysis  and  impact  determination  in  NUREG-2157  (NRC  2014- 
TN41 1 7),  and  taking  into  account  the  impacts  that  the  NRC  can  predict  with  certainty,  which  are 
SMALL;  the  uncertainty  reflected  by  the  ranges  in  the  long-term  and  indefinite  timeframes;  and 
the  relative  likelihood  of  the  timeframes,  the  staff  finds  that  the  impacts  for  at-reactor  storage  at 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  likely  to  be  minor. 

Spent  fuel  could  also  be  moved  to  an  away-from-reactor  storage  facility.  However,  there  is 
uncertainty  whether  an  away-from-reactor  storage  facility  would  be  constructed,  uncertainty 
regarding  where  it  might  be  located,  and  uncertainty  regarding  the  impacts  in  short-term,  long¬ 
term,  and  indefinite  timeframes  .  As  a  result,  these  impacts  provide  limited  insights  to  the 
decision  maker  in  the  overall  picture  of  the  environmental  impacts  from  the  proposed  action  and 
do  not  change  the  staffs  overall  conclusion  regarding  the  environmental  impacts  of  radiological 
wastes  from  the  fuel  cycle,  which  includes  the  impacts  associated  with  spent  fuel  storage.

The  NRC  staff  concludes,  based  on  Table  S-3  and  the  above  conclusions  regarding  storage 
and  disposal  of  LLW  and  spent  fuel,  that  the  environmental  impacts  from  radioactive  waste 
storage  and  disposal  associated  with  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  SMALL. 

6.1.7  Occupational  Dose 

The  annual  occupational  dose  attributable  to  all  phases  of  the  fuel  cycle  for  the  1 ,000-MW(e) 
LWR-scaled  model  is  about  1,800  person-rem.  This  is  based  on  the  NUREG-1437 
occupational  dose  estimate  of  600  person-rem  attributable  to  all  phases  of  the  fuel  cycle  for  the 
model  1,000-MW(e)  LWR  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289).  The  NRC  staff  concludes 
that  the  environmental  impact  from  this  occupational  dose  is  minor  because  the  dose  to  any 
individual  worker  would  be  maintained  within  the  limits  of  10  CFR  Part  20  (TN283),  which  is 
5  rem/year. 

6.1.8  Transportation 

The  transportation  dose  to  workers  and  the  public  related  to  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  totals  about 
2.5  person-rem  annually  for  the  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR,  according  to  Table  S-3 
(Table  6-1).  This  corresponds  to  a  dose  of  7.5  person-rem  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled 
model  at  the  PSEG  Site.  For  purposes  of  comparison,  the  estimated  collective  dose  from 
natural  background  radiation  to  the  current  population  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  with  a  2010 
population  of  5,460,955  is  about  831 ,200  person-rem/year  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Based  on 
this  comparison,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  environmental  impacts  of  transportation  would  be 
minor. 

6.1.9  Summary 

The  staff  evaluated  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle,  as  given  in  Table  S-3 
of  10  CFR  51.51(b)  (TN250)  (see  Table  6-1),  considered  the  effects  of  radon-222  and 
technetium-99,  and  appropriately  scaled  the  impacts  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model. 
The  NRC  staff  also  evaluated  the  environmental  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  from  the  uranium 
fuel  cycle  and  appropriately  scaled  the  impacts  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  LWR-scaled  model.  Based 
on  this  evaluation,  the  staff  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  would  be 
SMALL. 

6.2  Transportation  Impacts 

This  section  addresses  both  the  radiological  and  nonradioiogical  environmental  impacts  from 
normal  operating  and  accident  conditions  resulting  from  (1)  shipment  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  the 
PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  (Section  6.2.1 ),  (2)  shipment  of  spent  fuel  to  a  monitored 
retrievable  storage  facility  or  a  permanent  repository  (Section  6.2.2),  and  (3)  shipment  of  LLW 
and  mixed  waste  to  offsite  disposal  facilities  (Section  6.2.3).  For  the  purposes  of  these  analyses, 
the  NRC  staff  considered  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain,  Nevada,  repository  site  as  a  surrogate 
destination  for  a  monitored  retrievable  storage  facility  or  permanent  repository.  The  impacts 
evaluated  in  this  section  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  appropriate  to 
characterize  the  alternative  sites  discussed  in  Section  9.3  of  this  EIS.  In  addition  to  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site,  the  alternative  sites  evaluated  in  this  EIS  include  one  site  in  Hunterdon  County,  New

Jersey,  two  sites  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  one  site  in  Cumberland  County,  New 
Jersey.  There  is  no  meaningful  differentiation  among  the  proposed  and  the  alternative  sites 
regarding  the  radiological  and  nonradiological  environmental  impacts  from  normal  operating  and 
accident  conditions;  thus,  these  conditions  are  not  discussed  further  in  Chapter  9. 

The  NRC  performed  a  generic  analysis  of  the  environmental  effects  of  the  transportation  of  fuel 
and  waste  to  and  from  LWRs  in  the  Environmental  Survey  of  Transportation  of  Radioactive 
Materials  To  and  From  Nuclear  Power  Plants,  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22)  and  in  a 
supplement  to  WASH-1238,  NUREG-75/038  (NRC  1975-TN216),  and  found  the  impact  to  be 
small.  These  documents  provided  the  basis  for  Table  S-4  in  1 0  CFR  51 .52  (TN250)  that 
summarizes  the  environmental  impacts  of  transportation  of  fuel  and  waste  to  and  from  one  LWR 
of  3,000  to  5,000  MW(t)  (1 ,000  to  1 ,500  MW(e)).  Impacts  are  provided  for  normal  conditions  of 
transport  and  accidents  in  transport  for  a  reference  1,100-MW(e)  LWR.(1)  Dose  to  transportation 
workers  during  normal  transportation  operations  was  estimated  to  result  in  a  collective  dose  of 
4  person-rem  per  reference  reactor-year.  The  combined  dose  to  the  public  along  the  route  and 
the  dose  to  onlookers  were  estimated  to  result  in  a  collective  dose  of  3  person-rem  per 
reference  reactor-year. 

Environmental  risks  of  radiological  effects  during  accident  conditions,  as  stated  in  Table  S-4, 
are  small.  Nonradiological  impacts  from  postulated  accidents  were  estimated  as  one  fatal  injury 
in  100  reference  reactor-years  and  one  nonfatal  injury  in  10  reference  reactor-years. 

Subsequent  reviews  of  transportation  impacts  in  NUREG-0170  (NRC  1977-TN417)  and 
NUREG/CR-6672  (Sprung  et  al.  2000-TN222)  conclude  that  impacts  were  bounded  by  Table 
S-4  in  10  CFR  51.52  (TN250).  In  accordance  with  10  CFR  51.52(a)  (TN250),  a  full  description 
and  a  detailed  analysis  of  transportation  impacts  are  not  required  when  licensing  an  LWR  (i.e., 
impacts  are  assumed  to  be  bounded  by  Table  S-4)  if  the  reactor  meets  the  following  criteria: 

•  the  reactor  has  a  core  thermal  power  level  that  does  not  exceed  3,800  MW(t); 

•  fuel  is  in  the  form  of  sintered  uranium  oxide  pellets  having  a  uranium-235  enrichment  not 
exceeding  4  percent  by  weight;  and  pellets  are  encapsulated  in  Zircaloy-clad  fuel  rods;(2) 

•  the  average  level  of  irradiation  of  the  fuel  from  the  reactor  does  not  exceed 

33,000  MWd/MTU,  and  no  irradiated  fuel  assembly  is  shipped  until  at  least  90  days  after  it  is 
discharged  from  the  reactor; 


(1 )  The  transportation  impacts  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site  were  normalized  for  a  reference 

1 ,100-MW(e)  LWR  at  an  80  percent  capacity  factor  for  comparisons  to  Table  S-4.  Note  that  the 
basis  for  Table  S-4  is  a  1 ,100  MW(e)  LWR  at  an  80  percent  capacity  factor  (AEC  1972-TN22; 

NRC  1 975-TN21 6).  The  basis  for  Table  S— 3  in  10  CFR  51  51(b)  (TN250)  that  was  discussed  in 
Section  6.1  of  this  EIS  is  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  LWR  with  an  80  percent  capacity  factor  (NRC  1976-TN292). 
However,  because  fuel  cycle  and  transportation  impacts  are  evaluated  separately,  this  difference 
does  not  affect  the  results  and  conclusions  in  this  EIS. 

(2)  1 0  CFR  51 .52(a)(2)  (TN250)  specifies  the  use  of  Zircaloy  as  the  fuel  rod  cladding  material.  The  NRC 
has  also  specified  in  10  CFR  50.46  (TN249)  that  ZIRLO  is  an  acceptable  fuel  rod  cladding  material, 
and  that  with  regard  to  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  transportation  of  M5 
clad  fuel  assemblies,  the  M5  cladding  had  no  impact  on  previous  assessments  determined  in 
accordance  with  1 0  CFR  51 .52  (65  FR  794-TN2657).

•  with  the  exception  of  irradiated  fuel,  all  radioactive  waste  shipped  from  the  reactor  is 
packaged  and  in  solid  form; 

•  unirradiated  fuel  is  shipped  to  the  reactor  by  truck;  irradiated  (spent)  fuel  is  shipped  from  the 
reactor  by  truck,  railcar,  or  barge;  and  radioactive  waste,  other  than  irradiated  fuel,  is 
shipped  from  the  reactor  by  truck  or  railcar. 

The  environmental  impacts  of  the  transportation  of  fuel  and  radioactive  wastes  to  and  from 
nuclear  power  facilities  are  resolved  generically  in  10  CFR  51 .52  (TN250),  provided  that  the 
specific  conditions  in  the  rule  (see  above)  are  met.  The  NRC  may  consider  requests  for 
licensed  plants  to  operate  at  conditions  above  those  in  the  facility's  licensing  basis;  for  example, 
higher  burnups  (above  33,000  MWd/MTU),  enrichments  (above  4  weight  percent  uranium-235), 
or  thermal  power  levels  (above  3,800  MW(t)).  Departures  from  the  conditions  itemized  in 
10  CFR  51.52(a)  (TN250)  are  to  be  supported  by  a  full  description  and  detailed  analysis  of  the 
environmental  effects,  as  specified  in  10  CFR  51.52(b)  (TN250).  Departures  found  to  be 
acceptable  for  licensed  facilities  cannot  serve  as  the  basis  for  initial  licensing  of  new  reactors. 

In  its  application,  PSEG  did  not  identify  a  specific  reactor  design.  Rather,  it  used  bounding 
parameters  from  four  reactor  designs.  These  designs  are  LWRs  and  include  the  ABWR 
(4,300  MW(t)/unit),  the  API 000  (3,400  MW(t)/unit),  U.S.  EPR  (4,590  MW(t)/unit),  and  the 
US-APWR  (4,451  MW(t)/unit).  For  the  ABWR.  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR,  one  unit  is  proposed; 
for  the  API  000,  two  units  are  proposed.  None  of  the  proposed  LWR  designs  meets  ail  the 
conditions  in  10  CFR  51.52(a)  (TN250);  therefore,  a  full  description  and  detailed  analysis  are 
required  for  each  LWR  design.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  the  following: 

•  the  U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  and  US-APWR  designs  exceed  the  3,800-MW(t)  core  thermal  power 
level; 

•  the  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR.  and  US-APWR  designs  require  fuel  that  exceeds  the  U-235 
enrichment  of  4  percent;  and 

•  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  designs  are  expected  to  exceed  the  average 
irradiation  level  of  33,000  MWd/MTU. 

In  its  ER  and  request  for  additional  information  (RAI)  responses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280; 

PSEG  2012-TN2465),  PSEG  provided  a  full  description  and  detailed  analyses  of  transportation 
impacts  for  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  In  these  analyses,  the  radiological  impacts  of  transporting 
fuel  and  waste  to  and  from  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  were  calculated  using  the  RADTRAN  5.6 
computer  code  (Weiner  et  al.  2008-TN302).  RADTRAN  5.6  was  used  in  this  EIS  and  is  the 
most  commonly  used  transportation  impact  analysis  software  in  the  nuclear  industry.  However, 
the  ER  does  not  present  the  transportation  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites  evaluated  in  this 
EIS.  In  addition,  the  ER  analyzes  but  does  not  present  detailed  incident-free  radiological 
transportation  impacts  for  unirradiated  fuel  and  irradiated  fuel  based  on  normalizing  the  number 
of  shipments  to  the  880  MW(e)  (net)  WASH-1238  reactor.  Therefore,  to  address  these 
subjects,  the  NRC  staff  conducted  additional  transportation  analyses  to  verify  the  analyses 
performed  by  the  applicant  in  the  ER,  using  the  normalized  number  of  shipments,  collective 
doses  per  shipment,  radiological  risks  per  shipment,  and  alternative  site  scaling  factors 
estimated  by  the  applicant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465;  PSEG  2013-TN2463).

Comments  on  previous  new  reactor  EISs  also  were  considered  when  developing  the  scope  of 
this  EIS.  Based  on  these  comments,  this  EIS  includes  an  explicit  analysis  of  the  nonradiological 
impacts  of  transporting  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  radioactive  waste  to  and  from  the 
PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  Nonradiological  impacts  of  transporting  construction  workers 
and  materials  (see  Section  4.8.3)  and  operations  workers  (Section  5.8.6)  are  addressed 
elsewhere  in  this  EIS.  Publicly  available  information  about  traffic  accident,  injury,  and  fatality 
rates  was  used  to  estimate  nonradiological  impacts.  In  addition,  the  radiological  impacts  on 
maximally  exposed  individuals  (MEIs)  are  evaluated. 

6.2.1  Transportation  of  Unirradiated  Fuel 

The  NRC  staff  performed  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of 
transporting  unirradiated  (i.e. ,  fresh)  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  Radiological 
impacts  of  normal  conditions  and  transportation  accidents  as  well  as  nonradiological  impacts 
are  discussed  in  this  section.  Radiological  impacts  on  populations  and  MEIs  are  presented. 
PSEG  assumed  in  its  ER  and  RAI  responses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465)  that 
the  unirradiated  fuel  would  be  shipped  from  Richland,  Washington;  in  addition,  the  NRC  staffs 
analysis  assumed  a  “representative”  route  from  the  fuel-fabrication  facility  to  the  PSEG  Site  and 
alternative  sites.  This  means  that  there  are  no  substantive  differences  between  the  impacts 
calculated,  for  the  purposes  of  Chapter  9,  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  four  alternative  sites.  The 
site-specific  differences  are  minor  because  the  differences  in  dose  estimates  as  a  result  of 
differences  in  shipping  distances  among  the  potential  fuel-fabrication  plant  to  the  PSEG  Site 
and  alternative  sites  are  small. 

6. 2. 1.1  Normal  Conditions 

Normal  conditions,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “incident-free”  transportation,  are  transportation 
activities  during  which  shipments  reach  their  destination  without  releasing  any  radioactive 
material  to  the  environment.  Impacts  from  these  shipments  would  be  from  the  low  levels  of 
radiation  that  penetrate  the  unirradiated  fuel  shipping  containers.  Radiation  exposures  at  some 
level  would  occur  to  the  following  individuals:  (1 )  persons  residing  along  the  transportation 
corridors  between  the  fuel-fabrication  facility  and  the  PSEG  or  alternative  sites;  (2)  persons  in 
vehicles  traveling  on  the  same  route  as  an  unirradiated  fuel  shipment;  (3)  persons  at  vehicle 
stops  for  refueling,  rest,  and  vehicle  inspections;  and  (4)  transportation  crew  workers. 

Truck  Shipments 

Table  6-3  provides  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  truck  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  for  the 
ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactor  designs  compared  to  those  of  the  reference 
1,100-MW(e)  reactor  specified  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22)  operating  at  80  percent 
capacity  (880  MW(e)).  After  normalization,  the  NRC  staff  verified  that  the  number  of  truck 
shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  or  alternative  sites  would  be  fewer  than  the 
number  of  truck  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  estimated  for  the  reference  LWR  in  WASH-1 238. 
The  results  are  consistent  with  the  estimates  provided  in  PSEG’s  ER  and  RAI  responses 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465).

Shipping  Mode  and  Weight  Limits 

In  10  CFR  51.52  (TN250),  a  condition  is  identified  that  states  all  unirradiated  fuel  is  shipped  to 
the  reactor  by  truck.  PSEG  specifies  that  unirradiated  fuel  would  be  shipped  to  the  proposed 
reactor  site  by  truck.  10  CFR  51 .52  (TN250)  Table  S-4,  includes  a  condition  that  the  truck 
shipments  not  exceed  73,000  lb  as  governed  by  Federal  or  State  gross  vehicle  weight 
restrictions.  PSEG  states  in  its  ER  that  the  unirradiated  fuel  shipments  to  the  PSEG  Site  and 
alternative  sites  would  comply  with  applicable  weight  restrictions  (PSEG  2015-TN4280; 

PSEG  2012-TN2465). 

Radiological  Doses  to  Transport  Workers  and  the  Public 

10  CFR  51.52  (TN250),  Table  S^4,  includes  conditions  related  to  radiological  dose  to  transport 
workers  and  members  of  the  public  along  transport  routes.  These  doses  are  a  function  of  many 
variables,  including  the  radiation  dose  rate  emitted  from  the  unirradiated  fuel  shipments,  the 
number  of  exposed  individuals  and  their  locations  relative  to  the  shipment,  the  time  in  transit 
(including  travel  and  stop  times),  and  the  number  of  shipments  to  which  the  individuals  are 
exposed.  For  this  EIS,  the  radiological  dose  impacts  of  the  transportation  of  unirradiated  fuel 
were  independently  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  for  the  worker  and  the  public  using  the 
RADTFRAN  5.6  computer  code  (Weiner  et  al.  2008-TN302). 

One  of  the  key  assumptions  in  WASH-1 238  (AEC  1 972-TN22)  for  the  reference  LWR 
unirradiated  fuel  shipments  is  that  the  radiation  dose  rate  at  3.3  ft  from  the  transport  vehicle  is 
about  0.1  mrem/hour.  This  assumption  also  was  used  in  the  NRC  staffs  analysis  of  the  ABWR, 
API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactor  unirradiated  fuel  shipments.  This  assumption  is 
reasonable  because  the  reactor  fuel  materials  would  be  low-dose-rate  uranium  radionuclides 
and  would  be  packaged  similarly  to  those  described  in  WASH-1238  (i.e.,  inside  a  metal

container  that  provides  little  radiation  shielding).  The  numbers  of  shipments  per  year  were 
obtained  by  dividing  the  normalized  shipments  in  Table  6-3  by  40  years  of  reactor  operation. 
Other  key  input  parameters  used  in  the  radiation  dose  analysis  for  unirradiated  fuel  are  shown 
in  Table  6-4.

unirradiated  fuel  shipments.  A  3,200-km  (2,000-mi)  “representative”  shipping  distance  was  assumed  here. 

(b)  See  Table  6-8  for  truck  stop  parameters. 


The  RADTRAN  5.6  results  for  this  “generic”  unirradiated  fuel  shipment  are  as  follows: 

•  worker  dose:  1.7  x  10"3  person-rem/shipment, 

•  general  public  dose  (onlookers/persons  at  stops  and  sharing  the  highway): 

2.9  x  10-3  person-rem/shipment,  and 

•  general  public  dose  (along  route/persons  living  near  a  highway  or  truck  stop): 

4.1  x  icr5  person-rem/shipment. 

To  estimate  the  annual  doses  to  the  public  and  workers  from  the  average  annual  shipments  of 
unirradiated  fuel  for  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactors,  PSEG  assumed  in 
its  ER  and  RAI  responses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465)  that  the  unirradiated  fuel 
would  be  shipped  from  Richland,  Washington.  Table  6-5  presents  the  annual  radiological 
impacts  on  workers,  public  onlookers  (persons  at  stops  and  sharing  the  road),  and  members  of 
the  public  along  the  route  (i.e.,  residents  within  0.5  mi  of  the  highway)  for  transporting

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


unirradiated  fuel  from  Richland,  Washington,  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  for  a  single 
ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactor. 

The  cumulative  annual  dose  estimates  in  Table  6-5  were  normalized  to  1,100  MW(e) 

(880  MW(e)  net  electrical  output).  The  NRC  staff  performed  an  independent  review  and 
determined  that  all  dose  estimates  are  bounded  by  the  Table  S-4  conditions  of 
4  person-rem/year  to  transportation  workers,  3  person-rem/year  to  onlookers,  and 
3  person-rem/year  to  members  of  the  public  along  the  route. 

Radiation  protection  experts  assume  that  any  amount  of  radiation  may  pose  some  risk  of 
causing  cancer  or  a  severe  hereditary  effect  and  that  the  risk  is  higher  for  higher  radiation 
exposures.  Therefore,  a  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response  relationship  is  used  to  describe  the 
relationship  between  radiation  dose  and  detriments  such  as  cancer  induction.  A  recent  report 
by  the  National  Research  Council  (National  Research  Council  2006-TN296),  the  BEIR  VII 
report,  uses  the  linear,  no-threshold  dose  response  model  as  a  basis  for  estimating  the  risks 
from  low  doses.  This  approach  is  accepted  by  the  NRC  as  a  conservative  method  for 
estimating  health  risks  from  radiation  exposure,  recognizing  that  the  model  may  overestimate 
those  risks.  Based  on  this  method,  the  NRC  staff  estimated  the  risk  to  the  public  from  radiation 
exposure  using  the  nominal  probability  coefficient  for  total  detriment.  This  coefficient  has  the 
value  of  570  fatal  cancers,  nonfatal  cancers,  and  severe  hereditary  effects  per 
1,000,000  person-rem  (10,000  person-Sv),  equal  to  0.00057  effects  per  person-rem.  The 
coefficient  is  taken  from  ICRP  Publication  103  (ICRP  2007-TN422). 

Both  the  NCRP  and  ICRP  suggest  that  when  the  collective  effective  dose  is  smaller  than  the 
reciprocal  of  the  relevant  risk  detriment  (in  other  words,  less  than  1/0.00057,  which  is  less  than 
1 ,754  person-rem),  the  risk  assessment  should  note  that  the  most  likely  number  of  excess 
health  effects  is  zero  (NCRP  1995-TN728;  ICRP  2007-TN422).  The  largest  annual  collective 
dose  estimate  for  transporting  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  was  less 
than  2  x  10'2  person-rem,  which  is  less  than  the  1,754  person-rem  value  that  ICRP  and  NCRP 
suggest  would  most  likely  result  in  zero  excess  health  effects. 

To  place  these  impacts  in  perspective,  the  average  U.S.  resident  receives  about  311  mrem/year 
effective  dose  equivalent  from  natural  background  radiation  (i.e.,  exposures  from  cosmic 
radiation;  naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials,  such  as  radon;  and  global  fallout  from  testing 
of  nuclear  explosive  devices)  (NCRP  2009-TN420).  Using  this  average  effective  dose,  the 
collective  population  dose  from  natural  background  radiation  to  the  population  along  the  generic 
representative  route  would  be  about  2.2  *  105  person-rem.  Therefore,  the  radiation  doses  from 
transporting  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  are  minimal  compared  to 
the  collective  population  dose  to  the  same  population  from  exposure  to  natural  sources  of 
radiation.

Maximally  Exposed  Individuals  Under  Normal  Transport  Conditions 

A  scenario-based  analysis  was  conducted  by  the  NRC  staff  to  develop  estimates  of 
incident-free  radiation  doses  to  MEIs  for  fuel  and  waste  shipments  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site 
and  alternative  sites.  The  following  discussion  applies  to  unirradiated  fuel  shipments  to,  and 
spent  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  shipments  from,  the  PSEG  Site  and  any  of  the  alternative  sites. 
The  analysis  is  based  on  information  in  DOE’s  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  a 
Geologic  Repository  for  the  Disposal  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level  Radioactive  Waste

at  Yucca  Mountain,  Nye  County ,  Nevada  (DOE  2002-TN1236)  and  incorporates  data  about 
exposure  times,  dose  rates,  and  the  number  of  times  an  individual  may  be  exposed  to  an  offsite 
shipment.  Adjustments  were  made  where  necessary  to  reflect  the  normalized  fuel  and  waste 
shipments  addressed  in  this  EIS.  In  all  cases,  the  NRC  staff  assumed  that  the  dose  rate 
emitted  from  the  shipping  containers  is  1 0  mrem/hour  at  2  m  (6.6  ft)  from  the  side  of  the 
transport  vehicle.  This  assumption  is  conservative,  in  that  the  assumed  dose  rate  is  the 
maximum  dose  rate  allowed  by  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  regulations  in 
49  CFR  173.441  (TN298).  Most  unirradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  shipments  would  have 
much  lower  dose  rates  than  the  regulations  allow  (AEC  1972-TN22;  DOE  2002-TN418).  An 
MEI  is  a  person  who  may  receive  the  highest  radiation  dose  from  a  shipment  to  and/or  from  the 
PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  The  analysis  of  MEIs  is  described  below. 

Truck  Crew  Member 


Truck  crew  members  would  receive  the  highest  radiation  doses  during  incident-free  transport 
because  of  their  proximity  to  the  loaded  shipping  container  for  an  extended  period.  The 
analysis  assumed  that  crew  member  doses  are  limited  to  2  rem/year,  which  is  the  DOE 
administrative  control  level  presented  in  DOE-STD-1 098-99,  DOE  Standard.  Radiological 
Control,  Chapter  2,  Article  21 1  (DOE  2005-TN1235).  This  limit  is  anticipated  to  apply  to  spent 
nuclear  fuel  shipments  to  a  disposal  facility  because  DOE  would  take  title  to  the  spent  fuel  at  the 
reactor  site.  There  would  be  more  shipments  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  the  PSEG  Site  (or 
alternative  sites)  than  there  would  be  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  to,  and  radioactive  waste 
other  than  spent  fuel  from,  these  sites.  This  is  because  the  capacities  of  spent  fuel  shipping 
casks  are  limited  due  to  their  substantial  radiation  shielding  and  accident  resistance 
requirements.  Spent  fuel  shipments  also  have  significantly  higher  radiation  dose  rates  than 
unirradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  (DOE  2002-TN418).  As  a  result,  crew  doses  from 
unirradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  shipments  would  be  lower  than  the  doses  from  spent 
nuclear  fuel  shipments.  The  DOE  administrative  limit  of  2  rem/year  (DOE  2005-TN1235)  is  less 
than  the  NRC  limit  for  occupational  exposures  of  5  rem/year  (10  CFR  Part  20-TN283). 

The  DOT  does  not  regulate  annual  occupational  exposures.  It  does  recognize  that  air  crews 
are  exposed  to  elevated  cosmic  radiation  levels  and  recommends  dose  limits  to  air  crew 
members  from  cosmic  radiation  (Friedberg  and  Copeland  2003-TN419).  Air  passengers  are 
less  of  a  concern  because  they  do  not  fly  as  frequently  as  air  crew  members.  The 
recommended  limits  are  a  5-year  effective  dose  of  2  rem/year  with  no  more  than  5  rem  in  a 
single  year  (Friedberg  and  Copeland  2003-TN419).  As  a  result  of  this  recommendation,  a 
2-rem/year  MEI  dose  to  truck  crews  is  a  reasonable  estimate  to  apply  to  shipments  of  fuel 
and  waste  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites. 

Inspectors 

Radioactive  shipments  are  inspected  by  Federal  or  State  vehicle  inspectors,  for  example,  at 
state  ports  of  entry.  DOE  (2002-TN1236)  assumed  that  inspectors  would  be  exposed  for  1  hour 
at  a  distance  of  1  m  (3.3  ft)  from  the  shipping  containers.  Assuming  conservatively  that  the 
external  dose  rate  at  2  m  (6.6  ft)  is  at  the  maximum  allowed  by  regulations  (10  mrem/hr),  the 
dose  rate  at  1  m  (3.3  ft)  is  about  14  mrem/hour  (Weiner  et  al.  2008-TN302).  Therefore,  the 
dose  per  shipment  is  about  14  mrem.  This  is  independent  of  the  location  of  the  reactor  site.

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


Based  on  this  conservative  external  dose  rate  and  the  assumption  that  the  same  person 
inspects  all  shipments  of  fuel  and  waste  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites,  the 
annual  doses  to  vehicle  inspectors  were  calculated  to  be  about  2.1  rem/year,  based  on  a 
combined  total  of  149  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  radioactive  waste  per  year. 
This  value  slightly  exceeds  the  2-rem/year  DOE  administrative  control  level  for  individual  doses 
(DOE  2005-TN1235)  and  is  about  40  percent  of  the  5-rem/year  NRC  occupational  dose  limit 
(see  10  CFR  Part  20-TN283). 

Residents 

The  analysis  assumed  that  a  resident  lives  adjacent  to  a  highway  where  a  shipment  would  pass 
and  would  be  exposed  to  all  shipments  along  a  particular  route.  Exposures  to  residents  on  a 
per-shipment  basis  were  obtained  from  the  NRC  staffs  RADTRAN  5.6  output  files.  These  dose 
estimates  are  based  on  an  individual  located  100  ft  from  the  shipments  that  are  traveling 
15  mph.  The  potential  radiation  dose  to  the  maximally  exposed  resident  is  about 
0.09  mrem/year  for  shipments  of  fuel  and  waste  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative 
sites. 

Individuals  Stuck  in  Traffic 

This  scenario  addresses  potential  traffic  interruptions  that  could  lead  to  a  person  being  exposed 
to  a  loaded  shipment  for  1  hour  at  a  distance  of  4  ft.  The  NRC  staffs  analysis  assumed  this 
exposure  scenario  would  occur  only  one  time  to  any  individual,  and  the  dose  rate  was  at  the 
regulatory  limit  of  10  mrem/hour  at  2  m  (6.6  ft)  from  the  shipment.  The  dose  to  the  MEI  was 
calculated  in  DOE  (2002-TN1236)  to  be  16  mrem. 

Persons  at  a  Truck  Service  Station 

This  scenario  estimates  doses  to  an  employee  at  a  service  station  where  all  truck  shipments  to 
and  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  are  assumed  to  stop.  DOE  (2002-TN1236) 
assumed  this  person  is  exposed  for  49  minutes  at  a  distance  of  52  ft  from  the  loaded  shipping 
container.  The  exposure  time  and  distance  were  based  on  the  observations  discussed  by 
Griego  et  at.  (1996-TN69).  This  results  in  a  dose  of  about  0.34  mrem/shipment  and  an  annual 
dose  of  about  51  mrem/year  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites,  assuming  that  a  single 
individual  services  all  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  radioactive  waste  shipments  to  and  from 
the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites. 

6. 2. 1.2  Radiological  Impacts  of  Transportation  Accidents 

Accident  risks  are  a  combination  of  accident  frequency  and  consequence.  Accident  frequencies 
for  transportation  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  are  expected  to  be 
lower  than  those  used  in  the  analysis  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22),  which  forms  the  basis 
for  Table  S-4  of  1 0  CFR  51 .52  (TN250),  because  of  improvements  in  highway  safety  and 
security,  and  an  overall  reduction  in  traffic  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  since  WASH-1238 
was  published.  There  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  consequences  of  transportation 
accidents  severe  enough  to  result  in  a  release  of  unirradiated  fuel  particles  to  the  environment 
between  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactors  and  current-generation  LWRs 
because  the  fuel  form,  cladding,  and  packaging  are  similar  to  those  analyzed  in  WASH-1238 
(AEC  1972-TN22).  Consequently,  consistent  with  the  conclusions  of  WASH-1238,  the  impacts 


NUREG-2168 


6-26 


November  2015 


Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


of  accidents  during  transport  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  an  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and 
US-APWR  reactor  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  are  expected  to  be  smaller  than  those 
listed  in  Table  for  current-generation  LWRs. 

6. 2. 1.3  Nonradiological  Impacts  of  Transportation  Accidents 

Nonradiological  impacts  are  the  human  health  impacts  projected  to  result  from  traffic  accidents 
involving  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  (i.e.,  the  analysis 
does  not  consider  the  radiological  or  hazardous  characteristics  of  the  cargo).  Nonradiological 
impacts  include  the  projected  number  of  traffic  accidents,  injuries,  and  fatalities  that  could  result 
from  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  site  and  return  shipments  of  empty  containers  from 
the  site. 

Nonradiological  impacts  are  calculated  using  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  from  published 
sources.  The  rates  (i.e.,  impacts  per  vehicle-km  traveled)  are  then  multiplied  by  estimated 
travel  distances  for  workers  and  materials.  The  general  formula  for  calculating  nonradiological 
impacts  is  as  follows: 

Impacts  =  (unit  rate)  *  (round-trip  shipping  distance)  *  (annual  number  of  shipments). 

In  this  formula,  impacts  are  presented  in  units  of  the  number  of  accidents,  number  of  injuries, 
and  number  of  fatalities  per  year.  Corresponding  unit  rates  (i.e.,  impacts  per  vehicle-km 
traveled)  are  used  in  the  calculations. 

Accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  were  taken  from  Table  4  in  State-Level  Accident  Rates  for 
Surface  Freight  Transportation:  A  Reexamination  (ANL/ESD/TM-150)  (Saricks  and 
Tompkins  1999-TN81).  Nationwide  median  rates  were  used  for  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel 
to  the  site.  The  data  are  representative  of  traffic  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  for  truck 
shipments  similar  to  those  to  be  used  to  transport  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and 
alternative  sites.  In  addition,  the  DOT  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration  evaluated 
the  data  underlying  the  Saricks  and  Tompkins  (1999-TN81)  rates,  which  were  taken  from  the 
Motor  Carrier  Management  Information  System,  and  determined  that  the  rates  were 
underreported.  Therefore,  the  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  in  Saricks  and  Tompkins 
(1999-TN81)  were  adjusted  using  factors  derived  from  data  provided  by  the  University  of 
Michigan  Transportation  Research  Institute  (UMTRI)  (Blower  and  Matteson  2003-TN410).  The 
UMTRI  data  indicate  that  accident  rates  for  1994  to  1996,  the  same  data  used  by  Saricks  and 
Tompkins  (1999-TN81),  were  underreported  by  about  39  percent.  Injury  and  fatality  rates  were 
underreported  by  16  percent  and  36  percent,  respectively.  As  a  result,  the  accident,  injury,  and 
fatality  rates  were  increased  by  factors  of  1 .64,  1 .20,  and  1 .57,  respectively,  to  account  for  the 
underreporting. 

The  nonradiological  accident  impacts  for  transporting  unirradiated  fuel  to  (and  empty  shipping 
containers  from)  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  are  shown  in  Table  6-6.  The 
nonradiological  impacts  associated  with  the  WASH-1238  reference  LWR  are  also  shown  for 
comparison  purposes.  Note  that  there  are  only  small  differences  between  the  impacts 
calculated  for  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  and 
alternative  sites  and  the  reference  LWR  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22),  due  entirely  to  the 
estimated  annual  number  of  shipments.  Overall,  the  impacts  are  minimal,  and  there  are  no

substantive  differences  among  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  In  addition,  the  NRC  staff 
verified  PSEG’s  analysis  in  the  ER  and  RAI  responses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012- 
TN2465)  by  performing  independent  impact  calculations.  No  significant  differences  were 
identified.

6.2.2  Transportation  of  Spent  Fuel 

The  NRC  staff  performed  an  independent  analysis  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  transporting 
spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  to  a  spent  fuel  disposal  repository.  For  the 


NUREG-2168

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


purposes  of  these  analyses,  the  NRC  staff  considered  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  site  in 
Nevada  as  a  surrogate  destination.  Currently,  the  NRC  has  not  made  a  decision  about  the  DOE 
application  for  the  proposed  geologic  repository  at  Yucca  Mountain.  However,  the  NRC  staff 
considers  that  an  estimate  of  the  impacts  of  the  transportation  of  spent  fuel  to  a  possible 
repository  in  Nevada  to  be  a  reasonable  bounding  estimate  of  the  transportation  impacts  on  a 
storage  or  disposal  facility  because  of  the  distances  involved  and  the  representativeness  of  the 
distribution  of  members  of  the  public  in  urban,  suburban,  and  rural  areas  (i.e.,  population 
distributions)  along  the  shipping  routes.  Radiological  and  nonradiological  environmental 
impacts  of  normal  operating  conditions  and  transportation  accidents,  as  well  as  nonradiological 
impacts,  are  discussed  in  this  section.  The  NRC  Yucca  Mountain  adjudicatory  proceeding  is 
currently  suspended,  and  Yucca  Mountain-related  matters  are  pending  in  Federal  Court. 
Regardless  of  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  transportation 
impacts  are  roughly  proportional  to  the  distance  from  the  reactor  site  to  the  repository  site,  in 
this  case.  New  Jersey  to  Nevada. 

This  NRC  staff  s  analysis  is  based  on  shipment  of  spent  fuel  by  legal-weight  trucks  in  shipping 
casks  with  characteristics  similar  to  currently  available  casks  (i.e.,  massive,  heavily  shielded, 
cylindrical  metal  pressure  vessels).  Due  to  the  large  size  and  weight  of  spent  fuel  shipping 
casks,  each  shipment  is  assumed  to  consist  of  a  single  shipping  cask  loaded  on  a  modified 
trailer.  These  assumptions  are  consistent  with  those  made  in  the  evaluation  of  the 
environmental  impacts  of  transportation  of  spent  fuel  in  Addendum  1  to  NUREG-1437 
(NRC  1999-TN289).  Because  the  alternative  transportation  methods  involve  rail  transportation 
or  heavy-haul  trucks,  which  would  reduce  the  overall  number  of  spent  fuel  shipments 
(NRC  1999-TN289),  thereby  reducing  impacts,  these  assumptions  are  conservative.  Also,  the 
use  of  current  shipping  cask  designs  for  this  analysis  results  in  conservative  impact  estimates 
because  the  current  designs  are  based  on  transporting  short-cooled  spent  fuel  (approximately 
120  days  out  of  reactor).  Future  shipping  casks  would  be  designed  to  transport  longer-cooled 
fuel  (greater  than  5  years  out  of  reactor)  and  would  require  much  less  shielding  to  meet  external 
dose  limitations.  Therefore,  future  shipping  casks  are  expected  to  have  higher  cargo  capacities, 
thus  reducing  the  numbers  of  shipments  and  associated  impacts. 

Radiological  impacts  of  transportation  of  spent  fuel  were  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  using  the 
RADTRAN  5.6  computer  code  (Weiner  et  al.  2008-TN302).  Routing  and  population  data  used 
in  RADTRAN  5.6  for  truck  shipments  were  obtained  from  the  Transportation  Routing  Analysis 
Geographical  Information  System  (TRAGIS)  routing  code  (Johnson  and  Michelhaugh  2003- 
TN1234).  The  population  data  in  the  TRAGIS  code  are  based  on  the  2000  census.  The  NRC 
staff  reviewed  the  2010  census  data  and  determined  that  the  change  in  impacts  resulting  from 
using  2010  census  data  would  not  be  significant.  Nonradiological  impacts  were  calculated 
using  published  traffic  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  data  (Saricks  and  Tompkins  1999-TN81)  in 
addition  to  route  information  from  TRAGIS  (Johnson  and  Michelhaugh  2003-TN1234).  Traffic 
accident  rates  input  to  RADTRAN  5.6  and  nonradiological  impact  calculations  were  adjusted  to 
account  for  underreporting,  as  discussed  in  Section  6.2.1 .3.

6. 2. 2. 1  Normal  Conditions 

Normal  conditions,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “incident-free”  transportation,  are  transportation 
activities  in  which  shipments  reach  their  destination  without  an  accident  occurring  en  route. 
Impacts  from  these  shipments  would  be  from  the  low  levels  of  radiation  that  penetrate  the 
heavily  shielded  spent  fuel  shipping  cask.  Radiation  exposures  would  occur  to  the  following 
populations:  (1)  persons  residing  along  the  transportation  corridors  between  the  PSEG  Site  and 
alternative  sites  and  the  proposed  repository  location;  (2)  persons  in  vehicles  traveling  on  the 
same  route  as  a  spent  fuel  shipment;  (3)  persons  at  vehicle  stops  for  refueling,  rest,  and  vehicle 
inspections;  and  (4)  transportation  crew  workers  (drivers).  For  purposes  of  this  analysis,  it  was 
assumed  that  the  destination  for  the  spent  fuel  shipments  is  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain 
disposal  facility  in  Nevada.  This  assumption  is  conservative  because  it  tends  to  maximize  the 
shipping  distance  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites. 

Shipping  casks  have  not  been  designed  for  the  spent  fuel  from  advanced  reactor  designs  such 
as  the  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR.  Information  in  the  Early  Site  Permit 
Environmental  Report  Sections  and  Supporting  Documentation  (INEEL  2003-TN71 )  indicated 
that  advanced  LWR  fuel  designs  would  not  be  significantly  different  from  existing  LWR  designs; 
therefore,  current  shipping  cask  designs  were  used  for  the  analysis  of  reactor  spent  fuel 
shipments.  The  NRC  staff  assumed  that  the  capacity  of  a  truck  shipment  of  reactor  spent  fuel 
was  0.5  MTU/shipment,  the  same  capacity  as  that  used  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22).  In 
its  ER  and  RAI  responses  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465),  PSEG  assumed  a 
shipping  cask  capacity  of  0.5  MTU/shipment. 

Input  to  RADTRAN  5.6  includes  the  total  shipping  distance  between  the  origin  and  destination 
sites  and  the  population  distributions  along  the  routes.  This  information  was  obtained  by 
running  the  TRAGIS  computer  code  (Johnson  and  Michelhaugh  2003-TN1234)  for  highway 
routes  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  to  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  facility.  The 
resulting  route  characteristics  information  is  shown  in  Table  6-7.  For  truck  shipments,  all  of  the 
spent  fuel  is  assumed  to  be  shipped  to  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  facility  over  designated 
highway-route  controlled-quantity  routes.  In  addition,  TRAGIS  data  were  used  in  RADTRAN  5.6 
on  a  state-by-state  basis.  This  increases  precision  and  could  allow  the  results  to  be  presented 
for  each  state  along  the  route  between  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  and  the  proposed 
geologic  repository  at  Yucca  Mountain,  if  desired. 

Radiation  doses  are  a  function  of  many  parameters,  including  vehicle  speed,  traffic  count,  dose 
rate,  packaging  dimensions,  number  in  the  truck  crew,  stop  time,  and  population  density  at 
stops.  A  list  of  the  values  for  these  and  other  parameters  and  the  sources  of  the  information  are 
provided  in  Table  6-8.

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  transportation  crew  for  spent  fuel  shipments  delivered  by 
truck  is  assumed  to  consist  of  two  drivers.  Escort  vehicles  and  drivers  were  considered,  but 
they  were  not  included  because  their  distance  from  the  shipping  cask  would  reduce  the  dose 
rates  to  levels  well  below  the  dose  rates  experienced  by  the  drivers  and  would  be  negligible 
(DOE  2002-TN1236).  Stop  times  for  refueling  and  rest  were  assumed  to  occur  at  the  rate  of 
30  minutes  per  4  hour  of  driving  time.  TRAGIS  outputs  were  used  to  determine  the  number  of 
stops.  Doses  to  the  public  at  truck  stops  have  been  significant  contributors  to  the  doses 
calculated  in  previous  RADTRAN  5.6  analyses.  For  this  analysis,  doses  to  the  public  at 
refueling  and  rest  stops  (“stop  doses”)  are  the  sum  of  the  doses  to  individuals  located  in  two 
annular  rings  centered  at  the  stopped  vehicle,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6-2.  The  inner  ring 
represents  persons  who  may  be  at  the  truck  stop  at  the  same  time  as  a  spent  fuel  shipment  and 
extends  1  to  10  m  from  the  edge  of  the  vehicle.  The  outer  ring  represents  persons  who  reside 
near  a  truck  stop  and  it  extends  from  10  to  800  m  from  the  vehicle.  This  scheme  is  similar  to 
that  used  by  Sprung  et  al.  (Sprung  et  al.  2000-TN222).  Population  densities  and  shielding 
factors  were  also  taken  from  Sprung  et  al.  (Sprung  et  al.  2000-TN222),  which  were  based  on 
the  observations  of  Griego  et  al.  (Griego  et  al.  1996-TN69). 


The  results  of  these  normal  (incident-free)  exposure  calculations  are  shown  in  Table  6-9  for  the 
PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  Population  dose  estimates  are  given  for  workers  (i.e. ,  truck 
crew  members),  onlookers  (doses  to  persons  at  stops  and  persons  on  highways  exposed  to  the 
spent  fuel  shipment),  and  persons  along  the  route  (persons  living  near  the  highway).

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


Shipping  schedules  for  spent  fuel  generated  by  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  have  not 
been  determined.  The  NRC  staff  determined  that  it  is  reasonable  to  calculate  annual  doses 
assuming  the  annual  number  of  spent  fuel  shipments  is  equivalent  to  the  annual  refueling 
requirements.  Population  doses  were  normalized  to  the  reference  LWR  in  WASH-1238 
(880  MW(e)  net)  (AEC  1972-TN22).  This  corresponds  to  a  I.IOO-MW(e)  LWR  operating  at 
80  percent  capacity. 

The  small  differences  in  transportation  impacts  among  the  PSEG  Site  and  four  alternative  sites 
evaluated  are  not  substantive,  and  the  differences  among  sites  are  relatively  minor  and  are  less 
than  the  uncertainty  in  the  analytical  results.

The  bounding  cumulative  doses  to  the  exposed  population  given  in  Table  S-4  are  as  follows: 

•  4  person-rem/reactor-year  to  transport  workers  and 

•  3  person-rem/reactor-year  to  general  public  (onlookers)  and  members  of  the  public  along 
the  route. 

The  calculated  population  doses  to  the  crew  and  onlookers  for  the  reference  LWR  and  the 
PSEG  and  alternative  site  shipments  exceed  Table  S-4  values.  A  key  reason  for  the  higher 
population  doses  relative  to  Table  S-4  is  the  longer  shipping  distances  assumed  for  this  ESP 
analysis  (i.e. ,  to  a  proposed  repository  in  Nevada)  than  the  distances  used  in  WASH-1238 
(AEC  1972-TN22).  WASH-1238  assumed  that  each  spent  fuel  shipment  would  travel  a  distance 
of  1,000  mi,  whereas  the  shipping  distances  used  in  this  EIS  were  about  2,800  mi.  If  the  shorter 
distance  were  used  to  calculate  the  impacts  for  the  PSEG  and  alternative  sites  spent  fuel 
shipments,  the  doses  would  be  reduced  by  about  60  percent.  Other  important  differences  are 
the  stop  model  described  above  and  the  additional  precision  that  results  from  incorporating 
state-specific  route  characteristics. 

Where  necessary,  the  NRC  staff  made  conservative  assumptions  to  calculate  impacts 
associated  with  the  transportation  of  spent  fuel.  Some  of  the  key  conservative  assumptions  are 
as  follows. 

•  Use  of  the  regulatory  maximum  dose  rate  (10  mrem/hour  at  2  m)  in  the  RADTRAN  5.6 

calculations.  The  shipping  casks  assumed  in  the  EIS  prepared  by  DOE  in  support  of  the 
application  for  a  geologic  repository  at  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  repository  (DOE  2002- 
TN1236)  would  transport  spent  fuel  that  has  cooled  for  a  minimum  of  5  years  (see  10  CFR 
Part  961 ,  Subpart  B  [TN300]).  Most  spent  fuel  would  have  cooled  for  much  longer  than 
5  years  before  it  is  shipped  to  a  possible  geologic  repository.  Based  on  this,  shipments  from 
the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  also  are  expected  to  be  cooled  for  longer  than  5  years. 
Consequently,  the  estimated  population  doses  in  Table  6-9  could  be  further  reduced  if  more 
realistic  dose  rate  projections  are  used. 

•  Use  of  the  shipping  cask  capacity  used  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22).  The  WASH-1238 
analyses  that  form  the  basis  for  Table  S^4  assumed  that  spent  fuel  would  be  shipped  at 
least  90  days  after  discharge  from  a  current  LWR.  The  spent  fuel  shipping  casks  described 
in  WASH-1238  were  designed  to  transport  90-day-cooled  fuel,  so  their  shielding  and 
containment  designs  must  accommodate  this  highly  radioactive  cargo.  Shipping  cask 
capacities  assumed  in  WASH-1238  were  approximately  0.5  MTU  per  truck  cask.  DOE 
(2008-TN1237)  assumed  a  10-year  cooling  period  for  spent  fuel  to  be  shipped  to  the 
repository.  This  allowed  DOE  to  increase  the  assumed  shipping  cask  capacity  to  about 

1 .8  MTU  per  truck  shipment  of  uncanistered  spent  fuel.  The  NRC  staff  believes  this  is  a 
reasonable  projection  for  future  spent  fuel  truck  shipping  cask  capacities.  If  this  assumption 
were  to  be  used  in  this  EIS,  the  number  of  shipments  of  spent  fuel  would  be  reduced  by 
about  one-third  with  a  similar  reduction  in  incident-free  radiological  impacts. 

•  Use  of  30  minutes  as  the  average  time  at  a  truck  stop  in  the  calculations.  Many  stops  made 
for  actual  spent  fuel  shipments  are  of  short  duration  (i.e.,  10  minutes)  for  brief  visual 
inspections  of  the  cargo  (e.g.,  checking  the  cask  tie-downs).  These  stops  typically  occur  in 
minimally  populated  areas,  such  as  an  overpass  or  freeway  ramp  in  an  unpopulated  area.

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


Furthermore,  empirical  data  provided  by  Griego  et  al.  (1996-TN69)  indicate  that  a  30-minute 
duration  is  toward  the  high  end  of  the  stop  time  distribution.  Average  stop  times  observed 
by  Griego  et  al.  (1996-TN69)  are  about  18  minutes.  More  realistic  stop  times  would  further 
reduce  the  population  doses  in  Table  6-9. 

A  sensitivity  study  was  performed  by  the  NRC  staff  to  demonstrate  the  effects  of  using  more 
realistic  dose  rates  and  stop  times  on  the  incident-free  population  dose  calculations.  For  this 
sensitivity  study,  the  dose  rate  was  reduced  to  5  mrem/hour,  the  approximate  50  percent 
confidence  interval  of  the  dose  rate  distribution  estimated  by  Sprung  et  al.  (2000-TN222)  for 
future  spent  fuel  shipments.  The  stop  time  was  reduced  to  18  minutes  per  stop.  All  other 
RADTRAN  5.6  input  values  were  unchanged.  The  result  is  that  the  annual  crew  doses  were 
reduced  by  about  64  percent  of  the  annual  doses  shown  in  Table  6-9.  Further,  the  annual 
doses  to  onlookers  were  reduced  by  about  76  percent  and  the  annual  doses  to  persons  along 
the  route  were  reduced  by  about  64  percent  of  the  annual  doses  shown  in  Table  6-9. 

Using  the  linear  no-threshold  dose  response  relationship  discussed  in  Section  6. 2. 1.1,  the 
annual  public  dose  impacts  for  transporting  spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  or  alternative  sites  to 
Yucca  Mountain  are  about  17  to  23  person-rem,  which  is  less  than  the  1,754  person-rem  value 
that  ICRP  (2007-TN422)  and  NCRP  (1995-TN728)  suggest  would  most  likely  result  in  no 
excess  health  effects.  This  dose  is  very  small  compared  to  the  estimated  300,000  person-rem 
that  the  same  population  along  the  route  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Yucca  Mountain  would  incur 
annually  from  exposure  to  natural  sources  of  radiation.  The  estimated  population  dose  along 
the  PSEG-to-Yucca-Mountain  route  from  natural  background  radiation  is  different  from  the 
natural  background  dose  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  for  unirradiated  fuel  shipments  in 
Section  6. 2. 1.1  because  the  route  characteristics  are  different.  A  generic  route  and  actual 
highway  routes  were  used  in  Section  6. 2. 1.1  for  unirradiated  fuel  shipments  and  actual  highway 
routes  were  used  in  this  section  for  spent  fuel  shipments. 

Dose  estimates  to  the  MEI  from  transport  of  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  wastes  under 
normal  conditions  are  presented  in  Section  6.2.1. 1. 

6. 2. 2. 2  Radiological  Impacts  of  Accidents 

As  discussed  previously,  the  NRC  staff  used  the  RADTRAN  5.6  computer  code  to  estimate  the 
impacts  of  transportation  accidents  involving  spent  fuel  shipments.  RADTRAN  5.6  considers  a 
spectrum  of  postulated  transportation  accidents,  ranging  from  those  with  high  frequencies  and 
low  consequences  (e.g.,  “fender  benders”)  to  those  with  low  frequencies  and  high 
consequences  (i.e.,  accidents  in  which  the  shipping  container  is  exposed  to  severe  mechanical 
and  thermal  conditions). 

Radionuclide  inventories  are  important  parameters  in  the  calculation  of  accident  risks.  The 
radionuclide  inventories  used  in  this  analysis  were  from  the  PSEG  ER  and  RAI  responses 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465;  PSEG  2013-TN2463).  The  spent  fuel  inventories 
used  in  the  NRC  staff  analysis  are  listed  in  Table  6-10.

Robust  shipping  casks  are  used  to  transport  spent  fuel  because  of  the  radiation  shielding  and 
accident  resistance  required  by  10  CFR  Part  71  (TN301 ).  Spent  fuel  shipping  casks  must  be 
certified  Type  B  packaging  systems,  meaning  they  must  withstand  a  series  of  severe  postulated 
accident  conditions  with  essentially  no  loss  of  containment  or  shielding  capability.  These  casks

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


also  are  designed  with  fissile  material  controls  to  ensure  that  the  spent  fuel  remains  subcritical 
under  normal  and  accident  conditions.  According  to  Sprung  et  al.  (2000-TN222),  the  probability 
of  encountering  accident  conditions  that  would  lead  to  shipping  cask  failure  is  less  than 
0.01  percent  (i.e.,  more  than  99.99  percent  of  all  accidents  would  result  in  no  release  of 
radioactive  material  from  the  shipping  cask).  The  NRC  staff  assumed  that  shipping  casks 
approved  for  transportation  of  ABWR.  API 000,  U.S.  EPR.  and  US-APWR  reactor  spent  fuel 
would  provide  equivalent  mechanical  and  thermal  protection  of  the  spent  fuel  cargo. 

Accident  frequencies  are  calculated  in  RADTRAN  5.6  using  user-specified  accident  rates  and 
conditional  shipping  cask  failure  probabilities.  State-specific  accident  rates  were  taken  from 
Saricks  and  Tompkins  (1999-TN81)  and  used  in  the  RADTRAN  5.6  calculations.  The 
state-specific  accident  rates  were  then  adjusted  to  account  for  underreporting,  as  described  in 
Section  6.2.1 .3.  Conditional  shipping  cask  failure  probabilities  (i.e.,  the  probability  of  cask 
failure  as  a  function  of  the  mechanical  and  thermal  conditions  applied  in  an  accident)  were 
taken  from  Sprung  et  al  (2000-TN222). 

The  RADTRAN  5.6  accident  risk  calculations  were  performed  using  the  radionuclide  inventories 
(curie  per  metric  ton  uranium,  or  Ci/MTU)  in  Table  6-10  multiplied  by  the  shipping  cask  capacity 
(0.5  MTU).  The  resulting  risk  estimates  were  then  multiplied  by  assumed  annual  spent  fuel 
shipments  (shipments/year)  to  derive  estimates  of  the  annual  accident  risks  associated  with 
spent  fuel  shipments  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  to  the  proposed  repository  at 
Yucca  Mountain  in  Nevada.  As  was  done  for  routine  exposures,  the  NRC  staff  assumed  that 
the  numbers  of  shipments  of  spent  fuel  per  year  are  equivalent  to  the  annual  discharge 
quantities. 

For  this  assessment,  release  fractions  for  current-generation  LWR  fuel  designs 
(Sprung  et  al.  2000-TN222)  were  used  to  approximate  the  impacts  from  the  ABWR.  API  000, 
U.S.  EPR.  and  US-APWR  reactor  spent  fuel  shipments.  This  assumes  that  the  fuel  materials 
and  containment  systems  (i.e..  cladding  and  fuel  coatings)  behave  similarly  to  current  LWR  fuel 
under  applied  mechanical  and  thermal  conditions. 

The  NRC  staff  used  RADTRAN  5.6  to  calculate  the  population  dose  from  the  released 
radioactive  material  from  four  of  five  possible  exposure  pathways. 1  These  pathways  are  as 
follows. 

•  External  dose  from  exposure  to  the  passing  cloud  of  radioactive  material  (cloudshine). 

•  External  dose  from  the  radionuclides  deposited  on  the  ground  by  the  passing  plume 
(groundshine).  The  NRC  staff s  analysis  included  the  radiation  exposure  from  this  pathway 
even  though  the  area  surrounding  a  potential  accidental  release  would  be  evacuated  and 
decontaminated,  thus  preventing  long-term  exposures  from  this  pathway. 

•  Internal  dose  from  inhalation  of  airborne  radioactive  contaminants  (inhalation). 


(1)  Internal  dose  from  ingestion  of  contaminated  food  was  not  considered  because  the  NRC  staff 

assumed  evacuation  and  subsequent  interdiction  of  foodstuffs  following  a  postulated  transportation 
accident.

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


•  Internal  dose  from  resuspension  of  radioactive  materials  that  were  deposited  on  the  ground 
(resuspension).  The  NRC  staffs  analysis  included  the  radiation  exposures  from  this 
pathway  even  though  evacuation  and  decontamination  of  the  area  surrounding  a  potential 
accidental  release  would  prevent  long-term  exposures. 

Table  6-1 1  presents  the  environmental  consequences  of  transportation  accidents  when  shipping 
spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  to  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  repository. 
The  shipping  distances  and  population  distribution  information  for  the  routes  were  the  same  as 
those  used  for  the  normal  “incident-free”  conditions  (see  Section  6.2.2. 1).  The  results  are 
normalized  to  the  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22)  reference  reactor  (880-MW(e))  net  electrical 
generation,  1,100-MW(e)  reactor  operating  at  80  percent  capacity)  to  provide  a  common  basis 
for  comparison  to  the  impacts  listed  in  Table  S-4.  Note  that  the  impacts  for  all  site  alternatives 
are  less  than  the  reference  LWR  impacts.  Although  there  are  slight  differences  in  impacts 
among  alternative  sites,  none  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  clearly  favored  over  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  transportation  accident  impact  analysis  conducted  by  PSEG  and  RAI  responses 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465;  PSEG  2013-TN2463)  used  methods  and  data  that 
are  similar  to  those  used  in  this  EIS.  Differences  are  insignificant  in  terms  of  the  overall  results. 

Using  the  linear  no-threshold  dose  response  relationship  discussed  in  Section  6. 2. 1.1,  the 
annual  collective  public  dose  estimate  for  transporting  spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  and  alternative 
sites  to  Yucca  Mountain  is  less  than  2*10^  person-rem,  which  is  less  than  the 
1,754  person-rem  value  that  the  ICRP  (2007-TN422)  and  NCRP  (1995-TN728)  suggest  would 
most  likely  result  in  zero  excess  health  effects.  The  collective  population  dose  from  natural 
background  radiation  to  the  population  along  the  representative  routes  from  the  PSEG  and 
alternative  sites  to  Yucca  Mountain  would  be  about  300,000  person-rem.  Therefore,  the 
radiation  doses  from  transporting  spent  fuel  to  Yucca  Mountain  are  minimal  compared  to  the 
collective  population  dose  to  the  same  population  from  exposure  to  natural  sources  of  radiation. 

6. 2. 2. 3  Nonradiological  Impact  of  Spent  Fuel  Shipments 

The  general  approach  used  to  calculate  the  nonradiological  impacts  of  spent  fuel  shipments  is 
the  same  as  that  used  for  unirradiated  fuel  shipments.  State-by-state  shipping  distances  were 
obtained  from  the  TRAGIS  output  file  and  combined  with  the  annual  number  of  shipments  and 
accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  by  state  from  Saricks  and  Tompkins  (1999-TN81)  to  calculate 
nonradiological  impacts.  In  addition,  the  accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  from  Saricks  and 
Tompkins  (1999-TN81 )  were  adjusted  to  account  for  underreporting  (see  Section  6.2.1 .3).  The 
results  are  shown  in  Table  6-12  for  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactors. 
Overall,  the  impacts  are  minimal  and  there  are  no  substantive  differences  among  the  alternative 
sites.  In  addition,  the  NRC  staff  verified  PSEG’s  analysis  in  the  ER  and  RAI  responses 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  by  performing  independent  impact  calculations.  No  significant 
differences  were  identified.

6.2.3  Transportation  of  Radioactive  Waste 

This  section  discusses  the  environmental  effects  of  transporting  radioactive  waste  other  than 
spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites.  The  environmental  conditions  listed  in 
1 0  CFR  51 .52  (TN250)  that  apply  to  shipments  of  radioactive  waste  are  as  follows. 

•  Radioactive  waste  (except  spent  fuel)  would  be  packaged  and  in  solid  form. 

•  Radioactive  waste  (except  spent  fuel)  would  be  shipped  from  the  reactor  by  truck  or  railcar. 

•  The  weight  limitation  of  33,100  kg  (73,000  lb)  per  truck  and  90.7  MT  (100  T)  per  cask  per 
railcar  would  be  met. 


NUREG-2168

Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


•  Traffic  density  would  be  less  than  the  condition  of  one  truck  shipment  per  day  or  three 
railcars  per  month. 

Radioactive  waste  other  than  spent  fuel  from  ABWR.  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR 
reactors  is  expected  to  be  capable  of  being  shipped  in  compliance  with  Federal  or  State  weight 
restrictions.  Table  6-13  presents  estimates  of  annual  waste  volumes  and  annual  waste 
shipment  numbers  for  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and  US-APWR  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site 
normalized  to  the  reference  1,100-MW(e)  LWR  defined  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22).  The 
expected  annual  waste  volumes  and  waste  shipments  for  the  ABWR,  API  000,  and  U.S.  EPR 
reactors  were  less  than  the  1 ,100-MW(e)  reference  reactor  that  was  the  basis  for  Table  S— 4. 

The  projected  waste-generation  rates  for  the  US-APWR  reactor  (15,280  ft3  per  year  is  the 
estimated  rate  given  by  PSEG  2015-TN4280)  could  exceed  the  reference  LWR 
waste-generation  rate.  However,  projections  of  the  rate  of  waste  generation  and  the  number  of 
shipments  are  uncertain  and  are  a  function  of  PSEG's  radioactive  waste-management 
practices.  For  example,  if  all  of  the  dry  active  waste  from  the  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  and 
US-APWR  were  to  be  shipped  in  standard  20-ft  Sealand  containers  holding  28.32  m3  of  waste, 
the  number  of  normalized  annual  shipments  would  range  from  6.7  for  the  API  000  to  1 5.5  for  the 
ABWR,  compared  to  46  for  the  reference  LWR.  Therefore,  waste-generation  rates  and  the 
number  of  shipments  for  the  proposed  PSEG  reactors  are  anticipated  to  be  lower  than  values 
shown  in  Table  6-13. 

The  sum  of  the  daily  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  radioactive  waste  is  well 
below  the  one-truck-shipment-per-day  condition  given  in  10  CFR  51.52  (TN250),  Table  S-4,  for 
a  ABWR,  API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  or  US-APWR  reactor  located  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative 
sites.  Doubling  the  shipment  estimates  to  account  for  empty  return  shipments  of  fuel  and  waste 
is  included  in  the  results. 

Dose  estimates  to  the  MEI  from  transport  of  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  waste  under 
normal  conditions  are  presented  in  Section  6. 2. 1.1. 

The  nonradiological  impacts  of  radioactive  waste  shipments  (see  Table  6-14)  were  calculated 
using  the  same  general  approach  used  for  unirradiated  and  spent  fuel  shipments.  For  this  EIS, 
the  shipping  distance  was  assumed  to  be  500  mi  one  way  for  the  reference  LWR  (AEC  1972- 
TN22).  Distances  from  the  PSEG  and  alternative  sites  to  the  Barnwell,  South  Carolina  waste 
disposal  site  are  also  listed  in  Table  6-14.  Accident,  injury,  and  fatality  rates  were  used  in  the 
calculations  (Saricks  and  Tompkins  1 999-TN81 ).  These  rates  were  adjusted  to  account  for 
underreporting,  as  described  in  Section  6. 2. 1.3.  The  results  are  presented  in  Table  6-14.  As 
shown,  the  calculated  nonradiological  impacts  for  transportation  of  radioactive  waste  other  than 
spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  to  the  Barnwell  waste  disposal  facility  are 
greater  than  the  impacts  calculated  for  the  reference  LWR  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22), 
principally  because  of  the  greater  distances  to  the  Barnwell  LLW  disposal  facility  and  the 
number  of  shipments  for  the  US-APWR.  Also,  the  waste-generation  rates  and  number  of 
shipments  for  the  proposed  PSEG  reactors  are  anticipated  to  be  lower  than  values  shown  in 
Table  6-13,  and  impacts  would  also  be  less  than  the  reference  LWR  (AEC  1972-TN22).  In 
addition,  the  NRC  staff  verified  PSEG’s  analysis  in  the  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280)  by  performing 
independent  impact  calculations.  Slight  differences  were  identified,  but  the  differences  in  the 
estimates  of  the  nonradiological  impacts  were  not  significant.

(b)  The  number  of  shipments  per  1 ,100  MW(e)  was  calculated  assuming  the  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22) 
average  waste  shipment  capacity  of  2.34  m3  (82.6  ft3  per  shipment  [108  m3/yr  divided  by  46  shipments/yr])  for 
spent  resin,  evaporator  concentrates,  filters,  sludges,  dry  active  waste,  etc.  (PSEG  2013-TN2463). 

(c)  The  values  in  parentheses  represent  the  number  of  shipments  based  on  using  Sealand  containers  (28.32  m3

(a)  Normalized  shipments  taken  from  PSEG  2013-TN2463;  accidents,  injuries,  and  fatalities  per  shipment  taken 
from  Appendix  7A.  PSEG  2015-TN4280;  scaling  factors  for  alternative  sites  taken  PSEG  2012-TN2465. 


6.2.4  Conclusions  for  Transportation 

The  NRC  staff  performed  an  independent  confirmatory  analysis  of  the  impacts  under  normal 
operating  and  accident  conditions  of  transporting  fuel  and  wastes  to  and  from  an  ABWR, 

API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  or  US-APWR  reactor  to  be  located  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Four  alternative  sites 
also  were  evaluated,  including  one  site  in  Hunterdon  County,  two  sites  in  Salem  County,  and 
one  site  in  Cumberland  County  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2012-TN2465).  To  make 
comparisons  to  Table  S-4,  the  environmental  impacts  were  adjusted  (i.e.,  normalized)  to  the 
environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  reference  LWR  in  WASH-1238  (AEC  1972-TN22)  by 
multiplying  the  ABWR,  API 000,  U.S.  EPR,  or  US-APWR  reactor  impact  estimates  by  the  ratio 
of  the  total  electric  output  for  the  reference  reactor  to  the  electric  output  of  the  proposed 
reactors. 

Because  of  the  conservative  approaches  and  data  used  to  calculate  impacts,  the  NRC  staff 
does  not  expect  the  actual  environmental  effects  to  exceed  those  calculated  in  this  EIS.  Thus, 
the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  transportation  of  fuel  and 
radioactive  wastes  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  alternative  sites  would  be  SMALL,  and  would 
be  consistent  with  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  transportation  of  fuel  and 
radioactive  wastes  to  and  from  current-generation  reactors  presented  in  Table  S-4  of 
10  CFR  51.52  (TN250). 

The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  transportation  impacts  are  roughly  proportional  to  the  distance 
from  the  reactor  site  to  the  repository  site,  in  this  case  New  Jersey  to  Nevada.  The  distance 
from  the  PSEG  Site  or  any  of  the  alternative  sites  to  any  new  planned  repository  in  the 
contiguous  United  States  would  be  no  more  than  double  the  distance  from  the  PSEG  Site  or 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


alternative  sites  to  Yucca  Mountain.  Doubling  the  environmental  impact  estimates  from  the 
transportation  of  spent  reactor  fuel,  as  presented  in  this  section,  would  provide  a  reasonable 
bounding  estimate  of  the  impacts  to  meet  the  needs  of  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ). 
The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  these  doubled  estimates  would  not 
be  significant  and,  therefore,  would  still  be  SMALL. 

6.3  Decommissioning  Impacts 

At  the  end  of  the  operating  life  of  a  power  reactor,  NRC  regulations  require  that  the  facility 
undergo  decommissioning.  The  NRC  defines  decommissioning  as  the  safe  removal  of  a  facility 
from  service  and  the  reduction  of  residual  radioactivity  to  a  level  that  permits  termination  of  the 
NRC  license.  The  regulations  governing  decommissioning  of  power  reactors  are  found  in 
10  CFR  50.75  (TN249)  and  10  CFR  50.82  (TN249).  The  radiological  criteria  for  termination  of 
the  NRC  license  are  in  10  CFR  Part  20  (TN283),  Subpart  E.  Minimization  of  contamination  and 
generation  of  radioactive  waste  requirements  for  facility  design  and  procedures  for  operation  are 
addressed  in  10  CFR  20.1406  (TN283). 

Environmental  impacts  from  the  activities  associated  with  the  decommissioning  of  any  reactor 
before  or  at  the  end  of  an  initial  or  renewed  license  are  evaluated  in  the  Generic  Environmental 
Impact  Statement  for  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Facilities:  Supplement  1,  Regarding  the 
Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Power  Reactors  (GEIS-DECOM),  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1 
(NRC  2002-TN665).  If  an  applicant  for  a  construction  permit  or  COL  referencing  the  PSEG  ESP 
applies  for  a  license  to  construct  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  there  is  a 
requirement  to  provide  a  report  containing  a  certification  that  financial  assurance  for  radiological 
decommissioning  would  be  provided.  At  the  time  an  application  is  submitted,  the  requirements 
in  10  CFR  50.33  (TN249),  10  CFR  50.75  (TN249),  and  10  CFR  52.77  (TN251)  (and  any  other 
applicable  requirements)  would  have  to  be  met. 

At  the  ESP  stage,  applicants  are  not  required  to  submit  information  regarding  the  process  of 
decommissioning,  such  as  the  method  chosen  for  decommissioning,  the  schedule,  or  any  other 
aspect  of  planning  for  decommissioning.  However,  PSEG  did  provide  information  in  ER 
Section  5.9  concerning  the  environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  based  on  NUREG- 
0586,  Supplement  1 ,  and  a  2004  DOE  report  focused  on  decommissioning  costs  for  advanced 
reactors,  and  concluded  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  discussed  in 
NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1  (NRC  2002-TN665),  would  be  the  same  as  those  for  advanced 
reactor  designs  included  in  the  PSEG  ER  (API  000,  U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  US-APWR) 

(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  NRC  staff’s  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of 
decommissioning  presented  in  the  GEIS-DECOM  identifies  a  range  of  impacts  for  each 
environmental  issue  for  a  range  of  different  reactor  designs.  The  staff  has  no  reason  to  believe 
that  the  impacts  discussed  in  the  GEIS-DECOM  are  not  bounding  for  reactors  deployed  after 
2002. 

The  GEIS-DECOM  does  not  specifically  address  the  GHG  footprint  of  decommissioning 
activities.  However,  it  does  list  the  decommissioning  activities  and  states  that  the 
decommissioning  workforce  would  be  expected  to  be  smaller  than  the  operational  workforce, 
and  that  the  decontamination  and  demolition  activities  could  take  up  to  10  years  to  complete. 
Finally,  it  discusses  Safe  Storage  (also  called  the  SAFSTOR  decommissioning  option),  in  which 


NUREG-2168 


6-44 


November  2015 


Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 


decontamination  and  dismantlement  are  delayed  for  a  number  of  years.  Given  this  information, 
the  NRC  staff  estimated  the  GHG  footprint  of  decommissioning  to  be  on  the  order  of  81 ,000-MT 
C02e  without  SAFSTOR.  The  contributions  to  this  footprint  are  about  one-third  from 
decommissioning  workforce  transportation  and  two-thirds  from  equipment  usage.  The  details  of 
the  NRC  staffs  estimate  are  presented  in  Appendix  K.  A  40-year  SAFSTOR  period  would 
increase  the  GHG  footprint  of  decommissioning  by  about  40  percent.  These  GHG  footprints  are 
roughly  three  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  the  GHG  footprint  presented  in  Section  6.1.3  for 
the  uranium  fuel  cycle. 

Therefore,  the  staff  relies  upon  the  bases  established  in  GEIS-DECOM  and  concludes  the 
following. 

1 .  Doses  to  the  public  would  be  well  below  applicable  regulatory  standards  regardless  of  which 
decommissioning  method  considered  in  GEIS-DECOM  is  used. 

2.  Occupational  doses  would  be  well  below  applicable  regulatory  standards  during  the  license 
term. 

3.  The  quantities  of  Class  C  or  greater  than  Class  C  wastes  generated  would  be  comparable  to 
or  less  than  the  amounts  of  solid  waste  generated  by  reactors  licensed  before  2002. 

4.  Air-quality  impacts  of  decommissioning  are  expected  to  be  negligible  at  the  end  of  the 
operating  term. 

5.  Measures  are  readily  available  to  avoid  potential  significant  water  quality  impacts  from 
erosion  or  spills.  The  liquid  radioactive  waste  system  design  includes  features  to  limit 
release  of  radioactive  material  to  the  environment,  such  as  pipe  chases  and  tank  collection 
basins.  These  features  will  minimize  the  amount  of  radioactive  material  in  spills  and  leakage 
that  would  have  to  be  addressed  at  decommissioning. 

6.  The  ecological  impacts  of  decommissioning  are  expected  to  be  negligible. 

7.  The  socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  short-term  and  could  be  offset  by  decreases  in 
population  and  economic  diversification. 

For  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  at  any  of  the  four  alternative  sites,  the 
impacts  from  decommissioning  are  expected  to  be  within  the  bounds  described  in 
NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1  (NRC  2002-TN665).  Based  on  the  GEIS-DECOM  and  the 
evaluation  of  air-quality  impacts  from  GHG  emissions  above,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that,  as 
long  as  the  regulatory  requirements  on  decommissioning  activities  to  limit  the  impacts  of 
decommissioning  are  met,  the  decommissioning  activities  would  result  in  a  SMALL  impact.

7.0  CUMULATIVE  IMPACTS 


The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  regulations  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal 
Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51  (TN250)  implementing  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of 
1 969,  as  amended  (NEPA,  42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ),  require  the  NRC  to  consider  the 
cumulative  impacts  of  proposals  under  its  review  (10  CFR  51.71(d)  [TN250]).  Cumulative 
impacts  may  result  when  the  environmental  effects  associated  with  the  proposed  action  are 
overlaid  or  added  to  temporary  or  permanent  effects  associated  with  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects.  Cumulative  impacts  can  result  from  individually  minor, 
but  collectively  significant,  actions  taking  place  over  a  period  of  time. 

PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  submitted  an  application  for  an  early  site 
permit  (ESP),  which  was  accompanied  by  an  Environmental  Report  (ER)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280) 
that  included  consideration  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  that  might  be  constructed  and 
operated  at  the  PSEG  Site.  When  evaluating  the  potential  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  NRC  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 
(USACE)  (collectively,  the  review  team)  considered  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  resources 
that  could  be  affected  by  the  construction,  preconstruction,  operation,  and  decommissioning  of  a 
new  plant. 

Cumulative  impacts  result  when  the  effects  of  an  action  are  added  to  or  interact  with  other  past, 
present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  effects  on  the  same  resources.  For  purposes  of  this 
analysis,  past  actions  are  those  prior  to  the  receipt  of  the  ESP  application.  Present  actions  are 
those  related  to  resources  from  the  time  of  the  ESP  application  until  the  issuance  of  an  ESP. 
Future  actions  include  those  that  are  reasonably  foreseeable  through  the  building  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  as  would  occur  under  a  subsequent  NRC-authorized  construction  permit 
(CP)  or  combined  license  (COL),  operation  of  a  new  plant,  and  its  decommissioning.  The 
geographic  area  over  which  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  could 
contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  is  dependent  on  the  type  of  resource  considered  and  is 
described  below  for  each  resource  area.  The  review  team  considered,  among  other  things,  the 
cumulative  effects  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  with  current  operations  of  the  existing  units  at 
the  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS). 

The  impacts  of  the  proposed  action,  as  described  in  Chapters  4  and  5,  are  combined  with  other 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  in  the  general  area  surrounding  the 
PSEG  Site  that  would  affect  the  same  resources  impacted  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
regardless  of  what  agency  (Federal  or  non-Federal)  or  person  undertakes  such  actions.  These 
combined  impacts  are  defined  as  “cumulative”  in  40  CFR  1508.7  (TN428)  and  include 
individually  minor  but  collectively  potentially  significant  actions  taking  place  over  a  period  of 
time.  It  is  possible  that  an  impact  that  may  be  SMALL  by  itself  could  result  in  a  MODERATE  or 
LARGE  cumulative  impact  when  considered  in  combination  with  the  impacts  of  other  actions  on 
the  affected  resource.  Likewise,  if  a  resource  is  regionally  declining  or  imperiled,  even  a  SMALL 
individual  impact  could  be  important  if  it  contributes  to  or  accelerates  the  overall  resource 
decline.

Cumulative  Impacts 


The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Chapter  2  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  analysis,  including  the  effects  of  past  actions.  The  incremental  impacts 
related  to  the  activities  requiring  NRC  or  USACE  authorization  are  described  and  characterized 
in  Chapter  4,  and  those  related  to  operations  are  described  and  characterized  in  Chapter  5. 
These  impacts  are  summarized  for  each  resource  area  in  the  sections  that  follow.  The  level  of 
detail  is  commensurate  with  the  significance  of  the  impact  for  each  resource  area. 

This  chapter  includes  an  overall  cumulative  impact  assessment  for  each  resource  area.  The 
NRC  staff  performed  the  cumulative  impact  analysis  according  to  guidance  provided  in  Interim 
Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental  Issues  Associated  with  New  Reactors  (NRC  2014-TN3767). 
The  specific  resources  and  components  that  could  be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  the 
proposed  action  and  other  actions  in  the  same  geographic  area  were  assessed.  This 
assessment  includes  the  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  as 
described  in  Chapters  4  and  5;  impacts  of  preconstruction  activities  as  described  in  Chapter  4; 
impacts  of  fuel  cycle,  transportation,  and  decommissioning  as  described  in  Chapter  6;  and 
impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  Federal,  non-Federal,  and  private 
actions  that  could  affect  the  same  resources  affected  by  the  proposed  actions. 

The  review  team  visited  the  PSEG  Site  in  May  2012  (NRC  2012-TN2498).  The  team  then  used 
the  information  provided  in  the  ER,  PSEG’s  responses  to  Requests  for  Additional  Information 
issued  by  the  NRC  and  USACE  staff,  information  from  other  Federal  and  State  agencies,  and 
information  gathered  at  the  PSEG  Site  visit  to  evaluate  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  To  inform  the  cumulative  impacts 
analysis,  PSEG  conducted  a  search  to  identify  other  relevant  projects  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site  (PSEG  2012-TN2214).  The  search  included  information  available  through  regional 
economic  development  agencies  in  the  states  of  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  U.S.  Environmental 
Protection  Agency  (EPA)  databases  for  relevant  environmental  impact  statements  (EISs)  within 
the  state,  the  USACE  Philadelphia  District  website  for  recent  permit  applications,  township  and 
county  planning  websites,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Transportation  website,  and  the 
Delaware  Department  of  Transportation  website.  Information  was  also  sought  to  identify 
projects  in  the  geographic  area  funded  by  the  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  of 
2009  (Public  Law  1 11-5,  26  USC  1-TN1250).  The  review  team  developed  Table  7-1 ,  which 
shows  the  major  projects  near  the  PSEG  Site  that  were  considered  relevant  in  the  analysis  of 
cumulative  impacts.  The  review  team  used  this  information  to  perform  an  independent 
evaluation  of  the  direct  and  cumulative  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  PSEG  Site.

7.1  Land  Use 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.2  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impact  assessment  for  land  use.  As  described  in  Section  4.1,  the  NRC  staff 
concludes  the  impacts  of  NRC-authorized  construction  on  land  use  would  be  MODERATE 
because  power  block  construction  would  occur  on  the  85-ac  parcel  that  PSEG  would  acquire 
from  the  USACE,  resulting  in  the  loss  to  the  USACE  of  some  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  at 
the  Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF).  The  combined  impacts  from  construction 
and  preconstruction  also  are  described  in  Section  4.1  and  have  been  determined  by  the  review 
team  to  be  MODERATE  for  both  the  PSEG  Site  (because  of  the  loss  to  the  USACE  of  85  ac  of 
dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity)  and  the  proposed  causeway  corridor  (because  of  the  permanent 
change  in  land  use  of  45.5  ac  from  wetlands  to  developed  lands  within  areas  protected  by  the 
State  of  New  Jersey  under  Deeds  of  Conservation  Restriction).  As  described  in  Section  5.1,  the 
review  team  concludes  the  impacts  of  operations  on  land  use  would  be  SMALL. 

This  section  describes  the  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  impact  land  use  in  conjunction  with  the  impacts  described 
in  Sections  4.1  and  5. 1 .  For  this  cumulative  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  includes 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (in  which  the  PSEG  Site  is  located)  and  the  other  24  counties 
located  in  the  50-mi  region  around  the  PSEG  Site.  The  50-mi  region  includes  counties  in  New 
Jersey,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland.  The  direct  and  indirect  impacts  to  land  use  of 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway 
would  be  confined  to  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  when 
combined  with  other  actions  (discussed  below)  would  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey, 
Delaware,  Maryland,  and  Pennsylvania. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.2.1,  the  6-mi  vicinity  encompassing  the  PSEG  Site  is  dominated  by 
three  major  land  cover  types:  open  water  (primarily  the  Delaware  River)  (36  percent),  wetlands 
(35  percent),  and  agriculture  (23  percent).  Historically,  land  uses  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  have 
reflected  these  land  cover  types,  with  shipping  and  fishing  the  most  prevalent  uses  of  open 
water;  hunting,  fishing,  trapping,  wildlife  management,  and  dredge  spoil  disposal  the  most 
prevalent  uses  of  wetlands;  and  salt  hay  production  and  livestock  grazing  the  most  prevalent 
uses  of  agricultural  lands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Cumulative  Impacts 


The  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  is  dominated  by  four  major  land  cover  types: 
agriculture  (37  percent);  forests  (24  percent);  open  water,  including  both  the  Delaware  River  and 
the  Chesapeake  Bay  (16  percent);  and  developed  lands,  including  the  corridor  of  urban 
development  from  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  south  to  Baltimore,  Maryland  (13  percent). 
Historically,  land  uses  in  the  region  have  reflected  these  land  cover  types,  with  a  wide  variety  of 
cultivated  crop,  livestock  production,  and  hay  production  on  agricultural  lands;  logging,  forest 
management,  and  wildlife  management  on  the  forest  lands;  shipping,  fishing,  and  trapping  on 
the  open  water;  and  a  wide  variety  of  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  uses  on  the 
developed  lands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Table  7-1  lists  projects  that,  in  combination  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway,  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  in 
the  region.  The  project  closest  to  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  the  proposed  causeway 
would  be  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  on  the  PSEG  Site.  In  201 1 ,  the  NRC 
issued  new  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Unit  1  (expires  2036),  SGS  Unit  2  (expires  2040),  and 
HCGS  (expires  2046)  (NRC  201 1-TN3131).  The  cumulative  land-use  impact  on  the  PSEG  Site 
would  result  from  the  combined  commitment  of  land  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  with  the 
land  already  dedicated  to  SGS  and  HCGS.  With  the  acquisition  of  85  ac  from  the  USACE,  the 
PSEG  Site  would  total  819  ac,  of  which  373  ac  would  be  occupied  by  existing  facilities  at  SGS 
and  HCGS  and  225  ac  would  be  occupied  by  facilities  at  the  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Thus, 
73.0  percent  of  the  total  PSEG  Site  (598  of  81 9  ac)  would  be  occupied  by  SGS,  HCGS,  the  new 
nuclear  power  plant,  and  their  associated  facilities.  Although  this  would  represent  a  relatively 
large  land-use  impact  on  Artificial  Island  and  the  immediate  vicinity,  the  cumulative  impact  to 
land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  would  be  relatively  minor. 

A  second  proposed  project  that  could  occur  in  close  proximity  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on 
the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  is  the  USACE  Delaware  River  Main  Channel 
Deepening  Project  in  the  Delaware  River.  In  this  project,  the  USACE  would  conduct  dredging 
operations  to  deepen  a  section  of  the  Delaware  River,  including  the  portion  of  the  river  adjacent 
to  the  PSEG  Site  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  The  primary  land-use  impact  of  this  deepening 
project  would  be  the  use  by  the  USACE  of  some  existing  CDFs  along  the  Delaware  River  for  the 
disposal  of  dredge  materials.  The  total  dredging  operation  would  generate  an  estimated 
1 6  million  yd3  of  spoil  material,  some  of  which  (about  2  million  yd3)  would  be  disposed  of  at  the 
Reedy  Point  South  CDF  and  Artificial  Island  CDF.  The  NEPA  documentation  for  the  channel 
deepening  project  (USACE  201 1-TN2262)  concludes  there  would  be  no  significant  land-use 
impacts  from  the  project. 

The  cumulative  land-use  impact  of  developing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and 
the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  would  result  from  the  combined 
commitment  of  (1 )  land  for  the  new  power  plant  and  the  proposed  causeway,  (2)  lands  already 
dedicated  to  the  existing  USACE  CDFs,  and  (3)  any  new  land  the  USACE  would  develop  as  a 
CDF  to  replace  the  85  ac  of  dredge  spoil  capacity  lost  at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  in  the  land 
exchange  with  PSEG.  The  cumulative  impact  would  be  reduced  if  the  USACE  replaces  the 
85  ac  of  dredge  spoil  capacity  by  using  one  of  its  existing  CDFs  in  the  region.  However,  if  the 
USACE  must  develop  a  new  CDF  to  replace  the  85  ac  of  dredge  spoil  capacity,  the  cumulative 
impact  would  be  larger  than  if  an  existing  CDF  is  used.  To  facilitate  its  proposed  land  exchange 
with  the  USACE,  PSEG  identified  three  potential  sites  for  replacing  the  85  ac  of  dredge  spoil

capacity  (PSEG  2012-TN2282),  and  the  USACE  would  conduct  a  separate  assessment  of  the 
environmental  impacts  of  replacing  the  85  ac  of  capacity.  Although  developing  and  using  a  new 
or  existing  CDF  could  have  noticeable  land-use  impacts  at  the  site  of  the  CDF  and  in  the 
vicinity,  the  cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site,  the 
proposed  causeway,  and  the  USACE  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  would 
be  minor  in  the  context  of  land  use  within  the  50-mi  region. 

PJM  Interconnection,  LLC,  (PJM)  is  the  regional  transmission  organization  that  coordinates  the 
movement  of  wholesale  electricity  in  the  region  of  interest  (ROI).  PJM  began  accepting 
proposals  for  solutions  to  resolve  grid  stability  issues  in  the  region  of  Artificial  Island  where 
HCGS  and  SGS  are  located.  Solutions  include  the  construction  of  a  new  line  that  could  extend 
from  Pennsylvania  to  Artificial  Island. 

To  bound  the  potential  impacts  of  an  offsite  transmission  line  corridor,  PSEG  performed  a 
geographic  information  system  (GIS)  analysis  using  a  5-mi  wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the 
western  macro-corridor  (WMC)  and  assumed  a  transmission  line  right-of-way  (ROW)  width  of 
200  ft.  However,  the  PSEG  analysis  does  not  identify  a  specific  200-ft-wide  ROW  within  the 
WMC,  but  calculates  the  amount  of  each  land-use  type  that  would  be  affected  in  a  200-ft-wide 
ROW  based  on  each  land-use  type  as  a  percentage  of  total  land  use  within  the  WMC. 

Table  7-2  lists  the  results  of  this  analysis  for  the  portions  of  the  WMC  located  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  and  the  50-mi  region  of  the  PSEG  Site.

According  to  the  PSEG  analysis,  most  of  the  land-use  impacts  of  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  would  occur  on  agricultural  lands  and  forested  lands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PJM  has

not  selected  a  specific  route  for  the  potential  new  transmission  line.  However,  based  on  the 
analysis  performed  by  PSEG  and  the  potential  land  uses  that  could  be  affected,  a  new 
transmission  line  could  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  land  uses  within  the  region. 

Most  of  the  other  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  are  not  expected  to  create  noticeable  cumulative 
impacts  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  when  combined  with  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway.  The  new 
development/redevelopment  projects  listed  (Camp  Pedricktown  Redevelopment,  Agricultural 
Products  Business  Park,  and  Gateway  Business  Park)  are  all  too  far  from  the  PSEG  Site  and 
from  each  other  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.  The  parks  and 
recreation  activities  listed  (Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  restoration  and 
management  of  existing  parks  in  the  50-mi  region)  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  adverse 
land-use  impacts,  especially  on  the  regional  scale.  The  future  urbanization  activities  listed 
would  contribute  to  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region  but  are  too  speculative  and 
undefined  for  the  review  team  to  reach  a  conclusion  regarding  the  magnitude  of  their  impacts. 

The  report  Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472), 
prepared  for  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program,  summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of 
future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report  divides  the  United  States  into  nine 
regions,  and  the  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  report  indicates  climate 
change  could  increase  precipitation,  sea  level,  and  storm  surges  in  the  Northeast  region,  thus 
changing  land  use  through  the  inundation  of  low-lying  areas  that  are  not  buffered  by  high  cliffs. 
However,  cliffs  could  experience  increased  rates  of  erosion  as  a  result  of  frequent  storm  surges, 
flooding  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  Forest  growth  could  increase  as  a  result  of  more  carbon 
dioxide  in  the  atmosphere.  Existing  parks,  reserves,  and  managed  areas  would  help  preserve 
wetlands  and  forested  areas  to  the  extent  they  are  not  affected  by  the  same  factors.  In  addition, 
climate  change  could  reduce  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity,  which  might  change  portions 
of  agricultural  land  uses  in  the  region  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Thus,  direct  changes  resulting 
from  climate  change  could  cause  a  shift  in  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  that  would  contribute  to 
the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site 
and  the  proposed  causeway. 

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize, 
important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  Therefore, 
based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  iand-use  impacts  would  be  MODEFWTE.  This 
conclusion  is  based  on  the  acquisition  of  85  acres  on  Artificial  Island  and  the  potential  of  the 
transmission  line  corridor  to  noticeably  affect  land-use  resources  in  the  region.  The  NRC  staff 
concludes  the  incremental  contribution  to  cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  NRC-authorized 
activities  would  contribute  to  the  overall  impact  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest. 

7.2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

This  section  analyzes  the  cumulative  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
and  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  projects  on  water  use  and  water  quality.

7.2.1  Water-Use  Impacts 

This  section  describes  the  cumulative  water-use  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction, 
and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  projects. 

7. 2. 1.1  Impacts  on  Surface-Water  Use 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.3  serves  as  a  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  for  surface-water  use.  As  described  in  Section  4.2.2,  the 
impacts  on  surface-water  resources  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  related  to  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL.  Also,  as  stated  in  Section  5.2.2,  the  impacts  on 
surface-water  resources  from  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative 
impacts  assessment  also  includes  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  projects  that  could  affect  surface-water  use  in  the  vicinity.  These  projects  are  listed 
in  Table  7-1 .  Because  the  source  of  surface  water  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  the 
Delaware  River,  the  review  team  considered  the  geographic  area  of  interest  to  be  the  entire 
Delaware  River  Basin.  In  this  analysis,  the  review  team  considered  all  surface-water  uses  that 
have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  currently  occurring,  and  are  reasonably  foreseeable  to  occur  in 
the  future. 

Past  and  present  surface-water  use  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  is  described  in  Section  2.3.2. 
The  Delaware  River  Basin  has  a  long  history  of  water  use  by  the  States  of  New  York,  New 
Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  and  Delaware.  The  Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  was 
created  in  1961  through  the  Delaware  River  Basin  Compact  among  the  Federal  government 
and  the  four  States  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  The  DRBC  is  responsible  for  protecting  water 
quality,  allocating  and  permitting  water  supply,  conserving  water  resources,  managing  drought, 
reducing  flood  losses,  and  developing  recreation  in  the  Basin  (DRBC  2013-TN2366).  Surface 
water  from  the  Delaware  River  has  been  extensively  used  in  the  past.  To  better  manage  the 
surface-water  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  the  Governors  of  the  four  Basin  States  in 
1999  directed  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  water  resources  plan  (DRBC  2004- 
TN2278).  This  goal-based  plan  was  developed  to  manage  quantity  and  quality  of  the  Basin’s 
water  for  sustainable  use,  reduce  flood  losses,  improve  recreation,  and  protect  riparian  and 
aquatic  ecosystems,  among  other  goals.  Based  on  a  review  of  the  history  of  water  use  and 
water  resources  planning  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  the  review  team  determined  that  past 
and  present  use  of  the  surface  waters  in  the  Basin  has  been  noticeable,  necessitating 
consideration,  development,  and  implementation  of  careful  planning. 

To  address  future  water  supply  demands,  the  DRBC  in  its  report  (DRBC  2008-TN2277)  has 
identified  key  actions  and  needs  for  future  water  supply  planning.  The  report  indicated  the  need 
to  (1)  identify  water  demand  for  a  growing  population,  (2)  identify  alternative  sources  such  as 
aquifer  storage  and  recovery  or  reuse,  (3)  gain  a  better  understanding  of  irrigation  water  use, 

(4)  identify  water  demand  for  potential  growth  in  thermoelectric  power  generation,  and 

(5)  quantify  instream  flow  needs  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  The  USACE  and  DRBC  Philadelphia 
District  published  water  demand  projections  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  through  2030  (USACE 


NUREG-2168

Cumulative  Impacts 


and  DRBC  2008-TN3040).  Using  a  subwatershed  approach  and  dividing  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  into  147  study  subwatersheds,  the  USACE  and  DRBC  determined  that  the  peak  month 
water  demand  in  various  parts  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  could  range  from  a  greater  than 
40  percent  decrease  to  a  greater  than  60  percent  increase  between  2003  and  2030.  Using  the 
7-day,  10-year  low-flow  statistic,  the  USACE  and  DRBC  identified  ten  subwatersheds  as  having 
surface-water  supply  deficits  if  the  consumptive  surface-water  use  in  those  subwatersheds 
exceeds  75  percent  of  the  corresponding  low-flow  statistic.  All  ten  identified  subwatersheds  are 
located  in  the  lower  Delaware  River  Basin.  The  other  subwatersheds  were  determined  to  be  not 
deficient  in  surface-water  supply  needs. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1,  the  ones  that  were  considered  for  cumulative  impacts  to  the 
surface-water  resource  are  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  the  Delaware  River 
Main  Channel  Deepening  Project.  All  other  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  either  do  not  affect  the 
surface-water  resource  or  their  surface-water  use  is  insignificant. 

The  DRBC  has  permitted  the  consumptive  water  use  for  SGS  and  HCGS.  SGS  and  HCGS 
withdraw  water  from  the  Delaware  River  for  cooling  purposes  near  the  PSEG  Site.  The  water  in 
the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  brackish.  The  main  concern  for  water  withdrawal  is 
that  it  may  induce  upstream  movement  of  salt  water  from  the  Delaware  Bay  and  therefore  affect 
public  water  supply  intakes  located  near  Trenton,  New  Jersey.  To  offset  the  use  of  the 
freshwater  component  withdrawn  by  SGS  and  HCGS,  the  DRBC  requires  PSEG  to  maintain 
ownership  of  freshwater  in  the  upstream  Merrill  Creek  reservoir.  The  DRBC  can  require  PSEG 
to  release  freshwater  from  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  during  declared  droughts  when  the 
instream  flow  targets  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  may  not  be  sufficiently  met  by  upstream  inflows. 
PSEG’s  allocation  of  freshwater  in  Merrill  Creek  may  fall  approximately  6.9  percent  short  of  that 
needed  for  concurrent  operations  of  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  (see  Section  5.2.2. 1).  However,  PSEG  has  the  option  to  either  modify  consumptive  use  of 
other  power  plants  it  owns  and  supports  through  its  allocation  in  Merrill  Creek  reservoir,  or  to 
acquire  additional  storage  within  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  from  other  owners  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  As  stated  in  Section  5.2.2. 1 ,  the  review  team  determined  that  there  is  sufficient 
storage  available  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  for  PSEG  to  meet  the  requirements  of  all  three 
plants  (SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site)  with  minor  impact  to 
instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware  River.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  of  the  three  PSEG  plants  (SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant)  on 
surface-water  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  would  be  minor.  Furthermore,  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  is  not  expected  to  affect  water  use  of  the 
Delaware  River. 

The  review  team  is  also  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  the  water 
resources  available  for  cooling  and  the  impacts  of  reactor  operations  on  the  water  resources  for 
other  users.  A  recent  compilation  of  the  state  of  the  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472)  has  been  considered  in  the  preparation  of  this  EIS.  The  current  state  of  knowledge  is 
dependent  upon  the  computer  climate  models  and  assumptions  made  on  future  trends  in 
emissions.  Projected  changes  in  the  climate  for  the  region  during  the  life  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  include  an  increase  in  average  temperature  of  3^t°F  and  a  slight 
increase  in  precipitation  throughout  the  year  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).

NUREG-2168 


Cumulative  Impacts 


Changes  in  climate  during  the  life  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  could  result  in 
a  slight  increase  in  the  amount  of  runoff.  At  the  same  time,  potential  increase  in  water 
temperature  resulting  from  climate  change  could  increase  evaporative  losses. 

The  USACE  and  DRBC  (USACE  and  DRBC  2008-TN3040)  report  was  published  as  a 
complementary  report  to  the  DRBC’s  Water  Resources  Plan  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin. 

The  purpose  of  the  study  included  establishing  a  sustainable  water  use  and  supply  plan  for  the 
Basin.  The  study  assumed  that  the  available  water  supply  in  the  year  2030  would  be  reduced 
by  5  percent,  an  assumption  based  on  a  literature  review  of  the  current  state  of  knowledge  on 
climate  variability  and  acknowledged  by  the  authors  to  be  an  overestimate.  The  study  further 
assumed  that  the  25-year  baseflow  would  also  be  reduced  by  5  percent  for  the  year  2030. 

The  hydrologic  changes  that  are  attributed  to  climate  change  in  these  studies  are  not 
insignificant  nationally  or  globally.  However,  while  these  changes  may  noticeably  alter  the 
resource,  the  review  team  did  not  identify  anything  that  suggests  the  cumulative  impacts  would 
destabilize  the  water  resources  locally. 

Mainly,  because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River, 
the  review  team  determined  that  the  cumulative  impacts  to  surface-water  resources  in  the 
geographic  area  of  interest  would  be  MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes 
that  the  incremental  impact  of  surface-water  use  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  SMALL. 

7. 2. 1.2  Impacts  on  Groundwater  Use 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.3  serves  as  a  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  for  groundwater  use.  As  described  in  Section  4.2.2,  the 
impacts  on  groundwater  resources  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  related  to  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL.  Also,  as  stated  in  Section  5.2.2,  the  impacts  on 
groundwater  resources  from  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative 
impacts  assessment  also  includes  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  projects  that  could  affect  groundwater  use  in  the  vicinity.  These  projects  are  listed 
in  Table  7-1 .  Because  the  source  of  groundwater  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  the 
Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  (PRM)  aquifer  system,  and  because  the  PRM  aquifer  system  is  the 
most  heavily  used  potable  aquifer  system  in  the  site  area,  the  review  team  considered  the 
geographic  area  of  interest  to  be  the  PRM  aquifer  system  where  groundwater  use  could  affect 
the  PSEG  Site  or  be  affected  by  groundwater  use  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Based  on  Martin  (1998- 
TN2259),  this  region  of  the  PRM  aquifer  system  extends  from  the  Fall  Line  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean 
and  from  Camden  County,  New  Jersey,  into  Delaware.  In  this  analysis,  the  review  team 
considered  all  groundwater  uses  that  have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  currently  occurring,  and  are 
reasonably  foreseeable  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  was  limited  to  the 
PRM  aquifer  system  due  to  the  relative  thickness  and  low  conductivity  of  the  overlying  confining 
unit  (Martin  1998-TN2259;  Dames  and  Moore  1988-TN331 1 ).

Cumulative  Impacts 


Past  and  present  water  use  of  the  entire  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  system,  and  the 
PRM  aquifer  system  in  particular,  is  described  in  Section  2.3.2  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey 
report  references  therein.  Extensive  use  of  the  PRM  aquifer  system  in  Camden,  Gloucester, 
and  Salem  Counties,  New  Jersey,  and  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  has  noticeably 
changed  the  pattern  of  groundwater  flow  and  reduced  groundwater  head  over  the  entire  region 
(Martin  1998-TN2259).  Concerns  over  declines  in  the  groundwater  and  the  possible  intrusion  of 
saline  water  led.  in  1993,  to  the  designation  of  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  2  in  New  Jersey  and 
restriction  on  withdrawals  of  water  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  within  New  Jersey  (Spitz  and 
dePaul  2008-TN2998).  This  resulted  in  a  recovery  of  groundwater  head  elevations  within 
Critical  Area  2  by  2003  (Spitz  and  dePaul  2008-TN2998).  In  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  in 
response  to  droughts  in  1999  and  2002.  additional  development  of  groundwater  resources  has 
alleviated  an  estimated  gap  between  water  supply  and  demand  during  drought  conditions 
(DWSCC  2006-TN3041;  DWSCC  2006-TN3042).  Groundwater  heads  continued  to  decrease 
through  2003  in  some  PRM  aquifer  system  wells  in  Delaware  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948). 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1 ,  the  ones  that  were  considered  for  cumulative  impacts  to  the 
groundwater  resource  are  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  the  continued 
regional  withdrawal  of  groundwater  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system.  All  other  projects  listed  in 
Table  7-1  either  do  not  affect  groundwater  resources  or  their  groundwater  use  is  implicitly 
considered  as  part  of  the  regional  groundwater  withdrawals. 

Groundwater  withdrawal  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  for  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS 
averaged  385  gpm  from  2002  to  2012  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  NJDEP  2013-TN3223).  Normal 
operational  withdrawal  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  estimated  to  be  210  gpm.  The 
combined  total  of  595  gpm  is  less  than  the  existing  permitted  withdrawal  rate  of  2,900  gpm. 

Over  the  course  of  a  year,  continuously  pumping  595  gpm  would  exceed  by  about  3  percent  the 
existing  permitted  total  diversion  limit  of  300  million  gallons.  When  the  reactor  technology  is 
selected,  PSEG  would  reevaluate  withdrawal  against  permitted  limits.  The  existing  permit 
would  be  modified  to  account  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  if  these  withdrawals  do  not  cause 
the  existing  limits  to  be  exceeded.  Or,  a  new  permit  with  a  higher  withdrawal  rate  would  be 
obtained  by  PSEG  (2015-TN4280). 

Regionally,  groundwater  heads  appear  to  be  fairly  stable  except  near  major  pumping  centers. 

No  substantial  change  in  heads  was  observed  (i.e. ,  head  change  was  less  than  ±5  ft)  over  the 
periods  1988-2003  and  1998-2003  in  all  of  Salem  County  except  for  a  small  area  nearest 
major  New  Castle  County  pumping  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  described  in 
Section  2. 3. 1.2,  water  levels  in  SGS  and  HCGS  observation  wells  in  the  PRM  aquifer  system 
varied  in  response  to  site  pumping  over  a  range  of  about  40  ft  during  the  period  2003-2013. 

As  described  in  Section  5. 2. 2. 2,  pumping  to  support  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
is  expected  to  produce  an  additional  drawdown  in  groundwater  heads.  Although  the  additional 
drawdown  was  estimated  in  Section  52.2.2  to  be  about  14  ft  at  a  distance  of  5  mi  from  the 
pumping,  the  review  team  expects  that  it  would  be  less  than  this  in  practice  due  to  leakage  from 
overlying  and  underlying  aquitards  and  aquifers.  The  interpretation  provided  in  5-year  synoptic 
reports  of  groundwater  levels  (Lacombe  and  Rosman  2001-TN4194;  Lacombe  and  Rosman 
1997-TN4195;  Rosman  et  al.  1995-TN4196;  Eckel  and  Walker  1986-TN4197;  Walker  1983- 
TN4198)  is  that  past  and  current  HCGS/SGS  pumping  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  reduces

Cumulative  Impacts 


groundwater  heads  by  about  20  ft  at  a  distance  of  3  mi  from  the  site.  The  review  team  expects 
that  a  55  percent  increase  in  the  combined  pumping  at  the  site  (i.e. ,  from  385  to  595  gpm) 
would  increase  the  drawdown  from  the  current  pumping  by  about  55  percent.  While  this  would 
expand  the  area  impacted  by  site  pumping,  it  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  of  dewatering  offsite 
wells  screened  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer.  The  relative  isolation  of  the  site  from  nearby 
groundwater  users  leads  the  review  team  to  conclude  that  the  cumulative  impact  from  the 
combined  pumping  would  be  minor. 

Groundwater  recharge  throughout  the  area  is  likely  to  be  affected  by  changes  in  temperature 
and  precipitation  resulting  from  climate  change.  The  review  team  is  unable  to  determine 
specific  changes  in  the  amounts  or  pattern  or  future  recharge.  However,  groundwater 
withdrawals  are  permitted  by  state  and  regional  agencies,  and  noticeable  changes  in 
groundwater  conditions  have  been  managed  successfully  in  the  past.  The  review  team 
assumes  that  permits  for  future  withdrawals  will  consider  changing  conditions  to  prevent 
destabilization  of  the  groundwater  resource. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  above,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  past  and  current 
regional  groundwater  withdrawals  have  noticeably  altered  the  groundwater  resource  throughout 
the  area  of  interest.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  groundwater-use 
impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects,  including  climate  change, 
would  be  MODERATE.  The  incremental  impacts  from  NRC-authorized  activities  would  be 
SMALL. 

7.2.2  Water-Quality  Impacts 

This  section  describes  the  cumulative  water-quality  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction, 
and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  projects. 

7. 2. 2. 1  Impacts  on  Surface-Water  Quality 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.3  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  for  surface-water  quality.  As  described  in  Section  4.2.3, 
surface-water-quality  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  related  to  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL.  Also,  as  stated  in  Section  5.2.3, 
surface-water-quality  impacts  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant,  the  cumulative  impacts  assessment  also  includes  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  projects  that  could  affect  surface-water  quality  in  the  vicinity.  These 
projects  are  listed  in  Table  7-1.  Because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  discharge  plant 
blowdown  and  other  wastewater  streams  to  the  Delaware  River,  the  review  team  considered  the 
geographic  area  of  interest  to  be  the  entire  Delaware  River  Basin.  In  this  analysis,  the  review 
team  considered  all  actions  that  have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  currently  occurring,  and  are 
reasonably  foreseeable  to  occur  in  the  future  that  may  affect  surface-water  quality.

Cumulative  Impacts 


The  surface-water  quality  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  is  described  in  Section  2.3.3.  Section 
2.3.3  also  describes  the  water-quality  assessment  reports  published  by  the  DRBC  and  the 
DRBC's  planning  and  regulation  of  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  Although  there 
have  been  improvements  in  water  quality  (e.g.,  improved  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen)  in  the 
Delaware  River  Basin  because  of  careful  planning  and  management  policies  put  in  place  by  the 
DRBC,  the  presence  of  toxic  compounds  has  led  to  advisories  for  fish  consumption 
(DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Zone  5  of  the  Delaware  River,  within  which  the  PSEG  Site  is  located,  is 
listed  by  DRBC  as  not  supporting  the  aquatic  life  designated  use  (DRBC  2012-TN2279). 
Because  continuing  issues  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  related  to  water  quality  have  resulted  in 
careful  planning  and  management,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  water-quality  impact  on 
the  Delaware  River  Basin  from  past  and  present  actions  is  noticeable  but  water  quality  is 
improving. 

As  discussed  in  Section  5.2.3. 1 ,  water  temperature  in  the  Delaware  River  (the  areas  just  outside 
the  HCGS  heat  dissipation  area  [HDA]  and  where  the  excess  temperature  from  the  discharge 
for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  reach  1 ,5°F)  could  frequently  (more  than  half  of  the  days) 
exceed  86°F  when  all  units  of  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  are  operating.  The  area  affected 
by  the  combined  thermal  plumes  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  the  proposed  new  plant  would  be 
small,  localized,  and  completely  contained  within  the  SGS  HDA.  Also,  while  reviewing  the  New 
Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  application  for  a  new  discharge  to  the 
Delaware  River,  DRBC  and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP) 
would  have  the  opportunity  to  designate  an  HDA  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  require 
discharge  rules  that  would  protect  the  aquatic  environment.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
determined  the  combined  discharges  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would 
not  noticeably  affect  the  Delaware  River. 

Disturbance  of  bottom  sediment  while  dredging  operations  are  ongoing  for  the  Delaware  River 
Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  could  affect  turbidity  and  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River. 
However,  these  effects  would  be  localized  near  the  area  actively  being  dredged,  and  the 
disturbed  sediment  would  settle  down  soon  after  the  activity  ceases.  Because  the  effects  of  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  on  Delaware  River  water  quality  are  expected 
to  be  temporary  and  localized,  the  review  team  determined  that  these  effects  would  be  minor. 

The  review  team  also  evaluated  the  impact  of  potential  climate  changes  on  water  quality  as  well 
as  the  cumulative  impact  that  climate  change  and  reactor  operations  could  have  on  the  quality 
of  water  resources  for  other  uses.  As  mentioned  in  Section  7.2.1 ,  potential  climate  change 
scenarios  discussed  in  a  recent  compilation  of  the  state  of  the  knowledge  in  this  area 
(GCRP  2014-TN3472)  and  a  study  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (USACE  and  DRBC  2008- 
TN3040)  were  considered  during  the  preparation  of  this  EIS. 

Climate  change  could  also  potentially  impact  surface-water  quality,  such  as  Delaware  River 
salinity.  The  study  report  (USACE  and  DRBC  2008-TN3040)  describes  the  result  of  the  salinity 
numerical  model  for  the  Delaware  River  conducted  in  2007,  as  part  of  the  Delaware  Deepening 
Project.  The  model,  based  on  conservative  assumptions  for  year  2040,  predicted  that  the 
salinity  would  increase  at  Delaware  RM  98  but  still  would  remain  below  current  and  possible 
future  standards.  The  review  team  therefore  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  climate  change  to 
surface-water  quality  would  be  minor.

Based  on  the  information  provided  above,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  surface-water- 
quality  impacts  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  have  been  noticeably  affected  by  past  and 
present  actions.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  surface-water- 
quality  impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects,  including  climate 
change,  would  be  MODERATE.  However,  the  incremental  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  contribute  significantly  to  the  overall  cumulative  impacts  in 
the  geographical  area  of  interest.  Therefore,  the  incremental  impacts  to  surface-water-quality 
from  NRC-authorized  activities  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

7. 2. 2. 2  Impacts  on  Groundwater  Quality 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.3  serves  as  a  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  for  groundwater  quality.  As  described  in  Section  4.2.3, 
groundwater-quality  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  related  to  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL.  Also,  as  stated  in  Section  5.2.3,  groundwater-quality 
impacts  from  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative 
impacts  assessment  also  includes  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  projects  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  affect  groundwater  quality. 
Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1 ,  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HOGS  and  the  continued 
regional  withdrawal  of  groundwater  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  are  the  ones  considered  for 
cumulative  impacts  to  groundwater  quality.  All  other  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  either  do  not 
affect  groundwater  quality,  are  at  such  a  distance  from  the  PSEG  Site  that  there  would  be  no 
interaction  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  or  their  impact  on  groundwater  quality  is  implicitly 
considered  as  part  of  the  regional  groundwater  withdrawals. 

The  groundwater  quality  of  the  shallow  water-bearing  units  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  is  described 
in  Section  2.3.3.  The  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  have  impacted  shallow  groundwater  quality,  but 
these  impacts  have  been  minor  and  have  been  limited  to  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site.  The  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants- 
Supplement  45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2 — Final  Report  ( NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 )  and  Section  2.3.3  of  this  EIS  describe 
a  tritium  leak  at  SGS  that  has  impacted  groundwater  in  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer. 
In  general,  tritium  concentrations  have  declined  in  response  to  groundwater  remediation  efforts, 
and  most  concentrations  are  at  or  below  one-half  the  EPA  drinking  water  standard  of 
20,000  pCi/L  (ARCADIS  2012-TN3310;  ARCADIS  2014-TN4207).  The  available  information 
indicates  that  the  response  to  the  tritium  leak  has  been  successful  in  limiting  the  impact  of  the 
leak  on  groundwater  quality  to  the  immediate  area  of  the  existing  plants.  Impacts  of  the  existing 
plants  on  groundwater  are  also  limited  because  groundwater  in  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown 
aquifer  is  saline  and  not  suitable  for  potable  use  and  discharges  to  the  Delaware  River.  Low- 
permeability  units  underlying  the  Vincentown  aquifer  limit  the  potential  for  vertical  movement  of 
contaminants  to  deeper,  potable  aquifers. 

Routine  discharges  to  groundwater  are  not  planned  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Potential 
impacts  to  groundwater  quality  could  come  from  inadvertent  spills  that  could  migrate  to  the 
shallow  water  zones.  Best  management  practices  (BMPs)  would  be  used  during  operations  to

minimize  the  area  affected.  If  a  spill  occurs,  NJDEP  requires  that  it  be  reported  and  remediated 
to  minimize  or  prevent  groundwater  impacts.  The  site  grade  would  contain  engineered  fill  of  low 
permeability,  which  would  further  limit  the  risk  of  groundwater  contamination.  Based  on  the 
natural  system,  site-management  practices,  and  regulatory  oversight,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  impacts  of  inadvertent  chemical  or  radiological  releases  to  groundwater  from  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  contained  to  the  immediate  area.  As  a 
result,  the  cumulative  impacts  of  inadvertent  releases  would  be  minor. 

The  groundwater  quality  of  the  regional  PRM  aquifer  system  is  described  in  Section  2.3.3. 

The  major  groundwater-quality  concern  in  the  PRM  aquifer  system  is  saline  intrusion  due  to 
large-scale  groundwater  withdrawals.  As  described  in  Sections  2. 3. 1.2  and  7. 2. 1.2,  the  regional 
reductions  in  groundwater  heads  in  the  PRM  aquifer  system  have  been  attributed  to  major 
groundwater  pumping  centers  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948). 
Designation  of  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  2  in  New  Jersey  and  the  associated  restrictions  on 
water  withdrawals  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  were  motivated  by  concerns  of  saltwater 
intrusion  from  the  Delaware  River  near  the  Fall  Line,  where  the  PRM  aquifer  system  is 
recharged,  and  from  the  Atlantic  Ocean  side  of  the  aquifer.  Salinity  intrusions  near  the  recharge 
areas  due  to  pumping  are  localized  (Navoy  et  al.  2005-TN3234).  As  a  result,  the  PSEG  Site  is 
not  likely  to  be  impacted  by  or  to  impact  saltwater  intrusion  from  the  Delaware  River  because  of 
the  site's  distance  from  the  Fall  Line  and  aquifer  recharge  areas.  Section  2.3.3  and  Dames  and 
Moore  (1 988-TN331 1 )  indicate  that  past  and  current  pumping  for  HCGS  and  SGS  operations 
has  not  significantly  impacted  chloride  concentrations  in  the  HCGS  and  SGS  pumping  wells. 
Pope  and  Gordon  (1999-TN3006)  simulated  the  future  movement  of  the  freshwater-saltwater 
interface  in  response  to  a  hypothetical  30  percent  increase  in  withdrawals  from  the  major 
pumping  centers.  They  found  that  the  increased  pumping  resulted  in  minimal  movement  of  the 
seaward  freshwater-saltwater  interface  (i.e.,  less  than  5  ft  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer)  and 
concluded  that  on  a  regional  scale  the  location  and  movement  of  the  interface  was  more 
sensitive  to  the  historical  sea  level  than  to  the  amount  of  groundwater  pumping.  Because  the 
increase  in  groundwater  pumping  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  minimal  compared  to 
the  increase  in  regional  pumping  considered  in  Pope  and  Gordon  (1999-TN3006),  the  review 
team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant’s  cumulative  impact  on  groundwater  quality 
would  be  minor. 

The  review  team  considered  climate  change  effects  including  sea-level  rise  on  groundwater 
quality.  As  described  in  Pope  and  Gordon  (1999-TN3006),  the  freshwater-saltwater  interface  in 
the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  system  is  most  responsive  to  changes  in  sea  level.  The 
interface  is  currently  moving  inland  in  response  to  significant  past  sea-level  rise,  but  this 
response  is  very  slow  (Pope  and  Gordon  1999-TN3006).  As  sea  level  continues  to  rise  as  a 
result  of  climate  change,  the  response  would  continue  to  be  slow.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  saltwater  intrusion  from  sea-level  rise  over  the  license  period  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  minor  impact  on  groundwater  quality. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  above,  the  review  team  determined  that  groundwater 
withdrawals  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  have  noticeably  altered  the  groundwater 
quality  in  localized  areas  where  pumping  occurs  near  aquifer  recharge  areas.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  groundwater-quality  impacts  of  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects,  including  climate  change,  would  be  MODERATE.

Cumulative  Impacts 


Because  the  PSEG  Site  is  a  significant  distance  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  recharge  areas, 
pumping  at  the  site  would  not  result  in  a  noticeable  change  to  groundwater  quality.  Therefore, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  groundwater-quality  impacts  from 
NRC-authorized  activities  would  be  SMALL. 

7.3  Ecology 

This  section  addresses  the  potential  cumulative  impacts  on  ecological  resources  from  building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  evaluation  of  cumulative 
impacts  also  includes  consideration  of  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
activities  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  Section  7.3.1  discusses  the  cumulative  impacts 
to  terrestrial  ecological  resources,  and  Section  7.3.2  discusses  the  cumulative  impacts  to 
aquatic  ecological  resources. 

7.3.1  Terrestrial  and  Wetlands  Resources 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.4.1  provides  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessments  for  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecological  resources.  As  described 
in  Section  4.3.1 ,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  combined  impacts  of  construction  and 
preconstruction  would  be  MODERATE,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  As 
described  in  Section  5.3.1 ,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  impacts  of  operations  on 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operation,  the  following 
cumulative  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  projects 
that  could  affect  the  same  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecological  resources  affected  by  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Direct  and  indirect  impacts  to  terrestrial 
and  wetland  resources  resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  limited  to  Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 
However,  the  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources,  when  combined  with 
other  actions,  would  extend  to  areas  within  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains,  Northern 
Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  ecoregions.  For  purposes  of  this  cumulative 
analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  defined  as  the 
Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  Level  III 
ecoregions  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  This  geographic  ROI  includes  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey,  and  other  counties,  or  portions  of  counties,  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and 
Maryland.  Table  7-1  lists  those  projects  that  would  contribute  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  impacts  within  the  geographic  ROI. 

7. 3. 1.1  Cumulative  Impacts  to  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Habitats  and  Wildlife 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  in  the  geographic  ROIs  consist  of  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain, 
Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens.  The  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain  has 
relatively  flat  topography  and  consists  of  swampy,  marshy,  and  frequently  flooded  areas. 

Upland  areas  are  dominated  by  loblolly-shortleaf  pine  forests,  and  lowland  and  tidally  influenced 
areas  support  tidal  marshes,  swamps,  floodplain  forests,  and  pocosins.  Marshes  are  dominated 
by  cord  grass  and  salt-meadow  grass.  The  Northern  Piedmont  is  characterized  by  irregular

plains  and  low  hills.  It  is  dominated  by  mixed  oak,  chestnut  oak,  hemlock-mixed  hardwood,  and 
sugar  maple-mixed  hardwood  forests.  The  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  are  a  low  undulating 
part  of  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain.  Native  habitat  in  this  area  consists  of  pine-oak  woodlands, 
mixed  oak  and  beech-oak  forests,  salt  marshes,  swamps,  freshwater  marshes,  and  floodplains 
(Woods  et  al.  2007-TN3227). 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  ecoregion  has  been  significantly  altered  since  the  beginning  of 
European  settlement  in  the  1600s  as  a  result  of  agriculture,  silviculture,  and  urban  development. 
The  geographic  ROI  includes  the  same  habitat  types  as  are  found  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the 
PSEG  Site.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.4.1 .1 ,  habitats  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  site  include 
barren  land,  developed  land,  cultivated  cropland,  pasture  hay,  deciduous  forest,  evergreen 
forest,  mixed  forest,  emergent  herbaceous  wetland,  woody  wetland,  and  open  water.  However, 
the  overall  percentages  of  each  habitat  differ  when  expanding  from  the  6-mi  vicinity  to 
encompass  the  geographic  ROI.  Open  water  associated  with  the  Delaware  River,  Delaware 
Bay,  and  other  open  water  areas  occupies  791 ,821  ac  (1 5.7  percent)  of  the  area.  Emergent 
herbaceous  wetland  occupies  199,603  ac  (4.0  percent),  and  woody  wetland  occupies 
279,248  ac  (5.5  percent).  Agricultural  land  consisting  of  cultivated  cropland  (1,075,101  ac)  and 
pasture/hay  (774,432  ac)  accounts  for  36.8  percent  of  the  land  cover.  Deciduous  forest 
occupies  1,028,552  ac  (20.5  percent)  of  the  habitat  in  the  geographic  ROI.  Developed  lands, 
which  include  high,  medium,  low,  and  open  space  developed  land,  occupy  630,983  ac 
(12.6  percent).  Barren  lands  account  for  54,142  ac  (1 .1  percent)  of  the  landcover.  Evergreen 
and  mixed  forest  habitat  accounts  for  190,352  ac  (3.8  percent)  of  landcover  in  the  geographic 
ROI  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  USACE  created  Artificial  Island  in  the  early  1900s  with  the  authorization  of  the  Rivers  and 
Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  The  act  authorized  the 
creation  of  a  30-ft  channel  from  Philadelphia  to  the  Delaware  Bay  and  covered  56  mi  of 
proposed  channel.  The  amount  of  material  to  be  removed  was  estimated  at  34,953,000  yd3  of 
dredge  material  and  24,000  yd3  of  rock.  Six  locations,  including  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point 
Shoal,  were  evaluated  as  potential  disposal  sites.  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point  Shoal  were 
enclosed  in  1900  by  bulkheads  to  form  a  deposit  basin  now  known  as  Artificial  Island  (Snyder 
and  Guss  1 974-TN2280).  Since  the  development  of  Artificial  Island,  several  dredging  projects 
have  altered  the  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  of  the  region. 

Currently,  the  USACE  is  deepening  the  existing  Delaware  River  Federal  Navigation  Channel 
from  40  to  45  ft  from  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and  Camden,  New  Jersey,  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Delaware  River  (USACE  2013-TN2665).  The  USACE  Delaware  River  Main  Channel 
Deepening  Project  would  require  the  use  of  a  site  to  dispose  of  dredge  material,  and  the 
USACE  proposes  to  dispose  of  this  dredge  material  at  the  Fort  Mifflin  CDF.  The  USACE 
determined  that  the  planned  impacts  are  consistent  with  previous  actions  and  would  not  result  in 
significant  impacts  to  the  affected  environment  (USACE  2013-TN2665).  Similarly,  current 
operations  at  both  the  SGS  and  HCGS  (including  maintenance  dredging  for  the  intake  and/or 
outfall  structures)  would  require  a  location  for  disposing  of  dredge  material,  and  a  disposal  site 
also  would  be  needed  for  dredge  material  from  developing  a  new  barge  access  area  for  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  dredge  material  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  plant  would 
be  disposed  of  on  the  site  or  at  an  approved  upland  disposal  facility.

Cumulative  Impacts 


The  cumulative  impact  contribution  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  associated  with  the 
acquisition  by  PSEG  of  the  85-ac  Artificial  Island  CDF  would  be  dependent  on  the  USACE  s 
actions  to  develop  a  new  CDF  and  could  add  to  the  overall  cumulative  impacts  for  the 
geographic  ROI.  The  current  Artificial  Island  CDF  contains  low-quality  terrestrial  and  wetland 
habitat,  and  the  addition  of  a  new  CDF  has  the  potential  to  affect  habitat  of  higher  quality  in 
another  location.  The  USACE  has  evaluated  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  a  new  CDF 
to  replace  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  (USACE  201 5-TN4231 )  and  has  concluded  that  the  principal 
impacts  resulting  from  development  of  a  new  CDF  would  be  the  unavoidable  impact  of  filling 
0.8  ac  of  Federally  nonjurisdictional  wetlands  and  open  waters  in  a  drainage  ditch  internal  to  the 
new  CDF  site  and  the  potential  for  water-quality  impacts  due  to  CDF  operations.  The  overall 
impacts  on  existing  wildlife  and  other  terrestrial  or  aquatic  resources  would  be  minimal  as  the 
new  CDF  site  design  includes  provisions  to  address  water-quality  impacts  (USACE  2015- 
TN4231 ). 

Therefore,  the  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  would  be  expected  to  be  similar  to,  and 
consistent  with,  those  of  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  and  those  of  the 
aforementioned  development  of  a  new  CDF  to  replace  the  existing  Artificial  Island  CDF. 
Consequently,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  cumulative  impact  on  terrestrial  and  wetland 
ecology  habitats  from  dredging  activities  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  conjunction  with  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
dredging  activities  would  be  minimal. 

Most  of  the  other  operational  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  have  resulted  in  the  reduction, 
fragmentation,  and  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  in  the  geographical  ROI. 

These  projects  include  several  fossil-fuel  energy  facilities  such  as  Delaware  City  Refinery, 
Deepwater  Energy  Center,  Carneys  Point  Generating  Plant,  Pedricktown  Combined  Cycle 
Cogeneration  Plant,  Cumberland  County  Landfill  Gas-to-Energy  Plant,  Vineland  Municipal 
Electric  Utility,  Sherman  Avenue  Energy  Center,  Carl’s  Corner  Energy  Center,  and  Cumberland 
Generating  Station.  Additionally,  there  are  four  operating  nuclear  power  plants  located  in  the 
geographic  ROI  that  have  contributed  to  adverse  cumulative  effects  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources,  including  HCGS,  SGS,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  and  Limerick 
Generating  Station.  The  Salem  County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  also  operates  in  this  region.  These 
facilities  are  expected  to  have  continuing  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  in  the  ROI 
during  the  operational  period  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor 
and  Workforce  Development  projects  that  the  population  of  Salem  County  will  increase  by 
approximately  5  percent  between  2010  and  2030.  The  population  of  the  geographic  ROI  is  also 
expected  to  increase  from  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014-TN3332).  Future  urbanization  in  the 
geographic  ROI  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural  lands,  wetlands,  and  forested  areas. 
Urbanization  would  reduce  areas  in  natural  vegetation  and  open  space  and  would  decrease 
connectivity  among  wetlands,  forests,  and  other  wildlife  habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result 
of  urbanization  would  result  in  added  pressures  to  the  remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife 
populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that  these  activities  would  substantially  affect  the 
overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel  corridors  near  the  geographic  ROI.

Cumulative  Impacts 


Some  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  include  site  redevelopment.  These  projects  include 
redevelopment  resulting  from  a  Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  for  Camp  Pedricktown, 
Shieldalloy  site  decommissioning,  the  Gateway  Business  Park,  and  the  Millville  Municipal 
Airport.  The  Camp  Pedricktown  Redevelopment  and  Shieldalloy  facility  are  currently 
developed/disturbed  sites.  In  addition,  the  Gateway  Business  Park,  located  in  Oldmans 
Township,  Salem  County,  is  a  light  industrial  complex  consisting  of  284  acres.  The  business 
park  is  planning  to  develop  three  sites  totaling  approximately  25  acres.  The  site  is  mostly 
developed  with  little  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  available  (Matrix  Development  Group  2008- 
TN3273).  The  proposed  Millville  Municipal  Airport  Improvements  would  refurbish  the  apron 
terminal  at  the  airport.  These  projects  are  not  expected  to  further  degrade  or  fragment 
terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  resources  within  the  geographic  ROI. 

The  transmission  service  provider  has  determined  that  a  new  transmission  line  and  ROW  is 
needed  to  support  grid  stability  in  the  geographic  ROI.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  PSEG 
conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi-wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  WMC  and 
transmission  line  ROW  that  extends  55  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  Peach  Bottom  Substation 
in  Pennsylvania.  The  transmission  line  ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide. 
The  development  of  the  transmission  line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  over  1 ,500  ac  of 
land.  Habitats  that  could  be  affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests, 
mixed  forest,  agricultural  land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
The  corridor  would  be  expected  to  follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  However,  the 
exact  amounts  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  that  would  be  affected  are  not  known,  and  it  is 
expected  that  the  project  would  cause  fragmentation  and  degradation  of  these  resources.  The 
amount  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  affected  by  the  grid  stability  line  would  not  be  a 
significant  amount  of  the  available  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  in  the  region,  but  mitigation 
may  be  required  by  entities  issuing  permits  for  the  project. 

The  report  on  global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States,  provided  by  the  U.S.  Global 
Change  Research  Program  (GCRP),  summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate 
changes  in  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  The  report  divides  the  United  States  into 
nine  regions,  and  the  PSEG  Site  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  GCRP  climate  models 
for  this  region  project  temperatures  to  rise  2.5  to  4°F  in  the  winter  and  1 .5  to  3.5°F  in  the 
summer  over  the  next  several  decades.  Winters  are  projected  to  be  much  shorter  with  fewer 
cold  days  and  more  precipitation.  Cities  that  currently  experience  few  days  above  100°F  each 
summer  would  average  20  or  more  days.  Hot  summer  conditions  would  come  three  weeks 
earlier  and  last  three  additional  weeks  into  the  fall.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the 
global  average,  with  more  frequent,  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected 
changes  potentially  could  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations. 
Large-scale  shifts  in  the  ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  animal 
migration  that  are  already  occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 

As  described  in  Section  5.3.1 .1 ,  the  cooling  system  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  pose  the  most  significant  risk  to  vegetation  during  operations.  These  types  of 
structures  have  the  potential  to  produce  salt  deposition  and  increased  fogging,  icing,  humidity, 
and/or  precipitation.  Other  facilities  listed  in  Table  7-1  that  would  have  similar  effects  include 
HCGS,  Limerick  Generating  Station,  and  potentially  the  fossil-fuel  electricity  generating  stations. 
Most  native  vegetation  that  comprises  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  has  a  medium  to  high  salinity

tolerance,  and  vegetation  damage  would  be  localized  to  the  facility’s  site.  Increased  fogging, 
icing,  humidity,  and/or  precipitation  as  a  result  of  operating  these  facilities  are  expected  to  be 
low. 

In  Section  5.3.1 .1 ,  the  review  team  determined  that  avian  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with 
the  natural  draft  cooling  tower  design  could  occur  but  would  not  result  in  a  significant  decline  in 
avian  populations.  Additionally,  bat  species  could  experience  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions 
with  human-made  structures  on  the  PSEG  Site,  but  collisions  are  not  a  significant  source  of 
overall  population  declines  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771).  Likewise,  other  existing  and  proposed 
structures  for  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  would  be  expected  to  have  similar  effects.  The  highest 
rates  of  mortality  as  a  result  of  avian  collisions  occurred  with  structures  taller  than  300  ft 
(Kerlinger  2000-TN3188).  A  few  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  could  have  structures 
reaching  these  heights.  PSEG  submitted  a  report  on  avian  collisions  at  HCGS  to  the  NJDEP  in 
1987.  At  the  end  of  the  study  period,  PSEG  concluded  that  the  approximately  600-ft-tall  HCGS 
cooling  towers  appeared  to  be  an  insignificant  source  of  bird  collisions  and  mortality.  There 
were  a  total  of  30  mortalities  at  the  PSEG  Site  during  the  yearlong  study  lasting  from  February 
1985  to  January  1986,  and  no  Federally  or  State-listed  endangered  or  threatened  species  were 
among  the  mortalities  listed  (PSEG  1987-TN2893). 

Literature  regarding  bat  collisions  with  cooling  tower  structures  is  limited.  However,  several 
studies  have  been  completed  regarding  bat  collisions  with  other  human-made  structures. 
Mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  television  and  communications  facilities  were  recorded 
involving  eastern  red  ( Lasiurus  borealis ),  hoary  ( Lasiurus  cinereus),  and  silver-haired 
(, Lasionycteris  noctivagans)  bats.  Similarly,  bats  have  been  known  to  collide  with  tall  buildings. 
Bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  wind  turbines  are  well  documented.  Over  360  bats 
were  collected  from  wind  turbines  in  Minnesota,  and  the  highest  mortality  rate  of  32  bat 
mortalities  per  three  wind  turbines  was  recorded  at  a  single  wind  turbine  in  Tennessee.  Most  of 
the  mortalities  occurred  in  late  summer  to  early  fall  and  involved  mostly  migratory  tree  bats 
species.  Erickson  et  al.  (2002-TN771)  suggests  that  bat  species  may  not  use  echolocation 
during  migration,  which  can  result  in  higher  collision  rates  with  human-made  structures.  Fewer 
collisions  occurred  with  resident  bat  populations  that  forage  near  these  structures.  Projects 
listed  in  Table  7-1  potentially  having  structures  taller  than  500  ft  are  spread  out  through  the 
region  and  would  not  be  expected  to  cause  significant  declines  in  avian  populations.  Projects 
listed  in  Table  7-1  could  affect  migratory  bat  routes,  and  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions 
may  be  expected.  However,  evidence  suggests  that  bat  collisions  with  human-made  structures 
are  not  a  significant  source  of  population  declines  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771 ). 

Avian  and  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  transmission  lines  is  also  a  concern.  Avian 
and  bat  collisions  with  transmission  systems  are  dependent  on  site-specific  variables  such  as 
nesting,  bat  migration  routes,  foraging,  and  roosting.  In  addition,  line  orientation  to  flight 
patterns  and  movements,  species  composition,  and  line  design  are  factors  in  avian  and  bat 
collisions.  The  NRC  has  determined  that  bird  collisions  with  transmission  lines  are  more  likely 
to  occur  with  large-bodied  species  such  as  raptors,  while  smaller  species  such  as  songbirds  are 
more  likely  to  collide  with  towers  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Erickson  et  al.  (2002-TN771)  indicated 
that  migrating  bats  are  susceptible  to  collisions  with  human-made  structures,  and  foraging  bats 
would  be  less  likely  to  have  collisions.  The  proposed  grid  stability  line  would  have  similar 
impacts  over  a  larger  area.  It  is  expected  that  the  proposed  grid  stability  line  would  comply  with

Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act  (16  USC  703  et  seq.  -TN3331)  requirements.  Avian  mortality  as  a 
result  of  collision  with  transmission  systems  is  not  expected  to  be  a  significant  source  of 
population  declines.  The  transmission  system  potentially  could  cross  migratory  routes  of  bat 
species,  and  mortalities  could  result  from  collisions  with  these  structures.  However,  bat 
collisions  with  human-made  structures  would  not  be  expected  to  cause  a  decrease  in  the  overall 
population  of  bats  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771). 

Increased  traffic  as  a  result  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  and  urban  development  could 
result  in  declines  of  wildlife  populations  if  roadkill  rates  exceed  the  rates  of  reproduction  and 
immigration  in  the  geographic  ROI.  However,  roadkills  occur  frequently,  and  wildlife  populations 
are  not  significantly  affected  (Forman  and  Alexander  1998-TN2250). 

The  review  team  has  determined  that  the  cumulative  effects  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
and  wildlife  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  presented  above, 
including  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  in  the  geographical  ROI  would  be 
noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  not  be  a  significant  source  of  the  impacts. 

7.3. 1.2  Cumulative  Impacts  to  Important  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Species  and  Habitats 

The  discussion  of  important  species  and  habitat,  as  defined  by  the  NRC  in  NUREG-1555.  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  in  Section  2.4.1 .3  is  applicable  to  the  geographic  area  of  interest 
defined  for  the  cumulative  impact  assessment  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Future  urban  and 
industrial  development,  new  transmission  corridors,  and  the  effects  of  other  projects  potentially 
may  affect  important  species  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest,  primarily  by  decreasing  or 
degrading  the  available  habitat  for  these  species.  Several  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  have  the 
potential  to  degrade  wetlands.  Impacts  from  development,  new  transmission  corridors,  and 
potential  effects  of  other  projects  would  noticeably  alter,  but  not  destabilize,  important  species 
and  habitat  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest. 

Seven  birds  of  prey  have  been  identified  as  important  species  in  the  geographical  area  of 
interest  for  cumulative  impacts.  These  include  Cooper's  hawk  {Accipiter  cooperii),  red- 
shouldered  hawk  ( Buteo  lineatus),  northern  harrier  ( Circus  cyaneus).  bald  eagle  ( Haliaeetus 
leucocephalus),  osprey  ( Pandion  haliaetus),  American  kestrel  ( Falco  sparverius).  and  peregrine 
falcon  ( Falco  peregrinus ).  Although  impacts  to  these  species  resulting  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  are  expected  to  be  minimal,  the  degree  of  effect  on  these  species  could  increase 
when  considering  overall  cumulative  impacts  on  habitats  with  further  development  in  the 
geographical  area  of  interest.  Potential  impacts  would  include  fragmentation  of  habitat. 
Additional  fragmentation  and  loss  of  forested  habitat  could  further  impact  Cooper's  hawk  and 
red-shouldered  hawk.  Additional  loss  of  open  field  habitat  could  further  impact  American 
kestrel.  Cumulative  loss  of  wetland  habitat  could  have  additional  impacts  on  bald  eagle,  osprey, 
and  northern  harrier. 

Impacts  to  waterfowl,  wading  birds,  and  other  waterbirds  resulting  from  a  new  nuclear  plant  on 
the  PSEG  Site  were  found  to  be  negligible.  However,  the  cumulative  loss  of  wetlands  habitat  as 
a  result  of  development  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest  could  result  in  additional  impacts  to 
these  species.  This  would  include  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  recreationally  valuable

waterfowl  species,  Federally  listed  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa),  State-listed  wading 
birds,  and  other  listed  waterbirds  (e.g.,  pied-billed  grebe  [Podilymbus  podiceps]).  The  nearest 
known  occurrences  of  the  Federally  listed  threatened  rufa  red  knot  are  in  adjacent  Cumberland 
County,  New  Jersey  and  Kent  County,  Delaware.  The  rufa  red  knot  has  the  potential  to  be 
impacted  by  habitat  disturbance  and  collisions  with  human-made  structures.  Incremental  loss 
and  fragmentation  of  contiguous  open  field  habitat  potentially  could  impact  State-listed 
passerine  species  such  as  horned  lark  ( Eremophila  alpestris),  bobolink  ( Dolichonyx  oryzivorus), 
eastern  meadowlark  ( Sturnella  magna),  grasshopper  sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum ),  and 
savannah  sparrow  ( Passerculus  sandwichensis). 

Although  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  for  the  Federally  threatened 
(State-listed  endangered)  bog  turtle,  the  potential  grid  stability  transmission  lines  along  with 
other  actions  taken  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest  could  result  in  impacts  to  this  species. 
This  is  also  true  for  the  State  endangered  eastern  tiger  salamander  ( Ambystoma  tigrinum 
tigrinum). 

The  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  for  the  Federally  threatened  northern 
long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis ).  Habitat  does  exist  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site  and  in  the 
geographical  ROI.  The  proposed  transmission  line  project  to  support  grid  stability  has  the 
potential  to  transect  hibernacula,  roosting,  and  foraging  habitat  important  to  the  northern 
long-eared  bat.  The  PSEG  analysis  of  the  WMC  indicated  that  a  new  transmission  line  could 
cross  294  ac  of  forestland  in  the  region.  However,  the  exact  routing  of  the  transmission  corridor 
is  not  known,  and  a  greater  proportion  of  forestland  could  be  affected.  Northern  long-eared  bats 
summer  roost  in  forest  habitats  that  include  species  of  black  oak  ( Quercus  velutina),  northern 
red  oak  ( Quercus  rubra),  silver  maple  (Acer  saccharin um),  black  locust  (Robinia  pseudoacacia ), 
American  beech  ( Fagus  grandifolia),  sugar  maple  (Acer  sacch arum),  sourwood  ( Oxydendrum 
arboreum),  and  shortleaf  pine  ( Pinus  echinata).  Additionally,  forestland  habitat  is  important  to 
the  northern  long-eared  bat’s  foraging  methods  (78  FR  61046-TN3207).  However,  the  primary 
threat  to  the  northern  long-eared  bat  is  from  white  nose  disease,  and  more  than  1,000,000  ac  of 
forest  habitat  exist  in  the  region  (Table  2-2).  Thus,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  to 
the  northern  long-eared  bat  could  be  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing. 

The  extent  of  potential  cumulative  impacts  on  listed  species  would  be  dependent  on  the  extent 
to  which  BMPs  are  implemented  for  the  various  projects  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest. 
Mitigation  or  avoidance  of  sensitive  habitat  would  be  an  important  factor  in  determining  the 
extent  of  potential  impacts. 

The  proposed  new  transmission  line  to  support  grid  stability  has  the  potential  to  cross 
freshwater  woody  and  emergent  wetlands.  The  amount  of  these  wetlands  that  would  be 
disturbed  is  unknown  at  this  time.  However,  impacts  to  freshwater  woody  and  emergent 
wetlands  may  be  unavoidable.  The  addition  of  the  new  transmission  corridor  potentially  could 
cross  over  14  mi  of  stream  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Additionally,  future  urbanization  could  result 
in  some  limited  losses  of  wetlands  and  streams.  State  and/or  Federal  regulations  would  provide 
protection  of  wetlands  and  streams  from  future  ROW  development  and  urbanization.  However, 
the  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  these  activities  would  be  noticeable.

Cumulative  Impacts 


Summary 

Potential  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity 
would  result  from  loss  of  vegetation  as  well  as  loss  and  fragmentation  of  wildlife  habitat.  Such 
impacts  would  increase  with  the  continued  development  of  the  geographical  area  of  interest. 
Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  noticeable  but 
would  not  be  expected  to  cause  significant  wildlife  species  population  or  ecosystem  impacts 
within  the  geographic  ROI.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the 
review  team's  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  impacts  of  past, 
present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  including  climate  change  on  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  would  be  MODERATE  for  the  geographic  ROI.  The  MODERATE  impact 
level  is  based  primarily  on  the  cumulative  impacts  to  important  wetland  and  forest  resources 
associated  with  the  new  transmission  line  to  support  grid  stability.  The  NRC-authorized 
activities  associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  contribute  to  the  MODERATE  impact  level. 

7.3.2  Aquatic  Ecosystem 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.4.2  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  for  aquatic  ecological  resources.  As  described  in  Section  4.3.2, 
the  impacts  from  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  on  aquatic  ecological  resources  would 
be  SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  As  described  in  Section  5.3.2,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  operations  and  maintenance  on  aquatic  resources 
inhabiting  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  marsh  creeks  would  be  SMALL,  and  no  further 
mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

The  combined  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  from  construction  and  preconstruction  are 
described  in  Section  4.3.2  and  were  determined  to  be  SMALL,  provided  PSEG  complies  with 
BMPs  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  In  addition  to  the  impacts  from  construction, 
preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative  analysis  considers  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  actions  that  could  affect  aquatic  ecology.  These  projects  are  listed  in 
Table  7-1 .  For  this  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  considered  to  be  water  bodies 
connected  to  the  PSEG  Site,  the  onsite  desilt  basins  and  small  marsh  creeks,  the  marsh  creek 
system  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway,  and  the  tidal  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The 
water  bodies  crossed  by  a  potential  transmission  line  corridor  are  also  included  in  the 
geographic  area  of  interest. 

A  wide  variety  of  historical  events  have  affected  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  and  its 
resources  (Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127).  As  Europeans  began  settling  the  estuary  region  early 
in  the  17th  century,  agriculture  expanded,  and  the  clearing  of  forest  led  to  erosion.  Dredging, 
diking,  and  filling  gradually  altered  extensive  areas  of  shoreline  and  tidal  marsh.  By  the  late 
1800s,  industrialization  had  altered  much  of  the  watershed  of  the  upper  estuary,  and  fisheries 
were  declining  due  to  overfishing  as  well  as  pollution  from  ships,  sewers,  and  industry.  By  the 
1940s,  anadromous  fish  were  blocked  from  migrating  upstream  to  spawn  due  to  a  barrier  of  low 
oxygen  levels  in  the  Philadelphia  area.  This  barrier,  combined  with  small  dams  on  tributaries,

nearly  destroyed  the  herring  and  shad  fisheries.  A  large  increase  in  industrial  pollution  in  the 
early-to-mid  1900s  resulted  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Philadelphia  becoming  one  of  the  most 
polluted  river  reaches  in  the  world.  Major  improvements  in  water  quality  began  in  the  1960s  and 
continued  through  the  1980s  as  a  result  of  State,  multi-State,  and  Federal  actions,  including  the 
Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  and  the  activities  of  the  DRBC  (PDE  2012- 
TN2191).  The  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  is  the  subject  of  numerous  restoration 
activities  and  projects  under  the  purview  of  the  Partnership  for  the  Delaware  Estuary,  the 
DRBC,  and  numerous  research  and  academic  institutions.  In  its  2012  annual  report,  the 
Partnership  for  the  Delaware  Estuary  suggested  that  the  overall  environmental  conditions  of  the 
region  were  fair  (PDE  2012-TN2191).  Since  2008,  some  conditions  were  found  to  be  declining 
in  areas  such  as  sediment  removal  impairing  estuarine  habitats  and  a  decline  in  young-of-year 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus),  and  some  areas  were  seeing 
improvements  such  as  a  reduction  of  total  organic  carbon  and  an  increase  in  Striped  Bass 
( Morone  saxatilis)  populations  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ). 

Other  actions  in  the  vicinity  that  have  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  on  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  include  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  completion  of 
USACE  dredging  operations  for  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project,  and 
potential  PJM  construction  of  a  new  transmission  corridor  and  transmission  line  for  grid  stability. 
Planning  and  development  for  the  new  transmission  corridor  would  avoid  or  span  channelized 
waterways,  perennial  streams,  and  intermittent  streams  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  New 
transmission  line  crossing  development  would  require  BMPs  to  protect  water  quality  and 
minimize  effects  to  aquatic  habitats  that  may  be  at  risk  from  clearing  activities,  runoff,  and  bank 
erosion.  An  estimated  77,088  linear  ft  of  stream  habitat  (S&L  2010-TN2671 )  is  within  the 
5-mi-wide  macro-corridor  for  the  hypothetical  transmission  line  discussed  in  Section  7.5.  The 
hypothetical  transmission  line  would  cross  the  Delaware  River  and  would  require  installation  of 
footings.  Placement  of  footings  would  result  in  permanent  benthic  habitat  loss,  but  this  loss 
would  be  minimal  when  compared  to  available  adjacent  habitat.  Installation  activities  would  be 
managed  through  use  of  BMPs  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting  to  minimize  siltation 
and  protect  adjacent  aquatic  habitats.  PSEG  would  consult  with  Federal  and  State  agencies,  as 
required,  when  an  exact  route  is  identified  and  installation  effects  to  protected  species  can  be 
directly  assessed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Water  quality  in  the  region  may  be  affected  by  continued  withdrawal  and  discharge  of  water  to 
support  power  generation.  There  are  large  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  that  harvest 
fish  and  invertebrates  that  make  up  the  ecological  community  within  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  The  effects  of  natural  environmental  stressors  such  as  climate  change  and  extreme 
weather  events  would  also  affect  aquatic  communities  in  the  region. 

Each  of  the  current  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  may  influence  the  structure  and 
function  of  estuarine  food  webs  and  result  in  observable  changes  to  the  aquatic  resources  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  In  most  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  quantitatively  the  impact 
of  individual  stressors  or  groups  of  stressors  on  aquatic  resources  because  they  affect  the 
region  simultaneously,  and  their  effects  are  cumulative.

7. 3.2.1  Continued  Operation  of  the  SGS  Once-Through  Cooling  System 

Based  on  the  assessment  presented  in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for 
License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants-Supplement  45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station 
and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2 — Final  Report  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ),  NRC 
staff  concluded  that  “entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharge  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources  from  the  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  collectively  have  not  had  a  noticeable 
adverse  effect  on  the  balanced  indigenous  community  of  the  Delaware  Estuary.”  However, 
operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  continues  to  impinge  and  entrain  aquatic  species  and  would 
contribute,  in  part,  to  the  cumulative  loss  of  these  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Several  improvements  to  the  cooling  water  intake  structures  have  been  made  to  reduce 
impingement  mortality  at  SGS.  Some  of  these  improvements  included  installation  of  modified 
traveling  screens,  installation  of  improved  screen  mesh,  and  modifications  to  spray  wash  nozzle 
configurations  (PSEG  2009-TN251 3).  Decades  of  monitoring  and  survey  data  for  finfish  and 
aquatic  invertebrates  have  been  used  to  assess  species  density  and  richness  in  the  vicinity  of 
SGS  as  directed  under  NJPDES  permits  starting  in  1994  and  in  subsequent  renewals 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Impingement,  entrainment,  and  fish  assemblage  sampling  by  trawling 
and  seining  are  conducted  each  year,  in  accordance  with  NJPDES  permit  requirements  for 
biological  monitoring.  The  reporting  emphasis  is  on  targeted  representative  important  species 
that  include  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis),  Alewife  (A.  pseudoharengus),  American  Shad 
(A.  sapidissima),  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus),  Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchilli), 
Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia),  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana),  Striped  Bass,  Bluefish 
( Pomatomus  saltatrix ),  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis),  Spot  ( Leiostomus  xanthurus),  and  Atlantic 
Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  All  of  these  representative 
important  species  are  also  considered  either  recreationally  or  commercially  important,  or  are 
ecologically  important  as  forage  fish  for  sustainability  of  the  ecosystem  within  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  and  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Although  individual  species 
abundances  change  year  to  year,  the  overall  trends  in  community  abundances  and  diversity 
show  no  significant  changes  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

7.3.2  2  Continued  Operation  of  the  HCGS  Closed-Cycle  Cooling  System 

HCGS  uses  closed-cycle  cooling  and  therefore  requires  substantially  less  water  volume  for 
cooling  operations.  Accordingly,  effects  on  the  aquatic  community  through  impingement, 
entrainment,  and  discharge  are  also  expected  to  be  reduced  when  compared  with  the  once- 
through  cooling  system  at  SGS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  Impingement  studies  at  HCGS  were  only 
performed  in  1986  and  1987  at  the  commencement  of  operation  for  the  single  unit,  and  showed 
a  reduced  overall  impingement  rate  when  compared  to  SGS  (see  Section  5.3.2).  Because 
HCGS  was  operating  concurrently  with  SGS,  the  NJPDES  permit-directed  biological  monitoring 
of  the  aquatic  community  through  trawling  and  seining  studies  also  reflected  the  combined 
effect  of  both  HCGS  and  SGS  operations.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  regarding  effect  of 
continued  operation  of  SGS  apply  also  to  HCGS  in  that  the  overall  species  diversity  and 
community  abundances  near  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  continue  to  show  no  noticeable 
effects  from  operations  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).

7. 3. 2. 3  Commercial  and  Recreational  Harvest  of  Fish  and  Shellfish 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  supports  a  diverse  commercial  and  recreational  fishery  for  finfish 
and  invertebrates.  Losses  to  the  ecosystem  from  fishery  harvest  are  managed  at  the  Federal 
and  State  levels  through  catch  limits,  regulations  on  fishing  gear,  and  seasonal  closures. 
Unintended  harvest  or  mortality  is  another  source  of  loss  through  bycatch  while  targeting  a 
different  species.  While  these  activities  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  cumulative  effects  on 
aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  the  direct  contribution  is  difficult  to  assess  as 
many  of  these  fish  populations  have  life  histories  that  involve  a  large  migratory  territory  offshore 
and  along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States,  and  therefore,  effects  to  populations  are 
difficult  to  directly  attribute  to  Delaware  River  Estuary  habitat  effects. 

7. 3. 2. 4  Habitat  Loss  and  Restoration 

Current  and  future  land-use  development  for  industry,  agriculture,  or  other  habitat  alterations  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  watershed  may  affect  water  quality.  These  types  of  activities  may 
also  result  in  shoreline  habitat  loss. 

Dredging  activities  from  past  efforts  to  maintain  navigation  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  may 
have  affected  estuarine  habitats,  and  future  dredging  activities  are  planned  that  may  continue  to 
affect  the  aquatic  ecosystem.  Starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the  Delaware 
River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel  from 
40  to  45  ft  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  To  deepen  the  channel,  material  would  be  dredged  by 
hydraulic  and  hopper  dredges  and  placed  in  USACE  CDFs  or  used  for  beneficial  reuse 
purposes  (e.g.,  wetland  restoration,  beach  restoration,  and  habitat  creation)  in  lower  Delaware 
Bay.  The  USACE  estimates  that  1 ,01 2,428  yd3  of  material  were  dredged  from  Reach  D  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  near  Artificial  Island  and  placed  in  the  Federally  owned  CDF  on  Artificial 
Island  (USACE  2013-TN2851 ).  When  completed,  the  entire  Deepening  Project  would  remove 
and  dispose  of  an  estimated  16  million  yd3  of  sediments  from  the  Delaware  River  in  Philadelphia 
down  to  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay.  The  subsequent  maintenance  dredging  would  remove 
an  estimated  4,317,000  yd3  of  sediment  from  the  45-ft-deep  channel  each  year  (USACE  2011- 
TN2262).  Maintenance  dredging  would  be  carried  out  as  needed,  generally  over  a  2-month 
period  between  August  and  December.  As  with  building  in-river  components  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  fish  and  benthic  invertebrates  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
would  be  displaced  during  the  USACE  dredging  activities  but  are  expected  to  recolonize  the 
affected  areas.  The  USACE  would  implement  appropriate  measures  required  by  Federal  and 
State  agencies  and  organizations  to  protect  aquatic  resources,  including  endangered  species 
(e.g.,  sturgeon  and  sea  turtles),  sharks,  horseshoe  crabs  ( Limulus  polyphemus ),  blue  crabs 
( Callinectes  sapidus),  freshwater  mussels,  and  American  Eels  ( Anguilla  rostrata)  (USACE  2011- 
TN2262).  For  example,  mechanical  dredge  activities  between  March  15  and  June  30  would  be 
avoided  within  selected  reaches  of  the  project  area  to  prevent  sedimentation  and  turbidity 
effects  on  reproduction  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon,  Striped  Bass,  American  Shad,  and  river  herring 
(USACE  2013-TN2851). 

While  aquatic  habitats  continue  to  be  affected  by  natural  and  anthropogenic  activities  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  efforts  to  restore  salt  marsh  and  estuary  habitat  have  met  with  some 
success  and  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  future.  For  example,  ongoing  restoration  activities

Cumulative  Impacts 


within  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  (WMA),  which  is  located  4  mi  east  of  the 
PSEG  Site,  would  restore  nearly  200  ac  of  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  to  address  injuries  to 
shoreline  and  bird  resources  resulting  from  the  2004  Athos  I  oil  spill  (NOAA  2008-TN2721 ). 
NJDEP  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  proposed  a  tidal 
wetland  restoration  project  that  would  allow  development  of  smooth  cordgrass  ( Spartina 
alterniflora)  habitat  to  improve  habitat  quality  in  the  area.  Restoration  would  be  accomplished 
through  fill  material  removal  to  lower  the  marsh  elevation  and  allow  tidal  inundation 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  As  described  in  Section  4.3.1,  unavoidable  impacts  to  wetlands  by 
developing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be 
mitigated  by  habitat  restoration  and  enhancement,  using  experience  and  proven  techniques 
developed  by  the  PSEG  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP).  Sensitive  species  that  utilize 
such  marsh  habitats  would  be  positively  affected  by  the  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA 
restoration  effort  and  by  the  proposed  mitigation  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
and  causeway  (i.e.,  restoration  of  low-quality  marsh  habitats)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

7. 3. 2. 5  Climate  Change 

The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic 
area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could 
lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events, 
increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 
Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  the  PSEG  Site 
through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  For  example,  in  2012, 
Hurricane  Sandy  created  increased  storm  surge  during  this  event  within  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  and  had  moderate  effects  on  water  quality  and  coastal  habitats  within  the  southernmost 
portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  through  erosion,  sedimentation,  and  resuspension  of 
contaminants  within  sediments  (ALS  2012-TN2720).  Elevated  water  temperatures,  droughts, 
and  severe  weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat; 
however,  specific  predictions  on  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change 
are  inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on 
the  intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities.  The  DRBC 
stated  in  the  State  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature 
and  salinity  are  expected  with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  over  a  period  of  time  in 
the  future  (DRBC  2013-TN2609).  The  DRBC  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  U.S.  Global 
Change  Research  Program  regarding  the  very  high  likelihood  that  sea  levels  will  rise  and  create 
different  environmental  conditions  within  this  century  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Because  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  already  a  zone  of  tidally  influenced  fluctuation 
with  variable  salinity  and  temperature,  these  potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement 
of  populations  of  marine  and  euryhaline  species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For 
example,  in  a  recent  report,  hard  bottom  areas  north  and  south  of  the  Chesapeake  and 
Delaware  Canal  (upriver  of  the  PSEG  Site)  were  identified  as  having  potential  as  reef  sites  for 
the  establishment  of  new  oyster  beds  and  were  discussed  as  a  future  conservation  target  due  to 
changing  climate  conditions  resulting  in  increases  in  salinity  further  upriver  (PDE  201 1-TN2190).

7. 3. 2. 6  Summary  of  Cumulative  Impacts  on  Aquatic  Resources 

Aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  cumulatively  affected  to  varying  degrees 
by  multiple  activities  and  processes  that  have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  occurring  currently,  and 
are  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  food  web  and  the  abundance  of  important  aquatic  forage 
species  and  other  species  have  been  substantially  affected  by  these  stressors  historically  as  is 
described  in  Section  2.4.2.  The  impacts  of  some  of  these  stressors  associated  with  human 
activities  are  addressed  by  management  actions  (e.g.,  cooling  system  operation,  regulation  of 
fishing  pressure,  water-quality  improvements,  and  habitat  restoration). 

Other  stressors,  such  as  climate  change  and  increased  human  population  and  associated 
development  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  cannot  be  directly  managed  and  their  effects  are 
more  difficult  to  quantify  and  predict.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  future  anthropogenic  and  natural 
environmental  stressors  would  cumulatively  affect  the  aquatic  community  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  sufficiently  that  they  would  noticeably  alter  important  attributes,  such  as  species  ranges, 
populations,  diversity,  habitats,  and  ecosystem  processes,  just  as  they  have  in  the  past.  These 
stressors  have  modified  important  attributes  of  aquatic  resources,  and  would  continue  to  exert 
an  influence  in  the  future,  potentially  destabilizing  some  of  the  attributes  of  the  aquatic 
ecosystem.  Based  on  these  observations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  impacts 
have  been  noticeable  and  destabilizing  for  some  aquatic  resources,  primarily  based  on  past 
stressors  affecting  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin. 

Cumulative  impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  NMFS,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  The  significant  history  of 
the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had  a  noticeable  and  sometimes 
destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities.  Commencement  of  operations 
at  SGS  Units  1  and  2  resulted  in  significant  numbers  of  aquatic  species  being  entrained  and 
impinged,  which  led  to  required  restoration  of  the  area  through  the  EEP  as  a  form  of  mitigation. 
In  addition,  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  such  as  the  continued  operation 
of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  the  completion  of  dredging  operations  for  the  Delaware  River  Main 
Channel  Deepening  Project  would  continue  to  have  effects  on  the  aquatic  resources  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  of 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities,  including  climate  change,  on  the 
aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  would  be  MODERATE  to  LARGE.  However, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  contribution  of  the  NRC-authorized  activities 
related  to  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not 
be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  MODERATE  to  LARGE  impact. 

7.4  Socioeconomics  and  Environmental  Justice 

The  evaluation  of  cumulative  impacts  on  socioeconomics  and  environmental  justice  is  described 
in  the  following  sections. 

7.4.1  Socioeconomics 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.5  serves  as  a  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  in  these  resource  areas.  As  described  in  Section  4.4,  the

Cumulative  Impacts 


review  team  concluded  that  most  of  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  NRC-authorized  construction 
activities  would  be  SMALL  with  the  exceptions  discussed  as  follows.  In  Sections  4.4.1  and 
5.4.1 ,  the  review  team  found  that  physical  impacts  near  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL,  with 
the  exception  of  MODERATE  physical  impacts  to  the  local  road  network.  Aesthetic  and 
recreational  impacts  would  be  MODERATE. 

As  described  in  Section  5.4,  the  review  team  determined  that  demographic  effects  of  plant 
operations  would  be  SMALL.  The  physical  impacts  would  be  SMALL  for  all  physical  categories 
except  aesthetics,  which  would  be  MODERATE.  Economic  impacts  from  salaries,  sales,  and 
expenditures  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region;  property  tax  impacts  would 
be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region  with  the  exception  of  MODERATE  and 
beneficial  income  tax  impacts  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  LARGE  and  beneficial  property 
tax  impacts  for  Salem  County.  Impacts  on  infrastructure,  transportation,  and  community 
services  would  be  SMALL.  Aesthetic  and  recreational  impacts  near  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
MODERATE. 

The  impact  analyses  in  Chapters  4  and  5  are  cumulative  by  nature.  The  combined  impacts 
from  construction  and  preconstruction  are  described  in  Section  4.4  and  were  determined  to  be 
the  same  as  described  above  for  NRC-authorized  activities.  In  addition  to  socioeconomic 
impacts  from  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative  analysis  considers 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  contribute  to 
cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts.  For  this  cumulative  impacts  analysis,  the  review  team 
considered  a  geographic  area  of  a  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team 
determined  the  impacts  within  the  50-mi  radius  primarily  affected  four  counties — New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware  and  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties  in  New  Jersey — that 
make  up  the  economic  impact  area  (geographic  area  of  interest)  that  would  be  most  affected  by 
the  proposed  project. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  site  is  located  on  the  southern  part 
of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River,  about  15  mi  south  of  the  Delaware 
Memorial  Bridge;  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington,  Delaware;  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia. 
Pennsylvania;  and  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey. 

The  nearest  residences  to  the  PSEG  Site  are  located  about  2.8  mi  to  the  west  in  New  Castle 
County,  Delaware,  and  about  3.4  mi  to  the  east-northeast  in  the  Hancock's  Bridge  community  of 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  closest  recreational  areas  are  the 
Augustine  Beach  Access  Area  and  Augustine  Wildlife  Area,  which  are  approximately  3.1  and 
3.6  mi  across  the  Delaware  River  from  the  PSEG  Site. 

As  shown  in  Table  2-13,  the  combined  population  of  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact 
area  was  1 ,045,640  in  201 1 .  More  than  half  of  this  population  (51 .31  percent)  lives  in  New 
Castle  County;  6.31  percent  reside  in  Salem  County,  the  home  of  the  PSEG  Site;  14.93  percent 
live  in  Cumberland  County;  and  27.45  percent  live  in  Gloucester  County  (USCB  2002-TN2297; 
USCB  2008-TN2344;  USCB  2012-TN2743).  Table  2-14  lists  the  population  of  municipalities 
and  townships  within  10  mi  of  the  site.  The  largest  population  centers  are  Middletown, 
Delaware,  with  17,608  residents  and  Pennsville  Township,  New  Jersey,  with  13.405  residents.

Salem,  New  Jersey,  located  about  8  mi  north  of  the  site,  has  a  population  of  5,239  (USCB  2012- 
TN2743).  In  the  economic  impact  area,  Salem  County  is  the  least  populated  and  most  rural. 
New  Castle  County  is  the  most  populated  and  least  rural. 

New  Castle  County  has  been  strongly  influenced  by  favorable  corporate  tax  laws  where  large 
companies  have  offices.  New  Castle  also  has  a  manufacturing  history  with  DuPont  and 
AstraZeneca.  Health  care  providers  also  contribute  significantly  to  the  economic  base  in  New 
Castle  County.  Wilmington  is  the  largest  city  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  is  in  northern 
New  Castle  County.  The  three  New  Jersey  counties  have  smaller  populations  and  are  less 
industrialized.  Manufacturing  (glass  and  food),  health  care,  and  retail  trade  are  the  largest 
employers  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  counties  have  matured  based  upon  these 
characteristics. 

Table  7-1  lists  the  present  and  future  projects  that  could  contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  project  with  the 
greatest  contribution  to  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  continued  operations  at 
HCGS  and  SGS.  According  to  Section  2. 5. 1.3,  approximately  1,300  people  are  employed  at 
HCGS  and  SGS,  and  most  of  the  workforce  lives  in  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact 
area.  Each  reactor  has  outages  on  a  staggered  18-24  month  schedule  that  employ  an 
additional  1 ,034  to  1 ,361  workers  at  the  site  for  a  month.  Operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS  also 
contribute  to  economic  activity  and  tax  revenue  to  the  local  communities.  These  characteristics 
are  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5  and  the  HCGS  and  SGS  License  Renewal  EIS  (NRC  2011- 
TN3131). 

The  other  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  involve  continued  development  in  the  economic  impact 
area  and  are  included  in  county  comprehensive  plans  and  in  other  public  agency  planning 
processes.  Currently,  every  6  months  over  1 ,000  workers  are  employed  at  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
site  for  outages  for  approximately  1  month.  During  the  peak  building  period  at  the  PSEG  Site, 
an  additional  4,100  workers  would  be  employed.  The  review  team  already  considers  the 
impacts  from  this  larger  workforce  in  Section  4.4.  The  greatest  chance  for  impacts  would  be  on 
traffic  and  roads,  but  the  traffic  impact  analysis  (TIA)  includes  the  outage  workforce  and  peak 
building  workforce  in  its  analysis.  The  TIA  analyzed  the  impacts  of  the  current  workforce  at 
HCGS  and  SGS  as  part  of  the  traffic  baseline  (PSEG  2013-TN2525).  Assuming  a  plant 
parameter  envelope  of  two  Advanced  Passive  1000  Reactors  (API  000)  reactors  as  discussed 
in  Chapter  3,  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  two  outages  every  18  to  24  months,  which  is 
equivalent  to  a  staggered  schedule  of  every  9  to  1 2  months  for  the  two  API  000  reactors.  These 
outages  would  occur  on  a  staggered  schedule  with  the  HCGS  and  SGS  outages.  Therefore, 
assuming  evenly  staggered  schedules,  there  would  be  an  outage  every  2  to  3  months  at  the  site 
instead  of  the  current  schedule  of  every  6  months.  The  impacts  of  outage  workforces  for  HCGS 
and  SGS  would  be  similar  to  those  impacts  discussed  in  Chapter  5. 

The  operating  license  for  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  expire  in  2036,  2040,  and  2046, 
respectively.  Salem  County  would  see  a  loss  in  property  tax  revenue,  supplies  and  materials 
purchases  made  by  PSEG,  and  employment.  However,  this  loss  would  be  offset  by  the 
continued  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  compared  to  the  baseline  discussed  in  Section  2.5.

Cumulative  Impacts 


Independent  of  new  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PJM  plans  to  solicit  bids  for  upgrading 
transmission  lines  for  grid  stability  and/or  to  relieve  congestion.  PJM  has  not  selected  a 
company  or  a  route  for  the  project.  However,  PSEG  has  indicated  that  a  55-mi  corridor  running 
from  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  Peach  Bottom  substation  is  a  potential  route.  It  is  expected  that  most 
of  the  transmission  lines  would  follow  existing  corridors,  but  some  properties  might  be 
purchased  along  the  ROW  (PSEG  201 3-TN2525).  Where  clearing  would  be  necessary,  there 
would  be  fugitive  dust,  emissions,  and  noise  that  would  be  short  term  and  minimal. 

Transmission  line  noise  during  operations  would  be  within  regulatory  limits  at  the  edge  of  the 
ROW.  The  workers  that  would  be  needed  for  the  transmission  line  expansion  and  maintenance 
are  expected  to  already  reside  within  the  50-mi  region,  and  their  impacts  are  already  included  in 
the  region's  baseline  discussed  in  Chapter  2.  Therefore,  demographic,  housing,  education,  and 
public  service  impacts  would  be  minimal.  Transmission  line  construction  would  not  be  in  a 
centralized  location  but  scattered  over  miles,  so  cumulative  impacts  on  traffic  and  transportation 
would  be  minimal.  Because  transmission  lines,  to  the  extent  practicable,  would  be  co-located 
with  other  transmission  lines,  in  accordance  with  established  industry  practices  and  procedures 
regarding  vegetation  and  screening,  building  and  operations  of  the  transmission  lines  would 
have  a  minimal  impact  on  aesthetics  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 

On  the  basis  of  the  above  considerations,  PSEG’s  ER,  and  the  review  team’s  independent 
evaluation  and  outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  have  short-term  cumulative,  MODERATE,  and  adverse  impacts  associated  with  traffic 
and  a  SMALL  cumulative  impact  during  operations  and  outages  within  the  economic  impact 
area.  The  new  cooling  towers  would  also  have  cumulative  MODERATE  and  adverse  impacts 
associated  with  aesthetics  in  certain  locations. 

Cumulative  tax  impacts  would  also  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  for  most  of  the  economic  impact 
area,  except  for  a  LARGE  and  beneficial  impact  in  Salem  County.  The  review  team  concludes 
that  the  incremental  cumulative  impacts  from  NRC-authorized  activities  on  other  socioeconomic 
impact  categories  would  be  SMALL,  except  for  continued  MODERATE  aesthetic  impacts  from 
the  cooling  towers  and  from  traffic  during  construction.  All  other  cumulative  impacts  are 
deemed  to  be  SMALL. 

7.4.2  Environmental  Justice 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Sections  2.5  and  2.6  serves  as  a  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  of  environmental  justice  impacts.  The  combined  physical  and 
socioeconomic  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  and  from  operations  are 
summarized  in  Sections  4.5.6  and  5.5.6.  As  discussed  in  Sections  4.5  and  5.5,  the  review  team 
concluded  that  no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  and  low-income 
populations  would  result  from  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  or  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

In  addition  to  environmental  justice  impacts  from  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  of 
a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  cumulative  analysis  considers  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  environmental  justice 
impacts.  For  this  cumulative  analysis,  the  general  geographic  area  of  interest  is  considered  to 
be  the  50-mi  region  described  in  Section  2.5.1.

NUREG-21 68 


Cumulative  Impacts 


As  shown  in  Section  2.6,  the  greatest  concentrations  of  census  block  groups  with  minority  and 
low-income  populations  that  meet  the  criteria  discussed  in  Section  2.6  are  located  in  or  near 
Philadelphia,  Camden  County,  and  northern  New  Castle  County.  The  closest  minority 
populations  are  in  Salem  County  in  Salem  City,  approximately  8  mi  north  of  the  site.  The 
closest  low-income  populations  are  also  in  Salem  City,  approximately  8  mi  north  of  the  site. 
(Note:  These  are  linear  distances  from  the  PSEG  Site  center;  driving  distances  to  all 
communities  are  greater.) 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.4.1  for  socioeconomic  cumulative  impacts,  continued  operations  at 
HCGS  and  SGS  have  the  greatest  potential  to  affect  cumulative  environmental  justice  impacts 
within  the  region. 

HCGS  and  SGS  are  located  next  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  found  no  environmental 
pathways  in  Sections  4.5  and  5.5  that  could  result  in  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human 
health,  environmental,  physical,  or  socioeconomic  impacts  to  minority  and  low-income 
populations  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  In  the 
HCGS  and  SGS  License  Renewal  EIS,  no  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  to 
minority  and  low-income  populations  were  found  from  continued  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS 
(NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.4,  PJM  has  not  selected  a  company  or  a  route  for  the  transmission 
line  project.  PSEG  indicated  that  a  55-mi  corridor  running  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  Peach 
Bottom  substation  is  a  potential  route.  Because  the  potential  PSEG  to  Peach  Bottom 
Substation  route  follows  existing  corridors  and  very  few  properties  would  need  to  be  purchased, 
the  review  team  does  not  expect  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  to  minority  and 
low-income  populations  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 

On  the  basis  of  the  above  considerations,  information  provided  by  PSEG,  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation  and  outreach,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  would  be  no 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  cumulative  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations 
beyond  those  described  in  Chapters  4  and  5. 

7.5  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Chapter  2  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impact  assessments  in  this  resource  area.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  this 
resource  area  is  defined  in  Chapters  4  and  5  (the  direct  Area  of  Potential  Effect  (APE)  is  the 
proposed  plant  boundary  and  the  indirect  APE  is  4.9  mi).  As  described  in  Section  4.6,  the 
construction  of  two  natural  draft  cooling  towers  (NDCTs)  (if  selected)  is  anticipated  to  have  a 
noticeable,  but  mitigable,  indirect  adverse  visual  impact  on  three  historic  properties.  The  use  of 
mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  would  have  no  impact  on  historic  properties.  Therefore,  the 
impacts  of  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  could  range 
from  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  Even  though  the  proposed  project  is  over  4  mi  from  a  National 
Historic  Landmark  (NHL)  and  other  historic  properties  and  the  visibility  of  the  NDCTs  is 
dependent  on  climatic  conditions  which  could  obscure  them  (see  Figure  2-30  and  2-31  in 
Section  2.7),  the  visual  impact  would  remain  noticeable.  The  indirect  adverse  visual  effect 
would  be  cumulative  because  the  current  setting  already  contains  a  NDCT  immediately  south  of

the  proposed  project  site.  USACE  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966  (54  USC  300101 
et  seq.  -TN4157)  Section  106  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation 
Office  (SHPO)  on  impacts  from  the  proposed  causeway  and  the  wetland  mitigation  area  is 
ongoing,  but  would  be  resolved  prior  to  issuance  of  any  Department  of  the  Army  authorization. 
As  described  in  Section  5.6,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  operations  also 
could  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE  for  the  reasons  stated  above.  In  addition  to  the 
impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative  analysis  also 
considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  actions  that  could  affect  historic  and 
cultural  resources. 

This  cumulative  analysis  considers  the  effects  from  other  activities  in  the  region  in  combination 
with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  No  other  activities  are 
anticipated  within  the  Artificial  Island  project  area.  Because  most  historic  and  cultural  resources 
are  location  dependent,  no  cumulative  effects  are  expected  within  the  Artificial  Island  project 
area.  Other  activities  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  include  the  Delaware  River 
Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  and  the  potential  construction  of  a  new  transmission  line  by 
PJM  for  grid  stability. 

As  part  of  its  NEPA  review,  the  USACE  evaluated  the  visual  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway. 
The  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)  site  closest  to  the  proposed  causeway  is  the 
Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  NHL,  which  is  located  about  1  mi  from  the  northern  end  of  the 
causeway.  The  effect  from  the  proposed  causeway  on  historic  properties  is  still  being 
evaluated. 

Independent  of  the  potential  construction  and  operation  of  a  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PJM  has 
determined  that  additional  grid  improvements  are  necessary  to  address  voltage  and  stability 
constraints  in  the  region  of  Artificial  Island.  PJM  has  solicited  proposals  for  system 
enhancements  to  address  these  constraints.  While  PJM  has  not  formally  assessed  the  scope 
and  structure  of  this  future  transmission  upgrade,  given  the  solicitation  of  interest  PJM  issued 
for  new  transmission  lines,  the  staff  considers  new  transmission  lines  to  be  reasonably 
foreseeable,  and  they  are  considered  a  cumulative  impact.  PSEG  has  identified  the  potential 
impacts  of  a  new  offsite  transmission  line  with  technical  attributes  that  best  meet  PJM's  goal  of 
resolving  these  regional  constraints.  Developing  the  new  transmission  line  corridors  could 
adversely  affect  historic  and  cultural  resources  within  the  APEs.  Prior  to  development  of  any 
new  lines,  if  a  Federal  permit  is  needed,  then  the  Federal  agency  permitting  the  new  lines  must 
consult  with  the  appropriate  SHPOs.  This  consultation  would  involve  archival  research  and  field 
investigations  to  determine  if  any  significant  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be  present  in 
the  routes  considered.  If  significant  resources  (i.e. ,  NRHP-eligible)  are  located  within  the 
proposed  route,  and  it  is  determined  that  impacts  could  occur  to  those  resources,  consultation 
with  the  appropriate  SHPOs,  Native  American  tribes,  and  interested  parties  would  be  necessary 
to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  on  historic  properties. 

To  evaluate  the  potential  cumulative  impacts,  the  review  team  considered  that  PJM  could  build 
a  transmission  line  55  mi  in  length,  generally  following  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from 
the  PSEG  Site  to  the  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania,  some  of  which  could  fall  within 
the  APEs.  From  the  PSEG  Site,  the  hypothetical  corridor  extends  north  and  then  west  across

Cumulative  Impacts 


the  Delaware  River  to  the  Red  Lion  Substation.  From  this  location,  the  potential  corridor 
extends  to  the  Peach  Bottom  Substation. 

The  review  team  considered  the  PSEG  analysis  of  historic  properties  within  a  5-mi-wide  corridor 
of  the  hypothetical  transmission  line.  Based  on  GIS  analysis  of  NRHP-listed  sites,  the  macro¬ 
corridor  contains  52  NRHP-listed  sites.  The  three  counties  containing  NRHP-listed  sites  in  the 
macro-corridor  are  New  Castle,  Delaware  (21);  Cecil,  Maryland  (20);  and  Salem,  New  Jersey 
(11). 

Based  on  its  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  historic  and  cultural 
resources  impact  from  construction,  preconstruction,  operations,  and  other  Federal  and  non- 
Federal  projects  would  be  MODERATE.  The  impacts  could  be  greater  if  archaeological 
resources  are  present  in  the  transmission  line  corridors  and  could  not  be  avoided.  Building  and 
operating  the  plant  would  be  a  significant  contributer  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impact  if 
NDCTs  are  selected.  The  incremental  contribution  of  NRC-authorized  activities  on  historic  and 
cultural  resources  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

7.6  Air  Quality 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.9  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impact  assessment  for  air  quality.  As  described  in  Section  4.7,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  impacts  on  air  quality  from  preconstruction  and  NRC-authorized  construction 
would  be  SMALL,  and  that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  As  described  in 
Section  5.7,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  on  air  quality  from  operations  would  be 
SMALL,  and  that  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

7.6.1  Criteria  Pollutants 

In  addition  to  the  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  this  cumulative 
analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  to  air  quality.  For  this  cumulative  analysis  of  criteria 
pollutants,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  This  geographic  area 
of  interest  was  chosen  because  EPA  air-quality  designations  are  made  on  a  county-by-county 
basis. 

The  existing  PSEG  property  currently  has  three  operating  nuclear  reactors.  SGS  Units  1  and  2 
are  Westinghouse  pressurized  water  reactors  (PWRs)  rated  at  3,459  MW(t)  each.  HCGS  Unit  1 
is  located  north  of  the  SGS  units.  HCGS  is  a  General  Electric  boiling  water  reactor  (BWR), 
rated  at  3,840  MW(t).  Surrounding  SGS  and  HCGS  are  many  support  facilities,  including 
circulating  and  service  water  intake  structures,  switchyards,  administration  buildings,  and  an 
independent  spent  fuel  storage  installation  (ISFSI).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  north  of  and 
adjacent  to  HCGS  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.9.2,  air  quality  in  Salem  County  is  in  attainment  with  or  better  than  the 
National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQS)  for  criteria  pollutants  with  the  exception  of  the 
8-hour  ozone  (03)  NAAQS,  for  which  it  is  in  nonattainment  (40  CFR  Part  81-TN255).  At  such  a 
time  when  a  CP  or  COL  is  submitted  to  the  NRC,  a  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  - 


NUREG-2168

Cumulative  Impacts 


TN1 141)  general  conformity  applicability  analysis  and  determination  would  be  performed 
pursuant  to  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  (TN2495)  to  determine  whether  additional  mitigation 
may  be  warranted. 

Section  4.7  discusses  air-quality  impacts  associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Emissions  from  these  activities  primarily  would  be  the  fugitive  dust 
from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  engine  exhaust  from  heavy  equipment  and  vehicles. 
Emissions  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude  and  are  anticipated  to  be 
SMALL. 

Section  5.7  discusses  air-quality  impacts  during  operations.  Emissions  during  operation  would 
primarily  be  from  operation  of  the  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines,  and  commuter  traffic.  Stationary  sources  (e.g.,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas  turbines 
[operating  infrequently]  and  auxiliary  boilers  [operating  mostly  during  winter  months])  would  be 
operated  according  to  State  and  Federal  regulatory  requirements.  Impacts  to  air  quality  during 
operations  are  expected  to  be  SMALL. 

There  are  13  major  sources  of  air  emissions  in  Salem  County  with  existing  Title  V  operating 
permits  (EPA  2013-TN2504).  These  existing  sources  include  the  energy  and  industrial  projects 
listed  in  Table  7-1 .  The  permitted  air  emission  sources  closest  to  the  PSEG  Site  are  those 
associated  with  SGS  and  HCGS.  The  addition  of  emission  sources  associated  with  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  require  modification  to  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS 
Title  V  Operating  Permit  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Title  V  operating  permits  are  legally 
enforceable  documents  issued  for  all  major  sources  by  State  and  local  permitting  authorities 
after  the  source  has  begun  to  operate.  The  permits  include  all  air  pollution  requirements  that 
apply  to  the  source,  including  emissions  limits  on  the  types  and  amounts  of  emissions  allowed, 
operating  requirements  for  pollution  control  devices  or  pollution  prevention  activities,  and 
monitoring  and  record  keeping  requirements.  These  permits  also  require  the  source  to  report  its 
compliance  status  with  respect  to  permit  conditions  to  the  permitting  authority.  These  permits 
aid  the  State  in  meeting  NAAQS,  thereby  limiting  potential  air-quality  impacts. 

Future  development  near  the  PSEG  Site  also  could  lead  to  increases  in  gaseous  and  particulate 
emissions  related  to  transportation.  Table  7-1  lists  low  potential  for  growth  within  Salem 
County.  Most  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  would  not  increase  air  emissions  enough  to  exceed 
current  air-quality  standards.  Given  the  low  potential  for  growth  in  Salem  County,  and  the  minor 
contribution  of  emissions  from  building  and  operation,  the  cumulative  impact  on  air  quality  with 
exception  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  would  be  minimal. 

7.6.2  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions 

As  discussed  in  the  state  of  the  science  report  issued  by  GCRP,  “The  majority  of  the  warming  at 
the  global  scale  over  the  past  50  years  can  only  be  explained  by  the  effects  of  human 
influences,  especially  the  emissions  from  burning  fossil  fuels  (coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas)  and 
from  deforestation... Oil  used  for  transportation  and  coal  used  for  electricity  generation  are  the 
largest  contributors  to  the  rise  in  carbon  dioxide  that  is  the  primary  driver  of  observed  changes 
in  climate  over  recent  decades’’  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).

Cumulative  Impacts 


GHG  emissions  associated  with  building,  operating,  and  decommissioning  a  nuclear  power 
plant  are  addressed  in  Sections  4.7,  5.7,  6.1 .3,  and  6.3.  The  review  team  has  concluded  that 
the  atmospheric  impacts  of  the  emissions  associated  with  each  aspect  of  building,  operating, 
and  decommissioning  a  single  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  minimal.  The  review  team  also 
concluded  that  the  impacts  of  the  combined  emissions  for  the  full  plant  life  cycle  would  be 
minimal. 

It  is  difficult  to  evaluate  cumulative  impacts  of  a  single  source  or  combination  of  GHG  emission 
sources  for  the  following  reasons: 

•  the  impact  is  global  rather  than  local  or  regional; 

•  the  impact  is  not  particularly  sensitive  to  the  location  of  the  release  point; 

•  the  magnitude  of  individual  GHG  sources  related  to  human  activity,  no  matter  how  large 
compared  to  other  sources,  is  small  when  compared  to  the  total  mass  of  GHGs  that  exist  in 
the  atmosphere;  and 

•  the  total  number  and  variety  of  GHG  emission  sources  are  extremely  large  and  are 
ubiquitous. 

The  above  points  are  illustrated  by  the  comparison  of  annual  emission  rates  of  carbon  dioxide 
(C02),  one  of  the  principal  GHGs,  as  shown  in  Table  7-3.

In  the  U.S.,  the  national  annual  GHG  emission  rate  was  6.7  billion  metric  tons  (MT)  carbon 
dioxide  equivalent  (C02e)  in  201 1 ,  and  of  that  amount,  5.3  billion  MT  C02e  was  from  fossil-fuel 
combustion  (EPA  2013-TN281 5).  The  total  GHG  emissions  in  New  Jersey  were  projected  to  be 
143  million  MT  of  gross  C02e  in  2010  and,  of  that  total,  the  energy-related  emissions  from 
electricity  generation,  residential/commercial/industrial  fuel  combustion,  transportation,  and 
fossil-fuel  industry  were  projected  to  be  about  131  million  MT  C02e  (NJDEP  2008-TN2776). 
Appendix  A  to  Attachment  1  of  the  Interim  Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental  Issues  Associated 
with  New  Reactors  (NRC  2014-TN3767)  provides  details  of  the  review  team’s  estimate  for  a 
reference  1,000-MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant.  The  review  team  estimated  the  total  nuclear 
power  plant  lifecycle  footprint  to  be  10,500,000  MT  C02e,  with  a  7-year  preconstruction  and

Cumulative  Impacts 


construction  phase,  40  years  of  operation,  and  10  years  of  decommissioning.  This  value  may 
differ  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  depending  on  which  reactor  technology  is 
chosen  and  the  electrical  output  of  the  new  plant.  The  uranium  fuel-cycle  phase  is  projected  to 
generate  the  highest  emissions  (see  Appendix  K).  Table  7-3  lists  GHG  emissions  from  normal 
operations,  including  the  uranium  fuel  cycle,  as  260,000  MT  C02e  per  year.  These  emissions 
are  significantly  less  than  the  GHG  emissions  projected  for  New  Jersey  or  from  fossil-fuel 
combustion  in  the  United  States  for  the  year  201 1 . 

Even  though  GHG  emission  estimates  from  normal  operations  are  small  compared  to  other 
sources,  the  applicant  should  consider  measures  that  would  reduce  GHG  emissions.  These 
could  include,  but  would  not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  energy-efficient  design  features  and 
features  to  reduce  space  heating  and  air  conditioning  energy  requirements,  use  of  renewable 
energy  sources,  use  of  low-GHG-emitting  vehicles,  and  other  policies  to  reduce  GHG  emissions 
from  vehicle  use,  such  as  anti-idling  policies  and  vanpooling  or  carpooling. 

An  evaluation  of  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  requires  the  use  of  a  global  climate 
model.  The  GCRP  report  (GCRP  2014-TN3472)  provides  a  synthesis  of  the  results  of 
numerous  climate  modeling  studies;  hence,  the  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  around 
the  world  as  presented  in  the  GCRP  report  provide  an  appropriate  basis  for  the  evaluation  of 
cumulative  impacts.  Based  primarily  on  the  scientific  assessments  of  GCRP  and  the  National 
Research  Council,  the  EPA  Administrator  issued  a  determination  in  2009  (74  FR  66496-TN245) 
that  GHGs  in  the  atmosphere  may  reasonably  be  anticipated  to  endanger  public  health  and 
welfare,  based  on  observed  and  projected  effects  of  GHGs,  their  impact  on  climate  change,  and 
the  public  health  and  welfare  risks  and  impacts  associated  with  such  climate  change. 

Therefore,  national  and  worldwide  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  reflect  conditions 
within  the  MODERATE  impact  level  for  air  quality  related  to  GHG  emissions,  which  are 
noticeable  but  not  destabilizing. 

Based  on  the  impacts  set  forth  in  the  GCRP  report  and  on  the  GHG  emissions  criteria  in  the 
final  EPA  GHG  Tailoring  Rule  (75  FR  31514-TN1404),  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
national  and  worldwide  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  are  noticeable  but  not 
destabilizing,  with  or  without  the  contribution  of  GHG  emissions  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Consequently,  the  review  team  recognizes  that  GHG  emissions,  including  CO2,  from  individual 
stationary  sources  and,  cumulatively,  from  multiple  sources  can  contribute  to  climate  change. 
Section  9.2.5  contains  a  comparison  of  carbon  footprints  of  the  viable  energy  alternatives. 

7.6.3  Summary 

Cumulative  impacts  to  air-quality  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation.  Other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  activities  exist  in  the  geographic  areas  of  interest  (local  and  regional  for 
criteria  pollutants  and  global  for  GHG  emissions)  that  could  affect  air-quality  resources.  The 
cumulative  impacts  on  criteria  pollutants  from  emissions  of  effluents  from  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  other  projects  would  not  be  noticeable.  The  new  plant  and  the  other 
projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  would  have  minimal  impacts.  The  national  and  worldwide  cumulative

Cumulative  Impacts 


impacts  of  GHG  emissions  are  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
the  cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing,  with  or  without  the  GHG 
emissions  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  on  air- 
quality  resources  in  the  geographic  areas  of  interest  would  be  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  and 
MODERATE  for  GHGs.  The  incremental  contribution  of  NRC-authorized  activities  on  air-quality 
resources  for  both  criteria  pollutants  and  GHGs  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the 
cumulative  impact.  Operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  ESP  site  would 
considerably  reduce  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  and  GHGs  from  fossil-fueled  plants  that 
would  otherwise  be  needed  to  supply  the  demand  for  power  (see  Section  8.5). 

7.7  Nonradiological  Health 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.10  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  analysis  for  nonradiological  health.  As  described  in  Section  4.8,  the  nonradiological 
health  impacts  from  noise,  air  quality,  and  occupational  injuries  from  preconstruction-  and 
construction-related  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL, 
and  no  mitigation  beyond  that  proposed  by  PSEG  would  be  warranted.  Transportation  of 
personnel  and  construction  materials  would  result  in  a  minimal  increase  in  traffic  accident 
impacts  associated  with  the  impacts  of  the  construction  workforce  traveling  to  and  from  the 
PSEG  Site.  Mitigation  of  traffic  impacts  discussed  in  Section  4.4  would  reduce  traffic  accident 
impacts  related  to  building  activities,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  As  described  in  Section  5.8,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of 
operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  nonradiological  health  would  be  SMALL,  and  no 
further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

In  addition  to  the  impacts  from  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operations,  this  cumulative 
analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  (see  Table  7-1).  Most  of  the 
nonradiological  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (e.g.,  noise, 
etiological  agents,  and  occupational  injuries)  would  be  localized  and  would  not  have  a 
significant  impact  at  offsite  locations.  However,  impacts  such  as  vehicle  emissions  associated 
with  transporting  personnel  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site  would  affect  a  larger  area.  Therefore,  for 
nonradiological  health  impacts,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for  cumulative  impacts  analysis 
includes  projects  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  based  on  the  influence  of  vehicle  and 
other  air  emissions  sources.  For  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  potential  transmission 
lines,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  the  potential  transmission  line  corridor.  These 
geographical  areas  of  interest  are  expected  to  encompass  areas  where  public  and  worker 
health  could  be  influenced  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  future  transmission  lines  (if 
needed),  in  combination  with  any  past,  present,  or  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions.  For 
occupational  injuries,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  Artificial  Island,  including  the  workers 
at  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  units  and  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Current  projects  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative 
nonradiological  health  impacts  include  the  energy  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1,  as  well  as  vehicle 
emissions  and  existing  urbanization-related  activities.  Reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects 


NUREG-2168

Cumulative  Impacts 


in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  nonradiological  health 
impacts  include  new  industrial/business  projects  and  future  urbanization. 

The  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  projects  could  contribute  to  cumulative  occupational  injuries. 
However,  adherence  to  existing  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  requirements  at 
both  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  units  and  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  help  keep  cumulative 
occupational  injuries  to  a  minimal  level. 

Existing  and  potential  development  of  new  transmission  lines  could  increase  nonradiological 
health  impacts  from  exposure  to  acute  electromagnetic  fields  (EMFs).  However,  adherence  to 
Federal  criteria  and  State  utility  codes  would  help  keep  any  cumulative  nonradiological  health 
impacts  at  a  minimal  level.  With  regard  to  the  chronic  effects  of  EMFs,  the  scientific  evidence 
on  human  health  does  not  conclusively  link  extremely-low-frequency  EMFs  to  adverse  health 
impacts.  Cumulative  impacts  from  noise  and  vehicle  emissions  associated  with  current 
urbanization  and  the  current  operations  of  SGS  and  HCGS  could  occur.  However,  as  discussed 
in  Sections  4.8  and  5.8,  the  relative  contribution  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
to  these  impacts  would  be  temporary  and  minimal,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  SGS  and  HCGS 
facilities  would  continue  to  comply  with  local,  State,  and  Federal  regulations  governing  noise 
and  emissions. 

Nonradiological  traffic  accident  impacts  are  related  to  the  additional  traffic  on  the  regional  and 
local  highway  networks  leading  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site.  Additional  traffic  would  result  from 
shipments  of  construction  materials  and  movements  of  construction  personnel  to  and  from  the 
site.  The  additional  traffic  would  increase  the  risk  of  traffic  accidents,  injuries,  and  fatalities.  A 
review  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  identified  one  transportation-related  project  in  the  50-mi 
region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site:  road  widening  associated  with  the  Salem-Hancocks  Bridge 
Road.  This  project  is  in  progress  and  would  be  completed  by  the  time  building  activities  at  the 
PSEG  Site  commenced.  Therefore,  it  is  unlikely  to  contribute  to  cumulative  transportation 
impacts. 

Three  new  development  or  redevelopment  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1  could  involve  new 
construction  with  the  potential  to  increase  nonradiological  impacts:  Camp  Pedricktown 
Redevelopment,  construction  of  the  Agricultural  Products  Business  Park,  and  construction  of 
the  Gateway  Business  Park.  These  projects  are  located  between  19.9  and  36.9  mi  from  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  they  would  have  a  smaller  scope  and  lower  resource  and  personnel 
requirements  than  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore, 
these  projects  are  not  likely  to  result  in  a  measurable  cumulative  impact. 

Based  on  the  magnitude  of  new  nuclear  power  plant  construction  relative  to  the  other 
construction  activities  discussed  above,  the  review  team  concludes  the  cumulative 
nonradiological  transportation  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  and  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  would  be 
minimal,  and  no  further  mitigation  beyond  that  discussed  Sections  4.8  and  5.8  is  warranted. 

The  health  impacts  of  operating  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  were  evaluated  relative  to  the  Delaware  River  and  the  potential  propagation  of 
etiological  microorganisms.  As  discussed  in  Section  5.8,  the  thermal  discharges  from  the 


November  2015 


7-41 


NUREG-21 68 


Cumulative  Impacts 


operation  of  a  new  plant  would  not  have  impacts  on  the  concentration  levels  of  indigenous  or 
etiological  microorganisms. 

The  review  team  also  is  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  human  health 
and  has  considered  a  recent  compilation  of  the  state  of  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472)  in  preparing  this  EIS.  Projected  changes  in  the  climate  for  the  region  during  the  life  of 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  include 

•  reduced  cooling  system  efficiency  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (and  other  power 
generation  facilities),  which  would  result  in  increased  temperature  of  the  cooling  tower 
discharge  water  and  possible  increased  growth  of  etiological  agents; 

•  increased  incidence  of  diseases  transmitted  by  food,  water,  and  insects  following  heavy 
downpours  and  severe  storms;  and 

•  increased  severity  of  water  pollution  associated  with  sediments,  fertilizers,  herbicides, 
pesticides,  and  thermal  pollution  caused  by  projected  heavier  rainfall  intensity  and  longer 
periods  of  drought. 

The  review  team  did  not  identify  anything  that  would  alter  its  conclusion  that  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  have  no  appreciable  impact  on  nonradiological  human  health  including  the 
presence  of  etiological  agents  or  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. 

Cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  information  from 
PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  of  impacts  resulting  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  along  with  a  review  of  potential  impacts  from  other  past,  present, 
and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  and  from  urbanization  in  the  geographic  areas  of 
interest.  The  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  impacts  on  the  nonradiological  health  of 
the  public  and  workers  would  be  SMALL  and  that  mitigation  beyond  that  discussed  in  Sections 

4.8  and  5.8  would  not  be  warranted.  The  review  team  acknowledges,  however,  that  there  is  still 
uncertainty  associated  with  the  chronic  effects  of  EMFs. 

7.8  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operation 

The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Section  2.11  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the 
cumulative  impacts  assessment  in  this  resource  area.  As  described  in  Section  4.9,  the  NRC 
staff  concludes  that  the  radiological  impacts  to  construction  workers  engaged  in  building 
activities  would  be  SMALL,  radiological  impacts  from  NRC-authorized  construction  would  be 
SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  As  described  in  Section  5.9,  the  NRC 
staff  concludes  that  the  radiological  impacts  from  normal  operations  would  be  SMALL,  and  no 
further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

The  combined  radiological  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  were  described  in 
Section  4.9  and  determined  to  be  SMALL.  In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction, 
preconstruction,  and  operations,  this  cumulative  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present, 
and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  radiological 
impacts.  For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  area  within  a 
50-mi  radius  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Historically,  the  NRC  has  used  the 
50-mi  radius  as  a  standard  bounding  geographic  area  to  evaluate  population  doses  from  routine

Cumulative  Impacts 


releases  from  nuclear  power  plants.  The  area  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  includes 
HCGS;  SGS  Units  1  and  2;  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  Units  1  and  2;  and  Limerick 
Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2.  The  Shieldalloy  radioactive  materials  decommissioning  site 
in  Newfield,  New  Jersey,  is  also  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Also,  within  the  50-mi  radius  of 
the  site,  there  are  likely  to  be  hospitals  and  industrial  facilities  that  use  radioactive  materials. 

As  described  in  Section  4.9,  the  estimates  of  doses  to  workers  during  construction  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  well  within  the  NRC  annual  exposure  limits  (i.e., 

100  millirem  [mrem]  per  year)  designed  to  protect  the  public  health.  This  estimate  includes 
exposure  to  construction  workers  from  the  existing  units  at  SGS,  the  unit  at  HCGS,  ISFSI,  and 
the  first  unit  of  an  API  000  during  construction  of  the  second  unit,  if  an  API  000  is  selected  for 
the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  dose  to  the  maximally  exposed  individual  from 
existing  units  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  well  within  the  EPA’s 
regulatory  standard  of  40  CFR  Part  190  (TN739).  In  addition,  based  on  results  of  the 
Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring  Program  (REMP)  and  the  estimates  of  doses  from  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  to  biota  other  than  humans  given  in  Chapter  5.9,  the  NRC  staff  concludes 
that  the  cumulative  radiological  impact  on  biota  other  than  humans  would  not  be  significant. 

The  results  of  the  REMP  indicate  that  effluents  and  direct  radiation  from  area  hospitals  and 
industrial  facilities  that  use  radioactive  materials  do  not  contribute  measurably  to  the  cumulative 
dose  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative  radiological  impacts  of  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  along  with  the  existing  units  at  SGS  and  HCGS,  the 
ISFSI,  and  the  influence  of  other  human-made  sources  of  radiation  nearby,  would  be  SMALL, 
and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

7.9  Nonradiological  Waste  Systems 

Cumulative  impacts  on  water  and  air  from  nonradiological  waste  are  discussed  in  Sections  7.2 
and  7.6,  respectively.  The  description  of  the  affected  environment  in  Chapter  2  serves  as  the 
baseline  for  the  cumulative  impact  assessments  in  this  resource  area.  As  described  in 
Sections  4.10  and  5.10,  the  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  and  operation  were 
determined  to  be  SMALL,  and  further  mitigation  would  not  be  warranted.  In  addition  to  the 
impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative  analysis  also 
considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect 
nonradiological  waste  systems. 

Cumulative  impacts  on  water  and  air  from  nonradiological  waste  are  discussed  in  Sections  7.2 
and  7.6,  respectively.  The  cumulative  impacts  of  nonradioactive  waste  destined  for  land-based 
treatment  and  disposal  are  related  to  (1 )  the  available  capacity  of  the  area  treatment  and 
disposal  facilities  and  (2)  the  amount  of  solid  waste  generated  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  and  the  current  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  listed  in  Table  7-1. 
For  this  cumulative  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  includes  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey  (in  which  the  PSEG  Site  is  located)  and  the  other  24  counties  located  in  the  50-mi  region 
around  the  PSEG  Site.  The  50-mi  region  includes  counties  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  Maryland, 
and  Pennsylvania  (Section  2.2.3).  The  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  confined  to 


November  2015 


7-43 


NUREG-2168 


Cumulative  Impacts 


Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  when  combined  with  other  actions  (see 
Table  7-1)  would  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  Maryland,  and 
Pennsylvania. 

Nonradioactive  wastes  generated  by  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  managed  in  accordance  with  applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws  and 
regulations  and  with  permit  requirements.  As  described  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280), 
nonradiological  waste  management  practices  for  a  new  plant  would  be  similar  to  those  currently 
implemented  for  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  would  include  the  following: 

•  nonradioactive  solid  waste  would  be  collected  and  stored  temporarily  on  the  PSEG  Site  and 
disposed  of  offsite  only  at  authorized  and  licensed  commercial  waste-disposal  sites  or 
recovered  at  an  offsite  permitted  recycling  or  recovery  facility,  as  appropriate; 

•  sanitary  waste  would  be  treated  on  the  site; 

•  debris  (e.g.,  vegetation)  collected  on  trash  screens  at  the  water  intake  structure  would  be 
disposed  of  offsite  as  solid  waste,  in  accordance  with  State  regulations; 

•  scrap  metal,  lead  acid  batteries,  and  paper  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  recycled; 

•  water  discharges  from  cooling  and  auxiliary  systems  would  be  discharged  directly  and 
indirectly  to  the  Delaware  River  through  permitted  outfalls;  and 

•  air  emissions  from  operations  of  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
compliant  with  air-quality  standards  as  permitted  by  NJDEP. 

During  preconstruction  and  construction,  offsite  land-based  waste  treatment  and  disposal  would 
be  minimized  by  production  and  delivery  of  modular  plant  units;  by  segregation  of  recyclable 
materials;  and  by  management  of  vegetative  waste,  excavated  materials,  and  dredged  materials 
onsite  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  described  in  Section  4.10.1,  the  solid  waste  impacts  from 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal  with  no 
additional  mitigation  warranted.  The  few  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  listed  in 
Table  7-1  generally  either  would  not  coincide  with  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or 
would  produce  waste  streams  of  a  different  nature. 

The  types  of  nonradioactive  solid  waste  that  would  be  generated,  handled,  and  disposed  of 
during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  include  municipal  waste,  dredge  spoils, 
sewage  treatment  sludge,  and  industrial  wastes.  In  addition,  small  quantities  of  hazardous 
waste  and  mixed  waste  (waste  that  has  both  hazardous  and  radioactive  characteristics),  would 
be  generated  during  operations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  described  in  Section  5.10.1  and 
mentioned  above,  the  effective  practices  already  in  place  at  SGS  and  HCGS  for  recycling, 
minimizing,  and  managing  waste  would  be  used  at  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site;  thus, 
expected  impacts  on  land  from  nonradioactive  wastes  generated  during  operation  of  a  new 
plant  would  be  minimal,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.  Several  of  the  projects 
listed  in  Table  7-1  would  generate  municipal  and  industrial  waste.  However,  no  known  capacity 
constraints  exist  for  the  treatment  or  disposal  of  such  types  of  waste  within  New  Jersey, 
Delaware,  or  the  nation  as  a  whole  (EPA  201 1 -TN2723;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Of  the  projects 
listed  in  Table  7-1,  SGS,  HCGS,  hospitals,  and  other  industrial  facilities  that  use  radioactive 
materials  have  the  potential  to  generate  mixed  waste.  However,  none  of  the  considered 


NUREG-2168 


7-44 


November  2015 


Cumulative  Impacts 


projects  is  expected  to  generate  mixed  waste  in  significant  quantities  above  the  current  rates, 
and  therefore  cumulative  impacts  would  be  minimal. 

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
nonradioactive  and  mixed  waste  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  minimal.  Therefore,  based  on  the 
information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team's  independent  review,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  from  nonradioactive  waste  would  be  SMALL  for  the 
50-mi  region. 

7.10  Postulated  Accidents 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 .4.  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  potential  environmental 
impacts  (risks)  of  a  postulated  accident  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL.  Section  5.1 1  considers  both  design  basis  accidents  (DBAs)  and 
severe  accidents.  As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 .1 ,  the  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental 
consequences  of  DBAs  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL  for  a  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized 
Water  Reactor  (US-APWR),  two  APIOOOs,  a  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor  (U.S.  EPR),  or 
an  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR).  DBAs  are  addressed  specifically  to  demonstrate 
that  a  reactor  design  is  robust  enough  to  meet  NRC  safety  criteria.  The  consequences  of  DBAs 
are  bounded  by  the  consequences  of  severe  accidents. 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 .2,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  severe-accident  probability- 
weighted  consequences  (i.e.,  risks)  of  a  US-APWR.  two  APIOOOs.  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an  ABWR  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  compared  to  risks  to  which  the  population  is  generally 
exposed,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted. 

The  cumulative  analysis  considers  risk  from  potential  severe  accidents  at  all  other  existing  and 
proposed  nuclear  power  plants  that  have  the  potential  to  increase  risks  at  any  location  within 
50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  50-mi  radius  was  selected  to  cover  any  potential  overlaps  from 
two  or  more  nuclear  plants.  Existing  reactors  that  contribute  to  risk  within  the  geographic  area 
of  interest  include  HCGS  (Unit  1),  SGS  (Units  1  and  2),  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station 
Units  2  and  3,  Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating 
Station,  Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1 
and  2. 

Tables  5-30  and  5-31  in  Section  5.1 1.3.2  provide  comparisons  of  estimated  risk  for  the 
proposed  new  reactor  (a  US-APWR.  two  AP-IOOOs,  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an  ABWR)  and  current- 
generation  reactors.  The  estimated  population  dose  risk  for  the  new  reactor(s)  is  well  below  the 
mean  and  median  value  for  current-generation  reactors.  In  addition,  estimates  of  average 
individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  are  well  below  the  Commission’s  safety 
goals  (51  FR  30028-TN594).  For  existing  nuclear  generating  stations  within  the  geographic 
area  of  interest — namely  HCGS  (Unit  1),  SGS  (Units  1  and  2),  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power 
Station  Units  2  and  3,  Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear 
Generating  Station,  Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power 
Plant  Units  1  and  2 — the  Commission  has  determined  that  the  probability-weighted 
consequences  of  severe  accidents  are  small  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250). 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Cumulative  Impacts 


It  is  expected  that  risks  for  any  new  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  well  below  risks  for 
current-generation  reactors  and  would  meet  the  Commission’s  safety  goals.  The  severe 
accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  gets  smaller  as  the  distance  from  that 
plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  these  operating  and  proposed  nuclear  power 
plants.  Even  though  there  potentially  would  be  several  plants  included  in  the  combination,  this 
combined  risk  still  would  be  low.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
risks  of  postulated  accidents  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  likely  would  be 
SMALL,  and  no  further  mitigation  should  be  warranted. 

7.11  Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 

The  cumulative  impacts  related  to  the  fuel  cycle,  radiological  and  nonradiological  aspects  of 
transportation,  and  facility  decommissioning  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
described  below. 

7.11.1  Fuel  Cycle 

As  described  in  Section  6.1 ,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  the  fuel  cycle  due  to 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL.  Fuel-cycle  impacts 
not  only  would  occur  at  the  site  but  also  would  be  scattered  through  other  locations  in  the  United 
States  or,  in  the  case  of  foreign-purchased  uranium,  in  other  countries. 

Table  S-3  of  10  CFR  51.51  (TN250)  provides  the  environmental  impacts  from  uranium  fuel- 
cycle  operations  for  a  model  1,000-MW(e)  light  water  reactor  operating  at  80  percent  capacity 
with  a  12-month  fuel-loading  cycle  and  an  average  fuel  burnup  of  33,000  megawatt-days  per 
metric  ton  of  uranium  (MWd/MTU).  Per  1 0  CFR  51 .51  (a)  (TN250),  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that 
those  impacts  would  be  acceptable  for  the  1,000-MW(e)  reference  reactor.  The  impacts  of 
producing  and  disposing  of  nuclear  fuel  include  mining  the  uranium  ore,  milling  the  ore, 
converting  the  uranium  oxide  to  uranium  hexafluoride,  enriching  the  uranium  hexafluoride, 
fabricating  the  fuel  (where  the  uranium  hexafluoride  is  converted  to  uranium  oxide  fuel  pellets), 
and  disposing  of  the  spent  fuel  in  a  proposed  Federal  waste  repository.  As  discussed  in  Section 
6.1 ,  advances  in  reactors  since  the  development  of  Table  S-3  in  10  CFR  51 .51  (TN250)  would 
reduce  environmental  impacts  relative  to  the  operating  reference  reactor.  For  example,  a 
number  of  fuel-management  improvements  have  been  adopted  by  nuclear  power  plants  to 
achieve  higher  performance  and  to  reduce  fuel  and  separative  work  (enrichment)  requirements. 
As  discussed  in  Section  6.1,  the  environmental  impacts  of  fuel-cycle  activities  for  a  proposed 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  conservatively  be  about  3  times  those  presented  in  Table  S-3  of 
10  CFR  51.51  (TN250). 

Existing  nuclear  facilities  in  close  proximity  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  include  SGS 
Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  Unit  1.  Other  plants,  such  as  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  and 
Limerick  Generating  Station,  are  sufficiently  distant  that  environmental  impacts  resulting  from 
fuel-cycle  activities  at  these  facilities  would  remain  isolated  from  those  associated  with  proposed 
and  existing  facilities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  net  environmental  impacts  of  fuel- 
cycle  activities  for  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  combined  with  the  existing  Salem  and 
Hope  Creek  units  would  conservatively  be  about  7  times  those  presented  in  Table  S-3  of 
10  CFR  51 .51  (TN250).  Only  a  small  portion  of  this  impact  would  be  realized  near  the  PSEG 


NUREG-2168

Cumulative  Impacts 


Site.  The  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative  fuel-cycle  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal,  and  additional  mitigation  would  not  be 
warranted. 

7.11.2  Transportation  of  Radioactive  Material 

As  described  in  Section  6.2,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  impacts  of  transporting  unirradiated 
fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  from  the  site  would  be  SMALL. 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operations,  the  cumulative 
analysis  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could 
contribute  to  cumulative  transportation  impacts.  For  this  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  is  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site. 

Historically,  the  radiological  impacts  on  the  public  and  environment  associated  with 
transportation  of  radioactive  materials  in  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  have  been 
associated  with  shipments  of  fuel  and  waste  to  and  from  the  existing  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and 
HCGS,  located  adjacent  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Radiological  impacts  of  transporting  radioactive 
materials  would  occur  along  the  routes  leading  to  and  from  the  PSEG  Site,  SGS,  HCGS,  and 
fuel-fabrication  facilities  and  waste-disposal  sites  located  in  other  parts  of  the  United  States. 
Because  of  their  distance  from  the  PSEG  Site,  it  is  not  likely  that  shipments  to  or  from  the 
Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  or  the  Limerick  Generating  Station  would  be  associated 
with  cumulative  radiological  transportation  impacts.  No  other  major  activities  with  the  potential 
for  cumulative  radiological  transportation  impacts  were  identified  in  the  geographic  area  of 
interest.  Based  on  Table  S-4  in  10  CFR  51.52  (TN250),  the  impacts  of  transporting  unirradiated 
fuel  to  SGS  and  HCGS  and  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  from  SGS  and  HCGS  would  be 
minimal.  When  combined  with  the  impacts  of  transporting  unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site 
and  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  from  the  site,  the  cumulative  impacts  of  transporting 
unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  to  SGS  and  HCGS,  as  well  as  irradiated  fuel  and 
radioactive  waste  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  from  SGS  and  HCGS,  also  would  be  minimal.  The 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  in  the  region  surrounding  the  PSEG 
Site  are  also  a  small  fraction  of  the  impacts  from  natural  background  radiation. 

Advances  in  reactor  technology  and  operations  since  the  development  of  Table  S-4  would 
reduce  environmental  impacts  relative  to  the  values  in  Table  S-4  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250); 
therefore,  the  values  in  Table  S-4  remain  bounding.  For  example,  improvements  in  fuel 
management  have  been  adopted  by  nuclear  power  plants  to  achieve  higher  performance  and 
reduce  fuel  requirements.  This  leads  to  fewer  unirradiated  fuel  and  spent  fuel  shipments  than 
the  1,000-MW(e)  reference  reactor  discussed  in  10  CFR  51.52  (TN250).  In  addition,  advances 
in  shipping  cask  designs  to  increase  capabilities  would  result  in  fewer  shipments  of  spent  fuel  to 
offsite  storage  or  disposal  facilities.  This  would  reduce  the  cumulative  impacts  of  transporting 
unirradiated  fuel  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  to  SGS  and  HCGS  and  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive 
waste  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  from  SGS  and  HCGS. 

Therefore,  the  NRC  staff  considers  the  cumulative  impacts  of  transporting  unirradiated  fuel  to 
and  irradiated  fuel  and  radioactive  waste  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  to  be 
minor,  and  no  further  mitigation  would  be  warranted.

7.11.3  Decommissioning 

As  discussed  in  Section  6.3,  the  environmental  impacts  from  decommissioning  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be  SMALL  because  the  licensee  would  have  to 
comply  with  decommissioning  regulatory  requirements. 

In  this  cumulative  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG 
Site.  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  Unit  1  are  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  PSEG  Site. 
Other  nuclear  facilities  located  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site  include  Peach  Bottom  Atomic 
Power  Station  Units  2  and  3  about  44  mi  northwest  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and  Limerick  Generating 
Station  Units  1  and  2  about  50  mi  north  of  the  PSEG  Site.  In  Supplement  1  to  the  Generic 
Environmental  Impact  Statement  on  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Facilities,  the  NRC  found  the 
impacts  on  radiation  dose  to  workers  and  the  public,  waste  management,  water  quality,  air 
quality,  ecological  resources,  and  socioeconomics  to  be  small  (NRC  2002-TN665).  In  addition, 
in  Section  6.3,  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  the  impact  of  GHG  emissions  on  air  quality  during 
decommissioning  would  be  minimal.  Therefore,  the  cumulative  impacts  from  decommissioning 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal,  and  additional 
mitigation  would  not  be  warranted. 

7.11.4  Summary  of  Cumulative  Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning 
Impacts 

Based  on  the  analysis  above,  the  cumulative  impacts  from  fuel-cycle  activities,  transportation  of 
radioactive  material,  and  decommissioning  would  be  SMALL,  and  additional  mitigation  would 
not  be  warranted. 

7.12  Conclusions 

The  review  team  considered  the  potential  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  construction, 
preconstruction,  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  together  with 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions.  The  specific  resources  that 
could  be  affected  by  the  proposed  action  and  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
actions  in  the  same  geographic  area  were  assessed.  This  assessment  included  the  impacts  of 
construction  and  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  as  described  in  Chapters  4  and  5, 
respectively;  impacts  of  preconstruction  activities  as  described  in  Chapter  4;  impacts  of  fuel- 
cycle,  transportation,  and  decommissioning  impacts  described  in  Chapter  6;  and  impacts  of 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  Federal  and  non-Federal  actions  (listed 
in  Table  7-1)  that  could  affect  the  same  resources  as  the  proposed  action. 

Table  7-4  summarizes  the  cumulative  impacts  by  resource  area.  The  cumulative  impacts  for 
most  of  the  resource  areas  would  be  SMALL,  although  there  could  be  MODERATE  or  LARGE 
cumulative  impacts  for  some  resources,  as  described  below.

incremental  contribution  to  cumulative  surface-water-quality  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor  because  the  volume  of  discharge  is 
small  relative  to  the  volume  of  the  Delaware  River,  and  discharges  are  subject  to  permit  limits.

reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities,  including  climate  change,  on  the  aquatic  resources  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  would  be  MODERATE  to  LARGE.  However,  the  incremental  contribution 
of  the  NRC-authorized  activities  related  to  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  MODERATE  to 
LARGE  impact.

8.0  NEED  FOR  POWER 


PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  has  submitted  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  an  application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  to  expand  its 
nuclear  generation  capacity.  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC,  are  merchant  power 
generators,  separate  entities  from  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company  (PSE&G),  which  is 
one  of  four  electric  delivery  companies  (EDCs)  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  The  New  Jersey 
Board  of  Public  Utilities  (NJBPU)  has  limited  or  no  regulatory  authority  over  PSEG.  Instead, 
NJBPU's  regulatory  authority  is  limited  to  the  EDCs  that  are  responsible  for  the  distribution  of 
electricity  throughout  New  Jersey,  including  the  array  of  social  programs  and  renewable 
technologies  required  to  meet  New  Jersey’s  Renewable  Portfolio  Standard  (New  Jersey  201 1- 
TN21 1 5).  Any  new  nuclear  power  plant  built  and  operated  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  function  as 
a  merchant  power  vendor  supplying  wholesale  power  to  the  competitive  power  markets 
administered  by  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC  (PJM),  which  is  the  regional  transmission 
organization  (RTO)  for  the  area.  PSEG  indicated  in  its  Environmental  Report  (ER)  that  the 
relevant  service  area  (RSA)  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  the  State  of  New  Jersey 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  For  consistency  between  the  need  for  power  analysis  and  the 
applicant’s  stated  purpose  and  need  for  the  action,  the  review  team  determined  that  a  need  for 
power  assessment  that  looked  exclusively  at  the  demand  and  generating  assets  of  the  four 
utility  regions  of  New  Jersey  was  a  reasonable  area  of  study. 

In  accordance  with  guidance  from  NUREG-1555,  Standard  Review  Plans  for  Environmental 
Reviews  for  Nuclear  Power  Plants:  Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan  (NRC  2000-TN614), 
and  the  staffs  internal  guidance,  ISG-026,  Interim  Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental  Issues 
Associated  with  New  Reactors  (1SIRC  2014-TN3767),  the  need  for  power  analysis  period 
extends  3  years  past  the  planned  commercial  operation  date.  Because  of  limitations  in  the  data 
upon  which  the  review  team  relied,  forecasts  for  demand,  supply,  and  the  need  for  power  are 
provided  only  through  2023 — 2  years  after  the  planned  commercial  operation  date  of  2021 . 
However,  given  the  method  used  to  develop  the  forecasts,  the  review  team  determined  that  the 
difference  in  projections  between  the  second  and  third  year  of  operation — 12  and  13  years  past 
the  beginning  of  forecasted  data — would  be  sufficiently  small  that  the  assessment  considering  2 
years  after  planned  operation  was  a  reasonable  approximation  of  the  need  for  power  in  the 
PSEG  service  area. 

PSEG  prepared  the  initial  forecasts  for  electricity  demand,  supply,  and  need  for  power  in  early 
2010  using  data  and  information  available  at  that  time.  The  review  team  assessed  the 
applicant’s  need  for  power  determination  and  the  impact  of  key  changes  in  the  economy  and 
electric  power  markets  that  have  occurred  since  2010,  based  on  2013  PJM  data  and 
information.  This  chapter  represents  the  review  team’s  assessment  of  the  need  for  power 
based  on  the  information  in  the  applicant’s  ER,  important  changes  in  the  power  market  that 
have  emerged  since  2010  (in  particular,  the  burgeoning  natural  gas  market),  and  their  impact  on 
the  RSA. 

The  ESP  application  is  based  on  a  plant  parameter  envelope  approach  that  considers  the 
environmental  impacts  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  using  design  parameters  from  four  potential 
power  plant  designs:  the  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor,  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor,

8-1 


NUREG-2168 


Need  For  Power 


U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor,  and  Advanced  Passive  1000  (two-unit)  designs. 
Because  the  two-unit  Advanced  Passive  1000  plant  has  a  larger  net  electrical  output  at 
2,200  MW(e)  than  a  single  unit  of  any  of  the  other  reactor  designs,  the  review  team  selected  it 
as  the  basis  for  the  ESP  need  for  power  determination  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  need  for 
power  analysis  establishes  a  framework  for  evaluating  project  benefits  for  the  region  in  which 
the  majority  of  the  benefits  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  distributed. 

The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  relevant  factors  considered  in  the  review  team’s  need  for 
power  analysis.  The  results  of  the  need  for  power  analysis  are  presented  in  detail  in  the 
remaining  sections  of  this  chapter. 

•  The  applicant  determined  the  market  area  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  be  the  State  of 
New  Jersey. 

•  Average  retail  electricity  rates  in  New  Jersey  are  currently  ranked  tenth  highest  in  the  United 
States  (DOE/EIA  201 3-TN2874)  because  of  the  lack  of  baseload  generation  in  the  market 
area,  which  means  PJM  must  use  intermediate  and  peaking  units  within  New  Jersey  and 
generating  units  from  other  states  to  provide  baseload  power.  In  addition  to  being  more 
expensive,  using  intermediate  or  peaking  units  to  provide  baseload  power  also  contributes 
to  higher  emissions  because  they  are  typically  fossil-fueled. 

•  PSEG  identified,  as  part  of  the  benefits  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  achieving  two  of  the 
five  overarching  goals  of  Governor  Chris  Christie’s  New  Jersey  power  policy,  the  201 1  New 
Jersey  Energy  Master  Plan  (NJEMP).  Those  two  goals  are  to  drive  down  the  cost  of  energy 
for  all  customers  and  promote  a  diverse  portfolio  of  new,  clean,  in-state  generation  (New 
Jersey  201 1-TN21 15). 

The  review  team’s  need  for  power  analysis  relies  on  data  from  the  same  PJM  source  as  the 
applicant  used  in  its  ER,  but  for  later  years.  In  addition,  while  the  applicant  made  its  need  for 
power  determination  based  on  baseload  conditions,  the  staff  made  its  determination  based  on 
total  demand  and  capacity  because  baseload  data  at  the  RTO  level  of  aggregation  are 
extremely  difficult  to  obtain.  However,  the  review  team  determined  that  both  the  applicant’s 
need  for  power  assessment  and  that  performed  by  the  NRC  staff  are  both  reasonable 
approximations  of  the  future  (total  and  baseload)  demand  and  supply  of  electricity  in  2023.  The 
review  team’s  findings  are  discussed  in  detail  in  the  remainder  of  this  chapter,  which  is 
organized  into  four  sections.  Section  8.1  describes  the  market  area  and  the  overall  power 
market  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  addressing  characteristics  such  as  the  geographic  scope, 
population,  major  load  centers,  EDCs,  independent  system  operator  requirements,  status  of 
deregulation,  and  competitive  wholesale  markets.  Section  8.2  describes  the  historical  and 
forecasted  demand  for  electricity  in  the  market  area  served  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  Section  8.3  describes  the  existing  and  planned  power  supply  available  to  meet  the 
demand  for  power  in  the  market  area.  Section  8.4  assesses  the  need  for  the  power  that  would 
be  generated  by  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  by  comparing  the  forecasted 
demand  for  electricity  to  the  planned  power  supply.  Other  considerations,  such  as  the  impact 
generation  from  a  new  plant  would  have  on  imports,  transmission  congestion,  regional 
emissions  including  greenhouse  gases,  and  cost  of  power,  are  topics  discussed  in  Section  10.6.

Need  For  Power 


8.1  Description  of  Power  System 

The  applicant  has  chosen  the  State  of  New  Jersey  as  its  market  area.  This  section  discusses 
the  rationale  for  that  choice  and  describes  factors  in  and  near  New  Jersey  that  affect  power 
markets  in  New  Jersey. 

8.1.1  Rationale  for  Choosing  New  Jersey  as  the  Market  Area 

The  market  area  for  PSEG's  ESP  application  is  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  which  is  part  of  the 
power  market  area  administered  by  PJM,  the  RTO  for  the  area.  The  market  area  is  based  on 
the  region  where  PSEG  delivers  most  of  its  current  generation,  where  it  anticipates  its  future 
new  generation  will  be  delivered,  and  where  it  expects  new  generation  would  provide  the 
greatest  benefit.  The  market  area  has  a  large  population  and  several  major  load  centers. 
Currently,  most  of  New  Jersey’s  baseload  power  needs  are  met  by  imported  power,  with  a 
heavy  reliance  on  local  intermediate  and  peaking  units,  all  of  which  run  on  fossil  fuels.  The 
location  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  in  a  favorable  geographic  area  for 
serving  the  market  area  because  a  new  plant  would  reduce  reliance  on  intermediate  and 
peaking  power  generation  sources  in  the  market  area  and  would  decrease  the  amount  of 
baseload  power  currently  imported  into  the  RSA.  In  addition,  a  significant  portion  of  the  existing 
transmission  system  directly  servicing  the  PSEG  Site  extends  directly  into  the  regions  of  major 
load  within  New  Jersey. 

PJM  expects  New  Jersey  will  continue  to  rely  on  imported  power  to  meet  growth  in  peak  power 
demand.  However,  importing  large  amounts  of  power  often  leads  to  transmission  congestion,  a 
condition  where  increased  power  flows  challenge  the  operational  limits  of  critical  portions  of  the 
transmission  system,  resulting  in  higher  electricity  costs  in  New  Jersey. 

Construction  of  new  transmission  lines  and  upgrades  to  existing  transmission  lines  is  a  long, 
costly,  and  public  process  that  is  required  for  increased  importation  of  power  into  the  RSA.  The 
new  Susquehanna-Roseland  500-kV  transmission  line  project  creates  a  more  stable  link  from 
generation  sources  in  northeastern  and  north-central  Pennsylvania,  across  northeastern 
Pennsylvania  and  into  New  Jersey.  This  new  link  is  required  by  PJM  as  part  of  its  Regional 
Transmission  Expansion  Plan  (RTEP)  to  meet  system  reliability  requirements  in  the  immediate 
future.  However,  due  to  lower  regional  load  growth,  the  installation  of  new  intermediate  and 
peaking  gas-fired  power  plants,  and  the  increase  in  demand  response  (DR)  programs,  the  PJM 
Board  cancelled  two  other  transmission  line  construction  projects  that  were  designed  to  improve 
the  transfer  of  power  from  western  PJM  into  the  Eastern  Mid-Atlantic  Area  Council  (EMAAC) 
region  of  the  PJM  system,  of  which  New  Jersey  is  a  part.  Consequently,  imports  of  baseload 
capacity  from  western  PJM  to  New  Jersey  cannot  be  increased  to  accommodate  increasing 
demand  without  causing  increased  congestion,  higher  power  prices,  and  potential  reliability 
issues. 

Finally,  choosing  New  Jersey  as  the  market  area  is  aligned  with  two  of  the  five  overarching 
goals  of  the  NJEMP  (New  Jersey  201 1-TN21 15). 

To  drive  down  the  cost  of  energy  for  all  customers:  While  nuclear  power  plants  have  high 
construction  costs,  those  costs  are  considered  "sunk  costs”  for  purposes  of  setting  the  price  of

Need  For  Power 


electricity.  For  price  determination,  firms  only  consider  variable  costs — the  cost  of  actually 
producing  electricity  (operations,  maintenance,  fuel,  etc.) — and  nuclear  power  plants  are  among 
the  lowest  variable  cost  producers  in  the  PJM  market.  Introducing  up  to  2,200  MW  of  new,  low- 
cost  electricity  to  the  PJM  Day-Ahead  Market  (DAM)  for  energy  would  displace  the  same 
amount  of  electricity  that  had  formerly  been  among  the  last  units  bid  into  the  market  (i.e. ,  the 
highest  priced  units  that  established  the  market  price  in  the  bid  process),  thereby  reducing  the 
price  of  wholesale  electricity. (1) 

To  promote  a  diverse  portfolio  of  new,  clean,  in-state  generation:  The  intermediate  and 
peaking  units  in  New  Jersey  that  are  dispatched  due  to  the  lack  of  baseload  capacity  are 
typically  fossil-fueled.  Even  considering  the  congestion  relief  projected  by  the  approved 
Susquehanna-Roseland  transmission  project,  the  types  of  generating  units  that  supply  imported 
power  from  the  western  portion  of  PJM  also  are  often  fossil-fueled  and  typically  coal-fired. 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  generate  electricity  while  producing  only 
minimal  criteria  or  hazardous  air  pollutants  or  carbon  dioxide  emissions  and,  while  some 
displaced  fossil-fuel-based  generation  would  find  markets  elsewhere,  some  of  the  displaced 
generating  capacity  likely  could  be  retired,  resulting  in  a  net  reduction  of  these  pollutants. 

8.1.2  Structure  of  Power  Markets  Serving  New  Jersey 

PJM  maintains  the  bulk  electricity  power  supply  system  reliability  for  13  states  and  Washington, 
D.C.  In  doing  so,  PJM  serves  51  million  people,  including  the  major  U.S.  load  centers  from  the 
western  border  of  Illinois  to  the  Atlantic  coast:  the  metropolitan  areas  in  and  around  Baltimore, 
Chicago,  Columbus,  Dayton,  Newark  and  northern  New  Jersey,  Norfolk,  Philadelphia, 

Pittsburgh,  Richmond,  and  Washington,  D.C.  Figure  8-1  displays  the  PJM  service  area.  The 
service  areas  of  the  EDCs  serving  New  Jersey  are  shown  in  Figure  8-2.  These  companies  are 
PSE&G,  Rockland  Electric  Company  (RECO),  Jersey  Central  Power  &  Light  Company  (JCPL), 
and  Atlantic  City  Electric  (AE).  PSE&G  is  one  of  the  largest  combined  electric  and  gas 
companies  in  the  United  States  and  is  also  New  Jersey’s  oldest  and  largest  publicly  owned 
utility.  PSE&G  has  more  than  1.8  million  gas  and  2.2  million  electric  customers  in  more  than 
300  urban,  suburban,  and  rural  communities,  including  the  six  largest  New  Jersey  cities 
(Newark,  Jersey  City,  Paterson,  Elizabeth,  Edison,  and  Woodbridge  Township)  (BGS- 
Auction  2013-TN2284). 

PSE&G  currently  serves  nearly  three-quarters  of  New  Jersey’s  population  in  a  service  area 
covering  a  2,600-mi1 2  diagonal  corridor  from  Bergen  County  in  the  northeastern  portion  to 
Gloucester  County  in  the  southwest.  PSE&G  is  the  largest  provider  of  electric  and  gas  service 
in  New  Jersey.

electricity  into  the  market  that  will  drive  out  marginally  priced  generators,  thereby  lowering  the 

wholesale  price  for  electricity  in  the  market,  the  NRC  also  recognizes  that  the  retail  price  paid  by 
customers  is  dependent  on  a  large  number  of  variables.  Therefore,  discussion  of  retail  prices  or  rates 
is  too  speculative  for  the  purposes  of  an  environmental  impact  statement.

million  residential  and  business  customers  within  3,200  mi2  of  northern  and  central  New  Jersey. 
JCPL  is  a  member  of  the  FirstEnergy  family  of  companies  (BGS-Auction  201 3-TN2284). 

AE,  a  subsidiary  of  Pepco  Holdings,  Inc.,  is  a  regulated  utility  that  provides  electric  service  to 
more  than  574,000  customers  in  southern  New  Jersey  (BGS-Auction  2013-TN2284). 

New  Jersey  has  restructured  the  manner  in  which  utilities  are  regulated,  and  utilities  no  longer 
engage  in  traditional  integrated  resource  planning.  In  1999,  New  Jersey  electricity  customers 
were  allowed  to  choose  their  electricity  provider  through  the  Electric  Discount  and  Energy 
Competition  Act  (State  of  New  Jersey  1999-TN3292).  As  a  result  of  this  Act,  the  different  utility 
responsibilities  were  unbundled  and  the  power  industry  was  separated  into  four  divisions: 
generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  energy  services.  Utilities  were  essentially  required  to 
divest  generating  plants,  and,  as  a  result,  utilities  are  no  longer  the  sole  producers  of  electricity. 
New  Jersey,  in  turn,  no  longer  issues  certificates  of  convenience  and  necessity  for  deregulated 
merchant  power  vendors.  This  means  that  merchant  power  vendors  operate  “at  risk"  rather 
than  under  rate-of-return  regulation.  The  transmission  and  distribution  sectors  remain  subject  to 
regulation  by  the  Federal  government  through  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  and 
NJBPU.  NJBPU  has  adopted  an  auction  mechanism  for  procurement  of  electric  supply 
covering  the  power  needs  of  the  state.

8.1.3  Electric  System  Reliability  in  New  Jersey 

Electricity  provided  to  consumers  in  New  Jersey  is  bought  and  sold  in  the  competitive  wholesale 
electricity  markets  administered  by  PJM  through  the  DAM,  an  auction  where.  1  day  before 
delivery  of  the  power,  electricity  suppliers  make  offers  to  provide  a  specific  amount  of  electricity 
at  a  specific  price.  PJM  separates  DAM  participants  into  two  groups:  (1)  self-scheduling  power 
generators  and  (2)  day-ahead  auction  participants.  Self-scheduling  power  generators  are 
generators  of  electricity  that  sign  annual  agreements  with  PJM  to  participate  in  the  daily  auction 
market  for  planning  purposes  but  to  provide  power  to  the  grid  at  whatever  price  PJM  determines 
as  the  market  price.  Day-ahead  auction  participants  do  not  ensure  their  maximum  participation 
by  acting  as  price  takers  but  instead  compete  hourly  for  a  portion  of  the  remaining  electricity 
market  (after  the  self-scheduled  capacity  is  accounted  for)  by  bidding  a  specific  price  and 
quantity. 

Through  the  DAM,  PJM  incrementally  accepts  bids  from  day-ahead  auction  participants,  starting 
with  the  lowest  remaining  offer  price  (after  the  capacity  of  the  self-scheduling  generators  has 
been  accounted  for),  until  the  sum  of  the  accepted  capacity  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  next  day  s 
expected  demand  for  each  hour.  This  auction  establishes  the  lowest  possible  electricity  market 
price  for  that  day.  To  ensure  grid  reliability,  PJM  divides  its  region  into  three  locational 
deliverability  areas,  allowing  the  RTO  to  anticipate  areas  where  transmission  of  needed  power 
may  be  constrained. 

New  Jersey  is  under  the  jurisdiction  of  Reliabi I ity First  Corporation  (RFC)  for  electric  system 
reliability.  RFC  was  organized  to  develop  regional  standards  for  reliability  planning  and 
operation  of  the  regional  electric  power  system  and  to  provide  nondiscriminatory  compliance 
monitoring  and  enforcement  of  both  the  North  America  Electric  Reliability  Corporation  (NERC) 
and  RFC  standards  in  its  region  (TDW  2005-TN2286).  PJM  establishes  reserve  margin 
requirements  in  compliance  with  RFC  standards  and  coordinates  a  capacity  market  to  ensure 
that  generation  is  available  to  meet  these  requirements.  Figure  8-3  displays  a  map  of  the 
ReliabilityFirst  region. 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  increase  power  grid  reliability  by  adding  up 
to  2,200  MW  of  baseload  generation  within  New  Jersey.  The  agreements  that  PJM  holds  with 
adjacent  NERC  regions  and  subregions  would  allow  a  new  plant  to  support  New  Jersey  loads 
and  potentially  alleviate  conditions  that  can  create  localized  areas  of  congestion  in  the  region. 

As  shown  in  Figure  8-4,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  has  identified  New  Jersey  and 
EMAAC  as  part  of  a  larger  region  within  PJM  having  congestion  problems  that  adversely  affect 
local  economies  (known  as  “critical  congestion  areas”)  (DOE  2013-TN2287).  Limitations  in  the 
west-to-east  transmission  of  power  across  the  Allegheny  Mountains  and  the  growing  demand 
for  baseload  power  at  load  centers  in  New  Jersey  and  along  the  East  Coast  contribute  to  these 
areas  of  congestion.  Section  8.3  discusses  regional  500-kV  transmission  projects  that  have 
been  approved  by  PJM  to  help  address  congestion  issues.

8.1.4  Forecasting  Model  Methodology  and  Sufficiency  Attributes 

For  the  review  team  to  rely  on  the  forecasting  conclusions  of  an  independent  third  party,  the 
NRC  guidance  in  NUREG-1555  states  that  the  analysis  must  be  (1)  systematic, 

(2)  comprehensive,  (3)  subject  to  confirmation,  and  (4)  responsive  to  forecasting  uncertainty 
(NRC  2000-TN614).  PJM  produces  and  publishes  an  annual  peak  load  and  energy  forecast 
report  with  detail  sufficient  to  determine  a  15-year  load  and  energy  forecast  for  New  Jersey.  No 
other  current  load  forecast  for  New  Jersey  matches  the  detail  of  the  PJM  Forecast  Model  in  a 
manner  that  can  be  validated  according  to  NUREG-1 555  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Other  than  the 
annual  peak  load  and  energy  forecasts  performed  by  PJM,  the  NRC  staff  is  not  aware  of  any 
other  comparable  forecasting  system  that  is  publicly  available  and  meets  the  NRC’s  four 
sufficiency  criteria  for  reliability.  The  following  discussion  addresses  how  the  PJM  forecasts 
meet  the  NRC’s  four  criteria. 

Criteria  1:  The  PJM  Load  Forecast  Model  is  systematic.  The  PJM  forecast  process  is 
documented  in  PJM  Manual  19:  Load  Forecasting  and  Analysis  (PJM  2015-TN4306).  It 
employs  econometric  multiple  regression  processes  to  estimate  and  produce  15-year  monthly 
peak  demand  forecasts  assuming  normal  weather  for  each  PJM  zone  and  the  RTO  as  a  whole. 
The  model  incorporates  three  classes  of  variables:  (1 )  calendar  effects,  such  as  day  of  the 
week,  month,  and  holidays;  (2)  economic  conditions;  and  (3)  weather  conditions  across  the 
RTO.  The  model  is  used  to  set  the  expected  peak  loads  for  capacity  obligations  for  reliability 
studies,  and  to  support  transmission  planning.  PJM  uses  gross  metropolitan  product  (GMP)  in 
the  econometric  component  of  its  forecast  model  to  account  for  localized  treatment  of  economic 
effects  within  a  zone.  GMP  is  defined  as  the  market  value  of  all  final  goods  and  services 
produced  within  a  metropolitan  area  in  a  given  period  of  time.  Ongoing  economic  forecasts  for 
all  areas  within  the  PJM  market  area  are  also  inputs  into  the  analysis.  Weather  conditions 
across  the  region  are  considered  by  calculating  a  weighted  average  of  temperature,  humidity, 
and  wind  speed  as  inputs.  PJM  has  access  to  weather  data  from  about  34  weather  stations 
across  the  PJM  area  (PJM  2013-TN3475).  All  models  of  non-coincident  peak  (NCP)  used  GMP 
and  forecasts  of  coincident  peak  (CP).  NCP  is  the  peak  load  of  a  zone,  and  CP  is  the  load  of  a 
zone  coincident  with  one  of  the  five  highest  loads  used  in  the  weather  normalization  of  the  PJM 
season  peak.  PJM  incorporates  estimates  of  load  management,  energy  efficiency  (EE),  and 
distributed  generation  to  supplement  the  base  forecast.  This  accounts  for  changes  in  energy 
use  resulting  from  actions  taken  to  achieve  the  201 1  NJEMP  goal  to  reward  EE  and  energy 
conservation  and  reduce  peak  demand.  Forecasted  power  needs  within  the  market  area  are 
based  on  the  PJM  peak  load  and  energy  forecast.  The  PJM  CP  and  zonal  NCP  forecasts  are 
published  in  the  annual  PJM  Load  Forecast  Report  (PJM  2013-TN3475). 

Criteria  2:  The  PJM  Load  Forecast  Model  is  comprehensive.  PJM  develops  15-year 
monthly  energy  forecasts  assuming  normal  weather  for  each  PJM  zone  and  the  RTO.  The  PJM 
Load  Forecast  Model  incorporates  a  broad  sample  of  independent  variables  that  may  have  an 
effect  on  the  demand  for  electricity  in  the  relevant  area.  Each  candidate  variable  is  tried  in  the 
model  and  its  impact  on  demand  is  determined.  If  the  candidate  variable  does  not  prove  to  be 
statistically  significant,  or  if  that  candidate  variable  is  shown  to  display  some  degree  of  serial  or 
autocorrelation  with  any  existing  variables,  then  that  candidate  variable  is  not  included  in  the 
model. 


NUREG-2168

Need  For  Power 


Criteria  3:  The  PJM  Load  Forecast  Model  is  subject  to  confirmation.  The  PJM  Load 
Forecast  Model  is  subject  to  confirmation  as  a  part  of  its  requirements  as  a  member  of  RFC: 

"PJM  is  responsible  for  calculating  the  amount  of  resource  capacity  required  to  meet  the  defined 
reliability  criteria.  This  calculation  process  is  reviewed  by  the  Resource  Adequacy  Analysis 
Subcommittee.  This  process  satisfies  the  ReliabilityF/rsf  Corporation's  Standard 
BAL-502-RFC-02  for  the  PJM  region,  as  PJM  is  the  Planning  Coordinator  of  which  this  Standard 
applies”  (PJM  2013-TN3475). 

The  PJM  forecast  is  reviewed  by  both  the  PJM  Load  Analysis  Subcommittee  and  the  PJM 
Planning  Committee  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  the  forecast.  A  third-party  review  of  the  PJM 
forecast  concluded  that  the  PJM  forecasts  for  the  summer  of  2006  were  generally  consistent 
with  EDC  forecasts,  which  are  developed  independently.  PJM  updates  its  load  forecasts 
annually.  Figure  8-5  compares  the  actual  and  forecasted  demand  for  electricity  in  the  PJM  RTO 
for  each  of  the  7  years  between  2006  and  2012.  Based  on  this  comparison.  PJM  estimates  its 
annual  error  in  forecasts  to  be  about  2  percent  (PJM  2013-TN2290;  PJM  201 3-TN2291 ).  Load 
forecasts  were  compiled  by  PJM  from  forecasts  supplied  by  member  companies  from  1999  to 
2005  and  produced  by  PJM  thereafter  to  maintain  independence  from  market  participants  and 
to  improve  forecast  accuracy  (PJM  2013-TN2038).

Criteria  4:  The  PJM  Load  Forecasting  Model  is  responsive  to  forecasting  uncertainty. 

Through  its  annual  load  forecast  development,  changes  in  economic  inputs  affecting  the 
forecasted  loads  are  examined.  For  example,  the  2009  load  forecast  showed  a  reduction  in 
forecasted  peak  load  and  energy  due  to  the  effects  of  the  recession  beginning  in  2008 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Need  For  Power 


(PJM  2008-TN1553).  By  incorporating  recent  load  history  into  its  econometric  model,  trends 
such  as  the  potential  load  growth  associated  with  plug-in  electric  vehicles  are  captured  in  the 
PJM  load  forecast  methodology.  In  addition,  a  distribution  of  NCP  forecasts  is  produced  using  a 
Monte  Carlo  simulation  process  based  on  observed  historical  weather  data.  The  median  result 
is  used  as  the  base  (50/50)  forecast;  the  values  at  the  10th  percentile  and  90th  percentile  are 
assigned  to  the  90/10  weather  bands.  Changing  economic  conditions  and  energy  usage  as  a 
result  of  EE  and  DR  programs  are  captured  through  updating  of  inputs  in  the  annual  forecasting 
process. 

8.2  Power  Demand 

This  section  describes  the  development  of  the  New  Jersey  power  forecasts  used  in  Section  8.4 
to  determine  the  need  for  power.  The  power  demand  estimates  presented  in  this  section  were 
developed  in  2013  and  are  based  on  the  load  forecast  published  by  PJM  in  January  2013 
(PJM  2013-TN2038).  The  2012  PJM  load  forecast  has  been  reviewed  to  assess  any  changes 
in  the  demand  for  peak  load  and  energy  demand  over  the  3-year  period.  As  described  in 
Section  8.2.2,  the  forecasted  growth  in  peak  and  energy  demands  within  New  Jersey  is 
substantially  lower  than  prior  forecasts  because  of  the  impact  of  the  2008  to  2009  economic 
recession.  However,  despite  this  reduced  load  growth,  the  need  for  power  analysis,  as 
described  in  this  chapter,  still  identifies  a  substantial  need  for  baseload  generation  in 
New  Jersey  for  the  year  2021 ,  the  expected  service  date  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  increase  in  energy  needs  forecasted  by  PJM  is  driven  by  economic  and 
population  growth,  but  to  a  degree  is  offset  by  EE  and  demand-side  management  (DSM) 
programs  and  the  promotion  of  distributed  generation  using  renewable  resources.  These 
factors  are  assessed  in  detail  in  the  following  sections. 

8.2.1  Factors  Affecting  Power  Growth  and  Demand 

This  section  describes  the  major  factors  affecting  the  growth  of  electricity  demand  in 
New  Jersey:  economic  and  demographic  trends,  substitution  effects,  EE  and  DSM  programs, 
and  price  and  rate  structures.  In  each  case,  PJM  includes  the  effects  by  incorporating  them  into 
the  models  used  to  prepare  the  PJM  load  forecast  or,  in  the  case  of  EE  programs,  directly 
through  explicit  bidding  of  EE  or  DSM  programs  into  the  PJM  reliability  pricing  model  (RPM) 
auction. 

8.2.1 .1  Economic  and  Demographic  Trends 

The  PJM  load  forecast  for  New  Jersey  is  driven  by  three  factors:  calendar  effects,  economic 
and  demographic  trends,  and  weather  variations.  Economic  and  demographic  trends  have  the 
most  significance  in  the  period  of  interest.  The  econometric  model  and  its  supporting  data  used 
by  Moody’s,  a  PJM  consultant  for  load  forecasting,  are  proprietary  and  not  publicly  available. 
However,  publicly  available  information  can  be  used  to  approximate  the  economic  and 
demographic  trends  within  New  Jersey.  The  trends  identified  by  the  review  team  from  publicly 
available  sources  support  the  PJM  load  forecast  for  growth  in  electricity  demand.  Only  three 
states  are  smaller  in  area  than  New  Jersey,  yet  it  had  the  eighth  largest  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP)  in  the  United  States  in  2012.  About  half  of  New  Jersey’s  economy  is  dependent  on 
services  such  as  professional,  scientific,  technical,  health  care,  financial,  and  insurance  services

(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  2012  GDP  for  New  Jersey  was  $503  billion  (Knoema  2013- 
TN2875).  Private  service-providing  industries  accounted  for  78.3  percent  of  New  Jersey's  2012 
GDP,  and  private  goods-producing  industries  accounted  for  an  additional  10.8  percent. 
Government  contributed  about  11.0  percent  to  the  New  Jersey  GDP  (NJLWD  2013-TN3314). 

Historical  population  trends  and  projections  are  available  for  New  Jersey  from  the  U.S.  Census 
Bureau  (USCB-TN2289).  The  New  Jersey  population  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  0.9  percent 
between  1990  and  2000,  from  7,700,000  in  1990  to  8,400,000  in  2000.  The  estimated 
population  in  2008  was  8,700,000.  Table  8-1  shows  U.S.  Census  Bureau  historical  and 
forecasted  annual  population  growth  rates  for  New  Jersey.  While  Table  8-1  shows  that  New 
Jersey  is  expected  to  experience  population  growth  over  the  next  20  years,  the  U.S.  Census 
Bureau  projects  that  New  Jersey's  population  growth  rate  will  slow  from  0.6  percent  per  year  for 
2005  to  2010  to  0.3  percent  per  year  in  2025  to  2030.

Historical  personal  income  data  are  available  for  New  Jersey,  indicating  personal  income  in 
New  Jersey  increased  during  the  period  1993  to  2008  (NJLWD  201 3-TN3314).  The  average 
annual  income  growth  rate  was  4.4  percent  over  this  1 5-year  period. 

8. 2. 1.2  Current  Pattern  of  Electricity  Use 

Table  8-2  shows  New  Jersey  electricity  use  by  customer  class  and  the  national  total.  New 
Jersey  residential,  commercial,  and  transportation  energy  use  by  customer  class  were  above 
the  national  median.  In  2013,  New  Jersey  ranked  twelfth  among  the  50  states  and  District  of 
Columbia  in  commercial  energy  consumption  and  eighth  in  transportation  use.  Table  8-2  also 
shows  that  New  Jersey  industrial  use  was  below  the  national  median.

these  effects  are  incorporated  into  the  PJM  load  forecast.  The  regional  investments  in 
alternative  energy  projects  and  efficiency  described  in  this  section  have  produced  results  in 
terms  of  additional  electrical  production  and  net  reduction  in  electrical  demand.  The  effects  of

these  results  are  reflected  in  and  carried  through  subsequent  peak  load  and  energy  forecasts 
developed  by  PJM. 

Energy  Efficiency,  Demand  Response,  and  Renewables 

In  an  effort  to  enact  energy  conservation  measures  and  reduce  energy  demand,  New  Jersey 
has  established  several  government  and  corporate  programs.  These  can  be  characterized  as 

•  EE  programs  designed  to  reduce  permanently  the  consumption  of  energy  by  residential, 
commercial,  and  industrial  users; 

•  DSM  programs  designed  to  reduce  peak  power  demand  by  temporarily  reducing  load  or  by 
shifting  peak  period  load  to  off-peak  periods;  and 

•  distributed  generation  programs  designed  to  encourage  the  use  of  renewable  technologies 
by  end  users  to  self-supply  some  of  their  electricity  need. 

The  effect  of  these  programs  on  future  projections  of  power  needs  has  been  incorporated  into 
PJM  planning  indirectly  through  the  development  of  its  load  forecast  and  directly  through  the 
bidding  of  EE  and  DR  resources  into  the  annual  RPM  auctions.  As  described  in  Section  8. 2. 1.1, 
PJM  uses  an  econometric  modeling  approach  to  the  forecasting  of  future  peak  power  demand 
and  energy  use.  EE,  DSM,  and  distributed  generation  programs  affect  the  forecast  to  the  extent 
that  the  historical  data  used  to  develop  the  econometric  model  reflect  the  impact  of  the 
programs.  As  discussed  in  Section  8.3,  the  EE  and  DR  resources  that  clear  the  RPM  auction 
become  part  of  the  regional  power  supply  and  reduce  the  need  for  additional  generation.  Both 
of  these  effects,  indirectly  through  the  load  forecast  and  directly  through  the  supply  forecast,  are 
incorporated  into  the  need  for  power  forecast  discussed  in  Section  8.4. 

State-Sponsored  Energy  Efficiency  and  Demand-Side  Management  Programs 

New  Jersey  released  an  Energy  Master  Plan  in  December  201 1  that  outlines  a  strategy  for 
developing  an  adequate,  reliable  supply  of  electricity  that  keeps  up  with  the  growth  in  demand. 
The  major  energy  conservation  goals  of  the  Energy  Master  Plan  are  to  (1 )  maximize  energy 
conservation  and  EE  by  reducing  energy  consumption  by  at  least  20  percent  by  2020,  using 
1999  energy  consumption  as  the  baseline;  and  (2)  reduce  peak  electricity  demand  to  18,000 
MW  by  2020,  a  reduction  of  3,364  MW  relative  to  the  201 1  PJM  load  forecast  (New 
Jersey  201 1-TN21 15). 

New  Jersey's  Clean  Energy  Program™,  administered  through  the  New  Jersey  Office  of  Clean 
Energy,  is  an  NJBPU  initiative  that  provides  education,  information,  and  financial  incentives  for 
EE  measures.  New  Jersey's  Clean  Energy  Program  is  a  statewide  program  that  supports 
technologies  that  save  electricity  and  natural  gas  and  increase  the  amount  of  electricity 
generated  from  renewable  resources.  The  program  establishes  a  set  of  objectives  and 
measures  to  track  progress  in  reducing  energy  use  while  promoting  increased  EE.  Each  year, 
the  program  provides  an  average  of  $145  million  in  financial  incentives,  programs,  and  services 
to  residential  customers,  businesses,  schools,  and  municipalities  that  install  energy-efficient  and 
renewable  energy  technologies.

PSE&G  has  explored  various  disciplined  investments  and  implemented  programs  to 
address  the  New  Jersey  State  goals  regarding  EE,  including  the  following  (PSEG  2007- 
TN2292): 

•  Residential  Whole  House  Efficiency; 

•  Residential  Programmable  Thermostat  Installation  Program; 

•  Industrial/Commercial  Programs; 

•  Small  Business  Direct  Installation  Program  (over  4  years); 

•  Large  Business  Best  Practices  and  Technology  Demonstration  Program;  and 

•  Hospital  Efficiency  Program. 

The  PSE&G  Energy  Efficiency  Economic  Stimulus  Initiative  includes  the  following  (PSEG  2013- 
TN2293): 

•  Residential  Whole  House  Efficiency  Program; 

•  Multi-Family  Housing  Program; 

•  Industrial/Commercial  Programs; 

•  Small  Business  Direct  Install  Program; 

•  Municipal/Local/State/Government  Direct  Install  Program; 

•  Hospital  Efficiency  Program; 

•  Data  Center  Efficiency  Program; 

•  Building  Commissioning/Operations  and  Maintenance  Pilot  Program;  and 

•  Technology  Demonstration  Program. 

In  July  2009,  PSE&G  received  NJBPU  approval  for  $190  million  in  EE  projects  (Long  2009- 
TN3171).  The  EE  program  is  part  of  nearly  $1.7  billion  in  spending  planned  by  the  Public 
Service  Enterprise  Group  to  expand  its  investment  in  EE  programs.  The  efficiency  plan  results 
in  a  slight  rate  increase  for  PSE&G  customers.  The  EE  projects  include  residential  customers, 
businesses,  and  government  projects. 

8.2.2  Historic  and  Forecast  Electricity  Demand 

The  review  team  based  its  actual  and  forecasted  energy  demand  for  New  Jersey  on  the 
January  2013  PJM  Load  Forecast  Report  (PJM  201 3-TN2038).  In  this  report,  PJM  projected 
summer  peak  load  growth  in  the  entire  PJM  region  would  increase  at  an  average  rate  of 
1.3  percent  between  2013  and  2023.  PJM  also  projected  the  winter  peak  demand  for  electricity 
would  increase  at  a  rate  of  1 . 1  percent  for  the  same  1 0-year  period.  For  the  four  service 
regions  of  New  Jersey,  the  1 0-year  summer  peak  growth  rates  were  1.1  percent  (AE),  1 .2 
percent  (JCPL),  0.8  percent  (PSE&G),  and  0.6  percent  (RECO).  The  NRC  staff  guidance  calls 
for  the  inclusion  of  historic  demand  for  electricity  for  the  applicant’s  proposed  service  area, 
extended  to  3  years  beyond  the  commercial  operation  of  the  full  project.  PSEG  defined  full 
commercial  operations  to  occur  in  2021  for  purposes  of  the  ESP  application.  Because  the  PJM 
supply  forecast  did  not  extend  to  2024,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  projections  to  2023 
were  not  unreasonable  as  an  approximation  of  the  expected  supply  and  demand  for  electricity  in 
2024.  Therefore,  this  analysis  extends  to  2023.  The  review  team  used  PJM’s  summer 
projections  because  they  serve  as  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  future  need  for  electricity  in  the 
state.  Figure  8-6  contains  a  graphical  representation  of  the  past  and  projected  demand  for

Demand  data  in  Figure  8-6  and  Table  8-3  include  residential,  industrial,  commercial, 
institutional,  and  all  other  demand  segments.  In  addition,  each  electricity  demand  estimate 
includes  DSM,  EE  measures,  and  any  other  strategies  employed  in  New  Jersey  to  reduce  the 
level  of  demand  for  electricity. 

The  review  team  uses  forecasted  demand  as  the  basis  for  establishing  the  total  amount  of 
electricity  that  must  be  available  in  the  RSA.  Energy  consumption  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of 
1 .8  percent  from  1 993  to  2005  but  fell  at  an  annual  rate  of  nine-tenths  of  1  percent  from  2005  to 
2008.  The  forecast  projected  energy  requirements  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.9  percent  from 
2008  to  2012,  as  the  economy  recovers,  and  in  the  long  term  at  an  annual  rate  of  1.2  percent 
from  2012  to  2024.  The  current  growth  rate  forecast  for  energy  consumption  of  1.2  percent 
from  2012  to  2024  is  lower  than  the  historical  growth  rate  of  1 .8  percent  before  the  2008  to  2009 
recession  and  reflects  the  economic  factors  driving  the  2009  PJM  load  forecast. 


NUREG-2168 


8-16 


November  2015 


Need  For  Power 


The  review  team  determined  that  the  forecasted  peak  demand  in  2023,  based  on  the  2013  PJM 
load  forecasts,  would  be  22,072  MW.  Of  that  amount,  PSE&G  accounts  for  52  percent  of  the 
electricity  demand.  JCPL  for  32  percent,  AE  for  14  percent,  and  RECO  for  about  2  percent.  The 
distribution  of  energy  demand  in  New  Jersey  is  displayed  in  Table  8-3. 

In  addition  to  actual  customer  demand  for  electricity,  total  demand  must  include  any  reductions 
in  demand — typically  EE  and  DSM  programs,  and  stand-by  capacity  used  as  a  reserve.  As 
discussed  above,  the  PJM  demand  estimates  are  net  of  any  conservation  efforts  and  therefore 
could  not  be  isolated  from  the  total  to  explicitly  show  their  contribution  to  total  demand.  The 
RTO  establishes  the  magnitude  of  its  reserve  margin,  which  for  2023  is  set  at  15.6  percent  of 
peak  demand,  based  on  RFC  Standard  BAL-502-RFC-02-Resource  Planning  Reserve 
Requirements  (NERC  201 1-TN3177),  which  calls  for  an  11-year  resource  adequacy  projection. 
Therefore,  the  2023  system  reserve  margin  for  New  Jersey,  based  on  the  forecast  2023 
summer  peak  demand,  would  be  about  3.443  MW,  for  a  total  New  Jersey  demand  for  electricity 
in  2023  of  25,515  MW.  Table  8-4  displays  the  calculations  behind  this  determination.

8.3  Power  Supply 

The  review  team  assumed  for  this  analysis  that  the  electricity  in  New  Jersey  is  provided  by  the 
power  generated  in  New  Jersey,  without  consideration  of  any  power  imported  into  or  exported 
from  New  Jersey.  New  Jersey  power  supply  is  negatively  affected  by  the  likely  increase  in 
deactivation  and  retirement  of  generation  resources  due  to  the  increased  cost  of  environmental 
emissions.  However,  the  New  Jersey  power  supply  is  also  positively  affected  by  the  recent 
expansion  of  planned  natural  gas  generating  units  due  to  the  exploitation  of  Marcellus  Shale 
gas  reserves. 

The  review  team  identified  the  generation  resources  for  New  Jersey  using  data  obtained  from 
the  2013  PJM  Load  Forecast  Report  (PJM  2013-TN2038).  Generation  resources  include 
existing  generation,  planned  generation  (new  generation  and  increases  in  capacity  to  existing 
generation),  and  bilateral  contracts  for  unit-specific  capacity  resources. 

The  existing  and  planned  PJM  power  supply  portfolio  consists  of  nuclear,  fossil,  renewable, 
demand,  EE  resources,  and  others.  Table  8-5  was  developed  from  available  PJM  data  from 
PJM's  2007  through  2012  annual  RTEP  reports  (PJM  2008-TN3025;  PJM  2009-TN3026; 

PJM  2010-TN3027;  PJM  2011-TN3028;  PJM  2012-TN3129;  PJM  2013-TN3130)  and  shows  a 
breakdown  of  New  Jersey’s  generation  resources  by  fuel  type  that  qualified  for  the  RPM  base 
residual  auction  through  2012.  the  last  year  of  the  most  recent  RTEP  report.  The  megawatt 
values  in  the  table  reflect  the  summer  installed  capacity  rating  of  the  units  in  the  region. 

Figure  8-7  presents  a  graphical  representation  of  the  data  in  Table  8-5.

Need  For  Power 


The  current  portfolio  of  New  Jersey  is  only  moderately  diversified;  its  generating  resources 
consist  largely  of  fossil  fuels.  Since  2008.  over  half  of  the  new  generating  resources  in 
New  Jersey  have  been  natural  gas  units.  The  year  2007  is  viewed  as  an  outlier  with  natural 
gas-fired  generation  around  two-thirds  of  its  2008-2012  levels.  Between  2008  and  2012.  all  of 
the  major  fuel  types  show  relatively  constant  contributions,  with  natural  gas  at  9.400  to 
9,700  MW,  nuclear  at  a  constant  4,108  MW,  and  coal  at  about  2,000  MW.  The  total  varied  by 
no  more  than  about  400  MW  from  its  lowest  reported  level  (201 1 )  to  its  highest  (2009)  during 
the  same  period.  While  the  total  share  of  all  fossil  fuel  generators  has  declined  steadily  since 
2008  (down  2.6  percent  between  2008  and  2012),  by  2012  carbon-based  fuels  still  accounted 
for  about  73  percent  of  all  generating  capacity  (PJM  2012-TN3130) . 

Information  from  2012  on  the  deactivation  and  retirement  of  generation  resources  shows  an 
increased  number  of  retirements  of  fossil  and  nuclear  units.  PJM  expects  almost  3,000  MW  of 
existing  New  Jersey  generating  capacity  will  be  retired  by  2019,  based  on  the  following: 

•  The  637-MW  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Power  Plant,  a  baseload  resource,  will  be 
decommissioned  starting  in  2019. 

•  PJM  anticipates  another  2,300  MW  of  New  Jersey  generation  deactivations  through  2015. 
composed  of  natural  gas,  oil,  kerosene,  coal,  and  landfill  gas  resources. 

•  Older  fossil-fueled  plants  are  coming  under  increasing  economic  pressure  because  of  their 
age,  lower  prices  for  natural  gas,  and  stricter  environmental  regulations.  Fossil-fueled 
power  plants  will  require  millions  of  dollars  of  pollution  control  modifications,  which  may 
force  some  units  to  shut. 

New  Jersey's  Long-Term  Capacity  Agreement  Pilot  Program  includes  three  new  combined-cycle 
natural  gas-fired  generation  projects  totaling  1.949  MW  (not  completed  due  to  litigation).  The 
initial  increase  in  capacity  from  natural  gas  that  occurred  between  2007  and  2008  (2,680  MW) 
coincides  with  the  first  commercial  expansion  of  the  Marcellus  Shale  natural  gas  fields  in 
northern  Pennsylvania  and  throughout  New  Jersey.  Further  exploitation  of  the  Marcellus 
resource  was  hindered  by  the  lack  of  infrastructure,  which  prevented  the  transportation  of  natural 
gas  from  the  fields  to  end  users. 

However,  the  review  team  believes  the  2012  capacity  estimates  may  be  low,  based  on  new 
trends  in  natural  gas  generation.  Fitch,  a  major  energy  credit  rating  service,  identified  seven 
major  gas  pipeline  projects  (5,71 1  MMP/d)  and  two  major  liquefied  natural  gas  pipeline  projects 
(240,000  bbl/d)  under  development  in  the  Marcellus  Shale  region  (NGI  2012-TN3135).  In 
Pennsylvania  alone,  plans  for  7,351  MW  of  new  natural  gas  generating  capacity  have  been 
submitted  to  PJM,  despite  the  current  lack  of  gas  transportation  infrastructure  (NGI  2013- 
TN3172).  None  of  these  projects  are  reflected  in  the  PJM  forecast.  Once  they  are  built,  there  is 
every  indication  that  these  pipelines  will  fuel  a  near-term  emphasis  on  natural  gas  generation 
(NGI  2012-TN3135). 

The  PJM  2012  power  supply  within  New  Jersey  was  17,090  MW,  increasing  to  18.946  MW  by 
2023  (Table  8-6).  The  available  New  Jersey  power  supply  described  in  this  section  is  compared 
to  the  PJM  load  forecast,  as  described  in  Section  8.2.  This  comparison,  performed  in  Section

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  serve  the  New  Jersey  market  and  address  a 
portion  of  the  projected  capacity  needed  in  New  Jersey.  PSEG  plans  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  to  become  operational  in  2021  and  operate  as  a  merchant  baseload 
plant  producing  up  to  roughly  2,200  MW. 

PJM  has  the  overall  responsibility  of  establishing  and  maintaining  the  integrity  of  electricity 
supply  within  the  PJM  RTO.  PJM  is  responsible  for  determining  the  load  forecast  and 
calculating  the  PJM  Reserve  Requirement,  based  on  the  industry  and  Federal  guidelines  and 
standards  for  reliability  established  by  NERC  and  RFC.  Table  8-7  compares  the  forecast  peak 
demand  for  electricity  available  within  New  Jersey  in  2023  (from  Table  8-4)  with  the  total  peak 
capacity  expected  to  be  available  in  2023  (from  Table  8-6).  Demand  includes  a  15.6  percent 
reserve  margin,  as  defined  by  RFC,  over  the  2023  forecasted  summer  peak.  Table  8-7  shows 
the  need  for  additional  peak  capacity  within  New  Jersey  in  2023  would  be  almost  three  times 
the  expected  output  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Consequently,  the  review 
team  determined  that  unless  a  new  generation  plant  is  constructed,  New  Jersey  will  be  short  on 
capacity  to  meet  the  summer  peak  load  and  reserve  margin  requirements  in  2023,  and  therefore 
would  need  to  continue  to  rely  on  imports  (PJM  2013-TN2038).

8.5  Conclusion 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  operate  as  a  merchant  baseload  facility 
producing  up  to  2,200  MW  by  2021 .  It  would  alleviate  more  than  half  of  the  capacity  deficit  in 
New  Jersey  in  2023.  Consequently,  the  review  team  concludes  there  is  a  justified  need  for  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  based  on  a  comparison  of  forecasted  demand  and  supply.

Need  For  Power 


From  a  peak  power  perspective,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  contribute 
up  to  2,200  MW  of  electricity  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  alleviating  about  a  third  of  the  gap 
between  forecasted  demand  and  forecasted  supply  in  2023.  Therefore,  from  a  strictly  demand- 
minus-supply  standpoint,  the  review  team  determined  there  was  a  reasonable  expectation  of 
need  for  the  additional  baseload  generating  capacity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  2  years  after 
the  commencement  of  full  operations  (2023). 

The  principal  benefit  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  is  the  electricity  it  generates,  but  the  applicant 
referenced  several  additional  purposes  in  its  stated  purpose  and  need  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Based  on  the  applicant's  stated  purpose  and  need,  the  review  team 
concludes  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  the  potential  to  do  the  following: 

•  Meet  NJEMP  Goal  1  of  reducing  the  price  of  electricity  for  all  consumers  by  lowering  the 
locational  marginal  price  of  electricity  by  displacing  more  expensive  producers  during  the  bid 
process 

•  Meet  NJEMP  Goal  2: 

-  Increase  the  diversity  of  New  Jersey's  generation  portfolio. 

-  Reduce  local  air  pollution  emissions  by  displacing  fossil-fueled  generation  in  New  Jersey 
(this  also  supports  New  Jersey’s  Global  Warming  Response  Act,  (NJPL  2007,  Chi  12- 
TN4305),  goals  for  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  New  Jersey  to  80 
percent  below  2006  levels  by  2050). 

-  Reduce  New  Jersey’s  dependence  on  imported  power  by  displacing  imports  with 
cheaper  and  cleaner  in-state  generation. 

-  Help  increase  the  New  Jersey  economy  by  producing  local  jobs,  expanding  the  state's 
tax  base,  and  providing  energy  for  infrastructure  and  industrial  development. 

•  Reduce  potential  for  transmission  congestion. 

•  Reduce  local  emissions  from  fossil-fueled  generation  from  generators  of  imported  electricity. 

•  Increase  grid  stability  and  reliability  in  the  PJM  and  Eastern  Mid-Atlantic  Zone  by  increasing 
PJM's  reserve  margin. 

These  ancillary  benefits  are  discussed  in  Section  10.6. 

The  NRC  staff  emphasizes  that  these  need  for  power  projections  are  based  on  PJM  forecasts 
that  meet  the  sufficiency  criteria  set  forth  in  NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN614).  These  criteria 
state  that  for  a  forecast  to  be  reliable,  it  must  be  (1)  systematic,  (2)  comprehensive,  (3)  subject 
to  confirmation,  and  (4)  responsive  to  forecasting  uncertainty. 

Based  on  the  review  team’s  independent  analysis,  the  sufficiency  of  the  forecasts  on  which  it  is 
based,  the  foreseeable  additions  to  generation  capacity  that  will  affect  the  market  area,  and  the 
consistency  of  the  applicant’s  stated  purpose  and  need  relative  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey's 
identified  energy  goals,  the  NRC  staff  finds  its  conclusions  regarding  the  need  for  the  proposed 
two  units  to  be  consistent  with  the  conclusions  of  the  applicant  in  its  ER  and  determined  there  is 
a  reasonable  need  for  power  in  the  market  area  that  could  be  partially,  if  not  entirely,  met  by 
building  and  operating  a  new  baseload  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.

9.0  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACTS  OF  ALTERNATIVES 


This  chapter  describes  alternatives  to  the  proposed  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission 
(NRC)  action  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  for  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC 
(PSEG),  site  in  New  Jersey  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  action  for 
Department  of  the  Army  (DA)  permits.  This  chapter  also  discusses  the  environmental  impacts 
of  alternatives  to  the  proposed  NRC  and  USACE  actions.  Section  9.1  discusses  the  no-action 
alternative.  Section  9.2  addresses  alternative  energy  sources.  Section  9.3  reviews  the  PSEG 
region  of  interest  (ROI)  evaluated  in  the  site-selection  process,  its  alternative  site-selection 
process,  and  issues  common  or  generic  to  all  of  the  alternative  sites  and  summarizes  the 
environmental  impacts  for  the  proposed  and  alternative  sites.  Section  9.4  examines  plant 
design  alternatives. 

The  need  to  compare  the  proposed  action  with  alternatives  arises  from  the  requirement  in 
Section  102(2)(c)(iii)  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969.  as  amended  (NEPA; 

42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661),  that  environmental  impact  statements  (EISs)  include  an  analysis 
of  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action.  The  NRC  implements  this  requirement  through 
regulations  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51  (TN250)  and  its 
Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan  (ESRP)  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Furthermore,  Subpart  A  of 
10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251)  sets  forth  the  NRC  regulations  related  to  ESPs. 

In  this  EIS.  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  alternatives  are  evaluated  using  the  NRC 
three-level  standard  of  significance — SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE — developed  using 
Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  1508-TN428)  and  set  forth  in 
the  footnotes  to  Table  B-1  of  10  CFR  Part  51,  Subpart  A,  Appendix  B  (TN250).  The  issues 
evaluated  in  this  chapter  are  the  same  as  those  addressed  in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact 
Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants,  NUREG-1437  (GEIS)  (NRC  2013-TN2654). 

Although  NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013-TN2654)  was  developed  for  license  renewal,  it  provides 
useful  information  for  this  review  and  is  referenced  throughout  this  chapter.  Additional  guidance 
on  conducting  environmental  reviews  is  provided  in  Interim  Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental 
Issues  Associated  with  New  Reactors  (NRC  2014-TN3767). 

As  part  of  the  evaluation  of  permit  applications  subject  to  Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act 
(CWA;  33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662),  the  USACE  must  define  the  overall  project  purpose  in 
addition  to  the  basic  project  purpose.  The  overall  project  purpose  establishes  the  scope  of  the 
alternatives  analysis  and  is  used  for  evaluating  practicable  alternatives  under  the  U.S. 
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  CWA  Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  for  Specification  of 
Disposal  Sites  for  Dredged  or  Fill  Material  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427),  hereafter  the  404(b)(1) 
Guidelines.  In  accordance  with  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  and  the  USACE  headquarters 
guidance  (USACE  1989-TN2365),  the  overall  project  purpose  must  be  specific  enough  to  define 
the  applicant's  needs  but  not  so  narrow  and  restrictive  as  to  preclude  a  proper  evaluation  of 
alternatives.  The  USACE  is  responsible  for  controlling  every  aspect  of  the  404(b)(1 )  Guidelines 
analysis.  In  this  regard,  defining  the  overall  project  purpose  is  the  sole  responsibility  of  the 
USACE.  While  generally  focusing  on  the  applicant’s  statement,  the  USACE  will,  in  all  cases, 
exercise  independent  judgment  in  defining  the  purpose  and  need  for  the  project  from  the

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


perspective  of  both  the  applicant’s  alternatives  and  the  public  (33  CFR  Part  325,  Appendix 
B(9)(c)(4)  [TN425];  see  also  33  CFR  Part  230  [TN2273]). 


Section  230.10(a)  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427)  requires  that  “no 
discharge  of  dredged  or  fill  material  shall  be  permitted  if  there  is  a  practicable  alternative  to  the 
proposed  discharge  which  would  have  less  adverse  impact  on  the  aquatic  ecosystem,  so  long 
as  the  alternative  does  not  have  other  significant  adverse  environmental  consequences.” 
Section  230.10(a)(2)  of  the  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  states  that  “an  alternative  is  practicable  if  it  is 
available  and  capable  of  being  done  after  taking  into  consideration  cost,  existing  technology, 
and  logistics  in  light  of  overall  project  purposes.  If  it  is  otherwise  a  practicable  alternative,  an 
area  not  presently  owned  by  the  applicant  which  could  reasonably  be  obtained,  used, 
expanded,  or  managed  in  order  to  fulfill  the  basic  purpose  of  the  proposed  activity  may  be 
considered.”  Thus,  this  analysis  is  necessary  to  determine  which  alternative  is  the  least 
environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative  (LEDPA)  that  meets  the  project  purpose  and 
need. 

Where  the  activity  associated  with  a  discharge  is  proposed  for  a  special  aquatic  site  (as  defined 
in  40  CFR  Part  230,  Subpart  E  [TN427])  and  does  not  require  access  or  proximity  to  or  siting 
within  these  types  of  areas  to  fulfill  its  basic  project  purpose  (i.e.,  the  project  is  not  “water 
dependent”),  practicable  alternatives  that  avoid  special  aquatic  sites  are  presumed  to  be 
available,  unless  clearly  demonstrated  otherwise  (40  CFR  230.10(a)(3)  [TN427]).  See 
Section  1 .3.2  for  the  USACE  determination  of  the  basic  purpose  and  overall  purpose  to  be  used 
for  the  USACE  alternatives  analysis  for  this  project. 

Even  if  an  applicant’s  preferred  alternative  is  determined  to  be  the  LEDPA  that  meets  the 
project  purpose,  the  USACE  must  determine  whether  the  LEDPA  is  contrary  to  the  public 
interest.  The  USACE  Public  Interest  Review  (PIR),  described  at  33  CFR  320.4  (TN424),  directs 
the  USACE  to  consider  several  factors  in  a  balancing  process.  A  permit  will  not  be  issued  for  a 
practicable  alternative  that  is  not  the  LEDPA,  nor  will  a  permit  be  issued  for  an  activity  that  is 
determined  to  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest.  In  considering  both  the  LEDPA  and  the  PIR, 
the  USACE  must  consider  compliance  with  other  applicable  substantive  laws  such  as  the 
Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973,  as  amended  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010),  and  the 
National  Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966,  as  amended  (NHPA;  54  USC  300101  et  seq.  - 
TN4157),  and  consult  with  other  Federal  agencies.  The  USACE  also  must  follow  procedural 
laws  such  as  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  and  other  applicable  laws  described  in 
33  CFR  320.3  (TN424). 

Because  the  USACE  is  a  cooperating  agency  with  the  NRC  in  this  environmental  review  and  for 
development  of  this  EIS,  both  the  USACE  and  the  NRC  have  provided  information  to  the 
maximum  extent  practicable  in  this  EIS  that  the  USACE  will  use  in  its  evaluation  of  the  project, 
including  the  evaluation  of  alternatives.  While  the  USACE  concurs  as  part  of  the  review  team 
with  the  qualitative  designation  of  impact  levels  for  terrestrial  or  aquatic  resource  areas  for  this 
EIS,  in  so  far  as  waters  of  the  United  States  are  concerned,  the  USACE  must  conduct  a 
quantitative  comparison  of  impacts  on  waters  of  the  United  States  as  part  of  the  LEDPA 
analysis.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  NRC  determination  as  to  whether  an  alternative  site  is  environmentally  preferable  to  the 
proposed  PSEG  Site  is  independent  of  the  USACE  determination  of  a  LEDPA  pursuant  to  the 
Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  at  40  CFR  Part  230  (TN427).  The  USACE  will  conclude  its 
analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite  alternatives  in  a  regulatory  permit  decision  document  issued 
for  the  PSEG  ESP  application. 

9.1  No-Action  Alternative 

For  purposes  of  an  application  for  an  ESP,  the  no-action  alternative  refers  to  a  scenario  in  which 
the  NRC  would  deny  the  ESP  request.  Likewise,  the  USACE  could  also  take  no  action  or  deny 
any  request  for  a  DA  permit.  Upon  such  a  denial  by  the  NRC  or  the  USACE.  the  construction 
and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  location  on  the  PSEG  Site  in 
accordance  with  the  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251)  process  referencing  an  approved  ESP  would  not 
occur. 

Under  the  no-action  alternative  the  NRC  would  not  issue  the  ESP.  There  are  no  environmental 
impacts  associated  with  not  issuing  the  ESP.  and  the  impacts  predicted  in  this  EIS  would 
not  occur. 

In  this  context,  the  no-action  alternative  would  accomplish  none  of  the  benefits  intended  by  the 
ESP  process,  which  would  include  (1)  early  resolution  of  siting  issues  prior  to  large  investments 
of  financial  capital  and  human  resources  in  new  plant  design  and  construction,  (2)  early 
resolution  of  issues  related  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  new 
nuclear  generation  units  that  fall  within  the  plant  parameters,  (3)  the  ability  to  bank  sites  on 
which  nuclear  plants  might  be  located,  and  (4)  the  facilitation  of  future  decisions  about  whether 
to  construct  new  nuclear  power  generation  facilities. 

If  other  generating  sources  were  built,  either  at  another  site  or  using  a  different  energy  source, 
the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  these  other  sources  would  eventually  occur.  As 
discussed  in  Chapter  8.  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC  (PJM),  has  regulatory  responsibilities  in  New 
Jersey  to  provide  electrical  service  in  its  service  area,  and  there  is  a  demonstrated  need  for 
power.  It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  PJM  and  the  power  generation  companies  in  the  region 
will  act  to  meet  the  need  for  power.  This  needed  power  could  be  provided  and  supported 
through  a  number  of  energy  alternatives  and  alternative  sites,  which  are  discussed  in 
Sections  9.2  and  9.3,  respectively. 

9.2  Energy  Alternatives 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  NRC  proposed  action  (i.e.,  ESP  issuance)  as  identified  in 
Section  1 .3.1  of  this  EIS  is  to  provide  for  early  resolution  of  site  safety  and  environmental 
issues,  which  provides  stability  in  the  licensing  process.  The  PSEG  objective  in  seeking  an 
ESP  is  to  identify  a  site  where  it  can,  by  2021 ,  provide  2,200-MW(e)  of  baseload  power 
generation  for  sale  within  the  relevant  service  area  (RSA),  which  is  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

This  section  examines  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  alternatives  to 
building  a  new  baseload  nuclear  generating  facility.  Section  9.2.1  discusses  energy  alternatives 
not  requiring  new  generating  capacity.  Section  9.2.2  discusses  energy  alternatives  requiring 
new  generating  capacity,  while  Section  9.2.3  discusses  those  alternatives  from  Section  9.2.2 


November  2015 


9-3 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


that  appear  capable  of  meeting  the  need  for  power  as  a  discrete  energy  source.  A  combination 
of  alternatives  is  discussed  in  Section  9.2.4.  Section  9.2.5  compares  the  environmental  impacts 
from  new  nuclear,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired  generating  units,  as  well  as  a  combination  of 
energy  sources,  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

For  analysis  of  energy  alternatives,  PSEG  assumed  a  bounding  electrical  output  target  value  of 
2,200-MW(e)  with  a  capacity  factor  of  90  percent(1)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  NRC  staff  and 
USACE  staff  (collectively  referred  to  as  the  review  team)  also  used  this  level  of  output  in  the 
analysis  of  energy  alternatives. 

9.2.1  Alternatives  Not  Requiring  New  Generation  Capacity 

Four  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action  that  do  not  require  PSEG  to  construct  new  generating 
capacity  include  taking  some  or  all  of  the  following  actions: 

•  purchase  the  needed  electric  power  from  other  suppliers, 

•  reactivate  retired  power  plants, 

•  extend  the  operating  life  of  existing  power  plants,  and/or 

•  implement  conservation  or  demand-side  management  (DSM)  programs. 

Each  of  the  above  four  alternatives  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  the  following  sections. 

9. 2. 1.1  Purchased  Power 

As  discussed  in  Chapter  8,  a  shortfall  in  peak  load  resources  is  projected  in  New  Jersey  for 
2023,  as  well  as  a  shortfall  in  baseload  capacity  in  New  Jersey  in  the  same  time  frame.  In 
addition,  the  potential  for  further  power  exports  from  New  Jersey  to  New  York  City  and  to  Long 
Island  could  increase  the  demand  for  in-state  generating  capacity.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  8, 
PJM  anticipates  that  New  Jersey  will  continue  to  rely  upon  imported-energy  transmission 
capability  to  replace  retired  in-state  generating  capacity  and  to  meet  growth  in  the  demand  for 
peak  power. 

In  a  letter  dated  March  11, 2013  (PSEG  201 3-TN2464),  PSEG  provided  a  detailed  analysis  of 
the  potential  to  use  imported  power  as  an  alternative  to  building  new  nuclear  capacity  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  analysis  was  based  on  publicly  available  information  in  reports  and  analyses 
prepared  by  PJM.  These  reports  indicate  that  there  will  not  be  surplus  capacity  available  from 
nearby  portions  of  PJM  or  from  the  New  York  Independent  System  Operator  region  (which 
borders  on  PJM).  The  reports  also  indicate  that  there  is  not  likely  to  be  excess  transmission 
capacity  available  to  New  Jersey  in  the  time  frame  when  the  new  units  would  become 
operational.  In  addition,  purchasing  power  from  other  utilities  or  power  generators  that  are 
outside  New  Jersey  would  have  undesirable  consequences  (such  as  higher  costs  and  potential 
reliability  issues)  and  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  goals  of  the  New  Jersey  Energy  Master 
Plan  (New  Jersey  201 1-TN21 15)  to  (1 )  promote  a  diverse  portfolio  of  new,  clean,  in-state 
energy  generation  and  (2)  drive  down  the  cost  of  energy  for  all  customers.  Based  on  the 


(1 )  The  capacity  factor  is  the  ratio  of  the  net  electricity  generated,  for  the  time  considered,  to  the  energy 
that  could  have  been  generated  at  continuous  full  power  operation  during  the  same  period. 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


preceding  discussion,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  option  of  purchasing  electric  power 
from  other  suppliers  outside  New  Jersey  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative  to  providing  new 
baseload  power  generation. 

9. 2. 1.2  Reactivating  Retired  Power  Plants  or  Extending  Operating  Life 

Regarding  reactivation,  retired  generating  plants — predominantly  fossil-fuel-fired  plants  that 
could  be  reactivated — would  ordinarily  require  extensive  refurbishment  prior  to  their  reactivation. 
Such  plants  would  typically  be  old  enough  that  refurbishment  would  be  very  costly,  and  the 
refurbished  plants  would  likely  be  viewed  as  new  sources,  subject  to  the  current-day 
complement  of  regulatory  controls  on  air  emissions  and  waste  management.  PSEG  estimates 
that  about  3,000  MW(e)  of  existing  electrical  generating  capacity  in  New  Jersey  is  projected  for 
retirement  by  2019  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  has  retired  several  fossil-fuel-fired  units  in  the  past  several  years,  and  plans  to  retire 
several  more.  Hudson  Unit  3  (129  MW(e))  was  retired  in  2003  due  to  generator  damage,  and 
Hudson  Unit  1  (383  MW(e))  was  retired  in  201 1 .  Burlington  Units  101  through  105  (260  MW(e) 
total)  were  retired  in  2004,  and  their  turbine  generators  were  subsequently  sold.  In  2005,  the 
Kearny  Unit  7  and  Unit  8  steam  plants  (150  MW(e)  each)  were  retired.  Kearny  Units  10  and  1 1 
(122  MW(e)  and  128  MW(e),  respectively)  were  retired  in  2012,  and  Unit  9  (21  MW(e))  was 
retired  in  2013.  Bergen  Unit  3  (21  MW(e)),  Burlington  Unit  8  (21  MW(e)),  Mercer  Unit  3  (1 15 
MW(e)),  National  Park  Unit  1  (21  MW(e)),  and  Sewaren  Units  1  through  4  and  Unit  6  (558 
MW(e)  total)  are  scheduled  for  retirement  in  2015.  There  are  no  plans  to  return  any  of  these 
retired  coal-fired  units  to  service  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Based  on  the  cost  and  difficulty  of 
refurbishing  old  fossil-fuel-fired  units  to  meet  current  environmental  regulations,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  reactivation  of  such  units  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative. 

In  November  1974,  PSEG  was  granted  a  permit  by  the  NRC  for  the  construction  of  a  second 
unit  at  the  Hope  Creek  station  (i.e.,  Hope  Creek  Unit  2);  however,  construction  of  this  second 
unit  was  abandoned  in  1981  for  economic  reasons  and  because  of  a  reduced  demand  for  power 
at  that  time  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  containment  structure  and  the  reactor  vessel  planned 
for  use  at  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  were  subsequently  dismantled  and  distributed  for  salvage; 
furthermore,  according  to  PSEG  the  proposed  location  for  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  is  not  suitable  for 
the  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  reactor  unit  for  the  following  reasons  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280); 

•  Significant  portions  of  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  turbine  building  are  currently  used  for 
maintenance  and  administrative  office  space  and  laydown  support  for  the  operating  Hope 
Creek  Unit  1. 

•  The  structural  components  of  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  reactor  building  currently  provide  flood 
and  missile  protection  for  Hope  Creek  Unit  1.  Alteration  of  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  reactor 
building  to  accommodate  a  new  reactor  could  impact  these  protective  functions,  thereby 
adversely  impacting  the  operation  of  Hope  Creek  Unit  1. 

•  Constructing  a  new-generation  reactor  design  at  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  location  is  not 
feasible  given  the  high  likelihood  that  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  footprint  would  not 
physically  be  able  to  accommodate  any  of  the  standardized  reactor  designs.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


•  Construction  activities  associated  with  the  completion  of  the  Hope  Creek  Unit  2  would 
impact  operation  of  Hope  Creek  Unit  1  due  to  the  above  described  inter-reliance  of 
structures  and  overall  proximity  of  heavy  construction  (e.g.,  cranes  and  ultra-heavy 
modules)  to  critical  Hope  Creek  Unit  1  structures,  systems,  and  components. 

Based  upon  the  above  discussion,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  reactivation  of  the 
construction  permit  for  Hope  Creek  Unit  2,  as  well  as  the  possible  use  of  the  Hope  Creek 
Unit  2  site  for  the  construction  of  a  new  reactor  unit,  would  not  be  reasonable  alternatives  to 
the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power-generating  plant  at  another  location. 

Nuclear  power  facilities  are  initially  licensed  by  the  NRC  for  a  period  of  40  years.  Operating 
licenses  issued  by  the  NRC  can  be  renewed  for  up  to  20  years,  and  the  NRC  regulations  do  not 
preclude  multiple  renewals.  PSEG  currently  operates  the  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  Unit  1 
and  the  Salem  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2  under  licenses  issued  by  the  NRC.  In  August 
2009,  PSEG  submitted  applications  to  the  NRC  for  license  renewal  for  all  three  of  these  units, 
and  in  June  and  July  201 1 ,  the  NRC  issued  its  approval  of  the  extension  of  the  operating 
licenses  for  the  two  Salem  units  and  the  Hope  Creek  unit,  respectively  (NRC  201 1-TN2108; 
NRC  201 1-TN2109).  The  operating  licenses  for  these  units  now  expire  between  2036  (Salem 
Unit  1 )  and  2046  (Hope  Creek).  Therefore,  continuing  power  generation  from  these  units  has 
already  been  considered  in  the  need  for  power  analysis  during  the  time  frame  being  addressed 
for  alternatives. 

The  environmental  impacts  of  continued  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  significantly 
smaller  than  those  of  constructing  a  new  plant.  However,  continued  operation  of  an  existing 
nuclear  plant  does  not  provide  additional  generating  capacity  nor  is  it  a  feasible  alternative  to 
proposed  new  power-generating  plants. 

While  all  four  of  the  operating  nuclear  plants  in  New  Jersey  have  been  approved  by  the  NRC  for 
license  renewal,  decommissioning  activities  are  planned  for  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Power  Plant 
(637  MW(e)),  beginning  in  2019  (Exelon  2013-TN2521 ). 

Older,  existing  fossil-fuel-fired  plants — predominately  coal-fired  and  natural-gas-fired  plants — 
that  are  nearing  the  end  of  their  useful  lives  are  likely  to  need  refurbishing  to  extend  plant  life 
and  to  meet  applicable  environmental  requirements.  However,  such  refurbishment  activities  are 
costly,  and  the  typical  fate  of  an  aged  fossil-fuel-fired  plant  is  retirement  as  described  in  the 
discussion  of  reactivation  above. 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  life  extension,  refurbishment, 
and/or  reactivation  scenarios  would  be  bounded  by  alternatives  involving  new  coal-fired  or 
natural-gas-fired  facilities  (see  Section  9.2.3).  Given  both  the  costs  of  refurbishment  and  the 
environmental  impacts  of  operating  such  facilities,  the  review  team  concludes  that  extending  the 
operational  life  of  older,  existing  plants  or  reactivating  retired  plants  would  not  be  a  reasonable 
alternative  to  providing  new  baseload  power-generation  capacity  with  new  nuclear  units.

9. 2. 1.3  Energy  Efficiency  and  Demand-Side  Management 

DSM  programs  consist  of  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  activities  that  enable  and 
encourage  consumers  to  reduce  and/or  modify  their  levels  and  patterns  of  electricity  use.  By 
reducing  customer  demand  for  energy  through  energy  efficiency,  conservation,  and  load 
management,  the  need  for  additional  generation  capacity  can  be  reduced,  postponed,  or  even 
eliminated.  In  addition,  energy  conservation  measures  in  New  Jersey  also  include  distributed 
generation  programs  that  are  designed  to  encourage  end  users  to  supply  some  of  their  own 
electrical  needs  through  the  use  of  renewable  technologies  such  as  solar  photovoltaic  (PV) 
power-generating  systems. 

The  New  Jersey  Clean  Energy  Program  is  a  statewide  initiative  that  offers  financial  incentives, 
programs,  and  services  for  New  Jersey  residents,  business  owners,  and  local  governments  to 
help  them  save  energy,  money,  and  the  environment  (NJBPU  2012-TN2106).  The  Clean 
Energy  Program  supports  technologies  that  conserve  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  it  also 
promotes  increased  energy  efficiency  and  the  use  of  clean,  renewable  sources  of  energy  such 
as  solar,  wind,  geothermal,  and  sustainable  biomass.  The  program  establishes  a  set  of 
objectives  and  measures  to  track  progress  in  reducing  energy  use  while  promoting  energy 
efficiency.  The  program  provides  financial  incentives  and  services  to  residential  customers, 
businesses,  schools,  and  municipalities  that  install  energy-efficient  and  renewable  energy 
technologies. 

Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  already  offers  several  conservation  and 
DSM  programs  to  its  customers  to  reduce  peak  electricity  demands  and  daily  power 
consumption,  including  residential  programs  in  whole  house  efficiency,  programmable 
thermostat  installation,  and  multifamily  housing  and  industrial/commercial  programs  in  small 
business  direct  installation,  large  business  best  practices  and  technology  demonstration, 
hospital  efficiency,  municipal/locai/State  government  direct  installation,  data  center  efficiency, 
building  commissioning  operation  and  maintenance,  and  technology  demonstration 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  need  for  power  discussion  in  Chapter  8  takes  planned  energy  efficiency,  conservation,  and 
DSM  programs  into  account.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  8  of  this  EIS,  the  State  of  New  Jersey 
took  account  of  conservation  and  DSM  programs  in  preparing  its  report.  New  Jersey  Energy 
Master  Plan  (New  Jersey  201 1-TN21 15).  In  this  report,  the  State  of  New  Jersey  determined 
that  there  was  a  need  for  additional  baseload  power  in  the  PSEG  RSA.  even  taking  into  account 
conservation  and  DSM  programs.  The  review  team  concluded  in  Chapter  8  that  there  is  a 
justified  need  for  power  in  the  PSEG  RSA,  which  covers  the  same  area  as  the  ROI,  even  with 
the  successful  implementation  of  conservation  and  DSM  programs.  Because  PSEG  Power  only 
owns  generating  plants,  it  does  not  directly  offer  energy  efficiency,  conservation,  and  DSM 
programs.  The  review  team  concludes  that  such  programs  are  not  a  reasonable  alternative  to 
the  proposed  action. 

9. 2. 1.4  Conclusions 

Based  on  the  preceding  discussion,  as  well  as  information  and  discussions  provided  in  the  need 
for  power  analysis  in  Chapter  8.  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  options  of  purchasing

electric  power  from  other  suppliers,  reactivating  retired  power  plants,  extending  the  operating 
life  of  existing  power  plants,  conservation  and  DSM  programs,  or  any  combination  of  these  are 
already  fully  used  in  the  capacity  projections  for  the  PSEG  RSA  (New  Jersey  201 1-TN21 1 5) 
and  that  additional  efforts  do  not  present  reasonable  alternatives  to  providing  new  baseload 
power-generation  capacity.  The  review  team  therefore  concludes  that  alternatives  not  requiring 
new  generation  capacity  are  not  reasonable  alternatives  to  providing  new  baseload  power 
generation  in  amounts  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  project  purpose  and  need. 

9.2.2  Alternatives  Requiring  New  Generation  Capacity 

This  section  discusses  energy  alternatives  involving  new  generating  capacity,  the  review  team 
conclusions  about  the  feasibility  of  each  alternative,  and  the  basis  for  the  review  team 
conclusions.  Consistent  with  the  NRC  guidance  in  ESRP  9.2.2  (NRC  2000-TN614),  a 
reasonable  set  of  energy  alternatives  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  one  or  more  new 
nuclear  units  for  baseload  power  generation  at  the  PSEG  Site  should  be  limited  to  analysis  of 
discrete  power-generation  sources,  or  a  combination  of  sources,  that  are  capable  of  generating 
baseload  power  and  are  developed,  proven,  and  available  in  the  relevant  region.  The  current 
mix  of  baseload  power-generation  options  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  is  one  indicator  of  the 
feasible  choices  for  power-generation  technology  within  the  State.  The  energy  generation 
profile  for  New  Jersey  in  201 1  was  as  follows:  nuclear  (24  percent),  natural  gas  (56  percent), 
coal  (12  percent),  renewables  (2.5  percent),  and  oil  (4.7  percent)  (PJM  2012-TN3129). 

Furthermore,  in  accordance  with  NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN614),  the  basic  criteria  for  a 
viable  alternative  energy  source  include  (1 )  use  of  the  energy  source  is  consistent  with  national 
energy  policy  goals  for  energy  use  and  (2)  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations  do  not  prohibit 
or  restrict  the  use  of  the  energy  source.  Additional  criteria  listed  in  NUREG-1 555  (NRC  2000- 
TN614)  include  the  following: 

•  The  energy  technology  should  be  developed,  proven,  and  available  in  the  relevant  region. 

•  The  energy  source  should  provide  power  generation  equivalent  to  the  power  level  output  of 
the  applicant’s  proposed  project  (which,  in  this  case,  is  2,200  MW(e)  baseload  power  with  a 
capacity  factor  of  90  percent). 

•  The  power  should  be  available  within  the  time  frame  needed  for  the  proposed  project. 

•  No  unusual  environmental  impacts  or  exceptional  costs  are  associated  with  the  energy 
source  that  would  make  it  impractical. 

This  section  discusses  the  environmental  impacts  of  energy  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action 
that  would  include  the  construction  of  new  facilities  to  meet  the  demand  for  power-generating 
capacity.  The  three  primary  energy  sources  for  generating  electric  power  in  the  United  States  in 
2012  were  coal,  natural  gas,  and  nuclear  energy  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2593),  which  combined  to 
generate  roughly  87  percent  of  the  electricity  in  this  country.  Coal-fired  plants  remain  the 
primary  source  of  baseload  generation  in  the  United  States  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2590). 
Natural-gas  combined-cycle  power-generation  plants  are  often  used  as  intermediate  generation 
sources,  but  they  are  also  used  as  baseload  generation  sources  (SSI  2010-TN1405).  Each 
year,  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA),  a  component  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Energy  (DOE),  issues  an  annual  energy  outlook.  In  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2013 


NUREG-2168 


9-8 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


(DOE/EIA  201 3-TN2590),  the  EIA  reference  case  projects  that  the  total  electrical  generating 
capacity  additions  between  2012  and  2040  will  use  the  following  fuels  in  the  approximate 
percentages  indicated:  natural  gasll!  (67  percent),  renewables  (29  percent),  and  nuclear 
(4  percent).  During  this  same  period,  coal-  and  petroleum-fired  capacities  will  both  decrease. 
The  EIA  projections  include  baseload,  intermittent,  and  peaking  units  and  are  based  on  the 
assumption  that  providers  of  new  generating  capacity  would  seek  to  minimize  cost  while 
meeting  applicable  environmental  requirements. 

New  Jersey  has  a  renewable  energy  portfolio  implemented  through  Renewable  Portfolio 
Standard  (RPS)  regulations  that  consist  of  a  set  of  State  policies  designed  to  increase  the 
generation  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources.  These  policies  require  or  encourage  electricity 
producers  to  supply  a  certain  minimum  share  of  their  electricity  from  renewable  sources 
(DOE/EIA  2012-TN2090).  The  New  Jersey  RPS  requires  each  supplier/provider  serving  retail 
customers  in  the  state  to  procure  22.5  percent  of  the  electricity  it  sells  in  New  Jersey  from 
qualifying  renewables  by  2021.  In  addition,  the  standard  contains  a  separate  solar-specific 
provision  that  requires  suppliers/providers  to  procure  at  least  3.47  percent  of  sales  from 
qualifying  solar  electric  generation  facilities  by  2021  (NCSU  2012-TN2095). 

The  22.5  percent  RPS  target  includes  Class  I  and  Class  II  types  of  renewable  energy.  Class  I 
renewable  energy  includes  electricity  derived  from  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  wave  or  tidal 
action,  geothermal  energy,  landfill  gas  (LFG),  anaerobic  digestion,  fuel  cells  using  renewable 
fuels,  and — with  written  permission  from  New  Jersey — certain  other  forms  of  sustainable 
biomass.  Class  I  also  includes  hydroelectric  facilities  with  capacities  of  3  MW  or  less.  Class  II 
renewable  energy  includes  electricity  derived  from  hydroelectric  facilities  with  capacities  greater 
than  3  MW  but  less  than  30  MW  and  from  resource-recovery  facilities  such  as  municipal  solid- 
waste  facilities  (NCSU  2012-TN2095). 

New  nuclear  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  baseload  generation  units.  Any  feasible 
alternative  to  the  new  units  would  need  to  generate  baseload  power  consistent  with  the  purpose 
and  need  for  the  project.  In  evaluating  alternative  energy  technologies,  PSEG  used  the 
technologies  discussed  in  NUREG-1437,  Revision  0  (i.e. ,  the  GEIS  for  license  renewal 
(NRC  1996-TN288]).  The  review  team  reviewed  the  information  submitted  in  the  PSEG 
Environmental  Report  (ER)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  also  conducted  an  independent  review 
as  documented  in  this  section. 

9. 2. 2. 1  Wind  Power  Generation 

As  discussed  above,  electricity  derived  from  wind  energy  is  included  in  the  New  Jersey 
renewable  energy  portfolio.  As  of  August  2012,  New  Jersey  had  9  MW(e)  of  wind  energy 
projects  online,  and  an  additional  1,416  MW(e)  were  in  the  queue;  however,  no  such  projects 
were  located  in  or  planned  for  Salem  County  or  the  adjacent  counties  (AWEA  201 2-TN2076). 
Nevertheless,  adequate  wind  resources  exist  in  New  Jersey  and  its  surrounding  offshore  areas 
to  make  wind  powered  electricity  generation  a  potentially  attractive  alternative.  About

1 ,440  MW(e)  of  offshore  wind  projects  are  under  consideration  and/or  design  within  the  PJM 
generation  interconnection  queues  (PSEG  2012-TN21 14). 

The  largest  operating  wind  farm  in  the  world  is  the  9,000-ac  Alta  Wind  Energy  Center  in 
California,  which  has  a  total  capacity  of  1,320  MW  (CEC  2015-TN4265).  The  second  largest 
wind  farm  in  the  United  States  is  the  Roscoe  Wind  Farm  situated  on  100,000  ac  in  Texas.  The 
Roscoe  Wind  Farm  has  an  installed  capacity  of  781 .5  MW  and  uses  627  wind  turbines,  each 
with  a  capacity  between  1 .0  and  1 .5  MW  (Power  Technology  2010-TN21 12). 

A  utility-scale  land-based  wind-power-generation  plant  in  open  flat  terrain  would  generally 
require  about  60  ac  per  megawatt  of  installed  capacity  to  prevent  interference  and  shadowing 
among  and  between  the  wind  turbine  units,  although  much  of  this  land  could  be  used  for  other 
compatible  purposes  such  as  farming  or  ranching  (AWEA  2009-TN2075).  Wind  turbines 
typically  operate  at  a  capacity  factor  of  25  to  40  percent  compared  to  90  to  95  percent  for  a 
baseload  plant  such  as  a  nuclear  plant  (AWEA  2009-TN2074).  The  capacity  factor  of  the  Alta 
Wind  Energy  Center  is  estimated  to  be  30  percent  (CEAP  2012-TN2077).  Higher  capacity 
factors  for  wind  turbines  are  typically  associated  with  wind  farms  built  offshore,  where  winds  are 
steadier.  There  are  no  offshore  wind  farms  in  the  United  States  at  this  time. 

With  modern  wind  turbine  designs  of  about  2  MW  per  turbine,  about  3,300  wind  turbines  would 
be  required  to  produce  the  same  energy  as  the  PSEG  target  of  2,200  MW(e)  at  a  90  percent 
capacity  factor,  assuming  a  wind  energy  capacity  factor  of  30  percent.  The  review  team 
estimates  that  about  396,000  ac  (about  620  mi2)  would  be  required  for  these  3,300  turbines, 
assuming  60  ac  per  installed  megawatt. 

Offshore  wind  farms  can  have  higher  capacity  factors  and  use  larger  turbines.  For  example,  the 
Cape  Wind  Energy  Project  will  use  130  wind  turbines  rated  at  3.6  MW(e)  each  for  an  electrical 
generation  capacity  of  468  MW(e).  The  project  is  expected  to  deliver,  on  average,  1 ,600  GWh 
per  year  to  the  grid  (including  consideration  of  line  losses  from  the  turbines  to  shore),  for  an 
average  effective  capacity  factor  of  39  percent  (DOI  2009-TN2527).  The  project  will  occupy  an 
area  of  about  25  mi2  (16,000  ac),  or  roughly  120  ac  per  turbine  (or  about  34  ac  per  installed 
megawatt). 

Using  similar  3.6-MW  wind  turbine  designs,  almost  1,400  wind  turbines  would  be  necessary  to 
produce  the  same  energy  as  the  PSEG  target  of  2,200  MW(e)  at  a  90  percent  capacity  factor, 
assuming  a  wind  energy  capacity  factor  of  40  percent.  The  review  team  estimates  that  about 
165,000  ac  (about  260  mi2)  would  be  required  for  these  turbines,  assuming  120  ac  per  turbine. 

To  improve  the  availability  and  reliability  of  wind  energy  for  use  as  a  baseload  supply,  some 
form  of  backup  power  or  energy  storage  would  be  needed  to  supply  power  during  periods  when 
the  wind  is  not  blowing.  Backup  power  would  likely  be  in  the  form  of  gas  turbines,  which  can 
respond  quickly  to  demand.  Energy  storage  could  involve  batteries,  compressed  air  energy 
storage  (CAES),  or,  as  discussed  in  Section  9. 2. 2. 4,  pumped  storage. 

A  CAES  plant  consists  of  motor-driven  air  compressors  that  use  off-peak  electricity  to  compress 
air  and  pump  it  into  a  suitable  geological  repository  such  as  an  underground  salt  cavern,  a  mine, 
or  a  porous  rock  formation.  During  periods  of  low  electricity  generation  by  the  wind  farm,  the

stored  energy  is  recovered  by  releasing  the  compressed  air  through  a  combustion  turbine  to 
generate  electricity  (NPCC  2010-TN2107).  CAES  is  not  a  new  technology.  A  290-MW  plant 
near  Bremen,  Germany,  began  operating  in  1978,  and  a  110-MW  plant  located  in  McIntosh, 
Alabama,  has  been  operating  since  1991.  Both  facilities  use  salt  caverns  for  compressed  air 
storage  (Succar  and  Williams  2008-TN2122).  The  largest  CAES  facility  under  consideration  in 
the  United  States  is  the  2,700-MW  Norton  Energy  Storage  facility  in  Ohio,  which,  if  built,  would 
store  compressed  air  in  600  ac  of  underground  limestone  mines  (FirstEnergy  2009-TN2102; 
OPSB  201 1 -TN21 11).  However,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  timetable  for  the  development 
of  the  Norton  project  at  this  time. 

Alternatively,  the  power  company  could  install  1,100  2-MW(e)  wind  turbines  to  match  the 
planned  output  of  the  nuclear  units  and  also  build  and  maintain  a  backup  power  source  (e.g.,  a 
natural-gas  plant)  to  provide  power  when  the  wind  farm  is  not  operating  at  full  capacity.  This 
would  involve  a  smaller  commitment  of  land  (about  132,000  ac)  for  the  wind  turbines.  But  it 
would  also  involve  the  very  expensive  proposition  of  building  two  power  plants:  the  wind 
turbines  and  the  natural-gas  plant. 

Wind  turbines  typically  have  a  service  life  of  at  least  20  years  (DOE/EERE  2008-TN2078); 
nevertheless,  waste  generation  from  wind  power  technology  would  be  minimal.  Some 
construction-related  debris  could  be  generated  during  construction  activities. 

DOE  predicts  that  there  will  be  substantial  water  savings,  especially  in  the  western  United 
States,  as  wind  power  production  increases  (DOE/EERE  2008-TN2078).  While  there  are  no 
water  discharges  for  wind  turbines,  erosion  and  sedimentation,  which  could  be  managed,  could 
occur  and  affect  land  and  water  resources.  Depending  on  the  number  and  amount  of  stream 
and  wetland  crossings  needed  for  the  interconnecting  transmission  lines,  aquatic  resources 
could  also  be  affected. 

Bird  and  bat  collisions  with  wind  turbines  are  a  documented  concern  (DOE/EERE  2008- 
TN2078);  hence,  wind  energy  developers  should  consider  migration  areas  and  nesting  locations 
when  sites  for  wind  energy  facilities  are  selected.  However,  relative  to  other  human  causes  of 
avian  mortality,  wind  energy  impacts  are  minimal.  Bird  fatalities  from  anthropogenic  causes 
range  from  100  million  to  1  billion  annually,  and  it  has  been  estimated  that  for  every 
10,000  birds  killed  by  human  activity,  less  than  one  death  is  caused  by  wind  turbines 
(DOE/EERE  2008-TN2078).  A  study  by  the  National  Research  Council  concluded  that  wind 
energy  generation  is  responsible  for  0.003  percent  of  human-caused  avian  mortality  (National 
Research  Council  2007-TN2105).  Additionally,  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  wind 
turbines  occur  most  frequently  with  migrating  bats,  and  studies  indicate  that  this  is  not  a 
significant  source  of  population  declines  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771 ).  Estimates  of  temporary 
construction  impacts  from  turbines,  service  roads,  and  other  infrastructure  range  from  0.5  to 
2.5  ac  per  turbine;  estimates  of  permanent  habitat  spatial  displacement  range  from  0.75  to 
1 .0  ac  per  turbine  (Strickland  and  Johnson  2006-TN21 1 6).  Indirect  impacts  can  include  loss 
and  fragmentation  of  wildlife  habitat  and  the  presence  of  turbines  causing  reduced  productivity 
and  a  local  reduction  in  biological  diversity.  For  example,  a  grassland  songbird  study  on  Buffalo 
Ridge  in  Minnesota  found  species  displacement  of  600  to  800  ft  from  wind  turbines  (Strickland 
and  Johnson  2006-TN21 16).

The  workforce  needed  to  install  and  maintain  wind  turbines  at  a  wind  farm  is  a  small  fraction  of 
that  for  fossil-fuel  or  nuclear  power  options.  Transporting  the  large  wind  turbine  components 
can  result  in  temporary  disruptions  to  local  traffic.  Individuals  with  turbines  on  their  properties 
might  see  an  increase  in  their  property  values  because  of  the  lease  payments  paid  by  the  wind 
project  owner.  Lease  payments  tend  to  be  in  the  range  of  $2,000  to  $5,000  per  turbine  per 
year,  either  through  fixed  payments  or  as  a  small  share  of  the  electric  power  revenue 
(DOE/EERE  2008-TN2078). 

Turbine  noise  might  be  considered  obtrusive  in  some  instances.  However,  to  reasonably 
ensure  that  sound  levels  are  acceptable  and  nonintrusive,  standard  setbacks  from  residences 
and  other  buildings  are  frequently  used  (DOE/EERE  2008-TN2078).  While  the  optimal  areas  for 
siting  wind  turbines  tend  to  be  those  with  lower  population  densities,  such  areas  are  also  often 
prized  for  their  natural  beauty,  unimpaired  by  human  activity. 

Wind  turbines  can  be  highly  visible  because  of  their  height  and  locations  (e.g.,  ridgelines,  open 
plains,  and  near  offshore).  The  aesthetic  impacts  associated  with  a  large  number  of  wind 
turbines  could  be  significant. 

Impacts  on  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  for  wind  farms  would  depend  on  the 
amount  of  land  disturbed  for  wind  turbines,  access  roads,  and  transmission  line  corridors. 

Lands  that  are  acquired  to  support  wind  power  generation  would  also  likely  need  an  inventory  of 
field  cultural  resources,  identification  and  recording  of  existing  historic  and  archaeological 
resources,  and  possible  mitigation  of  the  adverse  effect  from  ground-disturbing  actions. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  above,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a  wind  energy  facility 
at  the  PSEG  Site  or  elsewhere  within  the  PSEG  ROI  would  not  currently  be  a  reasonable 
alternative  to  construction  of  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility  that  would  be 
operated  as  a  baseload  plant.  The  primary  reason  for  this  conclusion  is  the  intermittent  nature 
of  wind  power  generation,  which  makes  it  unsuited,  by  itself,  to  produce  baseload  power. 
However,  because  it  is  a  proven  generating  technology  available  in  New  Jersey,  it  will  be 
considered  by  the  review  team  in  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives  in  Section  9.2.4. 

9. 2. 2. 2  Oil-Fired  Power  Generation 

Oil-fired  generation  is  more  expensive  than  the  nuclear,  natural-gas-fired,  or  coal-fired 
generation  options.  In  addition,  future  increases  in  oil  prices  are  expected  to  make  oil-fired 
generation  increasingly  more  expensive.  The  high  cost  of  oil  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  its  use 
for  electricity  generation.  The  reference  case  in  the  EIA  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2013  projects 
that  electric  power  production  using  petroleum  will  decrease  by  around  10  percent  from  2012  to 
2040  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2593).  In  the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437,  the  NRC  staff  estimated 
that  construction  of  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  oil-fired  plant  would  require  about  1 20  ac  of  land 
(NRC  1996-TN288).  Operation  of  an  oil-fired  power  plant  would  have  air  emissions  that  would 
be  similar  to  those  of  a  comparably  sized  coal-fired  plant  (NRC  1 996-TN288). 

For  the  aforementioned  economic  and  environmental  reasons,  the  review  team  concludes  that 
an  oil-fired  power  plant  would  not  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to  construction  of  a  2,200-MW(e) 
nuclear  power  generation  facility  that  would  be  operated  as  a  baseload  plant.

9.2  2.3  Solar  Power 

Electricity  derived  from  solar  power  has  a  special  place  in  the  New  Jersey  renewable  energy 
portfolio.  New  Jersey  currently  ranks  second  to  California  in  installed  solar  capacity  in  the 
United  States,  and  New  Jersey  has  adopted  an  aggressive  stance  on  supporting  the  use  of 
solar  energy  for  electric  power  generation.  As  of  September  201 1 ,  the  installed  solar  capacity 
of  commercial  and  residential  solar  projects  in  New  Jersey  was  about  306  MW(e)  and 
73  MW(e),  respectively,  and  almost  one-half  of  the  New  Jersey  solar  PV  capacity  was  installed 
between  2010  and  2011  (New  Jersey  201 1-TN21 1 5).  About  1,780  MW(e)  of  solar  projects  are 
either  under  consideration/design  or  are  being  installed  in  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2012-TN21 14). 

In  July  2009,  the  New  Jersey  Board  of  Public  Utilities  approved  a  request  from  PSE&G  to  invest 
more  than  $500  million  through  2013  to  install,  own,  and  operate  up  to  80  MW(e)  of  solar  PV 
cells  in  the  state.  The  proposed  installation  includes  the  world's  largest  use  of  solar  panels  on 
utility  poles;  about  200,000  PV  panels  on  utility  poles  would  generate  a  total  of  40  MW(e)  from 
solar  energy  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

In  addition  to  solar  PVs,  solar  energy  can  be  converted  to  electricity  using  solar  thermal 
technologies  that  use  concentrating  devices  to  create  elevated  temperatures  suitable  for  power 
production  (also  known  as  concentrating  solar  power  [CSP]).  In  solar  thermal  technology,  heat 
energy  from  the  sun  is  captured  and  transferred  to  a  fluid  that  is  subsequently  used  to  create 
steam  for  use  in  turbine  generators.  Because  this  is  a  thermoelectric  technology,  it  requires  a 
cooling  system  similar  to  that  used  at  a  nuclear  or  fossil-fuel  power  plant.  These  types  of  solar 
thermal  technologies  are  currently  less  costly  than  solar  PVs  for  bulk  power  production.  The 
largest  operational  solar  thermal  plant  is  the  310-MW(e)  Solar  Energy  Generating  System 
located  on  about  1,500  ac  in  the  Mojave  Desert  in  southern  California  (NextEra  2012-TN1400). 
The  land-use  requirement  for  this  plant  in  southern  California  is  about  5  ac/MW.  Thus,  about 
1 1 ,000  ac  would  be  needed  for  a  hypothetical  solar  thermal  power  plant  with  the  same  capacity 
(2,200-MW(e))  as  the  new  units  at  the  PSEG  Site,  assuming  5  ac/MW(e)  and  not  accounting  for 
any  site-specific  differences  in  solar  insolation  between  the  two  locations.  To  increase  their 
utility  as  sources  of  baseload  power,  solar  thermal  facilities  can  also  be  equipped  with  thermal 
storage  or  auxiliary  boilers  that  allow  production  of  electricity  during  periods  when  the  sun  is  not 
shining  (NPCC  2006-TN1408).  However,  the  use  of  CSP  in  New  Jersey  is  unlikely.  The  DOE 
considers  select  areas  in  seven  states  (Arizona,  California,  Colorado,  Nevada,  New  Mexico, 
Texas,  and  Utah)  to  be  suitable  for  the  development  of  CSP  (NREL  201 1-TN4224). 

In  solar  PV  systems,  sunlight  incident  on  special  PV  materials  results  in  the  production  of  direct 
current  electricity,  which  can  then  be  converted  into  alternating  current  power.  Solar  insolation 
has  a  low  energy  density  relative  to  other  common  energy  sources.  The  average  annual  solar 
insolation  in  Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey — a  city  for  which  data  are  available — is  4.7  kWh/m2/d  for 
fixed  plate  solar  collectors  oriented  at  an  angle  approximately  equivalent  to  the  latitude  of  the 
receiving  location  (NREL  2012-TN2096).  Storage  such  as  with  batteries  would  be  required  for 
constant  PV  energy  output  during  periods  when  the  sun  is  not  shining.  Alternatively,  PSEG 
could  build  a  backup  power  plant  (e.g.,  natural  gas)  to  provide  power  for  those  times  when  the 
solar  panels  are  producing  less  than  full  power.  In  addition,  interference  on  solar  cells  that  are 
obscured  by  dirt  or  snow  reduces  their  net  electrical  output.  DOE  reports  that  capacity  factors 
for  solar  PV  facilities  range  from  0.14  to  0.33,  with  the  higher  value  in  the  range  resulting  from 
solar  panels  that  track  the  sun,  and  a  favorable  location  (e.g.,  Phoenix,  Arizona)  (NREL  2011-

TN4224).  Because  of  the  low  solar  insolation  value  and  the  low  capacity  factor,  a  large  total 
acreage  is  needed  to  gather  an  appreciable  amount  of  energy.  Typical  solar-to-electric  power 
plants  require  5  to  10  ac  for  every  megawatt  of  generating  capacity  (TSECO  2008-TN21 18). 

For  the  PSEG  target  capacity  of  2,200  MW(e),  the  review  team  estimates  the  land  requirements 
would  be  between  11,000  and  22,000  ac.  The  associated  land-use  and  ecological  impacts 
could  include  fragmentation  and  loss  of  wildlife  habitat,  reduced  productivity,  and  local  reduction 
in  biological  diversity.  However,  the  solar  panels  would  produce,  on  average,  less  than  a  third 
of  the  power  of  the  nuclear  power  plant  because  solar  PV  facilities  have  a  much  lower  capacity 
factor. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  above,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a  solar  energy  facility 
at  the  PSEG  Site  or  elsewhere  within  the  PSEG  ROI  would  not  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to 
construction  of  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility  that  would  be  operated  as  a 
baseload  plant.  The  primary  reason  for  this  conclusion  is  the  intermittent  nature  of  solar  power 
generation,  which  makes  it  unsuited,  by  itself,  to  produce  baseload  power.  However,  because  it 
is  a  proven  generating  technology  available  in  New  Jersey,  it  will  be  considered  by  the  review 
team  in  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives  in  Section  9.2.4. 

9. 2. 2. 4  Hydropower  and  Hydrokinetic  Energy 

Four  technology  variants  of  hydroelectric  power-generation  technologies  are  applicable  to  water 
resources  in  New  Jersey:  impoundment,  diversion,  pumped  storage,  and  hydrokinetic. 

Impoundment  technology  (also  called  dam-and-release)  is  the  most  common  type  of 
hydroelectric  technology  in  the  United  States,  and  it  consists  of  a  dam  that  stores  water  in  its 
associated  reservoir.  Electrical  energy  is  produced  in  turbine  generators  when  water  is 
released  from  the  reservoir  and  flows  through  these  turbines.  Impoundment  facilities  affect 
large  amounts  of  land  behind  the  dam  to  create  reservoirs,  but  they  can  provide  substantial 
amounts  of  baseload  power  at  capacity  factors  greater  than  90  percent. 

Diversion  technology  (also  called  run-of-the-river)  channels  a  portion  of  the  water  in  a  river 
through  a  canal  or  penstock,  and  it  may  or  may  not  require  the  use  of  a  dam  or  other 
impoundment.  Turbine  generators  are  used  to  convert  the  flow  of  water  into  electrical  energy. 
The  power-generating  capacities  of  diversion  facilities  fluctuate  with  the  flow  of  water  in  the 
river,  and  the  operation  of  such  facilities  is  typically  constrained  so  as  not  to  create  undue  stress 
on  the  aquatic  ecosystems  that  are  present. 

A  pumped  storage  facility  stores  energy  by  pumping  water  from  a  lower  reservoir  into  a 
reservoir  at  a  higher  elevation  during  off-peak  periods  when  the  demand  for  electrical  energy  is 
low;  then,  during  periods  of  higher  electrical  demand,  the  water  is  released  through  turbine 
generators  back  into  the  lower  reservoir. 

Hydrokinetic  energy  projects  generate  electricity  from  waves  or  from  the  flow  of  water  in  ocean 
currents  or  tides  or  inland  waterways.  Hydrokinetic  technologies  capture  wave  energy  from 
floating  or  submerged  devices,  oscillating  water  columns,  overtopping  devices,  or  attenuators. 
Hydrokinetic  devices  for  use  with  currents  in  ocean  or  inland  waterways  use  axial  or  cross-flow 
turbines  or  reciprocating  mechanisms  to  generate  electric  power.  In  addition,  hydrokinetic 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


systems  involving  thermodynamic  cycles  that  are  under  development  would  use  the 
temperature  differential  within  a  water  body  (such  as  the  ocean)  or  hybrid  combinations  of  the 
above  mechanisms  to  generate  electrical  energy  (DOE  2012-TN2085). 

All  of  the  above  hydropower  technologies  are  technically  plausible  for  development  in  New 
Jersey;  however,  the  characteristics  of  rivers  in  the  state,  the  topography,  and  the  existing  land 
uses  limit  the  development  of  impoundment  facilities  and  diversion  facilities.  The  highest 
elevation  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  is  1 ,803  ft  above  sea  level,  and  the  lowest  point  is  at  sea 
level  (i.e.,  the  Atlantic  Ocean).  The  mean  elevation  of  the  state  is  about  250  ft  (USCB  2012- 
TN21 19).  In  the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437,  the  NRC  staff  estimated  that  land  requirements 
for  impoundment  hydroelectric  power  are  about  1  million  ac  per  1,000  MW(e)  (NRC  1996- 
TN288).  For  the  PSEG  target  capacity  of  2,200  MW(e)  for  the  desired  net  electrical  output,  land 
requirements  would  thus  be  2.2  million  ac.  Although  diversion  hydroelectric  facilities  avoid 
concerns  for  excessive  land  use  and  widespread  habitat  alteration,  their  productivity  is  directly 
affected  by  a  number  of  factors;  for  example,  seasonal  low-flow  conditions  and  sustenance 
requirements  of  the  river  aquatic  ecosystems  can  lead  to  temporary  or  extended  interruptions  in 
power  production. 

The  EIA  reference  case  in  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2013  projects  that  U.S.  electricity 
production  from  hydropower  plants  will  remain  essentially  stable  through  the  year  2040 
(DOE/EIA  2013-TN2591 ).  EIA  reports  that  in  2010,  conventional  hydroelectric  power  in  New 
Jersey  had  a  collective  net  summer  capacity  of  only  4  MW  and  generated  18,119  MWh  of  power 
(DOE  2012-TN2524). 

The  most  recent  comprehensive  state-by-state  study  of  potential  impoundment  and  diversion 
hydropower  resources  in  the  United  States  was  published  by  DOE  in  2006  (Hall  et  al.  2006- 
TN2092).  The  2006  study  was  a  follow-on  examination  of  a  2004  study  that  evaluated  potential 
water  energy  resources  to  identify  which  of  those  resources  could  be  feasibly  developed.  The 
2006  study  attempted  to  determine  the  realistic  hydropower  potential  of  those  resources  by 
focusing  more  closely  on  the  low-head  resources  (i.e.,  elevation  changes  of  30  ft  or  less)  and 
low-power  resources.  The  development  model  included  consideration  of  working  flow 
restrictions  that  were  equivalent  to  half  the  stream  flow  rate  at  the  site  or  sufficient  flow  to 
produce  an  average  of  30  MW,  whichever  was  less.  The  study  found  that  a  potential  total  of 
63  MW  (annual  average)  was  feasible  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  from  such  water  resources. 

There  is  one  pumped  energy  storage  facility  in  New  Jersey  (the  Yards  Creek  facility  in  Warren 
County),  and  it  is  used  for  peaking  power  generation.  The  combined  capacity  of  the  three  Yards 
Creek  units  is  400  MW(e)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission 
(FERC)  has  also  issued  a  preliminary  permit  to  Reliable  Storage  2,  LLC,  for  a  feasibility  study  of 
additional  pumped  storage  in  New  Jersey  (FERC  Docket  No.  P-141 14).  The  proposed 
Rockaway  Pumped  Storage  facility  in  Morris  County  would  take  water  from  the  inactive  Mount 
Hope  mine  at  depths  up  to  2,500  ft  below  ground  level  and  pump  it  into  a  to-be-constructed 
aboveground  reservoir.  Electrical  power  would  be  generated  by  turbine  generators  when  the 
water  is  released  from  the  proposed  reservoir  back  into  the  underground  mine.  The  total 
proposed  capacity  of  the  Rockaway  facility  would  be  1 ,000  MW(e)  (FERC  2011 -TN2099).

No  hydrokinetic  power  facilities  that  generate  significant  amounts  of  power  are  currently  in 
operation  in  New  Jersey;  however,  FERC  has  issued  several  preliminary  permits  for  feasibility 
studies  of  possible  hydrokinetic  energy  facilities  in  New  Jersey.  The  two  largest  of  these 
potential  facilities  are  being  considered  by  Natural  Currents  Energy  Services,  LLC.  One  such 
facility  would  be  installed  on  the  Beach  Thorofare  in  Atlantic  City  (FERC  2012-TN2100)  and  the 
other  on  the  Ingram  Thorofare  in  Cape  May  County  (FERC  2012-TN2101 ).  Each  of  these 
potential  facilities  would  install  between  10  and  30  hydrokinetic  tidal  units,  each  with  a 
generating  capacity  of  100  kW(e);  thus,  the  total  combined  output  of  the  two  facilities  would  be 
between  2  and  6  MW(e).  However,  these  facilities  are  presently  in  the  conceptual  planning 
stage,  no  firm  plans  have  yet  been  developed  for  their  full  construction  or  operation,  and  no 
FERC  permits  have  been  issued  beyond  the  preliminary  feasibility  study  stage. 

Because  of  the  relatively  low  amount  of  undeveloped  hydropower  resource  in  New  Jersey  and 
the  large  land-use  and  related  environmental  and  ecological  resource  impacts  associated  with 
siting  hydroelectric  facilities  large  enough  to  produce  2,200  MW(e),  and  the  limited  progress  in 
developing  hydrokinetic  resources,  the  review  team  concludes  that  hydropower,  including 
energy  from  ocean/tidal/wave  energy,  within  the  PSEG  ROI  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative  to  a 
new  nuclear  power  generation  facility  operated  as  a  baseload  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

9. 2. 2. 5  Geothermal  Energy 

Geothermal  energy  has  an  average  capacity  factor  of  90  percent  or  more  and  can  be  used  for 
baseload  power;  however,  the  development  of  geothermal  generating  facilities  is  only  likely  to 
occur  in  limited  geographical  areas  because  of  the  limited  availability  of  the  resource 
(NRC  2013-TN2654).  Geothermal  plants  are  most  likely  to  be  sited  in  the  western  continental 
United  States,  Alaska,  and  Hawaii,  where  hydrothermal  reservoirs  are  prevalent  (DOE  2008- 
TN1409).  Maps  available  from  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  show  that 
no  geothermal  power  generation  is  planned  for  any  state  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  according 
to  data  supplied  to  NREL  by  the  Geothermal  Energy  Association  (NREL  2012-TN2097). 
Furthermore,  no  hydrogeothermal  sites  with  temperatures  greater  than  90°C  have  been 
identified  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  nor  are  any  favorable  deep  geothermal  resources 
(i.e.,  with  elevated  temperatures  at  depths  of  1  to  3  km)  located  beneath  New  Jersey 
(NREL  2012-TN2097). 

Geothermal  systems  have  a  relatively  small  footprint  and  minimal  emissions;  however,  a  study 
led  by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  concluded  that  a  $300  to  $400  million 
investment  over  15  years  would  be  needed  to  make  early-generation  enhanced  geothermal 
system  power  plant  installations  competitive  in  the  evolving  U.S.  electricity  supply  markets 
(MIT  2006-TN1410). 

For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  concludes  that  a  geothermal  energy  facility  at  the  PSEG 
Site  or  elsewhere  in  the  PSEG  ROI  would  not  currently  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to 
construction  of  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility  operated  as  a  baseload  plant.

9. 2. 2. 6  Wood  Waste 

A  wood-burning  facility  could  provide  baseload  power  and  operate  with  a  high  annual  capacity 
factor  and  with  thermal  efficiency  similar  to  a  coal  plant  (EPA  2007-TN2660;  NREL  1993- 
TN2661).  The  fuels  required  for  a  wood-waste  facility  are  variable  and  site-specific.  A 
significant  impediment  to  the  use  of  wood  waste  to  generate  electricity  is  the  high  cost  of  fuel 
delivery  and  high  construction  cost  per  megawatt  of  generating  capacity.  The  largest 
wood-waste  power  plants  are  only  75  MW(e)  in  size  (DOE/EERE  2004-TN2086).  Estimates  in 
the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437  suggest  that  the  overall  level  of  construction  impacts  per 
megawatt  of  installed  capacity  would  be  about  the  same  as  that  for  a  coal-fired  plant,  although 
facilities  using  wood  waste  for  fuel  would  be  built  at  smaller  scales  (NRC  1996-TN288).  Similar 
to  coal-fired  plants,  wood-waste  plants  require  large  areas  for  fuel  storage  and  processing  and 
involve  the  same  type  of  combustion  and  pollution-control  equipment. 

Based  on  the  quantities  of  biomass  reported  by  NREL  (2005-TN2094),  PSEG  estimates  that  up  to 
about  240  MW(e)  from  biomass  such  as  wood  waste,  forest  residues,  and  agricultural  crop 
residues  could  potentially  be  developed  in  New  Jersey.  Of  that  240  MW(e),  about  1 55  MW(e) 
could  be  produced  by  urban  wood  residues  and  secondary  mill  residues  (PSEG  2012-TN21 13). 
Biomass  already  provides  a  baseload  capacity  of  30  MW(e)  in  New  Jersey  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Because  of  uncertainties  associated  with  obtaining  sufficient  wood  and  wood  waste  to  fuel  a 
baseload  power  plant,  the  ecological  impacts  of  large-scale  timber  cutting  (e.g.,  soil  erosion  and 
loss  of  wildlife  habitat),  and  the  relatively  small  size  of  wood  power-generation  plants,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  wood  waste  would  not  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to  a  2,200-MW(e) 
nuclear  power  generation  facility  operated  as  a  baseload  plant. 

9. 2. 2. 7  Municipal  Solid  Waste  and  Methane  from  Landfills 

Municipal  solid-waste  (MSW)  combustors  incinerate  waste  and  can  use  the  resulting  heat  to 
produce  steam,  hot  water,  or  electricity.  The  combustion  process  reduces  the  volume  of  waste, 
as  well  as  the  need  for  new  solid-waste  landfills.  MSW  combustors  use  three  basic  types  of 
technologies:  mass  burn,  modular,  and  refuse-derived  fuel.  Mass-burning  technologies  are 
most  commonly  used  in  the  United  States.  This  group  of  technologies  processes  raw  MSW 
with  little  or  no  sizing,  shredding,  or  separation  before  combustion.  More  than  20  percent  of  the 
U.S.  MSW  incinerators  use  refuse-derived  fuel,  where  (in  contrast  to  mass  burning,  in  which  the 
MSW  is  introduced  “as  is”  into  the  combustion  chamber)  the  facilities  are  equipped  to  recover 
recyclables  (e.g.,  metals,  cans,  and  glass)  followed  by  shredding  the  combustible  fraction  into 
fluff  for  incineration  (EPA  2013-TN2121). 

MSW  combustors  generate  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  emissions,  as  well  as 
an  ash  residue  that  is  buried  in  landfills.  The  ash  residue  is  composed  of  bottom  ash  and  fly 
ash,  as  is  the  case  with  coal  combustion. 

In  New  Jersey,  116  MW(e)  of  baseload  capacity  and  23  MW(e)  of  peaking  capacity  are  currently 
available  from  MSW  facilities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  a  report  prepared  for  the  State  of  New 
Jersey.  Rutgers  University  estimated  that  additional  electricity  production  from  incineration  of 
MSW  could  amount  to  as  much  as  about  840  MW(e)  if  all  of  the  practicably  recoverable  waste 
were  to  be  burned  (Brennan  et  al.  2007-TN2528).

The  combustion  of  methane  gas  collected  from  natural  decay  processes  in  landfills  is  another 
source  of  energy  for  the  production  of  electric  power.  While  the  composition  of  LFG  varies 
depending  on  the  type  of  waste  in  the  landfill,  the  primary  component  is  combustible  methane. 
The  LFG  is  collected  in  a  process  that  involves  the  use  of  recovery  wells  and  gas  collection 
systems  that  are  constructed  in  the  landfill.  Because  LFG  is  produced  continuously,  facilities 
that  burn  LFGs  can  have  a  capacity  factor  greater  than  90  percent  and  can  thus  be  relied  upon 
as  sources  of  baseload  power.  PSEG  estimates  that  about  70  MW(e)  can  potentially  be 
produced  in  New  Jersey  from  LFG  and  from  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  which  also 
generate  methane  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Currently  in  New  Jersey,  a  baseload  capacity  of  31  MW(e)  and  an  additional  20  MW(e)  of 
peaking  capacity  are  available  from  facilities  burning  methane  from  landfills  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Given  the  small  size  and  output  of  existing  plants,  the  review  team  concludes  that  generating 
electricity  from  either  MSW  or  methane  derived  from  landfills  or  wastewater  treatment  plants 
would  not  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility 
operated  as  a  baseload  plant  within  the  PSEG  ROI. 

9. 2. 2. 8  Other  Biomass-Derived  Fuels 

In  addition  to  wood  waste  and  MSW  as  fuels,  several  other  biomass-derived  fuels  are  available 
for  fueling  electric  generators,  including  crops  grown  specifically  for  use  as  feedstocks  in 
combustion  facilities  (i.e. ,  energy  crops  such  as  switchgrass),  agricultural  residues  such  as  corn 
stover,  crops  converted  into  a  liquid  fuel  such  as  ethanol,  and  crops  (including  wood  waste) 
used  in  gasification  processes. 

Biomass-derived  fuels  would  typically  be  used  as  fuel  for  combustion  processes  that  create 
electric  power  by  steam  generators  and  turbines  in  a  manner  similar  to  coal-fired  power  plants. 
Construction  of  any  combustion-based  biomass  plant  would  have  environmental  impacts  similar 
to  those  for  a  coal-fired  plant,  although  facilities  using  energy  crops  and  agricultural  residues  for 
fuel  would  be  built  on  a  smaller  scale.  Similar  to  coal-fired  plants,  biomass-fired  plants  require 
areas  for  fuel  storage,  processing,  and  waste  (i.e.,  ash)  disposal.  The  major  operating  waste 
from  biomass-fired  plants  would  be  the  fly  ash  and  bottom  ash  that  result  from  the  combustion 
of  the  carbonaceous  fuels.  Biomass-derived  fuels  would  generate  fewer  criteria  pollutants  per 
unit  of  energy  than  coal.  Significant  impacts  to  land  use  could  be  associated  with  energy  crops 
due  to  the  large  acreage  required  to  grow  these  crops.  If  these  crops  were  to  be  irrigated,  then 
significant  impacts  to  water  use  and/or  water  quality  could  also  occur. 

Co-firing  biomass  fuels  with  coal  is  possible  when  low-cost  biomass  resources  are  available. 
Co-firing  is  the  most  economic  option  for  the  near  future  to  introduce  new  biomass  power 
generation.  These  projects  require  small  capital  investments  per  unit  of  power-generation 
capacity.  Co-firing  systems  range  in  size  from  1  to  30  MW(e)  of  biopower  capacity  (DOE  2008- 
TN1416). 

The  review  team  concludes  that  given  the  relatively  small  average  output  of  biomass  power- 
generation  facilities  and  the  lack  of  maturity  of  technologies  such  as  crop  gasification,  biomass-

derived  fuels  do  not  offer  a  reasonable  alternative  to  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation 
facility  operated  as  a  baseload  plant  within  the  PSEG  ROI. 

9. 2. 2. 9  Fuel  Cells 

Fuel  cells  work  without  combustion  and  its  associated  environmental  side  effects.  Power  is 
produced  electrochemically  by  passing  a  hydrogen-rich  fuel  over  an  anode,  air  over  a  cathode, 
and  then  separating  the  two  with  an  electrolyte.  The  only  by-products  are  heat,  water,  and 
carbon  dioxide  (CO2).  The  hydrogen  fuel  can  come  from  a  variety  of  hydrocarbon  resources  by 
subjecting  them  to  steam  under  pressure.  Natural  gas  is  typically  used  as  the  source  of 
hydrogen. 

Phosphoric  acid  fuel  cells  are  generally  considered  first-generation  technology.  Higher- 
temperature  second-generation  fuel  cells  achieve  higher  fuel-to-electricity  and  thermal 
efficiencies.  The  higher  temperatures  contribute  to  improved  efficiencies  and  give  the  second- 
generation  fuel  cells  the  capability  to  generate  steam  for  cogeneration  and  combined-cycle 
operations. 

During  the  past  three  decades,  significant  efforts  have  been  made  to  develop  more  practical 
and  affordable  fuel  cell  designs  for  stationary  power  applications,  but  progress  has  been  slow. 
The  cost  of  fuel  cell  power  systems  must  be  reduced  before  they  can  be  competitive  with 
conventional  technologies  (DOE  2008-TN1417).  DOE  has  an  initiative  called  the  Solid  State 
Energy  Conversion  Alliance  (SECA)  with  the  goal  of  developing  large  (i.e.,  250  MW  or  greater) 
fuel  cell  power  systems,  including  those  based  on  coal-derived  fuels.  Another  goal  of  SECA  is 
to  cut  the  costs  of  electricity  generated  via  fuel  cells  to  $700  per  kilowatt  (electrical)  (DOE  2011- 
TN2083).  However,  it  is  not  clear  whether  DOE  will  achieve  these  goals  and,  if  so,  when  the 
associated  fuel  cells  might  reach  commercial  operations. 

The  review  team  concludes  that,  at  the  present  time,  fuel  cells  are  not  economically  or 
technologically  competitive  with  other  alternatives  for  baseload  electricity  generation.  Future 
gains  in  cost  competitiveness  for  fuel  cells  compared  to  other  fuels  are  speculative. 

For  the  preceding  reasons,  the  staff  concludes  that  a  fuel  cell  energy  facility  located  at  the 
PSEG  Site  or  elsewhere  within  the  PSEG  ROI  would  not  currently  be  a  reasonable  alternative  to 
construction  of  a  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility  operated  as  a  baseload  plant. 

9.2.2.10  Coal 

Coal-fired  generation  is  a  proven  baseload  generating  technology  that  is  currently  in  use  in 
New  Jersey.  In  201 1 ,  coal  generated  about  1 2  percent  of  the  utility-generated  electricity  in  New 
Jersey  (PJM  2012-TN3129).  This  contribution  to  generation  was  down  from  over  17  percent  in 
2000,  primarily  because  of  a  significant  increase  in  generation  using  natural  gas.  While  building 
a  new  coal-fired  power  plant  could  be  challenging(1)  (e.g.,  meeting  evolving  air  emissions 


(1 )  The  review  team  is  aware  that  the  governor  of  New  Jersey  has  announced  a  policy  of  no  new  coal- 
fired  power  plants  (New  Jersey  201 1 -TN21 1 5).  While  the  policy  does  not  have  the  force  of  law,  it 
further  reduces  the  likelihood  a  new  coal  plant  could  be  built.  However,  because  a  new  coal  plant  is 
not  prohibited  by  law,  the  review  team  included  a  coal-fired  alternative  in  its  analysis.

standards),  the  review  team  considers  it  to  be  a  feasible  option  to  meet  the  need  for  new 
baseload  capacity  that  was  discussed  in  Chapter  8. 

9.2.2.11  Natural  Gas 

Natural-gas-fired  generation  is  a  proven  generating  technology  that  is  currently  in  use  in  New 
Jersey.  In  201 1 ,  natural  gas  generated  about  55  percent  of  the  utility-generated  electricity  in 
New  Jersey  (PJM  2012-TN3129).  This  contribution  to  generation  was  up  from  around 
28  percent  in  2000.  While  natural  gas  has  traditionally  been  used  as  an  intermediate  or  peaking 
power  source,  more  recently  it  has  been  used  increasingly  as  a  baseload  source,  often 
displacing  coal-fired  generating  plants  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2590).  The  review  team  considers 
natural  gas  to  be  a  feasible  option  to  meet  the  need  for  new  baseload  capacity  that  was 
discussed  in  Chapter  8. 

9.2.3  Feasible  Discrete  New  Generating  Alternatives 

The  discussion  in  Sections  9.2.3. 1  and  9.2. 3.2  is  limited  to  a  reasonable  range  of  the  individual 
energy  alternatives  that  appear  to  be  viable  for  new  baseload  generation:  coal-fired  and 
natural-gas  combined-cycle  generation.  The  impacts  discussed  in  these  sections  are  estimates 
based  on  current  technology.  Section  9.2.2  also  addresses  other  generation  technologies  that 
have  demonstrated  commercial  acceptance  but  may  be  limited  in  application,  total  capacity,  or 
technical  feasibility  when  analyzed  based  on  the  need  to  supply  reliable,  baseload  capacity. 

To  assess  the  environmental  impacts  of  each  of  the  competitive  energy  alternatives,  the  review 
team  assumed  that  (1)  the  new  power-generation  facilities  would  be  located  at  the  PSEG  Site 
for  the  coal-fired  and  natural-gas-fired  alternatives,  (2)  the  same  cooling  approach  (i.e.,  closed- 
cycle  cooling)  as  in  the  type  envisioned  by  PSEG  for  new  nuclear  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
be  used  for  plant  cooling,  and  (3)  the  new  causeway  to  be  constructed  for  access  to  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  needed  for  any  new  coal-fired  or  natural-gas-fired  alternatives  that  might  be 
constructed  and  operated  at  the  site. 

9. 2. 3. 1  Coal-Fired  Power  Generation 

For  the  coal-fired  power-generation  alternative,  the  review  team  assumed  construction  and 
operation  of  four  supercritical  pulverized  coal-fired  units,  each  with  a  total  net  capacity  of  about 
580  MW(e).  A  capacity  factor  of  85  percent  was  assumed.  The  coal-fired  units  were  assumed 
to  have  an  operating  life  of  40  years.  The  above  assumptions  are  consistent  with  the  ER 
submitted  as  part  of  the  PSEG  ESP  application  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  except  that  the  review 
team  assumed  a  somewhat  lower  capacity  factor  for  coal,  and  slightly  larger  units  in  order  to 
generate  the  same  amount  of  electricity  annually  as  the  proposed  project.  The  review  team 
estimates  of  coal  consumption,  coal  combustion  technology,  air  emissions,  water  consumption, 
and  waste  product  generation  are  based  on  Cost  and  Performance  Baseline  for  Fossil  Energy 
Plants,  Volume  1:  Bituminous  Coal  and  Natural  Gas  to  Electricity  (NETL  2010-TN1423). 

The  review  team  also  considered  an  integrated  gasification  combined-cycle  (IGCC)  coal-fired 
plant.  IGCC  is  an  emerging  technology  for  generating  electricity  with  coal  that  combines 
modern  coal  gasification  technology  with  both  gas  turbine  and  steam  turbine  power  generation. 
This  technology  is  cleaner  than  conventional  pulverized  coal  plants  because  major  pollutants 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


can  be  removed  from  the  gas  stream  before  combustion.  The  IGCC  alternative  also  generates 
less  solid  waste  than  the  pulverized  coal-fired  alternative.  The  largest  solid-waste  stream 
produced  by  IGCC  installations  is  slag — a  glassy,  black,  sand-like  material — that  is  potentially  a 
marketable  by-product.  The  other  large-volume  by-product  produced  by  IGCC  plants  is  sulfur, 
which  is  extracted  during  the  gasification  process  and  which  can  also  be  marketed  rather  than 
disposed  of  as  waste.  IGCC  units  do  not  produce  ash  or  scrubber  wastes. 

In  spite  of  the  preceding  advantages,  the  review  team  concludes  that,  at  present,  a  new  IGCC 
plant  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative  to  a  2,200  MW(e)  nuclear  power  generation  facility  for  the 
following  reasons:  (1)  IGCC  plants  are  more  expensive  than  comparable  pulverized  coal  plants 
(NETL  2010-TN1423),  (2)  the  existing  IGCC  plants  in  the  United  States  have  considerably 
smaller  capacities  than  the  assumed  2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  plant/1)  (3)  the  system  reliability  of 
existing  IGCC  plants  has  been  lower  than  pulverized  coal  plants,  and  (4)  a  lack  of  overall  plant 
performance  warranties  for  IGCC  plants  has  hindered  commercial  financing  (NPCC  2005- 
TN1406).  For  these  reasons,  IGCC  plants  are  not  considered  further  in  this  EIS. 

For  the  coal-fired  alternative,  the  review  team  assumed  that  coal  for  fuel  and  limestone 
(calcium  carbonate)  for  the  pollution  abatement  system  would  be  delivered  to  the  plant  by 
barge.  The  review  team  estimates  that  the  hypothetical  coal-fired  plant  would  consume  about 
6.5  million  tons  per  year  (tpy)  of  pulverized  Illinois  No.  6  bituminous  coal.  Slaked  lime  or 
limestone  would  be  used  in  the  flue-gas  scrubbing  process  for  control  of  SO2  emissions  and 
would  be  injected  as  a  slurry  into  the  hot  effluent  combustion  gases  to  remove  entrained  SO2. 
The  limestone-based  scrubbing  solution  reacts  with  SO2  to  form  calcium  sulfite  or  calcium 
sulfate,  which  precipitates  and  is  removed  from  the  process  as  sludge  for  dewatering  and  then 
sold  to  industry  for  use  in  the  manufacture  of  wallboard  or  other  industrial  products.  The  review 
team  estimates  that  about  641 ,000  tpy  of  limestone  would  be  used  for  flue-gas  desulfurization, 
generating  about  997,000  tpy  of  spent  limestone  (i.e.,  calcium  sulfite  or  calcium  sulfate)  waste. 

Air  Quality 

The  impacts  on  air  quality  from  coal-fired  generation  would  vary  considerably  from  those  of 
nuclear  generation  because  of  emissions  of  SO2,  NOX)  carbon  monoxide,  particulate  matter 
(PM),  volatile  organic  compounds,  and  hazardous  air  pollutants  such  as  mercury  and  lead.  The 
review  team  assumes  that  fugitive  dust  emissions  from  construction  activities  would  be 
mitigated  using  best  management  practices  (BMPs),  similar  to  mitigation  discussed  in  Chapter  4 
for  building  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Such  emissions  would  be  temporary. 

The  review  team  assumed  a  plant  design  that  would  minimize  air  emissions  through  a 
combination  of  boiler  and  combustion  technology  and  post-combustion  pollutant  removal. 
Nevertheless,  these  emissions  estimates  are  not  necessarily  representative  of  those  allowable 
under  applicable  regulatory  air  permits.  Salem  County  is  in  nonattainment  of  the  8-hour  ozone 
National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQSs).  One  or  more  of  the  emission  estimates 


(1)  The  review  team  is  aware  that  Duke  Energy  placed  a  618-MW(e)  integrated  gasification  combined 
cycle  (IGCC)  plant  into  service  in  June  2013  (Duke  2013-TN2662)  and  that  Mississippi  Power  is 
building  an  IGCC  plant  in  Kemper  County,  Mississippi,  with  a  planned  output  of  582  MW(e)  and  a 
planned  commercial  operations  date  in  the  first  half  of  2016  (MPC  2015-TN4155).

presented  below  exceeds  the  threshold  value  of  100  tpy;  therefore,  a  new  coal-fired  plant 
having  these  emissions  would  qualify  as  a  major  source  that  must  obtain  a  Title  V  operating 
permit.  A  final  air  permit  for  building  the  coal-fired  power  plant  would  likely  require  the  lowest 
achievable  emission  rate  (LAER)  for  ozone  precursor  (NOx),  along  with  offsets(1)  (NJAC  7:27- 
TN3290),  and  the  best  available  control  technology  (BACT)  for  other  pollutants  (SO2  and  PM). 
The  review  team’s  estimate  of  the  approximate  emissions  from  the  coal-fired  generation 
alternative  is  as  follows:(2) 

•  SO2  =  6,460  tpy; 

•  NOx  =  5,270  tpy; 

•  PM  =  980  tpy;  and 

•  mercury  =  0.085  tpy. 

The  review  team  estimates  that  the  coal-fired  plant  would  also  have  CO2  emissions  of 
15.3  million  tpy  that  could  affect  climate  change. 

The  acid  rain  requirements  of  the  Clean  Air  Act,  as  amended  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 ), 
capped  U.S.  SO2  emissions  from  power  plants.  PSEG  would  need  to  obtain  sufficient  pollution 
credits  either  from  a  set-aside  pool  or  purchases  on  the  open  market  to  cover  annual  emissions 
from  the  plant. 

A  new  coal-fired  power-generation  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  need  a  Nonattainment  New 
Source  Review  (NSR)  permit  for  NOx  and  a  Prevention  of  Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)  permit 
for  SO2  and  PM  as  building  permits  and  a  Title  V  operating  permit  under  the  Clean  Air  Act 
(42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 ).  The  plant  would  need  to  comply  with  the  new  source 
performance  standards  for  such  plants  in  40  CFR  Part  60  (TNI 020),  Subpart  Da.  The 
standards  establish  emission  limits  for  PM  and  opacity  (40  CFR  60.42Da),  SO2  (40  CFR 
60.43Da),  and  NOx  (40  CFR  60.44Da)  (40  CFR  Part  60-TN1020). 

Historically,  CO2,  an  unavoidable  by-product  of  combustion  of  carbonaceous  fuels,  has  not  been 
regulated  as  a  pollutant.  However,  regulations  are  now  under  development  for  CO2  and  other 
greenhouse  gases  (GHGs).  In  response  to  the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  of  2008  (Public 
Law  110-161,  121  Stat.  1844-TN1485),  EPA  promulgated  final  mandatory  GHG  reporting 
regulations  in  October  2009,  effective  in  December  2009  (74  FR  56260-TN1024).  The  rules  are 
primarily  applicable  to  large  facility  sources  of  CO2  equivalent  (C02e)  (those  emitting  25,000 
metric  tons  or  more  per  year).  New  utility-scale  coal-fired  power  plants  would  be  subject  to 
those  regulations. 

A  new  coal-fired  generation  plant  would  qualify  as  a  major  generator  of  GHGs  under  the 
“Tailoring  Rule”  recently  promulgated  by  EPA  (75  FR  31514-TN1404).  Beginning  January  2, 


(1 )  The  minimum  offset  ratio  varies,  depending  on  the  distance  between  the  facility  and  the  location  of 
the  emission  reductions  being  proposed  as  emission  offsets:  1.3  to  1  for  0-100  mi;  2.6  to  1  for 
100-250  mi;  and  5.2  to  1  for  250-500  mi. 

(2)  Based  on  6,460,000  tpy  of  bituminous  coal  and  combustion  controls  using  overfire  air  nozzles  in 
combination  with  low-NOx  burners  and  selective  catalytic  reduction,  limestone-based  flue-gas 
desulfurization,  and  conventional  particulate  capture  technology.

201 1 ,  permits  issued  to  major  sources  of  GHG  under  the  PSD  or  Title  V  Federal  permit 
programs  must  contain  provisions  requiring  the  use  of  BACT  to  limit  the  emissions  of  GHGs  if 
those  sources  would  be  subject  to  PSD  or  Title  V  permitting  requirements  because  of  their  non- 
GHG  pollutant  emission  potentials  and  if  their  estimated  GHG  emissions  are  at  least 
75,000  tons  C02e  per  year.  The  amount  of  GHGs,  mostly  C02,  released  per  unit  of  power 
produced  would  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  fuel,  the  firing  conditions,  and  overall  firing 
efficiency  of  the  boiler.  On  August  3,  2015.  the  EPA  set  the  final  standard  to  limit  CO2 
emissions  from  new  coal-fired  power  plants  (EPA  2015-TN4336).  However,  even  with  the 
application  of  this  new  standard,  the  emissions  from  a  coal-fired  power  plant  will  still  be  far 
greater  than  those  from  a  comparably  sized  nuclear  power  plant.  Meeting  permit  limitations  for 
GHG  emissions  may  require  installation  of  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  (CCS)  devices  on 
any  new  coal-fired  power  plant,  which  could  add  substantial  power  penalties.  The  relative 
efficiency  penalty  for  adding  CO2  capture  ranges  from  21  to  29  percent  on  average,  meaning 
that  a  new  coal  plant  would  have  to  be  much  larger  than  the  proposed  nuclear  power  plant  to 
provide  a  comparable  amount  of  power  (NETL  2010-TN1423).  In  addition,  once  extracted  the 
CO2  would  have  to  be  piped  either  to  a  permanent  sequestration  site,  or  for  use  in  enhanced  oil 
recovery.  Regardless  of  end  use,  the  construction  of  a  CO2  pipeline  would  have  the  potential  to 
increase  the  impacts  on  resources  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecology, 
socioeconomics,  and  cultural  and  historic  resources.  Because  the  exact  location  of  such 
sequestration  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  analysis  the  magnitude  of  the  impacts  could  not  be 
quantified  by  the  NRC  staff.  The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  complying  with  the  new  CO2 
regulations  would  increase  the  cumulative  impacts  because  the  coal-fired  power  plant  would  be 
larger  and  because  of  the  construction  of  the  CO2  pipeline. 

The  EPA  has  various  regulatory  requirements  for  visibility  protection  in  40  CFR  Part  51 , 

Subpart  P  (TNI 090),  including  a  specific  requirement  for  review  of  any  new  major  stationary 
source  in  an  area  designated  as  in  attainment  or  unclassified  for  criteria  pollutants  under  the 
Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141)  (40  CFR  51.307(a)  [TNI 090]).  NAAQSs  for 
criteria  pollutants  are  specified  in  40  CFR  Part  50  (TNI 089).  Salem  County,  in  which  the  PSEG 
Site  is  located,  is  in  attainment  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  ozone,  which  is  in  nonattainment 
with  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQSs.  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  located  across  the  Delaware 
River  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  which  the  northernmost  portions  of  Artificial  Island  are  located, 
is  in  attainment  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  8-hour  ozone.  Effective  September  4.  2014, 

New  Castle  County  was  redesignated  from  a  nonattainment  area  to  a  maintenance  area  for  PM 
with  aerodynamic  diameters  less  than  or  equal  to  2.5  jam  (i.e.,  PM2.5).  See  Section  2.9.2  for 
additional  details. 

Section  169A  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141)  establishes  a  national  goal  of 
preventing  future  impairment  of  visibility  and  remedying  existing  impairment  in  mandatory 
Class  I  Federal  areas  when  impairment  is  from  air  pollution  caused  by  human  activities.  In 
addition,  EPA  regulations  provide  that  for  each  mandatory  Class  I  Federal  area  located  within  a 
state,  the  state  must  establish  goals  that  provide  for  reasonable  progress  toward  achieving 
natural  visibility  conditions.  The  reasonable  progress  goals  must  provide  for  an  improvement  in 
visibility  on  the  most  impaired  days  over  the  period  of  the  implementation  plan  and  make  sure 
there  is  no  degradation  in  visibility  for  the  least-impaired  days  over  the  same  period  [40  CFR 
51.308(d)(1)  (TNI 090)].  If  a  new  coal-fired  power-generation  station  were  to  be  located  close  to

a  mandatory  Class  I  area,  additional  requirements  for  air-pollution  control  could  be  imposed. 

The  Federal  Class  I  area  nearest  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  Brigantine  Wilderness  Area  at  the 
Edwin  B.  Forsythe  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  about  60  mi  to  the  east. 

New  Jersey  is  one  of  28  states  in  the  eastern  half  of  the  United  States  whose  stationary  sources 
of  criteria  pollutants  are  subject  to  revised  emission  limits  for  SO2  and  NOx  under  the  Cross- 
State  Air  Pollution  Rule  (CSAPR).  New  Jersey  stationary  sources  of  SC>2and  NOx  would  be 
subject  to  this  rule,  as  well  as  complementary  regulatory  controls  developed  at  the  State  level. 
On  July  6,  201 1 ,  EPA  announced  the  finalization  of  CSAPR  (EPA  201 5-TN4307),  previously 
referred  to  as  the  Transport  Rule,  as  a  response  to  previous  court  decisions  and  as  a 
replacement  to  the  EPA’s  2005  Clean  Air  Interstate  Rule  (CAIR).  A  number  of  court  actions 
have  impacted  implementation  of  CSAPR,  including  an  August  2012  D.C.  Circuit  decision 
vacating  CSAPR.  On  April  29,  2014,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  issued  an  opinion  reversing  the 
D.C.  Circuit  decision.  CSAPR  took  effect  starting  January  1 ,  2015,  for  SO2  and  annual  NOx  and 
May  1,  2015,  for  ozone  season  NOx  (EPA  2015-TN4307).  Fossil-fuel  power  plants  in  New 
Jersey  would  be  subject  to  CSAPR  and  would  be  required  to  reduce  emissions  of  S02and  NOx 
to  help  reduce  downwind  ambient  concentrations  of  fine  particulates  (PM2.5)  and  ozone. 

However,  the  review  team  recognizes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  air  emissions  from  the 
coal-fired  plant  would  be  significantly  greater  than  those  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  even  after  application  of  CSAPR,  because  the  operational  emissions  from  the  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  be  much  less  than  from  a  coal-fired  plant  even  with  the  required 
reductions  under  CSAPR. 

The  coal-fired  electric  utility  steam-generating  units  would  be  subject  to  EPA  National  Emission 
Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  (40  CFR  Part  63,  Subpart  B  [TN 1 403]).  EPA  determined 
that  coal-fired  and  oil-fired  electric  utility  steam-generating  units  are  significant  emitters  of  the 
following  hazardous  air  pollutants  (HAPs):  arsenic,  beryllium,  cadmium,  chromium,  dioxins, 
hydrogen  chloride,  hydrogen  fluoride,  lead,  manganese,  and  mercury  (65  FR  79825-TN2536). 
EPA  concluded  that  mercury  is  the  HAP  of  greatest  concern  and  that  (1 )  a  link  exists  between 
coal  combustion  and  mercury  emissions,  (2)  electric  utility  steam-generating  units  are  the  largest 
domestic  source  of  mercury  emissions,  and  (3)  certain  segments  of  the  U.S.  population  (e.g.,  the 
developing  fetus  and  subsistence  fish-eating  populations)  are  believed  to  be  at  potential  risk  of 
adverse  health  effects  resulting  from  mercury  exposures  caused  by  the  consumption  of 
contaminated  fish  (65  FR  79825-TN2536).  On  March  28,  2013,  EPA  finalized  updates  to 
emission  standards,  including  mercury,  for  power  plants  under  the  Mercury  and  Air  Toxics 
Standards  (EPA  2013-TN2537).  This  rule  became  effective  on  April  24,  2013.  However,  the 
review  team  recognizes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  air  emissions  from  the  coal-fired  plant 
would  be  significantly  greater  than  those  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  even 
after  application  of  any  new  mercury  emissions  standards. 

NUREG-1437  (NRC  2013-TN2654)  indicates  that  air-quality  impacts  from  a  coal-fired  power 
plant  can  be  significant.  NUREG-1437  also  provides  estimates  of  CO2  and  other  emissions 
(NRC  2013-TN2654).  Adverse  human  health  effects,  such  as  cancer  and  emphysema,  have 
been  associated  with  the  by-products  of  coal  combustion. 

Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  air-quality  impacts  from  construction  and  operation  of 
the  new  coal-fired  power  generation  at  the  PSEG  Site,  despite  the  availability  of  LAER/BACT, 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


would  be  MODERATE.  The  impacts  would  be  clearly  noticeable,  but  would  not  destabilize  air 
quality. 

Waste  Management 

Coal  combustion  generates  waste  in  the  form  of  ash,  and  equipment  for  controlling  air  pollution 
generates  additional  ash,  spent  selective  catalytic  reduction  (SCR)  catalyst,  and  scrubber 
sludge.  The  review  team  estimates  that  the  coal-fired  units  would  generate  a  total  of  about 
625,000  tpy  of  ash,  which  would  include  500,000  tpy  of  fly  ash  and  1 25,000  tpy  of  bottom  ash 
(NETL  2010-TN1423).  Bottom  ash  refers  to  the  portion  of  the  unburned  matter  in  coal  that  falls 
to  the  bottom  of  the  grate  or  furnace.  Fly  ash  represents  the  small  particles  that  rise  from  the 
furnace  during  the  combustion  process.  The  fly  ash  is  typically  removed  from  the  stack  gases 
using  fabric  filters  and/or  wet  scrubbers.  Significant  quantities  of  the  fly  ash  may  be  recycled  for 
use  in  commodity  products  such  as  concrete,  thus  reducing  the  total  landfill  volume. 

Effective  6  months  after  publication  of  the  final  rule  signed  by  the  EPA  administrator  on 
December  19,  2014,  coal  combustion  residuals  (CCRs)  from  electric  utilities  will  be  regulated  as 
solid  waste  under  Subtitle  D  of  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  of  1976,  as 
amended  (42  USC  6901  et  seq.  -TN1281).  The  minimum  criteria  for  new  CCR  units  include 
location  restrictions;  design  and  operating  criteria;  groundwater  monitoring  and  corrective 
action;  closure  requirements  and  post-closure  care;  and  requirements  for  recordkeeping, 
notification,  and  Internet  posting.  Different  criteria  apply  to  landfills  and  surface  impoundments. 

Waste  impacts  on  groundwater  and  surface  water  could  extend  beyond  the  operating  life  of  the 
plant  if  leachate  runoff  from  the  waste-storage  area  occurs.  Disposal  of  the  waste  could 
noticeably  affect  land  use  (because  of  the  acreage  needed  for  waste)  and  groundwater  quality, 
but  with  appropriate  management  and  monitoring,  it  would  not  destabilize  any  resources.  After 
closure  of  the  waste  site  and  revegetation,  the  land  could  be  available  for  some  other  uses.  The 
disposal  location  could  be  either  on  or  off  the  site.  If  the  disposal  location  is  off  the  site,  the 
review  team  assumes  that  the  waste  would  be  transported  by  barge  in  a  manner  similar  to  the 
delivery  of  coal  for  fuel  and  limestone  for  the  pollution  abatement  system.  Construction-related 
debris  would  be  generated  during  plant  construction  activities  and  would  be  disposed  of  in 
approved  landfills. 

For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  from  waste 
generated  at  a  coal-fired  plant  would  be  MODERATE.  The  impacts  would  be  clearly  noticeable 
but  would  not  destabilize  any  important  resource. 

Human  Health 

Adverse  human  health  effects  such  as  cancer  and  emphysema  have  been  associated  with  the 
by-products  of  coal  combustion.  Coal-fired  power  generation  also  introduces  worker  risks  from 
coal  and  limestone  mining,  worker  and  public  risk  from  coal  and  lime/limestone  transportation, 
worker  and  public  risk  from  disposal  of  coal  combustion  waste,  and  worker  and  public  risk  from 
inhalation  of  stack  emissions.  In  addition,  the  discharges  of  uranium  and  thorium  from  coal-fired 
power  plants  can  potentially  produce  radiological  doses  in  excess  of  those  arising  from  nuclear 
power  plant  operations  (Gabbard  1993-TN1 144). 


November  2015 


9-25 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Regulatory  agencies,  including  EPA  and  State  agencies,  base  air  emission  standards  and 
requirements  on  human  health  impacts.  These  agencies  also  impose  site-specific  emission 
limits  as  needed  to  protect  human  health.  Given  the  regulatory  oversight  exercised  by  EPA  and 
State  agencies,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  human  health  impacts  from  radiological 
doses,  inhaled  toxins,  and  criteria  pollutants  (including  particulates  and  nitrogen  oxides) 
generated  from  coal-fired  generation  would  be  SMALL;  furthermore,  similar  to  the  findings  of  the 
traffic  accident  analysis  in  Chapter  4  for  a  new  nuclear  plant,  transportation  of  personnel  and 
construction  materials  for  a  new  coal-fired  plant  would  result  in  minor  impacts  limited  mainly  to 
those  from  traffic  associated  with  the  construction  workforce  traveling  to  and  from  the  PSEG 
Site. 

Other  Impacts 

Based  on  the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  at  least  1,700  ac  of  land 
would  need  to  be  converted  to  industrial  use  for  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  coal-fired  plant  on  the  PSEG 
Site  for  the  power  block,  infrastructure  and  support  facilities,  coal  and  limestone  storage  and 
handling,  and  landfill  disposal  of  ash  and  spent  scrubber  sorbent  (as  much  as  3,900  ac  for  four 
580-MW(e)  coal  units).  Land-use  changes  would  occur  in  an  undetermined  offsite  coal-mining 
area  to  supply  coal  for  the  plant.  In  the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437  (NRC  1996-TN288),  the 
staff  estimated  that  about  22,000  ac  would  be  needed  for  coal  mining  and  waste  disposal  to 
support  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  coal-fired  plant  over  its  operating  life  (51 ,000  ac  for  four  580-MW(e)  coal 
units).  Based  on  the  considerable  amount  of  land  affected  for  the  site,  mining,  and  waste 
disposal,  as  well  as  the  new  causeway,  the  review  team  concludes  that  land-use  impacts  would 
be  MODERATE.  The  impacts  would  alter  noticeably,  but  would  not  destabilize,  any  important 
attributes  of  land  uses  on  the  site  or  in  offsite  areas. 

The  amount  of  water  used  and  the  impacts  on  water  quality  from  constructing  and  operating  a 
coal-fired  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  comparable  to  those  associated  with  building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  Water  consumption  due  to  evaporative  cooling  would  also  be  comparable 
to  that  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  source  of  the  cooling  water  would  be  the  Delaware 
River.  All  liquid  discharges  would  be  regulated  by  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection,  Division  of  Water  Quality,  through  a  National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System 
(NPDES)  permit.  Indirectly,  water  quality  could  be  affected  by  acids  and  mercury  from  air 
emissions.  However,  these  emissions  are  regulated  to  minimize  impacts.  Some  erosion  and 
sedimentation  would  likely  occur  during  construction  of  new  facilities.  These  impacts  would  be 
similar  to  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant,  which  would  be  minor,  as  discussed  in  Sections  4.2  and 
5.2.  Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  surface-water  and  groundwater  impacts  would 
be  SMALL. 

The  coal-fired  power-generation  alternative  would  introduce  ecological  impacts  from 
construction  and  new  incremental  impacts  from  operations.  The  impacts  would  be  similar  to 
those  of  constructing  and  operating  new  nuclear  units  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  impacts  could 
include  terrestrial  and  aquatic  functional  loss,  habitat  fragmentation  and/or  loss,  reduced 
productivity,  and  a  local  reduction  in  biological  diversity.  The  impacts  could  occur  at  the  PSEG 
Site  and  at  the  sites  used  for  coal  and  limestone  mining.  Stack  emissions  and  disposal  of  waste 
products  could  affect  aquatic  and  terrestrial  resources.  Additional  impacts  on  threatened  and 
endangered  terrestrial  species  could  result  from  ash  disposal  and  mining  activities  if  the 


NUREG-2168

locations  of  such  activities  overlap  with  habitat  for  such  protected  species.  Overall,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  the  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecological  impacts  would  be  SMALL  to 
MODERATE,  primarily  because  of  the  potential  disturbance  to  habitat  associated  with  the  new 
causeway  and  because  of  the  potential  impacts  associated  with  disposal  of  ash  and  the  large 
area  of  land  affected  by  mining  activities.  Impacts  to  aquatic  ecosystems  would  be  similar  to 
those  for  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  which  are  SMALL 
provided  there  is  compliance  with  BMPs  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting. 

The  review  team  estimates  that  the  four  580-MW(e)  coal-fired  units  would  require  a  peak 
workforce  of  about  2,000  construction  workers,  and  about  250  workers  would  be  needed  to 
operate  the  facility  (NRC  2012-TN1976).  Socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  associated  with 
these  workforces  in  proportion  to  those  expected  for  the  proposed  PSEG  Site's  socioeconomic 
impacts.  The  construction  workers  would  be  predominantly  temporary,  and  the  review  team 
expects  that  most  of  the  socioeconomic  impacts  (physical,  demography,  economy/taxes,  and 
infrastructure/community  services)  would  be  similar  to  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant,  as 
discussed  in  Sections  4.4  and  5.4.  Impacts  in  the  following  categories  could  be  different  for  a 
coal-fired  plant  than  for  a  new  nuclear  plant:  noise  from  plant  operations  and  potential  impacts 
to  air  quality,  transportation,  and  traffic  associated  with  transporting  coal,  limestone,  and  wastes. 

Coal-fired  power  generation  would  introduce  mechanical  sources  of  noise  that  would  likely  be 
audible  at  offsite  locations.  Sources  contributing  to  the  noise  produced  by  plant  operation  are 
classified  as  continuous  or  intermittent.  Continuous  sources  include  the  mechanical  equipment 
associated  with  normal  plant  operations.  Intermittent  sources  include  the  equipment  related  to 
coal  handling,  solid-waste  disposal,  transportation  related  to  deliveries  (coal  and  lime/limestone) 
and  removal  (primarily  top  and  bottom  ash  wastes),  use  of  outdoor  alarms  and  loudspeakers, 
and  commuting  of  plant  employees.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  of  noise  on 
residents  in  the  vicinity  of  the  facility  would  be  SMALL  given  the  large  distances  to  such 
residents  from  the  proposed  PSEG  Site. 

Beyond  the  impacts  related  to  coal  combustion,  which  are  discussed  above,  the  transportation 
and  handling  of  coal  can  lead  to  particulate  emissions  along  the  transport  route  and  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  plant.  Transportation-related  impacts  of  coal  transportation  would  be  most 
noticeable  if  the  coal  were  to  be  transported  by  rail.  The  use  of  barges  to  transport  coal  and 
limestone  would  minimize  any  associated  air-quality  impacts  because — unlike  rail — the  barges 
operate  at  some  distance  from  residential  areas.  In  addition,  the  relatively  remote  location  of 
the  site  would  minimize  the  impacts  associated  with  coal  handling  at  the  site.  The  review  team 
therefore  concludes  that  the  physical  impacts  on  air  quality  would  be  SMALL. 

Similarly,  traffic  impacts  from  transporting  coal  and  ash  would  also  be  minimized  by  the  use  of 
barges.  As  a  result,  the  remaining  traffic  impacts — deliveries  and  commuting — would  be  similar 
to  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant,  as  analyzed  in  Sections  4.4  and  5.4. 

Overall,  the  socioeconomic  impacts  from  a  coal  plant  at  the  PSEG  site  would  range  from 
LARGE  (beneficial)  to  MODERATE  (adverse). 

Beneficial  Impacts.  Construction  and  operation  of  a  series  of  coal-fired  generating  units  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  produce  beneficial  economic  impacts  ranging  from  SMALL  (for  all  economic

categories  within  the  50-mi  region  other  than  the  host  county)  to  MODERATE  (for  tax  revenues 
collected  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey)  and  LARGE  (for  economic  impacts,  primarily  tax 
revenues,  in  Salem  County  during  construction  and  operation). 

Adverse  Impacts.  For  the  entire  50-mi  region,  construction  and  operations  would  produce 
SMALL  adverse  impacts  for  all  physical  impact  categories,  demographic  categories,  and 
community  and  infrastructure  categories  except  for  traffic  impacts  (MODERATE)  during  peak 
employment  during  construction  and  for  heavy  vehicle  transportation  of  coal  and  limestone 
delivery;  waste  removal  and  ash  management  activities;  and  aesthetic  impacts  (MODERATE) 
related  to  recreational  enjoyment  of  the  viewshed,  primarily  during  operation. 

As  discussed  in  Section  2.6.2,  there  are  no  environmental  pathways  by  which  the  identified 
minority  or  low-income  populations  within  the  50-mi  radius  surrounding  the  proposed  PSEG  Site 
(region)  would  be  likely  to  suffer  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  environmental  impacts. 

The  impacts  to  nearby  populations  of  building  and  operating  the  coal-fired  units  would  be  similar 
to  those  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  there  are  no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on 
minority  or  low-income  populations. 

The  impacts  on  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  of  a  new  coal-fired  plant  located  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.6  and  5.6.  Because  Artificial  Island  is  man-made  and  therefore  not  anticipated  to 
contain  intact  historic  and  cultural  resources,  no  direct  impacts  would  be  anticipated  within 
onsite  areas.  Other  lands,  if  located  off  Artificial  Island,  that  would  be  acquired  to  support  the 
plant  would  require  cultural  resource  studies,  and  possible  mitigation  of  the  adverse  effects  from 
ground-disturbing  actions.  The  studies  would  likely  be  needed  for  all  areas  of  potential 
disturbance  offsite,  such  as  mining  and  waste-disposal  sites,  and  along  associated  corridors 
where  new  construction  would  occur  (e.g.,  access  roads).  Visual  effects  from  the  cooling  system 
(i.e.,  cooling  towers)  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be  anticipated  from  a  new  coal  plant 
on  Artificial  Island.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources 
could  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE,  similar  to  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  action. 

The  construction  and  operational  impacts  of  four  580-MW(e)  coal-fired  power-generation  units 
at  the  PSEG  Site  are  summarized  in  Table  9-1 .

9. 2. 3. 2  Natural-Gas-Fired  Power  Generation 

For  the  natural-gas  power-generation  alternative,  the  review  team  assumed  construction  and 
operation  of  a  natural-gas-fired  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  assumed  that  the 
plant  would  use  combined-cycle  combustion  turbines.  Four  such  units  were  assumed,  each 
with  a  net  capacity  of  580  MW(e).  A  capacity  factor  of  85  percent  was  assumed.  The 
natural-gas-fired  units  were  assumed  to  have  an  operating  life  of  40  years.  The  above 
assumptions  are  consistent  with  the  ER  submitted  as  part  of  the  PSEG  ESP  application 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280),  except  that  the  review  team  assumed  a  somewhat  lower  capacity  factor 
for  natural  gas,  and  slightly  larger  units  in  order  to  generate  the  same  amount  of  electricity 
annually  as  the  proposed  project.  The  review  team  estimates  of  natural-gas  consumption, 
combined-cycle  technology,  air  emissions,  water  consumption,  and  waste  product  generation  are 
based  on  the  DOE  report  Cost  and  Performance  Baseline  for  Fossil  Energy  Plants,  Volume  1: 
Bituminous  Coal  and  Natural  Gas  to  Electricity  (NETL  201 0-TN 1423).  The  review  team  estimated 
that  the  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  use  about  1 14  billion  standard  ft3  of  gas  per  year. 

Air  Quality 

Natural  gas  is  a  relatively  clean-burning  fuel.  When  compared  with  a  coal-fired  plant,  a 
natural-gas-fired  plant  would  release  similar  types  of  emissions  but  in  lower  emitted  quantities. 
The  review  team  assumes  that  fugitive  dust  emissions  from  construction  activities  would  be 
mitigated  using  BMPs,  similar  to  mitigation  discussed  in  Chapter  4  for  building  new  nuclear 
reactor  units  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Such  emissions  would  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude 
and  are  anticipated  to  be  SMALL. 

The  review  team  assumed  a  plant  design  that  would  minimize  air  emissions  through  a 
combination  of  combustion  technology  and  post-combustion  pollutant  removal.  Nevertheless, 
these  emissions  estimates  are  not  necessarily  representative  of  what  would  be  allowed  under 
applicable  regulatory  air  permits.  Salem  County  is  in  nonattainment  of  the  8-hour  ozone 
NAAOSs.  One  or  more  of  the  emission  estimates  below  exceeds  the  threshold  value  of 
100  tpy;  therefore,  a  new  natural-gas-fired  plant  having  these  emissions  would  qualify  as  a 
major  source  that  must  obtain  a  Title  V  operating  permit.  A  final  air  permit  for  building  the 
natural-gas-fired  power  plant  would  likely  require  the  LAER  for  ozone  precursor  (NOx),  along 
with  offsets(1)  (NJAC  7:27-TN3290),  and  the  BACT  for  PM  and  S02.(2)  A  natural-gas-fired  plant 
equipped  with  appropriate  combustion  and  post-combustion  pollution-control  technology  would 
have  approximately  the  following  emissions:(3) 


(1)  The  minimum  offset  ratio  varies,  depending  on  the  distance  between  the  facility  and  the  location  of 
the  emission  reductions  being  proposed  as  emission  offsets:  1 .3  to  1  for  0-100  mi;  2.6  to  1  for 
100-250  mi;  and  5.2  to  1  for  250-500  mi. 

(2)  Sulfur  dioxide  emissions  exceed  the  significant  emission  rate  of  40  tpy  under  the  Prevention  of 
Significant  Deterioration  regulations  (40  CFR  51.166  [TNI 090])  and  thus  require  control  by  the  best 
available  control  technology. 

(3)  Emissions  are  based  on  1 14  billion  standard  cubic  feet  per  year  of  natural  gas  burned  in  advanced 
Class  F  combustion  turbine  generators  using  dry  low-NOx  burners  and  catalytic  control  for  NOx  at  a 
90  percent  reduction  rate  (NETL  2010-TN1423).  The  SO2  emissions  are  based  on  the  amounts  of 
sulfur  compounds  that  are  permitted  in  pipeline  natural  gas.  The  PM  value  was  provided  by  PSEG 
based  on  data  obtained  from  its  Linden,  New  Jersey,  natural-gas-fired  combined-cycle  plant,  scaled 
to  a  net  output  of  2,200  MW(e)  (PSEG  201 2-TN21 1 3).

•  SO2  =  97  tpy; 

•  NOx  =  530  tpy;  and 

•  PM  =  660  tpy. 

The  review  team  estimates  that  the  natural-gas-fired  power  plant  would  also  have  CO2 
emissions  of  7.0  million  tpy  that  could  affect  climate  change.  On  August  3,  2015,  EPA  set  the 
final  standard  to  limit  CO2  emissions  from  new  stationary  combustion  turbines  (such  as  natural 
gas  combined  cycle  technology)  (EPA  2015-TN4336).  However,  the  staffs  emissions  estimate 
of  7.0  million  tpy  was  already  below  the  new  standard  and  would,  therefore,  be  unchanged 
under  the  new  rule. 

A  new  natural-gas-fired  power-generation  plant  would  likely  need  a  Nonattainment  NSR  permit 
for  NOx  and  a  PSD  permit  for  PM  as  building  permits  and  a  Title  V  operating  permit  under  the 
Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141).  A  new  natural-gas-fired  combined-cycle  plant 
would  also  be  subject  to  the  new  source  performance  standards  specified  in  40  CFR  Part  60, 
Subpart  KKKK  (TN1020).  These  regulations  establish  emission  limits  for  SO2  and  NOx. 

EPA  has  various  regulatory  requirements  for  visibility  protection  in  40  CFR  Part  51 ,  Subpart  P 
(TNI 090),  including  a  specific  requirement  for  review  of  any  new  major  stationary  source  in  an 
area  designated  as  in  attainment  or  unclassified  for  criteria  pollutants  under  the  Clean  Air  Act 
(42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141)  (40  CFR  51.307(a)  [TNI 090]).  Salem  County,  in  which  the 
PSEG  Site  is  located,  is  in  attainment  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  ozone,  which  is  in 
nonattainment  with  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAOSs.  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  located  across 
the  Delaware  River  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  in  which  the  northernmost  portions  of  Artificial 
Island  are  located,  is  in  attainment  for  all  criteria  pollutants  except  8-hour  ozone.  Effective 
September  4.  2014,  New  Castle  County  was  redesignated  from  a  nonattainment  area  to  a 
maintenance  area  for  PM2.5.  (See  Section  2.9.2  for  additional  details.) 

Section  169A  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 )  establishes  a  national  goal  of 
preventing  future  impairment  of  visibility  and  remedying  existing  impairment  in  mandatory 
Class  I  Federal  areas  when  impairment  is  from  air  pollution  caused  by  human  activities.  In 
addition,  EPA  regulations  provide  that  for  each  mandatory  Class  I  Federal  area  located  within  a 
State,  the  State  regulatory  agencies  must  establish  goals  that  provide  for  reasonable  progress 
toward  achieving  natural  visibility  conditions.  The  reasonable  progress  goals  must  provide  for 
an  improvement  in  visibility  for  the  most  impaired  days  over  the  period  of  the  implementation 
plan  and  make  sure  there  is  no  degradation  in  visibility  for  the  least-impaired  days  over  the 
same  period  (40  CFR  51.308(d)(1)  [TNI 090]).  If  a  new  natural-gas-fired  power-generation  plant 
were  to  be  located  close  to  a  mandatory  Class  I  area,  additional  requirements  for  air-pollution 
control  could  be  imposed.  The  Federal  Class  I  area  nearest  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  the  Brigantine 
Wilderness  Area  at  the  Edwin  B.  Forsythe  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  about  60  mi  to  the  east. 

New  Jersey  is  one  of  28  states  in  the  eastern  half  of  the  United  States  whose  stationary  sources 
of  criteria  pollutants  are  subject  to  revised  emission  limits  for  SO2  and  NOx  under  CSAPR.  New 
Jersey  stationary  sources  of  SO2  and  NOx  would  be  subject  to  this  rule,  as  well  as 
complementary  regulatory  controls  developed  at  the  State  level.  On  July  6,  201 1 ,  EPA 
announced  the  finalization  of  CSAPR  (EPA  2015-TN4307),  previously  referred  to  as  the 
Transport  Rule,  as  a  response  to  previous  court  decisions  and  as  a  replacement  to  the  EPA's

2005  CAIR.  A  number  of  court  actions  have  impacted  implementation  of  CSAPR,  including  an 
August  2012  D.C.  Circuit  decision  vacating  CSAPR.  On  April  29,  2014,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court 
issued  an  opinion  reversing  the  D.C.  Circuit  decision.  CSAPR  took  effect  starting  January  1, 
2015,  for  SO2  and  annual  NOx  and  May  1 ,  2015,  for  ozone  season  NOx  (EPA  201 5-TN4307). 
Fossil-fuel  power  plants  in  New  Jersey  would  be  subject  to  CSAPR  and  would  be  required  to 
reduce  emissions  of  S02and  NOx  to  help  reduce  downwind  ambient  concentrations  of  fine 
particulates  (PM2.5)  and  ozone.  However,  the  review  team  recognizes  that  the  environmental 
impacts  of  air  emissions  from  the  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  be  significantly  greater  than 
those  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  even  after  application  of  CSAPR, 
because  the  operational  emissions  from  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  much  less  than 
from  a  natural-gas-fired  plant,  even  with  the  required  reductions  under  CSAPR. 

The  combustion  turbine  portion  of  the  combined-cycle  units  would  be  subject  to  EPA  National 
Emission  Standards  for  Hazardous  Air  Pollutants  for  Stationary  Combustion  Turbines  (40  CFR 
Part  63,  Subpart  YYYY  [TNI 403]),  if  the  site  is  a  major  source  of  hazardous  air  pollutants. 

Major  sources  have  the  potential  to  emit  10  tpy  or  more  of  any  single  hazardous  air  pollutant  or 
25  tpy  or  more  of  any  combination  of  hazardous  air  pollutants  (40  CFR  63.6585(b)  [TN 1 403]). 

Historically,  CO2,  an  unavoidable  by-product  of  combustion  of  carbonaceous  fuels,  has  not  been 
regulated  as  a  pollutant.  However,  regulations  are  now  under  development  for  CO2  and  other 
GHGs.  In  response  to  the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  of  2008  (Public  Law  110-161,  121 
Stat.  1844-TN1485),  EPA  promulgated  final  mandatory  GHG  reporting  regulations  in  October 
2009,  effective  in  December  2009  (74  FR  56260-TN1024).  The  rules  are  primarily  applicable  to 
large-facility  sources  of  C02e  (those  emitting  25,000  metric  tons  or  more  per  year).  New  utility- 
scale  gas-fired  power  plants  would  be  subject  to  those  regulations. 

A  new  gas-fired  generation  plant  would  qualify  as  a  major  generator  of  GHGs  under  the 
“Tailoring  Rule”  recently  promulgated  by  EPA  (75  FR  31514-TN1404).  Beginning  January  2, 

201 1 ,  permits  issued  to  major  sources  of  GHGs  under  the  PSD  or  Title  V  Federal  permit 
programs  must  contain  provisions  requiring  the  use  of  BACT  to  limit  the  emissions  of  GHGs  if 
those  sources  would  be  subject  to  PSD  or  Title  V  permitting  requirements  because  of  their  non- 
GHG  pollutant  emission  potentials  and  if  their  estimated  GHG  emissions  are  at  least 
75,000  tons  C02e  per  year.  Meeting  permit  limitations  for  GHG  emissions  may  require 
installation  of  CCS  devices  on  any  new  natural-gas-fired  power  plant,  which  could  reduce  power 
output.  However,  the  review  team  recognizes  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  air  emissions 
from  the  natural-gas-fired  power  plant  would  be  significantly  greater  than  those  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  even  after  application  of  any  new  GHG  emissions  standards. 

The  impacts  of  emissions  from  a  natural-gas-fired  power-generation  plant  would  be  clearly 
noticeable  but  would  not  be  sufficient  to  destabilize  air  resources.  Overall,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  air-quality  impacts  resulting  from  construction  and  operation  of  new 
natural-gas-fired  power  generation  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE;  SMALL 
for  criteria  pollutants  and  MODERATE  for  GHGs.

Waste  Management 

In  the  1996  version  of  NUREG-1437,  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  waste  generation  from 
natural-gas-fired  technology  would  be  minimal  (NRC  1996-TN288).  The  only  significant  waste 
generated  at  a  natural-gas-fired  power  plant  would  be  spent  SCR  catalyst,  which  is  used  to 
control  NOx  emissions.  The  spent  catalyst  would  be  regenerated  or  disposed  of  offsite.  Other 
than  spent  SCR  catalyst,  waste  generation  at  an  operating  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  be 
largely  limited  to  typical  operations  and  maintenance  waste.  Construction-related  debris  would 
be  generated  during  construction  activities.  Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  waste 
impacts  from  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  would  be  SMALL. 

Human  Health 

Natural-gas-fired  power  generation  introduces  public  risk  from  inhalation  of  gaseous  emissions. 
The  risk  may  be  attributable  to  NOx  emissions  that  contribute  to  ozone  formation,  which  in  turn 
contributes  to  health  risk.  Regulatory  agencies,  including  EPA  and  State  agencies,  base  air 
emission  standards  and  requirements  on  human  health  impacts.  These  agencies  also  impose 
site-specific  emission  limits  as  needed  to  protect  human  health.  Given  the  regulatory  oversight 
exercised  by  EPA  and  State  agencies,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  human  health 
impacts  from  natural-gas-fired  power  generation,  including  traffic  accident  impacts  from  the 
transportation  of  personnel  and  construction  materials,  would  be  SMALL. 

Other  Impacts 

The  natural-gas-fired  power-generating  plant  would  require  at  least  1 10  ac  for  the  power  block 
and  support  facilities  for  a  1 ,000-MW(e)  plant  (NRC  1 996-TN288)  (as  much  as  250  ac  for  four 
580-MW(e)  gas  units).  Construction  of  a  natural-gas  supply  pipeline  to  the  PSEG  Site  would 
require  about  60  ac,  assuming  10  mi  of  pipeline  length  with  a  50-ft  right-of-way  (ROW).  Thus, 
the  total  land-use  commitment,  not  including  natural-gas  wells  and  collection  stations,  would  be 
at  least  310  ac.  A  small  amount  of  additional  land  would  also  be  required  for  natural-gas  wells 
and  collection  stations.  Due  to  the  proximity  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  existing  natural-gas 
infrastructure,  these  impacts  would  be  minimized.  Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
land-use  impacts  from  new  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  would  be  MODERATE  due 
mainly  to  the  impacts  from  the  new  causeway. 

The  amount  of  water  used  and  the  impacts  on  water  quality  from  constructing  and  operating  a 
natural-gas-fired  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  comparable  to  those  associated  with 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  impacts  on  water  quality  from  sedimentation 
during  construction  of  a  natural-gas-fired  plant  were  characterized  in  the  1996  version  of 
NUREG-1437  as  SMALL  (NRC  1996-TN288).  The  NRC  staff  also  noted  in  the  1996  version  of 
NUREG-1437  that  the  impacts  on  water  quality  from  the  operation  of  a  natural-gas-fired 
combined-cycle  plant  would  be  similar  to,  or  less  than,  the  impacts  from  other  power-generating 
technologies  (NRC  1996-TN288).  The  source  of  the  cooling  water  would  be  the  Delaware 
River.  Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  to  surface  water  and  groundwater  would 
be  SMALL. 

A  natural-gas-fired  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  fewer  ecological  impacts  than  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  because  less  land  would  be  affected.  Constructing  a  new  underground  gas

pipeline  to  the  site  would  result  in  permanent  loss  of  some  terrestrial  and  aquatic  function  and 
conversion  and  fragmentation  of  habitat;  however,  because  the  distance  to  connect  to  natural- 
gas  distribution  systems  would  be  minimal,  no  important  ecological  attributes  would  be 
noticeably  altered.  Impacts  on  threatened  and  endangered  species  would  be  similar  to  the 
impacts  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  or  a  new  coal-fired  facility  located  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  terrestrial  and  wetland  impacts  would  be  SMALL  to 
MODERATE  when  considering  the  potential  impacts  associated  with  the  new  causeway. 

Impacts  to  aquatic  ecosystems  would  be  similar  to  those  for  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  which  are  SMALL,  provided  there  is  compliance  with  BMPs 
required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting. 

Socioeconomic  impacts  would  result  from  the  roughly  1,200  construction  workers  and 
150  workers  needed  to  operate  the  natural-gas-fired  facility  (NRC  201 2-TN 1976).  These 
workforce  numbers  are  smaller  than  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant.  The  construction  workers 
would  be  predominantly  temporary,  and  the  review  team  expects  that  most  of  the 
socioeconomic  impacts  (physical,  demography,  economy/taxes,  and  infrastructure/community 
services)  would  be  similar  to  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  as  discussed  in  Sections  4.4  and  5.4. 
Impacts  in  the  following  categories  could  be  different  for  a  natural-gas-fired  plant  than  for  a  new 
nuclear  plant:  physical  impacts  to  the  local  roadway  network,  traffic,  and  recreation.  All  three  of 
these  issues  are  associated  with  construction  traffic. 

The  construction  workforce  for  the  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  be  less  than  one-third  the  size 
of  the  workforce  for  a  new  nuclear  plant.  In  addition,  a  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  require 
fewer  shipments  of  construction  materials,  and  the  components  for  a  natural-gas  plant  would 
weigh  less  than  those  for  a  new  nuclear  plant.  Physical  impacts  to  the  local  roadway  network 
may  be  reduced  to  SMALL.  Furthermore,  the  temporary  and  intermittent  nature  of  the 
1,200  construction  workers  on  the  roads  surrounding  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  lead  to 
noticeable  impacts  to  traffic  and  recreation.  The  review  team  therefore  concludes  that  these 
impacts  would  be  SMALL.  For  beneficial  impacts,  the  review  team  determined  all  impact  areas 
would  be  SMALL  for  a  natural-gas-fired  plant,  with  the  exception  of  the  property  tax  revenues  to 
the  host  county  of  Salem,  New  Jersey,  which  would  be  MODERATE  during  operations. 

As  described  in  Section  2.6.2,  there  are  no  environmental  pathways  by  which  the  identified 
minority  or  low-income  populations  within  the  region  would  be  likely  to  suffer  disproportionately 
high  and  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  are 
no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income 
populations. 

The  impacts  on  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  for  a  natural-gas-fired  plant  located 
at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.6  and  5.6.  Because  Artificial  Island  is  human-made  and  therefore  not  anticipated  to 
contain  intact  historic  and  cultural  resources,  no  direct  impacts  would  be  anticipated  within 
onsite  areas.  Other  lands,  if  located  off  Artificial  Island,  that  would  be  acquired  to  support  the 
plant  would  require  cultural  resource  studies,  and  possible  mitigation  of  the  adverse  effects  from 
ground-disturbing  actions.  The  studies  would  likely  be  needed  for  all  areas  of  potential 
disturbance  offsite  such  as  gas  wells,  collection  stations,  and  waste-disposal  sites;  and  along 
associated  corridors  where  new  construction  would  occur  (e.g.,  roads  and  any  new  pipelines).

Visual  effects  from  the  cooling  system  (i.e.,  cooling  towers)  to  historic  and  cultural  resources 
would  be  anticipated  from  a  new  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  on  Artificial  Island.  The 
review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  could  range  from 
SMALL  to  MODERATE,  similar  to  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  action. 

The  impacts  of  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  summarized  in

Up  to  310  ac  would  be  needed  for  power  block,  cooling  towers, 
and  support  systems  and  connection  to  an  existing  natural-gas 
supply  pipeline.  Additional  land  would  be  needed  for 
infrastructure  and  other  facilities,  including  the  new  causeway. 

Impacts  would  be  comparable  to  the  impacts  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  located  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Impacts  might  also  be  associated  with  offsite  locations  where 
natural  gas  is  extracted/obtained. 

Impacts  would  be  comparable  to  the  impacts  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  located  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Constructing  a  new  underground  gas  pipeline  to  the  site  would 
result  in  permanent  loss  of  some  terrestrial  function  and 
conversion  and  fragmentation  of  habitat.  Impacts  on  threatened 
and  endangered  species  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  from  new 
nuclear  generating  units.  Most  impacts  from  pipeline  construction 
would  be  temporary.  Impacts  on  wetlands  could  occur  within  the 
project  footprint  and/or  along  the  new  causeway  and  transmission 
lines. 

Impacts  would  be  comparable  to  the  impacts  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  located  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Impacts  could  also  occur  along  the  new  causeway  and 
transmission  lines  and  at  the  sites  used  for  natural-gas  extraction. 
Constructing  a  new  underground  gas  pipeline  to  the  site  would 
result  in  loss  of  some  aquatic  function  and  disturbance  to  aquatic 
habitats;  however,  use  of  best  management  practices  required  for 
Federal  and  State  permitting  would  minimize  effects. 

Beneficial  Impacts:  Construction  and  operation  of  a  series  of 
natural-gas  generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  produce 
beneficial  economic  impacts  ranging  from  SMALL  (for  all 
economic  categories  within  the  50-mi  region  other  than  the  host 
county)  to  MODERATE  (for  property  tax  revenues  in  the  host 
county  during  operation). 

Adverse  Impacts:  For  the  entire  50-mi  region,  construction  and 
operations  would  produce  SMALL  adverse  impacts  for  all  impact 
categories. 

There  are  no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse 
impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations. 

Most  potential  impacts  could  likely  be  effectively  managed.  Most 
of  the  facility  and  infrastructure  would  be  built  in  previously 
disturbed  areas.  Visual  impacts  could  be  noticeable.

(a)  The  entry  “None”  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts  to  minority  or  low- 
income  populations  from  the  proposed  action.  Rather,  “None”  means  that,  while  there  may  be  adverse

9.2.4  Combination  of  Alternatives 

Individual  alternatives  to  the  construction  of  new  nuclear  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  might  not  be 
sufficient  on  their  own  to  generate  the  PSEG  target  value  of  2,200  MW(e)  because  of  limited 
availability  of  resources  or  lack  of  cost-effective  opportunities.  Nevertheless,  it  is  conceivable 
that  a  combination  of  alternatives  might  be  cost  effective.  Because  there  are  many  possible 
combinations  of  alternatives,  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  examine  every  possible  combination 
of  alternatives  in  an  EIS.  Doing  so  would  be  counter  to  CEQ  guidance  that  an  EIS  should  be 
analytic  rather  than  encyclopedic,  should  be  kept  concise,  and  should  be  no  longer  than 
absolutely  necessary  to  comply  with  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  and  CEQ  regulations 
(40  CFR  Part  1 502-TN2123).  Given  that  the  PSEG  objective  is  for  a  new  baseload  generation 
facility,  a  fossil-fuel  energy  source,  most  likely  natural  gas  or  coal,  would  need  to  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  any  reasonable  alternative  energy  combination. 

In  developing  a  combination  of  energy  alternatives  for  other  combined  license  applications,  the 
review  team  has  typically  relied  on  data  from  the  power  company’s  integrated  resource  plan 
and/or  data  from  the  most  recent  EIA  Annual  Energy  Outlook.  However,  because  of  the 
regulatory  structure  for  power  companies  in  New  Jersey,  PSEG  does  not  publish  an  integrated 
resource  plan.  The  review  team  also  found  that  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2013 
(DOE/EIA  2013-TN2591)  predictions  for  growth  in  renewable  sources  in  the  region  that  includes 
New  Jersey  are  less  than  the  growth  that  would  be  necessary  to  meet  the  RPS  for  New  Jersey 
(NJBPU  201 1-TN2526).  Compliance  with  the  RPS  will  require  greater  growth  in  renewable 
sources  (or  considerable  compliance  payments)  beyond  the  growth  predicted  by  the  Annual 
Energy  Outlook.  Because  of  this  situation,  the  review  team  has  relied  on  the  information  in  the 
latest  annual  report  for  the  New  Jersey  RPS,  the  New  Jersey  Energy  Master  Plan  (New 
Jersey  201 1-TN21 15),  and  other  public  information  to  develop  the  combination  of  energy 
alternatives. 

In  Chapter  8  the  review  team  concluded  that  there  is  a  sufficient  need  for  power  by  2023  to 

justify  building  and  operating  one  or  more  nuclear  units  with  a  total  capacity  of  up  to 

2,200  MW(e).  The  analysis  on  which  the  review  team’s  conclusion  is  based  considered  planned 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


new  generation  sources.  For  example,  construction  has  begun  on  two  natural-gas  combined- 
cycle  projects  in  New  Jersey  with  a  total  capacity  of  1 ,405  MW(e)  (Platts  2014-TN4153;  Power 
Technology  2015-TN4154).  In  concluding  that  the  need  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant 
existed,  the  review  team  assumed  the  construction  and  operation  of  these  planned  natural-gas 
units.  Therefore,  the  combination  of  alternative  energy  sources  would  involve  the  addition  of 
generating  sources  beyond  what  is  already  planned. 

The  review  team  considered  whether  2,200  MW(e)  could  be  provided  by  wind  and  solar,  each 
with  a  backup  power  source;  a  combination  of  sources  including  biomass,  municipal  solid 
waste,  and  geothermal;  and  natural  gas.  EIA  estimates  that  through  2040  the  combination  of 
wind,  solar,  and  biomass  will  provide  most  of  the  growth  in  renewable  electricity  generation  in 
the  United  States  (DOE/EIA  2013-TN2590).  Wind  or  solar  energy  sources  without  a  backup 
power  source  are  not  considered  here  for  baseload  purposes,  but  that  does  not  preclude  their 
development;  in  fact,  there  is  great  interest  in  developing  such  renewable  energy  resources. 

The  consumption  of  natural  gas  by  the  facility  in  the  combination  of  alternatives  case  can  be 
offset  by  the  production  of  energy  from  wind  and  solar  resources  when  available;  however,  a 
combination  of  alternatives  would  still  necessitate  the  installation  of  natural-gas  power  facilities 
to  ensure  that  power  is  available  as  a  baseload  power  source  when  wind  and  solar  sources 
cannot  meet  the  demand. 

The  review  team  considered  a  spectrum  of  energy  alternatives  that  were  reasonable  for  the 
PSEG  ROI  and.  for  the  purpose  of  analysis,  developed  a  combination  of  alternatives  case  that 
comprises  solar  and  wind  power,  biomass  (including  MSW  and  methane  from  landfills),  and 
natural-gas-fired  power  generation.  Additional  savings  from  energy-efficiency  and  conservation 
programs  were  not  included  in  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives  because  the  State  of  New 
Jersey  is  already  pursuing  a  very  aggressive  goal  for  these  programs,  which  the  review  team 
assumes  will  have  already  implemented  those  activities  that  would  be  cost  effective. 

The  review  team  assessed  the  environmental  impacts  of  a  combination  of  natural-gas-fired 
combined-cycle  power-generating  units  with  a  total  capacity  of  1,400  MW(e)  at  the  PSEG  Site 
using  closed-cycle  cooling  and  the  following  additional  contributions  from  within  or  near  the 
PSEG  ROI:  560  MW(e)  from  solar,  890  MW(e)  from  wind,  and  800  MW(e)  from  biomass 
sources. 1  These  contributions  were  derived  based  on  the  expected  percentage  contributions 
to  new  generation  from  these  resources  considering  sources  such  as  the  Annual  Energy 
Outlook  2013  (DOE/EIA  201 3-TN2590),  the  New  Jersey  Energy  Master  Plan  (New  Jersey  2011- 
TN21 15),  and  the  New  Jersey  RPS  (NJBPU  201 1-TN2526).  The  solar  and  wind  sources  would 
be  backed  up  by  the  natural-gas-powered  generation.  The  review  team  believes  that  the 
preceding  contributions  are  reasonable  and  representative  for  the  PSEG  ROI  given  the  publicly 
available  information  in  the  cited  Federal  and  State  sources.  The  contributions  of  the 
generating  sources  used  in  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives  reflect  the  review  team 
analyses  in  Sections  9.2.2  and  9.2.3. 


(1)  Because  there  is  limited  landfill  gas  (LFG)  available,  the  review  team  assumes  that  the  biomass  is 
composed  of  100  MW(e)  of  LFG  (with  emissions  similar  to  a  natural  gas  combined-cycle  plant)  and 
700  MW(e)  of  a  combination  of  biomass  (such  as  wood  waste)  and  municipal  solid  waste,  with 
emissions  similar  to  a  coal  plant.  These  assumptions  were  used  to  estimate  the  emissions  of  this 
portion  of  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives.

As  described  in  Section  9. 2. 2. 3,  a  capacity  factor  of  0.14  to  0.33  for  solar  PV  power  operation  is 
reasonable.  The  capacity  factor  in  New  Jersey  would  fall  somewhere  between  that  of  Boston 
(as  high  as  24  percent)  and  Miami  (as  high  as  26  percent)  if  panels  with  two-axis  tracking  are 
used  (NREL  201 1-TN4224).  Assuming  a  0.25  capacity  factor,  the  560  MW(e)  from  solar  energy 
would  generate  on  average  1 ,230  GWh  of  electricity  annually.  Land  use  required  for  this 
installed  capacity  would  be  between  2,800  and  5,600  ac.  Additional  transmission  lines  might  be 
needed  to  connect  the  locations  of  the  PV  panels  to  those  areas  in  New  Jersey  with  the  largest 
load  growth  rate. 

As  described  in  Section  9.2.2. 1,  a  capacity  factor  of  0.25  to  0.40  for  wind  power  generation  is 
reasonable.  The  higher  the  capacity  factor,  the  less  area  would  be  necessary  to  support  the 
wind  turbine  facilities.  Offshore  wind  generally  provides  for  the  highest  capacity  factors  and  so 
the  review  team  assumed  the  development  of  offshore  wind  resources.  Assuming  a 
0.40  capacity  factor,  the  890  MW(e)  from  wind  energy  would  generate  on  average  3,1 10  GWh 
of  electricity  annually.  An  offshore  wind  farm  of  this  installed  capacity  would  occupy  about 
48  mi2  (30,400  ac)  based  on  an  extrapolation  from  the  Cape  Wind  project,  a  468  MW(e)  project 
that  will  occupy  about  25  mi2  (DOI  2009-TN2527).  Optimal  locations  for  obtaining  offshore  wind 
energy  along  the  New  Jersey  shoreline  may  require  lengthy  new  transmission  lines  to  deliver 
the  power  to  those  areas  with  the  highest  demand  for  electricity. 

For  the  remainder  of  the  energy  sources  that  make  up  the  combination  of  alternatives  (biomass, 
MSW,  and  LFG),  the  review  team  assumed  a  capacity  factor  of  0.85,  which  is  consistent  with 
the  fossil  energy  combustion  alternatives  discussed  in  Sections  9.2.3. 1  and  9. 2. 3. 2.  While  land 
would  necessarily  be  used  to  host  these  facilities  and,  in  the  cases  of  biomass  and  MSW, 
additional  land  would  be  needed  for  storage  of  fuel  materials,  combustion  residue  (such  as  fly 
ash),  and  landfills,  the  review  team  did  not  attempt  to  quantify  the  additional  land  used.  In 
addition  there  could  be  attendant  environmental  effects  on  air,  water,  ecology,  socioeconomics, 
waste,  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties,  and  human  health;  these  were  discussed 
earlier  for  each  of  the  other  power  sources. 

The  review  team  assumed  that  the  1,400-MW(e)  natural-gas-fired  portion  of  the  combination  of 
alternatives  would  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  2,320-MW(e) 
natural-gas-fired  alternative  discussed  in  Section  9. 2. 3. 2.  Consequently,  the  environmental 
effects  for  building  this  portion  of  the  combination  of  alternatives  would  be  scaled  to  be  about 
60  percent  of  the  natural-gas-fired  alternative.  However,  the  natural-gas  plant  would  operate  at 
a  lower  capacity  factor  than  that  assumed  in  Section  9. 2. 3. 2  because  it  would  reduce  its  output 
when  the  wind  and  solar  resources  were  generating  electricity.  It  would  only  operate  at  full 
capacity  when  wind  and  solar  generation  dropped  to  zero.  Based  on  the  capacity  factors  of 
25  percent  and  40  percent  assumed  for  solar  and  wind,  respectively,  the  natural-gas  plant 
would  operate  at  an  average  capacity  factor  of  about  58  percent. 

The  review  team  estimates  that  the  combination  of  alternatives  would  also  have  CO2  emissions 
of  7.75  million  tpy  that  could  affect  climate  change.  On  August  3,  2015,  EPA  set  the  final 
standard  to  limit  C02  emissions  from  new  stationary  combustion  turbines  (e.g.,  natural  gas 
combined  cycle  technology)  (EPA  2015-TN4336).  However,  the  new  rule  applies  to  only  fossil- 
fueled  power  plants  and  would,  therefore,  not  apply  to  power  generated  by  biomass,  landfill  gas, 
or  municipal  solid  waste.  In  addition,  the  staffs  emissions  estimate  for  the  natural-gas-fired 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


power  plant  was  already  below  the  new  standard.  Therefore,  the  staff  s  estimate  of  the  C02 
emissions  from  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives  would  be  unchanged  under  the  new  rule. 

Overall,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impacts  to  land  use  would  be  MODERATE,  based 
on  the  impacts  of  the  natural-gas  plant,  the  solar  facilities,  the  biomass  facilities,  and  their 
respective  transmission  lines.  On  the  same  basis,  the  impacts  to  terrestrial  ecological 
resources  and  air  quality  would  be  similar  to  those  for  the  natural-gas  plant  from  Section  9. 2. 3. 2, 
which  were  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  The  impacts  to  surface  water  and  groundwater,  aquatic 
ecosystems,  human  health,  and  waste  are  also  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  for  the  natural- 
gas  plant  from  Section  9. 2. 3. 2,  which  were  SMALL(1).  The  impacts  to  socioeconomic  resources 
are  expected  to  range  from  MODERATE  (adverse)  to  MODERATE  (beneficial).  The 
MODERATE  (adverse)  impacts  to  socioeconomic  resources  are  related  to  traffic  impacts 
associated  with  moving  large  wind  turbine  components  during  construction  and  aesthetic 
impacts  associated  with  the  large  number  of  wind  turbines.  Similar  to  the  situation  for  a  natural- 
gas-fired  plant,  there  are  no  environmental  pathways  by  which  the  identified  minority  or  low- 
income  populations  within  the  region  would  be  likely  to  suffer  disproportionately  high  and 
adverse  environmental  impacts.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  are  no 
pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income 
populations. 

The  impacts  on  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  for  the  natural-gas-fired  plant  located 
at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.6  and  5.6.  Because  Artificial  Island  is  human-made  and  therefore  not  anticipated  to 
contain  intact  historic  and  cultural  resources,  no  direct  impacts  would  be  anticipated  within 
onsite  areas.  Other  lands,  if  located  off  Artificial  Island,  that  would  be  acquired  to  support  the 
plant  or  other  portions  of  the  combination  of  alternatives  (e.g.,  solar)  would  require  cultural 
resource  studies,  and  possible  mitigation  of  the  adverse  effects  from  ground-disturbing  actions. 
The  studies  would  likely  be  needed  for  all  areas  of  potential  disturbance  offsite  such  as  wind 
and  solar  facilities,  gas  wells,  collection  stations,  and  waste-disposal  sites;  and  along  associated 
corridors  where  new  construction  would  occur  (e.g.,  roads  and  any  new  pipelines).  Visual 
effects  from  the  cooling  system  (i.e.,  cooling  towers)  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be 
anticipated  from  the  new  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  on  Artificial  Island.  The  review  team 
concludes  that  the  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  could  range  from  SMALL  to 
MODERATE. 

The  review  team  believes  that  the  preceding  contributions  are  representative  of  a  combination 
of  energy  sources  that  could  be  considered  for  comparison  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
together  form  a  reasonable  combination  alternative.  A  summary  of  the  review  team 
characterization  of  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of 
the  preceding  combination  of  energy  alternatives  is  shown  in  Table  9-3. 


(1 )  Impacts  to  aquatic  resources  could  be  greater  than  SMALL  because  of  the  installation  of  almost 
900  MW(e)  of  offshore  wind  turbines.  However,  due  to  uncertainty  in  specific  technology  design,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  there  is  insufficient  information  to  definitively  assign  a  higher  impact 
category.

A  natural-gas-fired  plant  would  have  land-use  impacts  for  the  power 
block,  new  causeway,  cooling  towers,  support  systems,  and  connection 
to  a  natural-gas  pipeline.  Solar,  wind,  and  biomass  facilities  and  their 
associated  transmission  lines  would  also  have  land-use  impacts 
because  of  the  large  footprints  required  for  these  facilities.  Offshore 
wind  development  could  potentially  impede  navigation. 

Impacts  would  be  somewhat  less  than  the  impacts  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

Impacts  would  be  somewhat  less  than  the  impacts  for  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

Impacts  could  occur  both  on  and  off  the  site  and  could  include  wildlife 
habitat  loss  and  fragmentation,  reduced  productivity,  and  local 
reductions  in  biological  diversity  comparable  to  the  impacts  associated 
with  a  new  nuclear  plant  but  with  a  potential  for  greater  habitat  loss  due 
to  increases  in  land  use  for  solar  facilities.  Wind  energy  facilities  could 
result  in  increased  avian  and  bat  mortality. 

Impacts  from  the  natural  gas  portion  of  the  combination  would  be  similar 
to  those  discussed  in  Section  9. 2. 3. 2.  The  construction  of  offshore  wind 
energy  facilities  could  result  in  impacts  to  aquatic  resources. 

Beneficial  Impacts:  Construction  and  operation  of  a  series  of  natural- 
gas  generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  solar,  wind,  and  biomass 
units  elsewhere  would  produce  beneficial  economic  impacts  ranging 
from  SMALL  (for  all  economic  categories  within  the  50-mi  region  other 
than  the  host  county)  to  MODERATE  (for  economic  impacts,  primarily 
tax  revenues,  in  the  host  county  during  construction  and  operation). 

Adverse  Impacts:  For  the  entire  50-mi  region,  construction  and 
operations  would  produce  SMALL  adverse  impacts  for  all  physical 
impact  categories,  demographic  categories,  and  community  and 
infrastructure  categories  except  for  traffic  impacts,  which  would  be 
MODERATE  during  movement  of  large  wind  turbine  components  during 
construction,  and  aesthetic  impacts,  which  would  be  MODERATE 
based  on  the  large  number  of  wind  turbines. 

There  are  few  minority  populations  and/or  low-income  populations  near 
the  PSEG  Site;  impacts  to  such  populations  would  likely  be  minimal. 

The  potential  for  impacts  from  solar,  wind,  and  biomass  facilities  should 
be  manageable  based  on  likely  locations  and  distributed  nature  of  the 
resources.  Beneficial  impacts  from  property  tax  revenues  might  result 
in  beneficial  impacts. 

Most  potential  impacts  could  likely  be  effectively  managed.  Most  of  the 
facility  and  infrastructure  would  be  built  in  previously  disturbed  areas. 
Visual  impacts  could  be  noticeable.  Potential  offsite  impacts  from  solar, 
wind,  and  biomass  facilities  could  likely  be  effectively  managed. 
Important  site-specific  resources  could  be  affected  by  transmission 
lines,  but  these  could  likely  be  effectively  managed.

solid-waste  sources  of  energy. 

(a)  The  entry  "None"  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts  to  minority  or  low-

those  impacts  do  not  affect  minority  or  low-income  populations  in  any  disproportionate  manner,  relative  to  the 
general  population. 


The  review  team  also  considered  whether  some  other  combination  of  energy  alternatives  would 
be  more  advantageous  under  a  different  set  of  assumptions. 

If  the  contribution  from  solar  energy  were  doubled,  it  would  require  the  addition  (compared  to 
2010)  of  1 ,120  MW  of  solar  panels  by  2021 ,  which  would  generate  on  average  2,460  GWh  of 
electricity  annually.  The  natural-gas  plant  for  the  combination  alternative  would  still  be  sized  at 

1 .400  MW  in  order  to  back  up  the  solar  and  wind  sources.  But  it  would  generate  5.830  GWh 
annually,  operating  at  a  capacity  factor  of  48  percent,  with  an  associated  reduction  in  emissions. 
But  the  emissions  would  still  be  significant,  equivalent  on  average  to  the  operation  of  a  roughly 
700-MW  natural-gas  plant.  At  the  same  time,  the  additional  560  MW  of  solar  panels  would 
occupy  roughly  an  additional  2,800  to  5,600  ac.  So  while  emissions  would  decrease  somewhat, 
land-use  impacts  would  increase  and  there  would  be  no  clear  advantage  to  this  option. 

If  the  contribution  from  wind  energy  were  doubled,  it  would  require  the  addition  (compared  to 
2010)  of  1,780  MW  of  wind  turbines  by  2021,  which  would  generate  on  average  6,220  GWh  of 
electricity  annually.  The  natural-gas  plant  for  the  combination  alternative  would  still  be  sized  at 

1 .400  MW  in  order  to  back  up  the  solar  and  wind  sources.  But  it  would  generate  3,950  GWh 
annually,  operating  at  a  capacity  factor  of  32  percent,  with  an  associated  reduction  in  emissions. 
But  the  emissions  would  still  be  significant,  equivalent  on  average  to  the  operation  of  a  roughly 
450-MW  natural-gas  plant.  At  the  same  time,  the  additional  890  MW  of  offshore  wind  turbines 
would  occupy  roughly  an  additional  30,400  ac.  So  while  emissions  would  decrease,  impacts  to 
ecological  resources  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  wind  turbines,  as  discussed  in 
Section  9.2.2. 1,  would  increase  and  there  would  be  no  clear  advantage  to  this  option. 

Increasing  the  contributions  of  LFG/biomass/MSW  would  lead  to  an  equivalent  reduction  in  the 
size  of  the  natural-gas  plant  that  would  be  needed.  However,  the  land-use  and  emissions 
impacts  of  these  other  sources  are  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  impacts  of  the  natural-gas  plant. 
So  increasing  the  contribution  of  these  sources  would  offer  no  advantage  other  than  an

increased  reliance  on  renewable  resources.  However,  the  review  team  also  notes  that  there 
may  not  be  additional  capacity  available  from  these  limited  resources. 

9.2.5  Summary  Comparison  of  Alternatives 

Table  9-4  contains  a  summary  of  the  review  team’s  environmental  impact  characterizations  for 
building  and  operating  new  nuclear,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired  power-generating  units,  as 
well  as  a  combination  of  energy  alternatives,  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  within  the  PSEG  ROI.  The 
nuclear  power  impacts  summarized  in  the  table  are  evaluated  in  Chapters  4  and  5  for 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities  and  operational  impacts.  The  impacts  of  fossil-fuel 
alternatives  summarized  in  the  table  are  evaluated  in  Section  9.2.2  and  the  combination  of 
alternatives  in  Section  9.2.4.  For  the  combination  of  alternatives  shown  in  Table  9-4,  the  review 
team  assumes  the  siting  of  natural-gas-fired  combined-cycle  units  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the 
siting  of  other  alternative  power-generating  facilities  elsewhere  within  or  near  the  PSEG  ROI. 
Closed-cycle  cooling  with  natural  draft  or  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  (NDCTs  or  MDCTs)  is 
assumed  for  all  thermal  plants. 

The  review  team  reviewed  the  available  information  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  power- 
generation  alternatives  compared  to  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Based  on  this  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that,  from  an  environmental  perspective,  none 
of  the  viable  energy  alternatives  is  environmentally  preferable  to  building  new  baseload  nuclear 
power-generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Because  of  current  concerns  related  to  GHG  emissions,  it  is  appropriate  to  specifically  discuss 
the  differences  among  the  alternative  energy  sources  regarding  CO2  emissions.  The  CO2 
emissions  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  and  for  the  energy  generation  alternatives  are  discussed  in 
Sections  5.7.1,  9. 2. 3.1,  9. 2. 3. 2,  and  9.2.4.  Table  9-5  summarizes  the  CO2  emission  estimates 
for  a  40-year  period  for  the  alternatives  considered  by  the  review  team  to  be  viable  for  baseload 
power  generation.  These  estimates  are  limited  to  the  emissions  from  power  generation  and  do 
not  include  CO2  emissions  for  workforce  transportation,  building,  uranium  fuel  cycle,  or 
decommissioning.  Among  the  reasonable  energy  generation  alternatives,  the  CO2  emissions 
for  nuclear  power  are  a  small  fraction  of  the  emissions  of  the  other  viable  energy  generation 
alternatives.  Even  when  the  transportation  emissions  attributable  to  the  nuclear  workforce  and 
the  fuel  cycle  emissions  are  added  in,  which  would  increase  the  emissions  for  plant  operations 
over  a  40-year  period  to  about  1 1 ,000,000  MT  C02e,  this  number  is  still  significantly  lower  than 
the  emissions  for  the  plant  operations  portion  of  the  other  reasonable  energy  generation 
alternatives. 

On  June  3,  2010,  EPA  issued  a  rule  (75  FR  31514-TN1404)  tailoring  the  applicability  criteria 
that  determine  which  stationary  sources  and  modifications  to  existing  projects  become  subject 
to  permitting  requirements  for  GHG  emissions  under  the  PSD  and  Title  V  programs  of  the  Clean 
Air  Act  (42  USC  7401  et  seq.  -TN1 141 ).  According  to  the  source  permitting  program,  if  the 
source  (1 )  is  otherwise  subject  to  PSD  (for  another  regulated  NSR  pollutant)  and  (2)  has  a  GHG 
potential  to  emit  that  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  75,000  tons  C02e  per  year  (i.e.,  adjusting  for 
different  global  warming  potentials  for  different  GHGs),  then  the  source  would  be  subject  to 
BACT.  In  addition,  on  August  3,  2015,  the  EPA  set  the  final  standard  to  limit  C02  emissions 
from  new  coal-fired  power  plants  (EPA  2015-TN4336).  The  use  of  BACT  has  the  potential  to

reduce  the  amount  of  GHGs  emitted  from  stationary  source  facilities.  Implementation  of  these 
rules  could  reduce  the  amount  of  GHGs  from  the  values  indicated  in  Table  9-5  for  coal,  natural 
gas,  and  other  alternative  energy  sources  that  would  otherwise  have  appreciable  uncontrolled 
GHG  emissions.  The  GHG  emissions  from  the  production  of  electricity  from  a  nuclear  power 
source  are  primarily  from  the  fuel  cycle  and  such  emissions  could  be  reduced  further  if  the 
electricity  from  the  assumed  fossil-fuel  source  powering  the  fuel  cycle  is  subject  to  BACT 
controls.  GHG  emissions  from  the  production  of  electrical  energy  from  a  nuclear  power  source 
are  orders  of  magnitude  less  than  those  from  the  reasonable  alternative  energy  sources 
discussed  here.  Accordingly,  the  comparative  relationship  between  the  energy  sources  listed  in 
Table  9-5  would  not  change  meaningfully,  even  if  possible  reductions  to  the  GHG  emissions 
from  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle  are  ignored,  because  GHG  emissions  from  the  other  energy  source 
alternatives  would  not  be  sufficiently  reduced  to  make  them  environmentally  preferable  to  the 
proposed  project. 

The  CO2  emissions  associated  with  generation  alternatives  such  as  wind  power,  solar  power, 
and  hydropower  would  be  associated  with  workforce  transportation,  construction,  and 
decommissioning  of  the  facilities.  Because  these  power-generation  alternatives  do  not  involve 
combustion,  the  review  team  considers  the  GHG  emissions  to  be  minor  and  concludes  that  the 
GHG  emissions  would  have  a  minimal  cumulative  impact.  Other  energy  generation  alternatives 
involving  combustion  of  oil,  wood  waste,  municipal  solid  waste,  or  biomass-derived  fuels  would 
produce  CO2  emissions  from  combustion,  workforce  transportation,  plant  construction,  and  plant 
decommissioning.  It  is  likely  that  the  CO2  emissions  from  the  combustion  process  for  these 
alternatives  would  dominate  the  other  C02  emissions  associated  with  the  generation  alternative. 
It  is  also  likely  that  the  CO2  emissions  from  these  alternatives  would  be  of  the  same  order  of 
magnitude  as  the  emissions  for  the  fossil-fuel  alternatives  considered  in  Sections  9.2.3. 1, 

9. 2. 3. 2,  and  9.2.4.  However,  because  the  review  team  determined  that  these  alternatives  do 
not  meet  the  need  for  baseload  power  generation,  the  review  team  has  not  evaluated  their  CO2 
emissions  quantitatively.  Insofar  as  some  of  these  alternatives,  such  as  biomass,  are 
considered  in  the  combination  of  alternatives  discussed  in  Section  9.2.4,  they  would  increase 
the  total  CO2  emissions  beyond  the  numbers  shown  in  Table  9-5;  however,  the  review  team 
considers  the  small  fraction  contributed  by  these  technologies  in  comparison  to  the  contributions 
of  the  natural-gas  component  for  the  combination  of  alternatives  case  to  have  a  minimal  further 
cumulative  impact  that  does  not  warrant  a  more  precise  analysis. 

As  discussed  in  Chapter  8,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  need  for  additional  baseload 
power  generation  has  been  demonstrated.  Also,  as  discussed  previously  in  this  chapter,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  viable  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action  would  all  involve  the 
use  of  fossil  fuels  (coal  or  natural  gas).  Consequently,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  result  in  the 
lowest  level  of  emissions  of  GHGs  among  the  viable  alternatives. 

9.3  Alternative  Sites 

The  NRC  regulations  require  that  the  EIS  prepared  in  conjunction  with  an  application  for  an  ESP 
include  an  evaluation  of  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250).  The 
consideration  of  alternative  sites  is  one  portion  of  the  review  of  alternatives.  The  NRC  guidance 
in  Section  9.3  of  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614)  regarding  the  site-selection  process  calls  for  the

identification  of  an  ROI  followed  by  successive  screenings  of  candidate  areas,  potential  sites, 
candidate  sites,  and  the  proposed  site.  Section  9.3.1  of  this  EIS  presents  a  discussion  of  the 
PSEG  site-selection  process,  which  includes  identification  of  the  ROI  for  possible  siting  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  This  discussion  is  followed  by  the  review  team  evaluation  of  the  PSEG 
site-selection  process  (Section  9. 3. 1.3). 

The  specific  resources  and  components  that  could  be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  the 
proposed  action  and  other  actions  in  the  same  geographic  area  are  assessed.  For  the 
purposes  of  this  alternative  sites  evaluation,  the  impacts  evaluated  include  NRC-authorized 
construction  and  operation  and  other  cumulative  impacts  including  preconstruction  activities. 
Sections  9.3.2  through  9.3.5  provide  a  site-specific  description  of  the  environmental  impacts  of 
locating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  each  alternative  site  based  on  issues  such  as  land  use, 
air  quality,  water  resources,  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecology,  socioeconomics  and  environmental 
justice,  and  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties.  Section  9.3.6,  which  summarizes  the 
impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and  alternative  sites,  contains  a  table  with  the  NRC  staff 
characterization  of  the  impacts  at  the  alternative  sites  in  comparison  to  the  impacts  at  the 
proposed  site  to  determine  whether  there  are  any  alternative  sites  that  are  environmentally 
preferable  or  obviously  superior  to  the  PSEG  Site. 

9.3.1  Alternative  Site-Selection  Process 

The  review  team  evaluation  of  the  PSEG  alternative  site-selection  process  began  with  an 
evaluation  of  the  PSEG-stated  ROI.  Within  that  ROI,  the  review  team  evaluated  the  results  of 
the  application  of  screening  criteria  applied  sequentially  to  establish  candidate  areas,  potential 
sites,  and  finally  candidate  sites,  leading  to  the  selection  of  a  proposed  site  and  alternative  sites. 
The  process  that  PSEG  used  to  select  its  proposed  site  and  alternative  sites  is  described  in  the 
following  sections. 

9. 3. 1.1  Selection  of  Region  of  Interest 

In  general,  the  ROI  is  the  geographic  area  considered  in  searching  for  candidate  sites 
(NRC  2000-TN614).  The  ROI  is  typically  the  state  in  which  the  proposed  site  is  located  or  the 
relevant  service  area  for  the  proposed  plant  (NRC  2000-TN614). 

PSEG  selected  the  State  of  New  Jersey  as  its  ROI  primarily  because  (1)  the  PSEG  parent 
company,  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group,  is  headquartered  in  New  Jersey  and  has  power 
plants  and  offices  located  throughout  the  state  and  (2)  one  of  the  Public  Service  Enterprise 
Group’s  principal  subsidiaries  is  PSE&G,  a  regulated  public  utility  company  engaged  in  the 
transmission  and  distribution  of  natural  gas  and  electricity  and  whose  electric  service  area  is 
limited  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  extends  throughout  much  of  the  state.  Furthermore, 
PSEG  concluded  that  the  selection  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey  as  the  ROI  provides  a  good 
diversity  of  environmental  and  geographic  conditions  for  potential  power  plant  sites  and  that  any 
reasonable  expansion  of  the  ROI  outside  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  not  significantly 
improve  that  diversity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  PSEG  ER  states  that  locating  new  nuclear  units  in  New  Jersey  would  allow  Public  Service 
Enterprise  Group  to  make  effective  use  of  its  existing  resources  in  the  state  to  supply  the 
anticipated  electrical  output  to  important  load  centers  via  existing  transmission  lines  (PSEG 
2015-4280).

The  ROI  consists  of  about  8,700  mi2  in  21  counties  within  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  Major  water 
features  within  the  ROI  that  could  serve  as  sources  of  cooling  water  include  the  Delaware  River, 
the  Hudson  River,  and  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  In  addition  to  numerous  state  highways  and  routes, 
major  transportation  routes  within  the  ROI  include  Interstate  Routes  78,  80,  95,  280,  287,  and 
295;  the  New  Jersey  Turnpike;  the  Garden  State  Parkway;  and  the  Atlantic  City  Expressway. 
Rail  and  water  transportation  infrastructures  also  exist  throughout  the  ROI. 

9. 3. 1.2  Selection  of  Candidate  Areas  and  Potential  Sites 

The  PSEG  site-selection  process  is  described  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  in 
greater  detail  in  the  PSEG  Alternative  Site  Evaluation  Study  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  PSEG  also 
provided  additional  details  on  the  process  of  identifying  and  selecting  potential  sites  in  a 
Request  for  Additional  Information  (RAI)  response  (PSEG  2012-TN21 13).  The  following 
discussion  summarizes  the  PSEG  site-selection  process. 

Candidate  Areas 

As  the  initial  step  of  the  site-selection  process,  PSEG  identified  candidate  areas  within  the  ROI 
by  constructing  digitized  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  maps  of  the  entire  ROI  and  then 
applying  exclusionary  criteria  to  eliminate  areas  considered  to  be  unsuitable  for  siting  a  nuclear 
power  plant.  The  exclusionary  criteria  applied  by  PSEG  covered  those  factors  that  might  make 
the  licensing,  permitting,  or  development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  impractical. 

PSEG  exclusionary  criteria  included  distances  to  primary  highways,  railroad  or  barge 
transportation,  transmission  lines  or  500-kV  substations,  and  water  sources  capable  of 
supplying  35,000  gpm.  Any  areas  located  more  than  20  mi  from  such  resources  were 
eliminated.  In  addition,  areas  were  eliminated  if  their  population  densities  were  greater  than 
500  people/mi2,  including  a  3-mi  buffer  zone  around  such  densely  populated  areas.  The 
exclusionary  criteria  also  provided  for  the  elimination  of  designated  parks,  preserves,  and 
recreation  areas  and  active  military  bases  (PSEG  2010-TN257). 

The  principal  criteria  that  affected  the  identification  of  candidate  areas  within  the  ROI  were 
population  density  and  the  presence  of  designated  lands.  These  two  criteria  eliminated 
significant  portions  of  the  ROI.  It  should  be  noted  that  application  of  the  criteria  for  distance  to 
highways  and/or  to  rail/barge  transportation  did  not  eliminate  any  areas  from  the  ROI,  and  the 
criteria  for  distance  to  transmission  lines/substations  and/or  water  sources  eliminated  only  a 
small  part  of  the  ROI  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  application  of  exclusion  criteria  to  the  ROI  resulted  in  the  identification  of  seven 
candidate  areas  scattered  throughout  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

Potential  Sites 

PSEG  next  searched  within  the  seven  candidate  areas  to  identify  locations  for  potential  sites 
suitable  for  siting  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Topographical  maps  and  aerial  photographs  of 
each  candidate  area  were  examined  to  identify  locations  that  would  provide  sufficient  land  for 
the  suitable  arrangement  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  other  required  facilities  and  a 
reasonable  site  boundary.  The  principal  considerations  at  this  step  included  (1)  reasonably  flat

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


terrain  and  undeveloped  land  of  sufficient  size  to  accommodate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
(2)  avoiding  any  of  the  following:  urban  areas;  residential  developments;  public  institutions; 
designated  parks,  preserves,  and  recreational  areas;  listed  historic  sites;  extensive  wetland  or 
floodplain  areas;  public  drinking  water  intakes;  protected  groundwater  resources;  and  airports 
(PSEG  2012-TN21 13). 

Locations  that  were  identified  as  satisfying  the  above  conditions  were  subjected  to  further 
examination  to  identify  specific  parcels  of  land  with  the  following  attributes:  site  topography  of 
no  more  than  5  percent  slope  across  the  area;  minimal  contact  with  wetlands,  floodplains, 
individual  residences,  and  hazardous  material  pipelines;  location  as  close  as  possible  to  water, 
transmission,  and  transportation  resources;  and  location  as  far  as  possible  from  the  other 
environmental  features  identified  in  Item  2  listed  in  the  preceding  paragraph. 

Preliminary  block-type  plant  footprint  layouts  were  developed  and  overlaid  on  each  parcel  of 
land  that  appeared  to  satisfy  the  above  criteria.  These  footprint  layouts  were  used  to  determine 
whether  sufficient  land  was  available  to  develop  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  that  location.  In  addition 
to  the  block-type  plant  footprint,  conceptual  offsite  corridors  were  identified  and  examined  for 
the  nearest  suitable  water  supply,  transmission  line,  rail  line,  and  primary  road.  An  attempt  was 
made  to  locate  these  conceptual  corridors  to  avoid  the  same  types  of  sensitive  environmental 
features  that  are  described  above  for  the  identification  of  potential  sites.  The  locations  that 
survived  this  part  of  the  process  were  designated  by  PSEG  as  preliminary  potential  sites. 

These  preliminary  potential  sites  and  their  associated  offsite  corridors  were  then  evaluated  as  to 
how  well  they  satisfied  the  aforementioned  siting  attributes  (e.g.,  site  topography  of  no  more 
than  5  percent  slope  across  the  area).  The  site  in  each  candidate  area  that  was  determined  to 
best  satisfy  the  siting  criteria  was  carried  forward  to  become  a  potential  site.  An  effort  was 
made  by  PSEG  to  identify  at  least  1  potential  site  in  each  of  the  seven  candidate  areas,  and 
1 1  such  potential  sites  were  so  identified.  In  each  case,  the  potential  sites  that  were  retained  for 
further  evaluation  included  the  most  favorable  site  identified  in  each  of  the  candidate  areas 
(PSEG  2012-TN21 13). 

Candidate  Sites 

Candidate  sites  are  those  sites  within  the  ROI  that  are  considered  to  be  among  the  best  sites 
that  can  be  reasonably  identified  and  made  available  for  the  siting  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 
PSEG  subjected  the  1 1  potential  sites  to  evaluation  in  greater  detail  to  identify  possible 
candidate  sites.  PSEG  collected  more  detailed  information  on  environmental  and  technical 
conditions  at  each  of  the  potential  sites. 

The  primary  criteria  used  by  PSEG  for  the  selection  of  candidate  sites  included  consideration  of 
whether  a  potential  site  had  any  significant  environmental  or  other  issues  that  would  make  it 
impractical  or  undesirable  for  licensing,  permitting,  or  development  with  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant.  PSEG  considered  the  following  issues  in  its  evaluation: 

•  Environmental  acceptability.  The  potential  sites  were  reviewed  with  regard  to  major 
environmental  issues  such  as  proximity  to  designated  lands  or  waters  and  potential 
encroachment  on  sensitive  land  uses. 


November  201 5 


9-47 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


•  Nuclear  licensing.  The  potential  sites  were  reviewed  with  regard  to  major  nuclear  licensing 
issues  such  as  proximity  to  capable  faults,  proximity  to  hazardous  land  uses,  and  proximity 
to  population  centers. 

•  Engineering.  The  potential  sites  were  reviewed  with  regard  to  major  engineering  issues 
such  as  the  length  and  difficulty  of  required  water,  transmission,  and  rail  connections; 
cooling  water  pumping  head;  and  ability  to  deliver  large  components  to  the  site. 

PSEG  identified  the  number  of  environmental  concerns  for  each  site  during  this  screening; 
however,  this  evaluation  was  combined  with  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  level  of 
environmental  impact  and  the  necessary  activities  or  considerations  that  would  be  required  to 
mitigate  or  avoid  such  impacts.  The  focus  of  the  evaluation  was  therefore  on  the  environmental 
suitability  of  the  potential  sites.  Any  issues  that  were  identified  were  considered  to  be  significant 
if  they  introduced  the  potential  for  adverse  environmental  impact  or  schedule  delays  (such  as 
those  associated  with  environmental/regulatory  permitting  or  nuclear  licensing).  Other  issues 
were  considered  to  be  significant  if  they  involved  environmental  conditions  that  introduced 
overall  regulatory  uncertainty  by  raising  the  possibility  of  unusual  and  restrictive  licensing  or 
permitting  conditions  and/or  increased  project  costs  by  requiring  unusual  and  costly  site- 
development  efforts  or  impact  mitigation  measures. 

PSEG’s  evaluation  identified  significant  issues  at  each  of  the  11  potential  sites;  however,  these 
issues  did  not  by  themselves  indicate  a  site  would  not  be  feasible  for  the  licensing,  permitting,  or 
development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  that  site.  Rather,  the  evaluation  highlighted  those 
issues  that  would  make  it  more  difficult,  more  costly,  and/or  more  complicated  to  construct  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  that  particular  site.  As  applied  in  the  PSEG  siting  study,  the  extent 
of  these  issues  was  an  important  factor  in  determining  the  overall  desirability  of  a  site. 

Based  on  the  more  detailed  evaluation  of  the  1 1  potential  sites,  5  of  these  sites  were  found  to 
have  fewer  significant  negative  issues  than  the  other  6  sites.  Furthermore,  the  PSEG  qualitative 
evaluation  of  the  significant  issues  at  these  five  sites  indicated  that  all  of  the  identified  issues 
appeared  to  be  manageable  and  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  resolved.  In  addition, 
each  of  these  five  sites  was  found  to  possess  multiple  highly  desirable  characteristics 
(PSEG  2010-TN257). 

On  the  basis  of  these  evaluations,  the  six  sites  with  significantly  more  negative  issues  were 
eliminated  from  further  consideration,  and  the  following  five  sites  were  retained  as  candidate 
sites  for  further  study  (see  Figure  9-1 ): 

•  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey 

•  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 

•  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 

•  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey 

•  Site  7-4  (also  called  the  proposed  site  or  the  PSEG  Site,  which  is  located  at  the  existing 
Salem-Hope  Creek  site)  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


To  identify  the  proposed  and  alternative  sites,  PSEG  evaluated  each  of  the  five  candidate  sites 
against  more  specific  criteria  from  both  technical  and  environmental  perspectives.  A  numerical 
scoring  system  was  used  as  the  basis  for  comparing  the  candidate  sites.  To  support  the 
numerical  scores,  various  investigations  and  assessments  of  the  candidate  sites  were 
performed,  including  environmental  and  permitting  evaluations,  transmission  evaluations,  field 
reconnaissance,  and  refinement  of  the  previously  developed  preliminary  site  layouts.  These 
more  detailed  evaluations  included  the  aspects  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  described  below. 

•  Environmental  and  Permitting  Conditions.  Factors  related  to  environmental  acceptability 
and  permitting  issues  were  evaluated  in  more  detail  than  previously  for  the  potential  sites. 
Information  on  zoning  and  land-use  planning — including  maps  showing  the  property  parcels 
on  and  near  each  of  the  candidate  sites — was  collected.  Reviews  were  conducted  of 
applicable  State  and  local  regulations  concerning  air  quality;  ambient  noise;  water 
withdrawal;  land  use;  and  other  environmental,  regulatory,  and  permitting  issues.  Site- 
specific  information  on  threatened  and  endangered  species  and  cultural  resources  was 
obtained  from  appropriate  State  and  Federal  government  agencies. 

•  Transmission  Interconnection  and  Stability.  The  feasibility  of  obtaining  transmission 
interconnection  for  each  of  the  candidate  sites  was  evaluated  through  modeling  of  thermal 
overloads  and  was  expressed  as  a  cost  of  network  upgrades  that  might  be  required  for  the 
mitigation  of  such  overloads.  The  risk  of  transmission  upgrades  being  required  to  maintain 
system  stability  was  evaluated  qualitatively. 

•  Field  Reconnaissance.  Field  reconnaissance  site  visits  were  conducted  and  were 
intended  to  supplement  and  confirm  the  information  collected  from  maps,  aerial 
photographs,  and  other  publicly  available  sources.  The  observations  from  the  field 
reconnaissance  focused  on  issues  such  as  the  condition  of  wetlands  and  other  natural 
habitats,  recent  residential  developments,  transportation  routes,  and  constructability 
characteristics. 

•  Refinement  of  Site  Layouts.  Based  on  the  information  collected  through  the 
environmental  evaluations  and  field  reconnaissance,  the  preliminary  site  layouts  developed 
during  the  prior  identification  of  “potential  sites”  were  revised  to  make  the  best  use  of 
existing  property  parcels  and  reduce  impacts  on  environmentally  sensitive  areas. 

The  information  collected  was  used  to  generate  numerical  scores  for  each  of  the  candidate 
sites.  The  numerical  scores  covered  40  individual  site  characteristics  related  to  three 
categories:  environmental  acceptability  (15  characteristics),  nuclear  licensing 
(11  characteristics),  and  engineering/cost  factors  (14  characteristics).  An  importance  weighting 
factor  was  assigned  to  each  site  characteristic.  The  weighted  scores  for  each  candidate  site 
were  obtained  by  multiplying  each  unweighted  score  by  its  importance  weighting  factor  and  then 
summing  the  weighted  scores  for  each  characteristic.  The  resulting  numerical  scores  are 
shown  in  Table  9-6,  in  which  the  candidate  sites  have  been  ranked  from  the  highest  weighted 
score  to  the  lowest  weighted  score  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  (It  should  be  noted  that  the  maximum 
possible  weighted  score  under  the  PSEG  method  would  be  1,465.) 

To  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  importance  weighting  factors,  the  candidate  sites  were  also 
ranked  according  to  their  total  unweighted  score.  The  ranking  of  the  sites  by  their  unweighted 
scores  is  also  shown  in  Table  9-6.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  maximum  possible  unweighted 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


score  under  the  PSEG  method  would  be  200.  The  data  in  Table  9-6  show  that  the  importance 
weighting  factors  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  rankings  of  the  five  candidate  sites. 
That  is,  the  candidate  sites  have  the  same  overall  ranking  regardless  of  whether  the  total 
weighted  or  the  total  unweighted  scores  are  used,  with  the  exception  that  Sites  7-1  and  7-2  would 
have  been  tied  if  the  unweighted  scores  had  been  used  to  rank  the  sites.

The  total  weighted  numerical  scores  in  Table  9-6  indicate  that  Site  7-4  has  the  highest  ranking, 
followed  in  order  by  Site  7-3,  Site  7-2,  Site  7-1,  and  Site  4-1. 

As  a  further  check  on  the  results  of  the  site  evaluations,  the  numerical  scores  were  subtotaled 
within  each  of  three  categories  of  site  characteristics:  environmental  acceptability  (including 
issues  related  to  ecology,  land  use,  and  socioeconomics),  nuclear  licensing  (including  issues 
related  to  demographics,  emergency  planning,  seismicity,  and  site  security),  and 
engineering/cost  (including  issues  related  to  site  development,  transmission,  transportation,  and 
water  supply).  The  results  are  shown  in  Table  9-7  (PSEG  2010-TN257).

Based  on  the  results  summarized  in  Table  9-6  and  Table  9-7,  PSEG  identified  Site  7-4  as  the 
most  favorable  candidate  site  in  regard  to  the  issues  considered  in  the  numerical  scoring.  As 
can  be  seen  in  Table  9-6,  Site  7-4  is  the  highest  ranked  site  based  on  both  the  weighted  and 
unweighted  overall  scoring.  In  addition,  as  shown  in  Table  9-7,  Site  7-4  is  the  highest  ranked 
site  in  the  environmental  acceptability  category  and  is  the  second  highest  ranked  site  for  both 
the  nuclear  licensing  category  and  the  engineering/cost  category.  None  of  the  other  candidate 
sites  ranked  among  the  top  two  sites  in  all  three  categories.

In  addition  to  the  numerical  scores  described  above  for  the  candidate  sites,  PSEG  considered 
the  additional  technical  and  business  considerations  and  synergies  of  collocating  a  new  nuclear 
facility  with  the  existing  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  nuclear  units  at  Site  7-4.  According  to  PSEG, 
these  synergies  include  the  following  factors: 

•  abundant  existing  site-specific  data,  information,  and  regulatory  knowledge; 

•  significant  community  and  key  stakeholder  support  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  and 
in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  existing  emergency  management  infrastructure  and  support  agreements  with  the  states  of 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware  and  with  Salem  and  Cumberland  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and 
New  Castle  County  in  Delaware; 

•  economic  and  operational  synergies  with  existing  operations  at  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek 
nuclear  units; 

•  security  considerations,  such  as  the  opportunity  for  an  integrated  security  strategy  and 
protected  area  and  preexisting  agreements  for  mutual  aid,  support,  and  response; 

•  jobs  creation  in  areas  of  New  Jersey  currently  experiencing  low  per  capita  income  and  high 
unemployment; 

•  limited  risk  of  substantial  population  growth  near  the  proposed  site;  and 

•  minimal  community  and  regional  disruptions  associated  with  necessary  infrastructure 
improvements  such  as  the  new  transmission  lines,  new  pipelines,  and  new  access  road  and 
rail  systems. 

In  consideration  of  all  of  the  above  elements,  PSEG  evaluated  business  and  other  qualitative 
factors  along  with  the  numerical  scores  of  each  candidate  site  in  making  its  final  site  selection. 
Site  7-4  (i.e. ,  the  existing  PSEG  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey)  was  selected  by  PSEG  as 
the  proposed  site  for  the  ESP  application  because  it  was  the  highest  ranked  site  and  because  it 
has  additional  benefits  related  to  the  existing  infrastructure,  community  support,  emergency 
response,  and  operational  synergies  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  other  four  candidate  sites  are 
considered  to  be  alternative  sites. 

9.3. 1.3  Review  Team  Evaluation  of  the  PSEG  Site-Selection  Process 

Review  Team  Findings 

The  review  team  evaluated  the  PSEG  method  for  selecting  the  ROI;  identifying  candidate  areas; 
and  evaluating  potential  sites,  candidate  sites,  and  alternative  sites.  The  results  of  the  review 
team  evaluation  are  presented  in  this  section. 

PSEG  chose  the  entire  State  of  New  Jersey  for  the  PSEG  ROI,  an  area  that  is  larger  than,  and 
completely  encompasses,  PSEG’s  traditional  service  territory.  The  designated  ROI  is 
consistent  with  the  guidance  in  the  NRC  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614).  The  review  team 
concludes  that  the  ROI  used  in  the  PSEG  ESP  application  is  reasonable  for  consideration  and 
analysis  of  potential  sites.  The  areal  extent  of  the  ROI  is  sufficiently  expansive  to  ensure  that  an 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


adequate  slate  of  potential  sites  could  be  found.  The  review  team  also  finds  that  the  PSEG 
basis  for  defining  the  ROI  did  not  arbitrarily  exclude  desirable  candidate  locations. 

PSEG  next  identified  candidate  areas  within  the  ROI.  PSEG  used  exclusionary  criteria  based 
on  distances  to  primary  highways,  railroad  or  barge  transportation,  transmission  lines  or  500-kV 
substations,  and  water  supply,  as  well  as  exclusionary  criteria  for  areas  with  high  population 
densities  and  areas  designated  as  parks,  preserves,  recreation  areas,  and  active  military  bases. 
The  review  team  concludes  that  the  approach  used  by  PSEG  to  identify  its  seven  candidate 
areas  within  the  State  of  New  Jersey  is  consistent  with  that  described  in  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000- 
TN614);  therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  method  used  by  PSEG  to  identify 
candidate  areas  is  reasonable. 

To  identify  potential  sites,  PSEG  used  topographical  maps  and  aerial  photographs  to  determine 
where  suitable  land  area  for  siting  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  be  available  within  each  of  the 
candidate  areas  (i.e. ,  inclusionary  criteria).  PSEG  developed  preliminary  plant  footprint  layouts 
for  this  purpose.  PSEG  also  considered  other  required  conditions  at  each  site,  including  ground 
slope  and  proximity  to  water  supply,  transmission,  and  transportation  resources.  For  each 
location  under  consideration,  PSEG  developed  conceptual  offsite  corridors  for  water  supply 
pipelines,  transmission  corridors,  rail  lines,  and  primary  roads.  In  addition,  PSEG  gave 
consideration  to  the  proximity  of  each  site  to  floodplains,  wetlands,  residences,  and  other 
sensitive  land  features.  In  all,  PSEG  identified  1 1  potential  sites,  including  at  least  1  such  site  in 
each  of  the  7  candidate  areas.  The  review  team  notes  that  the  1 1  potential  sites  identified  by 
PSEG  cover  a  wide  geographic  area  and  range  of  environmental  conditions.  The  approach 
used  by  PSEG  in  identifying  potential  sites  is  consistent  with  that  described  in  the  ESRP 
(NRC  2000-TN614);  therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  PSEG  process  for  identifying 
potential  sites  is  reasonable. 

PSEG  reviewed  the  1 1  potential  sites  in  more  detail  to  narrow  the  list  to  a  group  of  candidate 
sites.  This  portion  of  the  PSEG  review  included  subjecting  the  11  sites  to  more  detailed 
evaluation  including  obtaining  more  detailed  information  on  the  environmental  and  technical 
conditions  at  each  site.  While  the  focus  of  the  PSEG  evaluation  was  on  the  environmental 
suitability  of  the  sites,  other  factors  in  the  PSEG  evaluation  included  consideration  of  major 
nuclear  licensing  issues  and  major  engineering  issues  related  to  cost  or  difficulty  of  constructing 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  site. 

In  this  step  of  its  site-selection  process,  PSEG  eliminated  6  of  the  1 1  potential  sites;  5  of  these 
sites  were  eliminated  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the  observation  that  the  water  supply 
pipeline  and/or  the  transmission  lines  would  have  to  cross  a  state  park  or  other  sensitive  areas. 
According  to  the  PSEG  siting  study  (PSEG  2010-TN257),  one  of  the  potential  sites  was 
eliminated  due  to  consideration  that,  among  other  factors,  two  population  centers  of  greater 
than  25,000  people  are  located  within  10  mi.  The  PSEG  siting  study  also  found  that  5  of  the 
1 1  potential  sites  had  40  percent  fewer  identified  issues  than  the  other  6  sites;  hence,  these 
5  sites  were  identified  by  PSEG  as  candidate  sites.  While  the  PSEG  evaluation  and  ranking  of 
the  potential  sites  included  consideration  of  factors  other  than  environmental  acceptability,  the 
review  team  found  that  none  of  the  sites  that  were  eliminated  had  fewer  environmental  issues 
than  the  sites  that  were  retained,  while  all  of  the  eliminated  sites  had  notably  more  total  issues.

Review  Team  Alternative  Site  Evaluation 

In  accordance  with  Section  9.3  of  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614).  the  review  team  performed  an 
independent  comparison  of  the  proposed  and  alternative  sites.  The  four  alternative  sites 
(Site  4-1,  Site  7-1,  Site  7-2,  and  Site  7-3)  are  examined  in  detail  in  Sections  9.3.2  through  9.3.5 
of  this  EIS  in  the  following  subject  areas:  land  use,  water  resources,  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
ecology,  socioeconomics  and  environmental  justice,  cultural  resources  and  historic  properties, 
air  quality,  nonradiological  health,  radiological  health,  and  postulated  accidents.  The  review 
team  visited  the  proposed  site  and  each  alternative  site  in  April  2012  (NRC  2012-TN2498:  NRC 
2012-TN2855).  Section  9.3.6,  which  summarizes  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and 
alternative  sites,  contains  a  table  with  the  review  team’s  characterization  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  site  and  at  each  of 
the  alternative  sites  (Table  9-24).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Following  the  guidance  promulgated  in  Section  9.3  of  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614),  the  review 
team  collected  and  analyzed  reconnaissance-level  information  for  each  site.  The  review  team 
then  used  the  information  provided  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  RAI  responses 
(PSEG  2012-TN21 13;  PSEG  2012-TN2214),  information  from  other  Federal  and  State 
agencies,  and  information  gathered  during  the  review  team  visits  to  each  alternative  site  to 
evaluate  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  those 
sites.  The  analysis  therefore  included  the  impacts  of  NRC-authorized  construction  and 
operation  and  potential  impacts  associated  with  other  actions  affecting  the  same  resources. 
Cumulative  impacts  occur  when  the  effects  of  an  action  are  added  to  or  interact  with  other 
effects  in  a  particular  place  and  within  a  particular  time;  as  a  result,  the  cumulative  impact 
assessment  entails  a  more  extensive  and  broader  review  of  possible  effects  of  the  action 
beyond  the  site  boundary. 

The  cumulative  analysis  for  the  impacts  at  the  alternative  sites  was  performed  in  the  same 
manner  as  discussed  in  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS  for  the  proposed  site,  except,  as  specified  in 
Section  9.3  of  the  ESRP  (NRC  2000-TN614),  a  reconnaissance-level  analysis  was  conducted 
for  the  alternative  sites.  To  inform  the  cumulative  impacts  analysis,  PSEG  conducted  a  search 
to  identify  other  relevant  projects  in  the  vicinity  of  each  of  the  alternative  sites  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2214).  The  search  included  information  available  through  regional  economic  development 
agencies  in  the  states  of  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  New  Jersey;  EPA  databases  for  relevant 
EISs  within  the  state;  the  USACE  Philadelphia  District  website  for  recent  permit  applications; 
township  and  county  planning  websites;  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Transportation  website; 
and  the  Delaware  Department  of  Transportation  website.  Information  was  also  sought  to 
identify  projects  in  the  geographic  area  funded  by  the  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment 
Act  of  2009  (Public  Law  111-5;  26  USC  1-TN1250).  The  review  team  developed  tables  of  the 
major  projects  near  each  alternative  site  that  were  considered  relevant  in  the  analysis  of 
cumulative  impacts.  The  review  team  used  this  information  to  perform  an  independent 
evaluation  of  the  direct  and  cumulative  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  alternative  sites  to 
determine  whether  one  or  more  of  the  alternative  sites  were  environmentally  preferable  to  the 
proposed  site. 

Included  in  the  cumulative  analysis  are  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  Federal, 
non-Federal,  and  private  actions  that  could  have  meaningful  cumulative  impacts  with  the 
proposed  action.  For  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  past  is  defined  as  the  time  period  before 
receipt  of  the  ESP  application.  The  present  is  defined  as  the  time  period  from  the  receipt  of  the 
ESP  application  until  the  beginning  of  activities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  future  is  defined  as  the  beginning  of  building  activities  (construction 
and  preconstruction  activities)  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  through 
operation  and  eventual  decommissioning. 

Using  the  analyses  in  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS  as  a  guide,  the  specific  resources  and  components 
that  could  be  affected  by  the  new  incremental  effects  of  constructing  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  each  of  the  alternative  sites  and  other  actions  in  the  same  geographic  areas 
were  identified.  The  affected  environment  that  serves  as  the  baseline  for  the  cumulative 
impacts  analysis  is  described  for  each  alternative  site,  and  a  qualitative  discussion  of  the 
general  effects  of  past  actions  is  included.  The  geographic  area  over  which  past,  present,  and 
future  actions  could  reasonably  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  is  defined  and  described  in

later  sections  for  each  resource  area.  The  analysis  for  each  resource  area  at  each  alternative 
site  concludes  with  a  cumulative  impact  finding  (SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE).  For  those 
cases  in  which  the  impact  level  to  a  resource  was  greater  than  SMALL,  the  review  team  also 
discussed  whether  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  be  a  significant  contributor 
to  the  cumulative  impact.  In  the  context  of  this  evaluation,  “significant”  is  defined  as  a 
contribution  that  is  important  in  reaching  that  impact-level  determination. 

Cumulative  impacts  are  summarized  for  each  resource  area  at  each  site  in  Sections  9.3.2 
through  9.3.5.  The  level  of  detail  is  commensurate  with  the  significance  of  the  impact  for  each 
resource  area.  The  findings  for  each  resource  area  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  each  alternative  site 
then  are  compared  in  Table  9-24  in  Section  9.3.6.  The  results  of  this  comparison  are  used  in 
Section  9.3.6  to  determine  whether  any  of  the  alternative  sites  are  environmentally  preferable  to 
the  proposed  site.  If  any  alternative  site  is  determined  to  be  environmentally  preferable,  the 
review  team  would  evaluate  whether  that  specific  alternative  site  was  obviously  superior  to  the 
proposed  site. 

The  impacts  described  in  Chapter  6  of  this  EIS  (e.g.,  nuclear  fuel  cycle  and  decommissioning) 
would  not  vary  significantly  from  one  site  to  another.  This  is  true  because  all  of  the  alternative 
sites  and  the  proposed  site  are  in  low-population  areas  and  because  the  review  team  assumes 
the  same  reactor  plant  parameter  envelope  is  applicable  for  each  of  the  sites,  and,  therefore, 
the  same  fuel  cycle  technology,  transportation  methods,  and  decommissioning  methods. 
Because  of  this,  these  impacts  would  not  differentiate  between  the  sites  and  would  not  be  useful 
in  the  determination  of  whether  an  alternative  site  is  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed 
site.  For  this  reason,  these  impacts  are  not  discussed  in  the  evaluation  of  the  alternative  sites. 

Nonradiological  waste  impacts  are  described  in  Sections  4.10  and  5.10  and  were  determined  to 
be  SMALL  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  nonradiological  waste  impacts  would  not  vary  significantly 
from  one  site  to  another  because  the  types  and  quantities  of  nonradiological  and  mixed  waste 
would  be  about  the  same  at  any  of  the  alternative  sites.  For  each  alternative  site,  all  wastes 
destined  for  land-based  treatment  or  disposal  would  be  transported  off  the  site  by  licensed 
contractors  to  existing,  licensed  disposal  facilities  operating  in  compliance  with  all  applicable 
Federal,  State,  and  local  requirements,  and  all  nonradioactive  liquid  discharges  would  be 
discharged  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  an  applicable  NPDES  permit.  Also,  the  amount 
of  nonradioactive,  nonhazardous  municipal  solid  waste  to  be  generated  annually  at  the 
proposed  site  would  be  a  relatively  small  percentage  of  the  total  solid  waste  generated  within 
the  geographic  area  of  influence  of  any  of  the  alternative  sites. 

Finally,  as  stated  in  Section  7.9,  activities  at  the  proposed  site  would  generate  a  very  small 
percentage  of  the  hazardous  waste  produced  in  New  Jersey,  and  no  known  capacity  constraints 
exist  for  the  treatment  or  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes  either  within  the  State  of  New  Jersey  or 
for  the  nation  as  a  whole.  For  these  reasons,  these  impacts  are  not  discussed  separately  in  the 
evaluations  of  each  alternative  site  in  Sections  9.3.2  through  9.3.5. 

9.3.2  Site  4-1 

This  section  covers  the  review  team  evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  siting  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site  designated  as  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey, 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


located  about  80  mi  north-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  (see  Figure  9-1).  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield 
site  that  is  not  owned  by  PSEG.  The  site  is  located  about  5  mi  from  the  Delaware  River,  which 
would  be  the  source  of  cooling  water  for  new  nuclear  units  at  this  site.  The  site  has  a  total  area 
of  1 ,128  ac. 

As  indicated  by  PSEG,  the  use  of  Site  4-1  would  require  infrastructure  upgrades  and 
improvements,  as  follows  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

•  Portions  of  the  public  roads  that  currently  provide  access  to  the  site  would  need  to  be 
relocated  around  plant  facilities  and/or  improved  to  increase  their  load-carrying  capacity.  An 
estimated  total  of  3.5  mi  of  road  building  would  be  required,  and  the  ROW  width  would  be 
150  ft. 

•  A  new  rail  spur  would  be  required  to  allow  delivery  of  materials  and  equipment  to  the  site. 
PSEG  identified  a  conceptual  route  and  alignment  for  this  new  rail  spur  that  would  be  6.8  mi 
long  and  would  require  a  ROW  width  of  150  ft. 

•  A  new  water  supply  pipeline  would  need  to  be  installed  to  withdraw  water  from  the  Delaware 
River.  A  new  discharge  pipeline  would  also  need  to  be  installed  to  convey  blowdown  and 
wastewater  to  the  Delaware  River.  PSEG  assumed  that  the  two  new  pipelines  would  be 
constructed  parallel  to  each  other  and  within  the  same  100-ft-wide  ROW.  The  estimated 
length  of  the  route  is  6.6  mi. 

•  Three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines  would  need  to  be  installed  to  connect  to  the  existing 
transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  these  three  new  lines  would  be  installed 
parallel  to  one  another,  each  within  a  200-ft  ROW.  The  length  of  these  three  new  lines 
would  be  1 .1  mi. 

•  A  new  switchyard  would  be  required  at  the  connection  of  the  above  new  transmission  lines 
and  the  existing  transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  this  new  switchyard  would 
be  located  on  25  ac. 

The  following  sections  include  a  cumulative  impact  assessment  conducted  for  each  major 
resource  area.  The  assessment  considered  the  specific  resources  and  components  that  could 
be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  Site  4-1 ,  including  the  impacts  of 
NRC-authorized  construction  and  operations  and  impacts  of  preconstruction  activities.  Also 
included  in  the  assessment  are  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  Federal, 
non-Federal,  and  private  actions  in  the  same  geographical  area  that  could  have  meaningful 
cumulative  impacts  when  considered  together  with  a  new  nuclear  plant  if  such  a  plant  were  to 
be  built  and  operated  at  Site  4-1.  Other  actions  and  projects  considered  in  this  cumulative 
analysis  are  described  in  Table  9-8.

Affected  Environment 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.2,  Site  4-1  covers  1,128  ac  in  Franklin  Township,  Hunterdon 
County,  New  Jersey  (Figure  9-1).  Existing  land  use  at  Site  4-1  is  predominantly  agricultural, 
with  large  areas  planted  in  cultivated  crops.  The  State  of  New  Jersey  operates  an  agricultural 
extension  research  farm  on  part  of  Site  4-1 ,  and  much  of  the  soil  on  the  site  is  classified  as 
prime  farmland. 

Most  of  Site  4-1  is  zoned  Residential  (with  a  zoning  designation  that  specifies  3-ac  lots),  and 
there  are  about  25  single-family  houses  located  within  the  site  boundaries.  Also,  although  the 
site  is  located  5  mi  from  the  nearest  incorporated  town,  there  are  small  concentrations  of 
houses  within  1  mi  of  the  site.  There  are  no  significant  industrial  land  uses  on  Site  4-1  or  in 
close  proximity.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


According  to  the  2012  State  of  New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture  GIS  mapping  conducted 
by  PSEG,  a  total  of  270.8  ac  within  the  Site  4-1  boundaries  (24.0  percent  of  the  total  1 , 1 28  ac) 
are  designated  County  Preserved  Farmlands  under  the  State  Farmland  Preservation  Program 
(Figure  9-2)  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  The  GIS  mapping  indicates  that  there  are  two  County 
Preserved  Farmland  parcels  within  Site  4-1.  One  (148.9  ac)  is  located  at  the  southwest  corner 
of  the  site,  and  the  other  (121 .9  ac)  is  located  at  the  southeast  corner  of  the  site.  However, 
PSEG  has  reviewed  public  records  for  Hunterdon  County  and  could  not  locate  any  formal  deed 
restrictions  or  evidence  of  County  Preserved  Farmland  status  for  either  parcel.  Therefore, 
PSEG  could  not  confirm  the  status  of  the  County  Preserved  Farmland  identified  in  the  2012 
New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture  GIS  mapping  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

One  70-ac  parcel  within  the  Site  4-1  boundaries  (6.0  percent  of  the  total  1 , 1 28  ac)  is  owned  by 
the  New  Jersey  Audubon  Society  and  preserved  as  open  space  under  a  Deed  of  Conservation 
Restriction  (DCR)  (Figure  9-3)  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

The  offsite  corridors  for  the  access  roads,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  to  Site  4-1 ,  as  well  as 
the  short  connector  transmission  line  from  Site  4-1  to  the  grid,  would  be  largely  confined  to  the 
immediate  site  vicinity.  Land  uses  within  these  corridors  would  be  similar  to  the  site  itself,  with 
most  of  the  land  in  agricultural  use  and  residences  scattered  throughout  the  area.  There  are  no 
significant  industrial  land  uses  within  the  offsite  corridors  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Building  Impacts 

According  to  PSEG,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  directly  disturb 
(temporarily  and  permanently)  a  total  of  401  ac  on  the  site.  The  plant  footprint  would  disturb 
about  323  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  6.9  ac  of  developed  land,  47  ac  of  barren  land,  12  ac  of 
forest  land,  and  2  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland.  The  remaining  land  within  the  Site 
4-1  boundaries  (727  ac)  would  not  be  directly  disturbed,  but  access  to  this  land  would  be 
controlled,  and  it  would  be  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In 
addition,  developing  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for  Site  4-1  would 
disturb  268  ac  off  the  site.  Therefore,  a  total  of  1,396  ac,  not  including  transmission  line 
corridors,  would  be  disturbed  or  made  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSEG  has  stated  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  could  tie  into  the  new 
Susquehanna-Roseland  Electric  Reliability  Project  (SRERP)  transmission  lines  that  have  been 
constructed  in  northern  New  Jersey,  thereby  negating  the  need  for  an  additional  stability  line  for 
Site  4-1  (PSEG  2012-TN21 13).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  a  connector 
transmission  line  from  Site  4-1  to  the  SRERP  lines.  This  1.1-mi  connector  transmission  line 
corridor  would  disturb  a  total  of  1 00  ac  off  the  site.  The  tie-in  to  the  SRERP  would  disturb  about 
79  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  less  than  1  ac  of  developed  land,  about  3  ac  of  barren  land, 

1 6  ac  of  forest,  and  0.4  ac  of  other  wetland  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Site  4-1  is  predominantly  zoned  Residential,  and  the  definitions  for  this  zoning  classification 
indicate  that  “power  generation  is  not  an  allowable  use"  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  Therefore,  the 
current  zoning  designation  would  have  to  be  changed  or  a  variance  granted  before  the  site 
could  be  developed  for  a  nuclear  power  plant.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


PSEG  has  stated  that  most  of  the  25  houses  within  the  Site  4-1  boundaries  would  have  to  be 
removed  before  the  site  could  be  developed  for  a  nuclear  power  plant.  PSEG  anticipates  that 
the  offsite  corridors  could  be  developed  without  removing  existing  houses,  but  has  stated  that 
some  houses  would  be  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  various  ROW  alignments  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

If  the  two  parcels  of  County  Preserved  Farmland  within  the  Site  4-1  boundaries  are  preserved 
under  a  development  easement,  and  the  lands  were  purchased  using  State  funds,  the 
easement  would  have  to  be  removed  in  accordance  with  the  State  Agriculture  Retention  and 
Development  Act  (NJSA  4:1  C-1 1  et  seq.  -TN4309).  This  would  require  that  a  governing  body 
(municipal,  county,  State,  or  Federal  agency)  exercise  the  right  of  eminent  domain  on  the 
parcels.  Accordingly,  PSEG  would  have  to  engage  the  appropriate  governing  body  to  initiate 
condemnation  proceedings  on  its  behalf  to  remove  the  existing  easements.  The  condemnation 
process  for  an  authorized  governing  body  includes  an  analysis  of  alternatives,  a  public  hearing, 
and  a  decision  from  the  governor  of  New  Jersey  that  the  proposed  action  is  necessary  to  ensure 
public  health,  safety,  and  welfare  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

According  to  PSEG  correspondence  with  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture,  there  is  no 
requirement  that  replacement  land  be  acquired  as  part  of  the  process  to  offset  the  loss  of 
preserved  farmland.  However,  PSEG  would  have  to  provide  a  payment  equal  to  the  value  of 
the  development  easement,  as  determined  by  the  State  House  Commission,  as  part  of  the 
process  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

The  70-ac  parcel  owned  by  the  New  Jersey  Audubon  Society  and  preserved  as  open  space 
under  a  DCR  (Figure  9-3)  was  purchased  using  funds  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey  Green 
Acres  Program,  so  removing  the  DCR  would  be  guided  by  the  State  process,  described  in 
Section  4.1.2.  However,  PSEG  has  not  identified  compensatory  land  for  removing  the  DCR 
from  the  New  Jersey  Audubon  Society  land  within  Site  4-1. 

Site  4-1  has  an  existing  site  elevation  between  540  and  640  ft  above  mean  sea  level  (MSL). 
PSEG  considers  the  site  to  be  a  bedrock  site  with  rock  at  an  estimated  depth  of  20  ft,  so  some 
rock  excavation  would  be  required  for  the  power  block  structures.  Because  the  existing  Site  4-1 
elevation  would  provide  adequate  final  grade  elevation  to  preclude  flooding,  PSEG  has  stated 
that  no  additional  fill  above  existing  grade  elevation  would  be  required.  PSEG  estimates  that 
the  total  fill  quantity  for  Site  4-1  would  be  1 .5  million  yd3,  with  0.5  million  yd3  of  Category  1  fill 
and  1 .0  million  yd3  of  Category  2  fill.  PSEG  has  stated  that  the  fill  material  for  Site  4-1  could 
come  from  the  same  sources  as  the  fill  material  for  the  PSEG  Site  (i.e.,  existing  permitted 
borrow  sites  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Maryland).  However,  PSEG  would  likely  conduct 
a  new  search  for  fill  material  sources  if  Site  4-1  were  developed  and  would  conduct  testing  to 
determine  whether  the  material  excavated  from  Site  4-1  could  be  reused  as  fill  at  the  site 
(PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  4-1  would  be 
sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the 
site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Building  a  new  plant  would  directly  disturb  401  ac  of  land  and  eliminate 
access  to  and  use  of  another  727  ac  of  land  that  currently  supports  productive  agricultural  and 
rural  residential  uses.  Building  the  new  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Site  4-1  would  disturb  an  additional  268  ac  of  similar  land  uses  off  the  site.  Further,  developing 
the  new  connector  transmission  corridor  from  Site  4-1  to  the  SRERP  lines  would  disturb  an 
additional  100  ac  of  similar  offsite  land  uses.  There  are  about  43,671  ac  of  planted/cultivated 
land  and  6.535  ac  of  developed  land  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In 
comparison  to  the  vicinity,  the  conversion  of  land  use  from  agricultural  and  rural  residential  to 
heavy  industrial  and  transmission  corridor  would  not  noticeably  alter  existing  land  use  in  the 
surrounding  area.  However,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  4-1  would  require  that 
most  of  the  25  houses  within  the  site  boundaries  be  removed  and  that  any  residents  be 
relocated;  that  70  ac  of  land  owned  by  the  New  Jersey  Audubon  Society  and  preserved  as  open 
space  under  a  DCR  be  developed;  and,  potentially,  that  270.8  ac  of  County  Preserved 
Farmlands  be  developed. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  on  and  off  the  site  for  Site  4-1  would  be  noticeable.  The  review  team  reaches  this 
conclusion  because  the  conversion  of  rural  residential  land  uses  to  heavy  industrial  and 
transmission  corridor  use  and  the  relocation  of  25  residences  would  be  sufficient  to  alter 
noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the  site  and  in  the 
vicinity. 

Operational  Impacts 

The  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  smaller  than 
the  impacts  of  building  the  plant,  but  they  would  still  permanently  eliminate  almost  all  access  to 
and  use  of  1 ,396  ac  of  land  on  Site  4-1  that  supports  productive  agricultural  and  rural  residential 
uses.  Most  of  these  impacts  would  occur  during  the  building  phase  at  Site  4-1 ,  and  no 
additional  impacts  from  operation  would  be  expected.  Additionally,  there  are  sufficient 
agricultural  and  residential  land-use  resources  in  the  vicinity,  and  the  impacts  would  be  minimal. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team's  independent 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  negligible. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  consideration  of  cumulative  land-use  impacts  at  Site  4-1 
includes  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey  (in  which  Site  4-1  is  located)  and  the  other  counties  in 
New  Jersey,  New  York,  and  Pennsylvania  within  the  50-mi  region  around  Site  4-1.  The  direct 
and  indirect  impacts  to  land  use  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 
would  be  confined  to  Hunterdon  County,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  when  combined 
with  other  actions  (discussed  below)  could  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey,  New  York, 
and  Pennsylvania. 

Table  9-8  lists  projects  that,  in  combination  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  4-1 ,  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  in  the  region.  Most  of  the  other  projects 
listed  in  Table  9-8  are  not  expected  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  in  the 
50-mi  region  when  combined  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1.  The  energy  projects 
listed  in  Table  9-8  are  all  located  too  far  from  Site  4-1  and  from  each  other  to  create  noticeable 


November  2015

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.  However,  the  SRERP,  the  Northeast  Supply  Link 
Project  (NSLP),  and  the  North  Central  Reliability  Project  energy  infrastructure  projects  would 
contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1 .  The 
NSLP  could  add  an  additional  12  mi  of  42-in.  pipeline  in  Hunterdon  County  to  support  natural- 
gas  supplies  (EPA  2012-TN3125).  The  SRERP  added  an  additional  45  mi  of  transmission  lines 
in  the  area,  and  the  North  Central  Reliability  Project  added  an  additional  35  mi  of  transmission 
lines.  Both  the  North  Central  Reliability  Project  and  the  SRERP  were  expected  to  use  existing 
ROWs  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  thereby  further  minimizing  potential  land-use  impacts 
(PSEG  2013-TN2618;  PSEG  2013-TN2617).  The  SRERP  transmission  lines  could  be  used  as 
tie-ins  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1.  The  National  Park  Service  NEPA 
documentation  for  the  SRERP  line  ROW  concludes  that  the  proposed  ROW  “would  not  greatly 
change  existing  land  use  itself,  nor  land  use  plans,”  and  dismisses  the  topic  of  land  use  from 
further  detailed  analysis  (NPS  2012-TN2676).  Individually,  these  projects  would  not  be 
expected  to  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  land-use  resources.  However,  the  cumulative  land-use 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1  with  building  and  operating  the  NSLP, 
North  Central  Reliability  Project,  and  SRERP  would  be  noticeable  in  the  context  of  total  land  use 
within  the  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  and  the  50-mi  region. 

Likewise,  the  transportation  project  listed  in  Table  9-8  (Route  31)  is  not  close  to  Site  4-1  and  is  a 
relatively  minor,  short-term  project  that  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  cumulative  land-use 
impacts  at  the  regional  scale.  The  parks  and  recreation  activities  listed  (Horseshoe  Bend  Park; 
Voorhees  State  Park;  Round  Valley  Recreation  Area;  and  other  existing  parks,  forests,  and 
reserves  in  the  50-mi  region)  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  adverse  land-use  impacts, 
especially  on  the  regional  scale. 

The  report  Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472), 
prepared  for  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  (GCRP),  summarizes  the  projected 
impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report  divides  the  United  States 
into  nine  regions,  and  Site  4-1  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  report  indicates  that 
climate  change  could  increase  precipitation,  sea  level,  and  storm  surges  in  the  Northeast 
region,  thus  changing  land  use  through  the  inundation  of  low-lying  areas  that  are  not  buffered  by 
high  cliffs.  However,  cliffs  could  experience  increased  rates  of  erosion  as  a  result  of  frequent 
storm  surges,  flooding  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  Forest  growth  could  increase  as  a  result  of 
more  CO2  in  the  atmosphere.  Existing  parks,  reserves,  and  managed  areas  would  help 
preserve  wetlands  and  forested  areas  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not  affected  by  the  same 
factors.  In  addition,  climate  change  could  reduce  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity,  which 
might  change  portions  of  agricultural  land  uses  in  the  region  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Thus, 
direct  changes  resulting  from  climate  change  could  cause  a  shift  in  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region 
that  would  contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  on  Site  4-1. 

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 
(along  with  the  new  connector  transmission  lines  to  the  SRERP  lines)  would  be  sufficient  to  alter 
noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of 
the  site  and  the  larger  50-mi  region.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG 
and  the  review  team  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  land-

use  impacts  of  developing  Site  4-1  would  be  MODERATE.  The  incremental  contribution  of 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  a  significant  contributor 
to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 2. 2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

This  section  describes  the  review  team's  assessment  of  impacts  on  water  use  and  quality 
associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1.  The  analysis  also 
considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
actions  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  that  could  affect 
water  use  and  quality.  Site  4-1  hydrology,  water  use,  and  water  quality  are  discussed  in  the  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site  4-1  is  a  1,128-ac  greenfield  site  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey,  located  about  5  mi  east 
of  the  Delaware  River  at  about  River  Mile  (RM)  1 64.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  the 
surface-water  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  which  would  be  affected  by 
water  withdrawn  from  and  wastewater  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River.  In  2008,  the  Delaware 
River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  permanently  designated  the  Delaware  River  between 
Delaware  RM  209.5  and  RM  134.4  as  Special  Protection  Waters  with  a  classification  of 
Significant  Resource  Waters  (DRBC  2008-TN3210).  The  designation  brought  this  reach  of  the 
river  under  the  DRBC's  anti-degradation  regulations  and  established  numeric  standards  for 
water  quality.  Intake  and  discharge  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  located 
within  the  designated  reach  and  would  be  subject  to  the  Special  Protection  Waters  regulations. 
For  groundwater,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  contains  the  potentially  impacted  aquifers 
which,  for  reasons  described  below,  are  likely  limited  to  those  within  a  few  miles  of  the  site. 

DRBC  regulates  discharges  in  excess  of  10,000  gpd  and  withdrawals  in  excess  of  100,000  gpd 
and  provides  some  information  on  permitted  projects  (DRBC  2014-TN3212)  but  does  not 
provide  sensitive  information  such  as  the  location  of  public  water  supplies.  Available  docket 
information  from  DRBC  (DRBC  2014-TN3212)  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1  includes  the  presence  of 
wastewater  treatment  plant  discharges  at  Delaware  RM  164  and  167  and  public  water  supply 
intakes  at  RM  1 54  and  1 57.  The  presence  of  two  public  water  supplies  derived  from 
groundwater  wells  is  also  included  in  this  information.  In  addition,  two  groundwater  withdrawal 
projects  are  described,  one  supplying  160  gpm  from  four  wells  and  one  supplying  227  gpm  from 
nine  wells.  The  New  Jersey  Geological  Survey  (NJGS)  (NJGS  2014-TN3220)  identifies  about 
80  Mgd  of  surface-water  withdrawals  for  public  water  supply  in  the  Lockatong  Creek  watershed. 
From  this  information,  the  review  team  concludes  that  groundwater  and  surface  water  are  used 
extensively  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1 . 

PSEG  stated  in  its  ER  that  the  Delaware  River  would  be  the  primary  source  of  water 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  in  the  Site  4-1  area  contains  freshwater.  Because 
of  freshwater  use,  the  cooling  towers  would  be  able  to  operate  at  three  cycles  of  concentration 
or  more  at  Site  4-1.  As  stated  in  Section  9.3.2  of  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  the  total  water 
withdrawal  for  this  site  would  be  40,300  gpm  (89.8  cfs).  The  consumptive  water  use,  however, 
would  remain  the  same  as  for  the  other  sites,  including  the  PSEG  Site,  at  26,420  gpm 
(58.9  cfs).

The  nearest  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  gage  to  Site  4-1  is  01457500,  “Delaware  River  at 
Riegelsville  NJ,”  located  at  Delaware  RM  174.8,  about  1 1  mi  upstream  from  the  Site  4-1  water 
intake  location.  The  available  record  for  this  gage  is  from  1906-1971  and  2002-2012.  Table  9-9 
lists  representative  historical  flow  values  as  reported  by  USGS  (2014-TN3229).  The  mean 
annual  river  flow  at  this  gage  is  9,693  cfs  (4.351  *  1 06  gpm)  and  the  7-day,  1 0-year  low  flow 
(7Q1 0)  is  1 ,661  cfs  (7.455*  1 05  gpm).  Because  the  gaging  station  is  located  upstream  of  the  Site 
4-1  water  intake  location,  the  actual  river  flow  in  the  site  area  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  that 
at  the  gaging  station.  The  7Q10  is  a  typical  measure  of  low  flow  and  is  defined  as  the  lowest 
average  flow  during  a  7-consecutive-day  period,  with  a  probability  of  occurrence  of  once  in 
10  years.  Table  9-9  also  includes  the  assessed  impact  levels.  Because  withdrawal  of  surface 
water  to  meet  the  consumptive  needs  of  a  new  plant  would  reduce  river  flow  by  less  than 
5  percent  of  the  mean  annual  flow,  the  associated  water-use  impact  is  assessed  to  be  minor.

ER  Section  9.3.2. 1 .3  states  that  groundwater  use  at  Site  4-1  would  not  be  mandatory  but  that 
available  information  indicates  that  one  or  two  wells  at  the  site  could  supply  the  groundwater 
needs  identified  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (210  gpm  average,  953  gpm 
maximum)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Site  4-1  lies  in  the  Newark  Basin  of  the  Piedmont 
Physiographic  Province  (Trapp  and  Horn  1997-TN1865).  Newark  Basin  aquifers  in  the  area  of 
Site  4-1  primarily  consist  of  sandstone,  siltstone,  shale,  and  some  conglomerate  rocks  of  the 
Passaic  Formation  (part  of  the  Brunswick  Group),  the  Lockatong  Formation,  and  the  Stockton 
Formation  (Herman  et  al.  1998-TN3217;  Serfes  1994-TN3216).  According  to  Trapp  and  Horn 
(1997-TN1865),  the  Lockatong  Formation  is  the  least  productive  of  these  formations.  Four 
USGS  observation  wells  in  the  Site  4-1  area  access  aquifers  in  the  Passaic  and  Stockton 
Formations  and  are  finished  at  depths  of  21  to  299  ft  below  ground  surface  (USGS  2014- 
TN3230).  Water  movement  in  the  Newark  Basin  occurs  primarily  along  joints,  fractures,  and 
bedding  planes,  with  limited  flow  across  the  confining  units  located  between  the  individual 
aquifers  (Trapp  and  Horn  1997-TN1865).  Water  supply  wells  are  generally  long,  uncased 
boreholes  that  access  multiple,  relatively  thin  conductive  zones  separated  by  thicker  beds  of 
low-permeability  rock  (Trapp  and  Horn  1997-TN1865).  Drawdown  patterns  and  groundwater 
flow  paths  are  dependent  on  the  orientation  of  the  rock  beds  and  the  occurrence  of  fractures 
and  joints  (Barton  et  al.  2003-TN3225;  Michalski  1990-TN3215).  Herman  et  al.  (1998-TN3217) 
indicate  that  median  well  yields  in  the  Brunswick  Group  and  Stockton  Formation  aquifers  are 
100-250  gpm,  although  Trapp  and  Horn  (1997-TN1865)  describe  typical  yields  of  about  80  gpm 
from  large-diameter  wells  completed  in  massive  sandstones  and  conglomerates.  Site  4-1  is  not 
located  above  a  sole-source  aquifer,  being  to  the  east  of  the  northwest  New  Jersey  Fifteen 
Basin  Sole-Source  Aquifer  (EPA  2010-TN3213). 

Considering  the  relative  difficulty  of  obtaining  a  sufficient  groundwater  supply,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  use  of  Delaware  River  water  to  supply  a  new  plant’s  freshwater  needs  would  be

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


likely  at  Site  4-1.  The  average  use  of  groundwater  at  the  PSEG  Site,  210  gpm  (0.47  cfs).  would 
be  less  than  1  percent  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant's  consumptive  use.  This  small  amount  of 
water  would  have  a  negligible  effect  on  the  impacts  resulting  from  the  use  of  Delaware  River 
water  to  support  plant  operations. 

Building  Impacts 

Impacts  to  surface  waters  from  building  activities  at  Site  4-1  may  occur  from  site-preparation 
and  plant  building  activities.  A  barge  docking  facility  would  not  be  constructed  in  the  Site  4-1 
area.  The  offsite  building  activities  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  include 
relocation  of  existing  public  roads  around  plant  facilities,  improvements  to  existing  roads  for 
plant-related  traffic,  building  a  new  rail  spur,  installation  of  new  makeup  water  and  wastewater 
discharge  pipelines,  and  building  three  new  transmission  lines. 

PSEG  proposes  in  ER  Section  9.3.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  to  use  surface  water  withdrawn  from 
the  Delaware  River  or  groundwater  to  support  building  activities.  The  anticipated  water  use 
during  building  activities  would  be  significantly  less  than  that  during  the  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant.  During  building  activities,  as  estimated  by  PSEG  in  ER  Section  4.2 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  water  use  to  support  concrete  plant  operations,  dust  suppression,  and 
potable  water  would  be  1 1 9  gpm.  Assuming  use  of  surface  water  for  building  activities, 
compared  to  the  flow  data  in  Table  9-9,  the  withdrawal  rate  of  1 19  gpm  (0.27  cfs)  during  building 
activities  would  be  quite  insignificant  (less  than  0.5  percent  of  consumptive  use).  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  impact  on  the  surface-water  resource  from  water  use  for 
building  activities  at  Site  4-1  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  water-quality-related  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  expected  for  any  other 
large  project.  Alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  would  occur  during  installation  of  the  makeup 
water  intake  structure  and  the  wastewater  discharge  structure.  During  installation  of  these 
structures,  some  additional  turbidity  in  the  river  is  expected  because  of  disturbance  of  bottom 
sediments.  However,  these  sediments  would  be  localized  to  the  area  needed  to  install  the 
structures,  and  engineering  measures  would  be  in  place  as  part  of  BMPs  to  minimize  movement 
of  the  disturbed  sediment  beyond  the  immediate  work  area.  These  impacts  would  also  be 
temporary  and  not  occur  after  the  structures  were  installed.  Because  these  activities  would 
occur  in  waters  of  the  United  States,  appropriate  permits  from  the  USACE  and  the  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  would  be  required.  PSEG  would  be  required 
to  implement  BMPs  to  control  erosion  and  sedimentation  and  discharge  of  building-related 
pollutants  to  the  Delaware  River  or  nearby  water  bodies.  Because  the  effects  from  building- 
related  activities  would  be  minimized  using  BMPs,  would  be  temporary  and  localized,  and  would 
be  controlled  under  various  permits,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impact  from  building- 
related  activities  on  the  water  quality  of  the  Delaware  River  and  nearby  water  bodies  would  be 
minor. 

PSEG  indicated  in  its  ER  that  groundwater  withdrawal  would  not  be  mandatory  to  support 
building  activities  at  Site  4-1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  As  stated  above,  the  availability  of 
Delaware  River  water  for  freshwater  plant  needs  and  the  relative  difficulty  of  obtaining  a  sufficient 
groundwater  supply  leads  the  review  team  to  conclude  that  groundwater  would  not  be  used  for 
building.  Therefore  the  impact  to  groundwater  due  to  building-related  use  would  be  minor.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


It  must  be  assumed,  however,  that  temporary  dewatering  would  be  needed  to  build  the  power 
block,  similar  to  the  PSEG  Site.  There  are  significant  differences  between  the  aquifers  at 
Site  4-1  and  the  PSEG  Site  that  affect  the  impact  of  dewatering.  The  Newark  Basin  aquifers  in 
the  Site  4-1  region  consist  of  fractured,  consolidated  rocks  with  water  flow  occurring  primarily 
along  fractures,  joints,  and  bedding  planes.  In  addition,  Newark  Basin  surficial  aquifers  in  the 
Site  4-1  region  may  be  used  as  the  primary  drinking  water  supply,  unlike  at  the  PSEG  Site 
where  the  drinking  water  aquifers  are  much  deeper  and  separated  from  the  surficial  units  by 
intervening  confining  units. 

Dewatering  flow  rates  for  the  site  excavation  cannot  be  estimated  without  characterization  of 
Site  4-1 .  However,  water  storage  is  primarily  within  the  rock  fractures  and  joints,  thus  limiting 
the  amount  of  water  likely  to  infiltrate  the  excavation.  Barton  et  al.  (2003-TN3225)  state  that  the 
effective  porosity  of  the  Brunswick  and  Lockatong  Formations  is  likely  not  to  exceed 
0.7  percent.  Carleton  et  al.  (1999-TN3224)  estimated  effective  porosities  of  about  0.1  percent 
for  the  Passaic  Formation  at  a  site  near  Hopewell,  New  Jersey,  in  Mercer  County.  Because  of 
the  presence  of  fractured  rock  at  Site  4-1 ,  with  these  low  effective  porosities,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  infiltration  to  the  excavation  would  be  limited  and  could  likely  be  controlled  by 
engineering  methods,  such  as  grouting  the  fractures  and  using  a  sump  to  remove  residual 
infiltrated  water.  Discharge  of  infiltrated  water  would  be  managed  using  BMPs  according  to 
NJDEP  requirements.  The  impacts  of  dewatering  under  these  conditions  would  be  minor. 

Impacts  to  groundwater  quality  from  building  activities  could  occur  from  inadvertent  spills  of 
pollutants  such  as  fuel  or  oil  that  might  infiltrate  into  the  subsurface.  BMPs  would  be  used  to 
minimize  potential  discharges  to  the  environment.  In  addition,  NJDEP  requires  reporting  and 
remediation  of  any  chemical  spills.  Monitoring  and  remediating  spills  at  Site  4-1  may  be  more 
difficult  than  at  the  PSEG  Site  due  to  the  presence  of  fractured  rock  at  Site  4-1  and  the  potential 
use  of  the  uppermost  aquifer  as  a  source  of  drinking  water.  Based  on  the  use  of  BMPs  and 
NJDEP  remediation  requirements,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  effect  on  groundwater 
quality  of  inadvertent  chemical  spills  would  be  localized,  temporary,  and  minor. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 ,  surface  water  withdrawn  from  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  used  to  provide  makeup  water  to  the  plant  circulating  water  system 
(CWS).  The  blowdown  from  the  plant  and  other  wastewater  streams  would  be  discharged  to 
the  Delaware  River.  PSEG  has  stated  that  DRBC  has  indicated  that  Site  4-1  is  not  located  in 
any  declared  critical  areas  for  water  use  and  that  there  are  no  unconditional  restrictions  to 
obtaining  the  water  allocation  needed  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (PSEG  201 2-TN21 1 3). 
PSEG  has  also  stated  that  water  allocations  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  are  not  made  based 
on  prior  water  rights  but  are  based  on  equitable  apportionment  under  which  PSEG  would  have 
to  demonstrate  that  the  withdrawal  would  not  result  in  adverse  impact  to  the  resource  or  to 
nearby  users  (PSEG  2012-TN21 13).  The  review  team’s  independent  assessment  of  the  DRBC 
rules  related  to  water  allocation  in  the  basin  confirmed  that  there  were  no  restrictions  on  a 
possible  allocation  of  new  withdrawals  from  the  Delaware  River  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  4-1.

As  discussed  above,  because  the  Delaware  River  water  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  is  fresh,  the 
CWS  cooling  towers  would  operate  at  three  cycles  of  concentration  rather  than  the  one  and  a- 
half  cycles  of  concentration  appropriate  for  the  brackish  water  that  would  be  used  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  Assuming  that  the  210  gpm  of  average  groundwater  use  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
satisfied  at  Site  4-1  by  withdrawals  from  the  Delaware  River,  the  required  freshwater  withdrawal 
for  Site  4-1  would  be  40,51 0  gpm  (90.3  cfs),  40.300  gpm  for  the  CWS  and  210  gpm  for  other 
plant  needs.  Assuming  that  the  210  gpm  for  non-CWS  needs  would  be  entirely  consumed,  the 
consumptive  use  at  Site  4-1  would  be  26.630  gpm  (59.3  cfs),  26.420  gpm  for  the  CWS  and 
210  gpm  for  other  plant  needs.  Because  the  water  withdrawn  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  4-1  would  be  freshwater,  the  amount  PSEG  would  need  to  offset  to  meet  instream  flow 
targets  under  a  DRBC-declared  drought  would  be  the  same  as  the  total  consumptive  use: 
26,630  gpm  (59.3  cfs). 

Because  brackish  water  consumptive  use  has  a  lesser  impact  on  salinity  intrusion  than  an  equal 
consumptive  use  of  freshwater,  the  DRBC  has  developed  an  equivalent  impact  factor  (EIF)  to 
account  for  the  difference  (DRBC  2005-TN3376).  The  EIF  for  the  PSEG  Site  was  determined  to 
be  0.18  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  discussed  in  Section  5. 2. 2.1,  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
were  built  at  the  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  estimated  that  during  a  declared  drought  its  currently 
permitted  allocation  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  of  6.695  ac-ft  would  fall  short  by  465  ac-ft 
(6.9  percent)  of  the  volume  required  to  support  the  operations  of  all  PSEG-owned  power  plants, 
including  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Because  the  Delaware  River  water  in  the  vicinity  of 
Site  4-1  is  fresh  and  not  brackish,  the  review  team  applied  the  0.18  EIF  to  estimate  the  shortfall 
in  the  PSEG  Merrill  Creek  allocation  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  were  built  and  operated  at 
Site  4-1.  The  review  team  determined  that  the  shortfall  would  increase  from  465  ac-ft  to  more 
than  2,583  ac-ft  (465  ac-ft  divided  by  0.18).  (The  actual  shortfall  would  be  slightly  more  than 
this  because  this  calculation  does  not  include  the  210  gpm  used  for  non-CWS  plant  operations.) 
This  shortfall  would  be  at  least  39  percent  of  the  current  PSEG  Merrill  Creek  allocation. 

Consumptive  use  of  Delaware  River  water  at  Site  4-1  to  support  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  would  be  about  3.5  percent  of  the  7Q10,  as  presented  in  Table  9-9.  The  review 
team  determined  that  although  this  withdrawal  from  the  Delaware  River  near  Site  4-1  would 
have  a  minimal  impact,  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  require  PSEG  to 
obtain  an  additional  39  percent  of  its  current  allocation  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  to  meet 
instream  flow  targets  if  PSEG  continued  operations  at  all  its  power  plants  during  a  DRBC- 
declared  drought.  This  additional  allocation  would  have  to  be  acquired  from  existing  owners  of 
Merrill  Creek  reservoir's  storage  or  by  significantly  revising  consumptive  use  allocations  among 
other  PSEG  plants.  The  review  team  determined  that  PSEG  acquisition  of  an  additional 
39  percent  of  its  current  allocation  in  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  would  likely  result  in  a  noticeable 
impact  to  existing  water  allocations  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin. 

The  review  team  agrees  with  the  PSEG  evaluation  that  use  of  groundwater  to  support  plant 
operations  is  unlikely,  considering  the  relatively  close  proximity  of  the  Delaware  River  (5  mi)  and 
the  widespread  use  of  the  Newark  Basin  aquifers  for  public  and  private  water  supplies. 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  discharge  its  wastewater  effluent  to  the  Delaware 
River.  PSEG  did  not  provide  an  analysis  of  the  effects  of  this  discharge  on  the  Delaware  River. 
The  review  team  assumed  that  the  water-quality  parameters  of  the  discharge  would  be  similar 


November  2015 


9-71 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


to  those  estimated  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  the  Delaware  River  is  not  affected  by  tidal 
action  near  Site  4-1 ,  the  discharged  effluent  would  spread  downstream  from  the  discharge 
point.  If  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  were  built  and  operated  at  Site  4-1 ,  PSEG  would  have  to 
provide  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  effects  of  the  effluent  discharge  to  NJDEP  and  DRBC. 
Discharges  from  a  new  plant  would  be  permitted  under  a  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge 
Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  permit,  which  would  set  limits  on  effluent  concentrations  that 
would  be  protective  of  the  environment.  This  discharge  permitting  process  is  similar  to  what 
would  be  needed  at  any  industrial  facility,  including  the  discharge  permitting  process  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  Discharges  at  Site  4-1  would  also  be  subject  to  DRBC  regulations  governing 
discharges  to  Special  Protection  Waters.  The  review  team  concludes,  based  on  the  history  of 
the  NJPDES  permitting  process,  that  the  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  from  operations  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  could  be  limited  in  magnitude  and  extent  and  would  be 
minor. 

Groundwater  quality  could  be  impacted  by  nonroutine  chemical  spills  that  may  migrate  to 
shallow  groundwater.  BMPs  would  be  used  during  operations  to  minimize  potential  impacts  of 
chemical  spills  on  groundwater  quality.  If  a  spill  occurs,  NJDEP  requires  reporting  and 
remediation  to  minimize  or  prevent  groundwater  impacts.  Monitoring  and  remediating  spills  at 
Site  4-1  may  be  more  difficult  than  at  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  presence  of  fractured  rock 
at  Site  4-1  and  the  potential  use  of  the  uppermost  aquifer  as  a  source  of  drinking  water. 
Considering  these  factors,  the  review  team  concludes  the  impacts  to  groundwater  quality  would 
range  from  minor  to  noticeable. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

In  addition  to  water-use  and  water-quality  impacts  from  building  and  operations  activities,  this 
cumulative  analysis  considers  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  the  same  water  resources. 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.2,  the  review  team  is  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that 
could  affect  the  water  resources  available  for  cooling  and  the  potential  impacts  of  reactor 
operations  on  water  resources  for  other  users.  Though  Site  4-1  is  not  located  in  the  same 
physiographic  province  as  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  the  potential  changes  in  climate  would 
nonetheless  be  similar  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Therefore  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
impact  of  climate  change  on  water  resources  would  be  similar  to  that  for  the  PSEG  Site. 

Cumulative  Water-Use  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  surface  water  is  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  As  stated  in 
Section  7.2. 1 . 1 ,  the  Delaware  River  Basin  has  a  long  history  of  water  use  by  the  “basin  states” 
(New  York,  New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  and  Delaware).  DRBC  is  responsible  for  protecting 
water  quality,  allocating  and  permitting  water  supply,  conserving  water  resources,  managing 
drought,  reducing  flood  losses,  and  developing  recreation  in  the  basin  (DRBC  201 3-TN2366). 
Surface  water  from  the  Delaware  River  has  been  extensively  used  in  the  past.  To  better 
manage  the  surface-water  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  the  governors  of  the  four 
basin  states  in  1999  directed  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  water  resources  plan 
(DRBC  2004-TN2278).  This  goal-based  plan  was  developed  to  manage  the  quantity  and  quality

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


of  basin  water  for  sustainable  use,  reduce  flood  losses,  improve  recreation,  and  protect  riparian 
and  aquatic  ecosystems,  among  other  goals.  Based  on  a  review  of  the  history  of  water-use  and 
water-resources  planning  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  the  review  team  determined  that  past 
and  present  use  of  the  surface  waters  in  the  basin  has  been  noticeable. 

None  of  the  specific  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  is  expected  to  result  in  significant  consumption 
of  water.  As  stated  previously,  the  water-use  impacts  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  Site  4-1  would  be  minor,  but  the  water-use  impacts  from  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1 
would  be  noticeable.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  cumulative  surface-water- 
use  impact  because  of  past  and  present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  MODERATE  and  that  the  incremental  contribution  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  to  this  impact  would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

The  primary  past  and  present  activity  potentially  affecting  groundwater  use  in  the  region  is  the 
widespread  withdrawal  of  groundwater.  Unlike  groundwater  use  in  the  New  Jersey  Coastal 
Plain  aquifer  system,  however,  the  use  of  groundwater  in  the  Newark  Basin  has  not  resulted  in 
widespread  reductions  in  groundwater  elevations  such  as  seen  in  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  2. 
This  is  likely  due  to  the  occurrence  of  groundwater  in  the  Newark  Basin  in  discrete  fracture 
zones  that  are  not  well  connected  across  large  distances  (Barton  et  al.  2003-TN3225).  Under 
these  conditions,  wells  can  be  located  to  minimize  impacts  on  other  groundwater  users  (Trapp 
and  Horn  1997-TN1865).  In  addition,  as  described  above,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  use  groundwater  to  support  either  construction  or  operation. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  cumulative  groundwater-use  impact  from  past 
and  present  actions  and  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 
would  be  SMALL. 

Cumulative  Water-Quality  Impacts 

As  stated  in  Section  7.2.2. 1,  DRBC  has  implemented  careful  planning  and  regulation  of  surface- 
water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  Although  there  have  been  improvements  in  water 
quality  (e.g.,  improved  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  because  of 
careful  planning  and  management  policies  put  in  place  by  DRBC),  the  presence  of  toxic 
compounds  leads  to  advisories  for  fish  consumption  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  The  review  team 
concluded  that  past  and  present  actions  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  have  resulted  in  noticeable 
impacts  to  water  quality,  which  has  prompted  careful  planning  and  management  of  the  quality  of 
the  river  waters.  The  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  may  result  in  alterations  to  land  surface, 
surface-water  drainage  pathways,  and  water  bodies  within  which  limited  building  activities  could 
occur.  These  projects  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation 
of  BMPs.  Because  of  the  Special  Protection  Waters  designation,  discharges  to  the  Delaware 
River  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1  are  subject  to  DRBC’s  anti-degradation  regulations.  Therefore,  the 
impacts  to  surface-water  quality  from  these  projects  are  not  expected  to  be  noticeable. 

As  stated  previously,  the  incremental  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  minor.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  impact  on  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  would  be  MODERATE,  and  that 
the  incremental  contribution  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  this  impact  would  not  be  a 
significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Past  and  present  activities  affecting  shallow  groundwater  quality  in  the  Newark  Basin  include 
urbanization,  industrial  activities,  and  agriculture  (Serfes  et  al.  2007-TN3219).  However,  there 
is  no  indication  that  the  quality  of  groundwater  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1  has  been  noticeably 
affected  by  these,  or  any  of  the  other  projects  and  activities  listed  in  Table  9-8.  In  addition,  as 
described  above,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  use  groundwater  to  support  either 
construction  or  operation.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the  cumulative 
groundwater-quality  impact  from  past  and  present  actions  and  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3. 2. 3  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources 

The  following  analysis  includes  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting 
from  building  activities  and  operations  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  4-1. 
The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
may  impact  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-8. 

Site  Description 

Site  4-1  is  located  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey.  This  is  a  flat  greenfield  site  located  about 
5  mi  east  of  the  Delaware  River,  which  would  act  as  the  primary  water  source.  The  elevations 
on  this  site  range  from  540  to  640  ft  above  MSL.  The  site  has  a  total  area  of  about  1,128  ac 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site  4-1  is  located  in  the  Southern  Highlands  Zone  of  the  Skylands  Landscape  Region.  The 
dominant  habitats  in  the  Southern  Highlands  are  agricultural  fields  and  pastures.  Highly 
fragmented  forest  habitat  exists  mainly  in  small  patches  interspersed  with  agricultural  land  and 
developed  areas.  There  are  wetlands  scattered  throughout  the  zone,  with  many  having  been 
disturbed  by  human  activity.  The  Delaware  River  floodplains  provide  important  habitat  for 
migrating  birds.  The  terrestrial  species  of  concern  in  the  Southern  Highlands  Zone  are  primarily 
found  in  wetland,  forest,  or  grassland  habitats  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  ecological  conditions  for  Site  4-1  are  similar  to  those  described  above  for  the  Southern 
Highlands.  Most  of  the  land  is  in  agriculture  and  forested  areas  consisting  mainly  of  scattered 
woodlots  and  tree-lined  stream  corridors.  The  forest  would  provide  daytime  habitat  for  large 
mammals  such  as  white-tailed  deer  ( Odocoileus  virginianus)  and  smaller  mammal  species. 
Additionally,  forest  habitat  would  provide  nesting  habitat  for  avian  species.  Wetlands  are  mainly 
present  in  isolated  low  areas,  and  some  are  farmed.  There  are  virtually  no  grasslands  in  this 
area.  Offsite  corridors  for  access  roads,  the  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  are  largely  restricted 
to  the  immediate  6-mi  vicinity,  and  the  natural  habitats  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  those 
found  on  Site  4-1  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

No  site-specific  surveys  for  threatened  and  endangered  species  were  conducted  at  Site  4-1 . 
Information  on  protected  and  rare  species  that  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1  was  obtained 
from  NJDEP  and  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  Environmental  Conservation  Online 
System  (ECOS).  The  bog  turtle  ( Clemmys  muhlenbergii)  (Federally  listed  as  threatened), 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Indiana  bat  ( Myotis  sodalis)  (Federally  listed  as  endangered),  and  northern  long-eared  bat 
( Myotis  septentrionalis)  (Federally  listed  as  threatened)  are  the  only  Federally  listed  species  that 
could  occur  in  Hunterdon  County  and  have  the  potential  to  occur  on  Site  4-1.  The  NJDEP 
endangered  and  threatened  species  list  includes  all  Federally  listed  species  as  endangered.  In 
addition,  5  State-listed  endangered  species,  9  State-listed  threatened  species,  and  60  species 
listed  by  NJDEP  as  species  of  concern  in  the  Southern  Highlands  Zone  may  occur  in  the  area  of 
Site  4-1  (FWS  2014-TN3333;  NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

A  total  of  13  listed  animal  species  and  one  listed  plant  species  have  been  recorded  within  about 
1  mi  of  Site  4-1  (Table  9-10).  Also,  the  nearby  Lockatong  Wildlife  Management  Area  (WMA) 
has  records  for  two  additional  State-listed  bird  species,  the  American  kestrel  ( Falco  sparvenius) 
and  the  grasshopper  sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389).  None  of  the 
species  recorded  was  Federally  listed  as  endangered  or  threatened.  Documentation  of  the 
actual  presence  of  any  of  these  species  on  the  site  and  along  offsite  corridors  would  require  that 
detailed  field  surveys  be  conducted.

Wildlife  Sanctuaries,  Refuges,  and  Preserves 

There  are  several  areas  that  qualify  as  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges,  and  preserves  within  the 
6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  (Figure  9-4)  that  have  the  potential  to  be  affected  by  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  (PSEG  2012-TN2389).  These  areas  include 
parks,  WMAs,  preserves,  and  greenways.  The  Southern  Highlands  have  a  limited  number  of 
publicly  available  lands  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 1 7).  A  brief  description  of  these  areas  is  given 
below. 

Delaware  and  Raritan  Canal  State  Park 


The  Delaware  and  Raritan  Canal  State  Park  is  a  6,595-ac  state  park  managed  by  the  NJDEP 
Division  of  Parks  and  Forestry  (State  Park  Service).  This  70-mi-long  park  is  one  of  central  New 
Jersey’s  most  popular  recreational  corridors  for  canoeing,  jogging,  hiking,  bicycling,  fishing,  and 
horseback  riding.  The  canal  and  the  park  are  part  of  the  National  Recreational  Trail  System. 
The  park  is  also  a  valuable  wildlife  corridor,  connecting  field  and  forest  habitat.  During  a  recent 
bird  survey  conducted  in  the  park,  160  species  were  recorded,  almost  90  of  which  nested  within 
the  park  (NJDEP  2013-TN31 18). 

Lockatonq  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Lockatong  is  a  583-ac  WMA  in  Franklin  and  Kingwood  Townships  along  Lockatong  Creek.  The 
main  habitats  on  the  site  are  deciduous  upland  forest,  deciduous  wetland  forest,  and  open  field. 
According  to  landscape  mapping  done  by  NJDEP,  the  WMA  provides  habitat  for  the  State 
threatened  American  kestrel,  savannah  sparrow  ( Passerculus  sandwichensis),  grasshopper 
sparrow,  and  bobolink  ( Dolichonyx  oryzivorus)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Hoffman  Park 


Hoffman  Park  covers  354  ac  and  contains  a  mix  of  hardwood  forest,  grasslands,  and  32  ponds 
of  various  sizes.  The  onsite  ponds  were  created  in  the  1940s  for  erosion  control,  crop  irrigation, 
and  cattle  management  at  a  time  when  the  park  was  a  working  farm.  Paved  and  gravel  paths  at 
the  park  provide  opportunities  for  bike  riding  and  walking.  The  ponds  provide  opportunities  for 
fishing  and  nature  study.  The  paths  are  also  used  for  cross-country  skiing  in  the  winter. 

Hunting  is  also  allowed  in  the  park  during  designated  seasons  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Plum  Brook  Greenwav 

This  greenway  was  partially  preserved  through  a  partnership  with  the  New  Jersey  Water  Supply 
Authority,  Hunterdon  County,  Delaware  Township,  and  the  NJDEP  Green  Acres  program.  The 
property  is  260  ac.  An  almost  half-mile  corridor  is  protected  along  Plum  Brook,  which  is  a 
tributary  to  Wickecheoke  Creek,  identified  by  NJDEP  as  a  waterway  of  the  highest  quality.  The 
greenway  consists  of  a  combination  of  riparian  woodlands  and  managed  shrubland.  Plum 
Brook  flows  into  the  Delaware  and  Raritan  Canal,  and  the  preservation  of  the  greenway  aids  in 
the  protection  of  drinking  water  quality  in  the  area  (PSEG  2012-TN2389).

South  Branch  Reservation 


The  South  Branch  Reservation  is  over  1,000  ac  in  size  and  is  located  in  Clinton,  Franklin, 
Raritan,  and  Readington  Townships.  The  reservation  aids  in  the  protection  of  the  South  Branch 
of  the  Raritan  River.  It  is  also  a  popular  fishing  spot,  and  the  river  is  stocked  with  rainbow 
(■ Oncorhynchus  mykiss),  brook  ( Salvelinus  fontinalis),  and  brown  trout  ( Salmo  trutta) 

(PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Uplands  Preserve 

This  101-ac  preserve  is  located  in  Raritan  Township.  The  preserve  contains  steep  slopes,  open 
fields,  and  hardwood  forests.  Walnut  Brook  flows  through  the  preserve,  which  was  originally  a 
farm  and  estate.  The  property  was  acquired  by  Hunterdon  County  in  1986  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2389). 

Building  Impacts 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  4-1  would  directly  disturb  about  401  ac  of  land 
(permanently  and  temporarily).  A  total  of  about  727  ac  of  land  within  the  site  boundaries  would 
not  be  directly  disturbed.  However,  certain  building  activities  would  result  in  indirect  disturbance 
(noise,  dust,  etc.)  to  much  of  the  area  within  the  site  boundaries.  This  could  result  in  additional 
wildlife  impacts  in  terms  of  affecting  movements  and  causing  further  displacement  from  the  site. 
The  development  of  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  would  result  in  the 
additional  disturbance  of  about  268  ac  of  potential  habitat.  In  total,  about  1 ,396  ac  of  potential 
habitat  would  be  directly  or  indirectly  impacted  by  building  activities  on  Site  4-1 .  The  plant 
footprint  would  disturb  about  323  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  6.9  ac  of  developed  land,  47  ac 
of  barren  land,  12  ac  of  forest  land,  and  2  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

A  new  1 . 1  -mi  transmission  line  corridor  would  be  required  to  connect  Site  4-1  to  the  SRERP 
constructed  by  PPL  and  PSEG  in  northern  New  Jersey.  This  500-kV  transmission  line  and 
associated  corridor  would  encompass  about  100  ac  of  offsite  land.  The  total  acreage  includes 
about  79  ac  of  planted/cultivate  land,  less  than  1  ac  of  developed  land,  about  3  ac  of  barren 
land,  1 6  ac  of  forest,  and  0.4  ac  of  other  wetland  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  amount  of  habitat  that  would  be  potentially  impacted  by  building  activities  on  Site  4-1  is 
minor  compared  to  the  acreage  of  similar  habitat  present  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Habitat  in  the  6-mi 
vicinity  includes  about  43,671  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  6,535  ac  of  developed  land, 

4,759  ac  of  barren  land,  35,232  ac  of  forestland,  636  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetlands, 

5,175  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  1 ,357  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  In  addition,  onsite  habitat  is  generally  limited  to  areas  that  are  relatively  small  and 
isolated  from  larger  areas  of  habitat  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Therefore,  the  impacts  on  terrestrial 
and  wetland  habitats  due  to  building  activities  are  expected  to  be  negligible. 

There  is  the  potential  for  impacts  to  open  country  bird  species  (e.g.,  bobolink,  eastern 
meadowlark  [Sturnella  magna ],  grasshopper  sparrow,  and  vesper  sparrow  [Pooecetes 
gramineus])  and  those  that  frequent  smaller  woodlots.  Fragmentation  and  loss  of  forested

areas  could  also  potentially  impact  more  area-sensitive  species  such  as  red-shouldered  hawk 
( Buteo  lineatus),  northern  long-eared  bats,  and  wood  thrush  ( Hylocichla  mustelina).  Inadvertent 
impacts  to  slower  moving  species  (e.g.,  eastern  box  turtle  [Terrapene  Carolina  Carolina ])  are 
also  a  possibility.  Such  impacts  would  be  expected  to  be  minor  for  most  species  due  to  the 
relatively  minimal  impacts  to  natural  habitats  and  the  fact  that  there  are  extensive  areas  of 
similar  habitats  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  However,  wetland  and  forested  areas  are  considered 
important  resources  for  Federally  listed  species.  The  loss  of  about  92  ac  of  wetlands  and  220 
ac  of  forest  could  affect  the  Federally  listed  bog  turtle,  Indiana  bat,  and  northern  long-eared  bat. 
Impacts  to  these  species  could  warrant  mitigation.  Therefore,  impacts  to  these  listed  species  as 
a  result  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  expected  to  be  noticeable, 
but  not  destabilizing. 

It  is  expected  that  a  project  of  this  size  would  result  in  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources,  including  habitat  loss,  fragmentation,  and  disturbance.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  result  in  the  loss  of  available  onsite  habitat.  Noise,  lights,  and  dust  during 
construction  activities  may  further  displace  species  in  adjacent  areas,  thereby  further  reducing 
viable  habitat.  Less  mobile  wildlife  species  would  likely  be  the  most  impacted  species  with  the 
development  of  a  new  plant.  It  is  expected  that  most  wildlife  species  would  be  capable  of 
moving  to  habitat  in  adjacent  areas.  These  displaced  species  may  also  experience  impacts 
resulting  from  loss  of  habitat  acreage  and  increased  competition  for  more  limited  resources. 
Adjacent  WMAs,  preserves,  and  refuges  could  be  affected  by  increased  demand  for  limited 
resources  as  a  result  of  species  displacement.  The  available  habitat  at  Site  4-1  is  common  to 
Hunterdon  County,  and  sufficient  resources  exist  in  the  Southern  Highlands.  However,  the  loss 
of  wetland  and  forest  habitat  that  is  important  to  Federally  listed  and  proposed  Federally  listed 
species  would  be  noticeable.  Thus,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be 
noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing. 

Operational  Impacts 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  that  may  result  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  include  those  associated  with  cooling  towers,  transmission 
system  structures,  maintenance  of  transmission  line  ROWs,  and  the  presence  of  project 
facilities  that  permanently  eliminate  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Operational  impacts  would 
be  similar  to  those  described  in  Section  5.3.1 ,  although  there  may  be  minor  differences  as  a 
result  of  topography,  climate,  and  elevation.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  the 
operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  at  Site  4-1  would  be  minimal. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Several  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  projects  could  affect  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  in  ways  similar  to  siting  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 .  Table  9-8  lists  these 
projects,  and  descriptions  of  their  contributions  to  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  are  provided  below. 

The  Southern  Highlands  have  seen  extensive  agricultural  development  and  much  of  the 
remaining  natural  habitat  is  highly  fragmented  and  exists  in  small  patches  surrounded  by  urban

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


development  and  agriculture.  Forested  ravines  and  floodplain  forests  exist  along  the  Delaware 
River  and  tributaries.  Scattered  emergent  wetlands  have  been  impacted  by  human  activities 
and  development  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17).  Very  little  publicly  owned  land  exists  in  this  region, 
and  the  WMAs  and  parks  listed  in  Table  9-8  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  further  adverse 
impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 

Most  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  are  operational  and  have  resulted  in  the  conversion  of 
natural  areas  to  industrial  and  commercial  development.  These  past  actions  have  resulted  in 
loss  and/or  fragmentation  of  natural  habitat  and  displacement  of  wildlife.  These  projects  include 
one  operational  nuclear  power  plant  (Limerick  Generating  Station).  Additionally,  there  are  three 
operational  fossil-fuel  facilities.  The  development  and  operation  of  these  projects  would 
continue  to  reduce,  fragment,  and  degrade  natural  forest,  open  field,  and  wetland  habitats  in  the 
Southern  Highlands.  Operational  projects  with  tall  structures,  such  as  the  cooling  towers  at 
Limerick  Generating  Station,  would  cause  avian  and  bat  mortalities.  However,  the  projects 
listed  are  spread  throughout  the  region,  and  avian  and  bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collision  with 
tall  structures  would  not  cause  a  noticeable  effect  on  avian  or  bat  populations. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor 
and  Workforce  Development  (NJLWD)  projected  that  the  population  of  Hunterdon  County  would 
increase  by  about  6.8  percent  between  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014-TN3332).  Future 
urbanization  in  the  area  of  Site  4-1  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural  lands,  wetlands, 
and  forested  areas.  Urbanization  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  would  reduce  area  in  natural 
vegetation  and  open  space  and  decrease  connectivity  between  wetlands,  forests,  and  other 
wildlife  habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result  of  urbanization  would  result  in  added  pressures 
to  the  remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife  populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that  these 
activities  would  substantially  affect  the  overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel  corridors 
near  Site  4-1  or  the  general  extent  of  forested  areas  in  the  site  vicinity. 

As  noted  in  Table  9-8,  there  are  three  energy  infrastructure  projects  planned  for  or  completed  in 
the  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  that  would  add  to  the  cumulative  impacts.  An  additional  12  mi  of  42-in. 
pipeline  in  Hunterdon  County  will  be  added  to  support  natural-gas  supplies  as  a  result  of  NSLP 
(EPA  2012-TN3125).  SRERP  added  an  additional  45  mi  of  transmission  lines  in  the  area,  and 
the  North  Central  Reliability  Project  added  an  additional  35  mi  of  transmission  lines.  These 
projects  affected  forestland,  open  areas,  and  wetland  habitats  and  caused  further  habitat 
degradation  and  fragmentation  in  the  area.  Both  the  North  Central  Reliability  Project  and 
SRERP  were  expected  to  use  existing  ROWs  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  thereby  further 
minimizing  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  (PSEG  2013-TN2618; 

PSEG  2013-TN2617).  Overall,  due  to  their  extent,  these  energy  infrastructure  projects  would 
have  the  potential  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  when  added 
together.  It  is  not  expected  that  proposed  road-widening  and  road  improvement  projects 
planned  for  the  area  would  have  significant  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 
Overall,  the  potential  for  cumulative  impacts  from  other  foreseeable  actions  altering  the 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  impact  rating  for  Site  4-1  would  be  noticeable  but  would  not 
destabilize  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  report  on  climate  change  impacts  in  the  United  States  provided  by  GCRP  (2014-TN3472) 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions.  Site  4-1  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project  temperatures  to  rise  over  the  next  several  decades 
by  4.5"F  to  10°F  if  emissions  continue  or  3°F  to  6°F  if  emissions  are  reduced  substantially. 
Frequency,  intensity,  and  duration  of  heat  waves  are  projected  to  increase  under  both  of  the 
warming  scenarios  but  with  larger  increases  under  the  continuing  emissions  scenario.  Winters 
are  projected  to  be  much  shorter,  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more  precipitation.  With  higher 
temperatures  and  earlier  winter  and  spring  snow  melt,  seasonal  drought  risk  is  projected  to 
increase  in  summer  and  fall  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Increased  frequency  of  summer  heat  stress 
can  also  impact  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity  in  the  Northeast  region.  New  Jersey  is 
projected  to  experience  60  additional  days  above  90°F  by  mid-century  under  the  continuing 
emissions  scenario.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the  global  average  due  to  land 
subsidence,  with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected 
changes  could  potentially  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations. 
Large-scale  shifts  in  the  ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  animal 
migration  that  are  already  occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue. 

The  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  4-1,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities 
described  above,  would  noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities 
would  result  in  the  loss  or  modification  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats,  which  could  potentially 
affect  important  species  that  live  in  or  migrate  through  the  area. 

Summary 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  were  evaluated  based  on  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  the  conceptual  layout  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 ,  and  an 
independent  review  by  the  review  team.  Permanent  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
and  wildlife  would  result  in  some  localized  effects  on  these  resources.  Any  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  temporarily  disturbed  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to 
return  to  preconstruction  conditions.  The  potential  loss  of  habitat  important  to  Federally  listed 
species  would  be  a  noticeable  impact,  but  would  not  be  destabilizing.  Operational  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  similar  to  those  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the 
conclusion  of  the  review  team  is  that  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  plants  and 
wildlife,  including  threatened  and  endangered  species,  and  wildlife  habitat  would  be  noticeable 
in  the  surrounding  landscape,  and  therefore  MODERATE.  Building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 2. 4  Aquatic  Resources 

The  following  analysis  evaluates  the  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  on  aquatic 
ecology  resources  at  Site  4-1.  The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past, 
present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-8,  that  could  affect  aquatic  resources.  In  developing  this  EIS,  the 
review  team  relied  on  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  the  alternative  site  evaluation 
in  accordance  with  ESRP  9.3  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Reconnaissance-level  information  is  data

that  are  readily  available  from  regulatory  or  resources  agencies  (e.g.,  NJDEP,  National  Marine 
Fisheries  Service  [NMFS],  and  FWS)  and  other  public  sources  such  as  scientific  literature, 
books,  and  Internet  websites.  It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  site  visits 
(NRC  2012-TN2498;  NRC  2012-TN2499;  NRC  2012-TN2855)  and  documents  provided  by  the 
applicant. 

Affected  Environment 

The  affected  aquatic  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  and  numerous  freshwater 
streams  on  and  near  Site  4-1 .  The  withdrawal  required  from  the  Delaware  River  for  the  water 
intake  structure  would  be  40,300  gpm  because  this  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  is  freshwater 
and  can  be  used  at  three  cycles  of  concentration  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Under  drought 
conditions,  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  39  percent  of  its  current  Merrill  Creek 
reserve  as  described  in  detail  in  Section  9. 3. 2. 2.  Reconnaissance  information  for  Hunterdon 
County,  New  Jersey,  did  not  suggest  that  any  of  the  water  resources  in  the  area  have 
exceptional  or  high  ecological  value.  In  addition,  freshwater  habitat  would  be  lost  in  the 
Delaware  River  because  of  the  installation  of  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  in  the 
vicinity  of  Delaware  RM  163.7  in  Hunterdon  County  (S&L  2010-TN2671 ).  Aquatic  resources  in 
the  Delaware  River  could  be  affected  by  operation  of  the  closed-cycle  cooling  system. 

Commercial/Recreational  Species 

There  are  no  commercial  fishery  activities  associated  with  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey, 
waters.  However,  recreational  angling  for  a  number  of  freshwater  species  occurs  in  the 
Delaware  River.  There  are  numerous  public  boat  launch  sites  along  the  nontidal  Delaware 
River.  Angling  for  stocked  Brook  Trout  ( Salvelinus  fontinalis)  and  Rainbow  Trout  ( Oncorhynchus 
mykiss)  is  popular  in  many  small  lakes  and  water  bodies  within  Hunterdon  County.  In  addition, 
fishing  in  the  Delaware  River  results  in  catches  of  Smallmouth  Bass  ( Micropterus  dolomieu), 
Yellow  Perch  ( Perea  flavescens),  Channel  Catfish  ( Ictalurus  punctatus),  Largemouth  Bass 
(M.  salmoides),  and  crappie  ( Pomoxis  spp.).  Fish  consumption  advisories  are  updated  regularly 
for  fish  caught  in  New  Jersey  tributaries  and  for  the  Delaware  River.  Hunterdon  County  had 
restrictions  on  fish  consumption  for  Channel  Catfish,  Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis),  American 
Eel  ( Anguilla  rostrata),  White  Sucker  ( Catostomus  commersonii),  Largemouth  Bass,  and 
Smallmouth  Bass  caught  in  the  Delaware  River  in  2012  (NJDEP  2013-TN2368). 

Non-Native  and  Nuisance  Species 

The  Northern  Snakehead  ( Channa  argus)  prefers  stagnant  waters  (shallow  ponds,  swamps) 
and  slow  streams  and  has  a  wide  temperature  tolerance.  Northern  Snakehead  have  been 
observed  in  tributaries  of  the  Delaware  River  beginning  in  2009  (USGS  2012-TN2201). 

Flathead  Catfish  ( Pylodictis  olivaris)  are  reported  to  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  primarily 
in  the  main  stem  of  the  Delaware  River  (NJDEP  2012-TN2185).  More  recently,  Northern 
Snakehead  are  being  reported  further  up  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries  and  are 
becoming  more  of  a  concern  for  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (DeRitis  2013-TN2854).  In 
freshwaters,  water  chestnut  ( Trapa  natans)  forms  dense  mats  that  create  difficulty  in  accessing 
water  resources  for  recreation  and  is  a  common  nuisance  species  in  New  Jersey  waters 
(NJDEP  2013-TN2367).  Chinese  pond  mussel  ( Sinanodonta  woodiana)  has  recently  been 
reported  in  Hunterdon  County  where  it  prefers  eutrophic  ponds  to  slow  running  streams  and

rivers,  and  uses  carp  species  as  a  fish  host  (NJISST  201 1-TN2679).  Recently,  an  invasive 
diatom  species,  didymo.  or  "rock  snot"  ( Didymosphenia  geminata)  has  become  more  prevalent 
in  the  Delaware  River  from  north  of  Site  4-1  south  to  Trenton,  New  Jersey.  Didymo  forms  thick 
mats  that  quickly  colonize  riverbed  habitats  and  alter  the  physical  and  biological  conditions  of  a 
stream  to  inhibit  growth  of  native  algae  and  other  beneficial  species  that  support  the  food  chain 
(DRBC  2013-TN3279). 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

There  are  no  critical  habitats  designated  by  NMFS  or  FWS  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  4-1 
(NMFS  2013-TN2614;  FWS  2013-TN2147).  Based  on  reconnaissance  information,  there  may 
be  one  Federally  listed  endangered  aquatic  species  within  a  1-mi  radius  of  the  Site  4-1  intake 
(NJDEP  2013-TN2722).  Shortnose  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  have  been  traditionally 
reported  as  far  upriver  as  Delaware  RM  147,  but  typically  overwinter  in  the  Delaware  River 
around  RM  131.6  near  T renton.  New  Jersey  (Hastings  et  al.  1 987).  However,  records  from  the 
State  of  New  Jersey  indicated  sightings  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  within  1  mi  of  the  water  intake 
location  for  Site  4-1  (RM  163.7)  (NJDEP  2013-TN2722).  There  are  several  freshwater  mussel 
species  listed  as  endangered  or  threatened  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  in  Hunterdon  County: 
they  are  included  in  Table  9-11  and  described  below.  One  State-listed  threatened  freshwater 
mussel  species,  the  yellow  lampmussel  ( Lampsilis  cariosa),  is  known  to  occur  within  a  1-mi 
radius  of  the  Site  4-1  intake  (NJDEP  2013-TN2722).  There  are  no  State-listed  occurrences  of 
aquatic  species  within  a  1-mi  radius  of  the  Site  4-1  location  (NJDEP  2013-TN3567).

Brook  Floater 

The  brook  floater  ( Alasmidonta  varicosa)  ranges  from  South  Carolina  to  the  St.  Lawrence  River 
Basin  in  Canada  and  prefers  rapids  or  riffles  over  rock  and  gravel  substrates  that  are  found  in 
small  streams  in  the  upper  Delaware  River  Basin  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2013-TN2188). 
Potential  fish  host  species  include  the  Pumpkinseed  ( Lepomis  gibbosus),  Golden  Shiner 
( Notemigonus  crysoleucas),  and  Longnose  Dace  ( Rhinichthys  cataractae).  Brook  floater  are 
reported  to  occur  in  Hunterdon  County.  New  Jersey,  and  are  listed  as  a  State  endangered 
species  (Cordeiro  and  Bowers-Altman  2003-TN2131;  NJDEP  2012-TN2186).

Tidewater  Mucket 


The  tidewater  mucket  ( Leptodea  ochracea)  is  found  in  New  Jersey  in  Delaware 
River-associated  tidewaters  in  sand  and  silt  substrates.  The  host  fish  species  may  be  the  White 
Perch  ( Morone  americana)  (Cordeiro  and  Bowers-Altman  2003-TN2131 ).  The  tidewater  mucket 
is  State-listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN2186)  and  occurs  in  Atlantic, 
Burlington,  Camden,  Cumberland,  Hunterdon,  Mercer,  and  Salem  Counties  in  New  Jersey 
(Cordeiro  and  Bowers-Altman  2003-TN2131;  NatureServe  2012-TN2182). 

Triangle  Floater 

The  triangle  floater  ( Alasmidonta  undulata )  has  been  found  in  a  variety  of  habitats  including 
silt/sand  in  slower  moving  waters,  gravel/sand  in  riffles  and  runs,  and  crevices  in  bedrock. 
Because  the  triangle  floater  is  found  in  a  variety  of  habitats,  it  is  assumed  the  fish  hosts  of  the 
triangle  floater  are  also  variable  and  diverse  (NJDEP  2013-TN2188).  The  triangle  floater  is 
listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN2186)  and  occurs  primarily  in  northern  New 
Jersey  counties  which  include  Hunterdon  County  (NatureServe  2012-TN2183). 

Yellow  Lampmussel 

Yellow  lampmussel  ( Lampsilis  cariosa)  inhabit  sand  and  silt  substrates  along  shorelines  and 
margins  in  both  large  rivers  and  small  streams.  This  species  spawns  in  the  summer  and  the 
Alewife  ( Alosa  pseudoharengus )  has  been  suggested  as  the  host  fish  for  the  yellow 
lampmussel;  however,  there  may  be  other  freshwater  hosts  (NJDEP  2013-TN2188).  The  yellow 
lampmussel  is  State-listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN2186)  and  has  been 
documented  to  occur  in  Hunterdon  County  near  the  proposed  water  intake  site  (NJDEP  2013- 
TN2722). 

Field  studies  would  be  required  to  definitively  determine  whether  any  rare  or  protected  species 
are  present  in  streams  in  the  project  area  or  nearby  Delaware  River. 

Building  Impacts 

Installation  of  the  water  intake  structure  and  the  discharge  structure  would  result  in  a  loss  of 
habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  and  temporary  degradation  of  water  quality  because  of  turbidity 
and  sedimentation.  Effects  on  aquatic  organisms  are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  temporary 
because  adjacent  habitat  is  accessible,  and  mobile  aquatic  organisms  such  as  fish  would  be 
able  to  move  away  from  the  affected  area  during  dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities. 
There  would  be  some  permanent  loss  of  onsite  aquatic  stream  habitat  from  the  building  of 
project  structures  and  in  the  installation  of  pipelines  to  and  from  the  Delaware  River  for  the 
water  intake  and  discharge  structures.  Dredging  would  disturb  about  2  ac  of  bottom  habitat  in 
the  Delaware  River  and  would  remove  about  35,000  yd3  of  dredged  material  (S&L  2010- 
TN2671).  Because  barge  access  is  not  possible  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Site  4-1,  no  barge 
facilities  would  be  developed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Building  impacts  to  streams  and  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  regulated  under  Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  and  would  be 
expected  to  be  minimized  and  mitigated  through  the  use  of  BMPs.

A  total  of  2,946  ft  of  freshwater  streams  would  be  affected  by  building  activities  on  the  site  and 
for  building  the  access  roads  and  rail  spur  and  installing  water  pipelines  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
In  addition  to  buildings  and  other  structures,  buried  water  intake  and  discharge  pipes  would  run 
6.6  mi  from  the  Delaware  River  to  the  site.  The  total  length  of  streams  that  would  be  affected  by 
building  on  Site  4-1  represents  0.1  percent  of  the  total  length  of  streams  within  6  mi  of  the  site. 

In  addition,  an  estimated  533  ft  of  streams  are  contained  in  a  new  1.1-mi-long  transmission 
corridor  and  a  switchyard  (representing  less  than  0.1  percent  of  the  total  stream  lengths  in  the 
area)  (S&L  2010-TN2671),  but  in  most  cases  impacts  to  streams  from  transmission  line 
installation  could  be  avoided  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  the  impact  on  aquatic  ecology 
of  the  Delaware  River  and  streams  on  the  site  and  in  pipeline  and  transmission  corridors  during 
building  activities  would  be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 ,  there  would  be  no  direct  discharges 
and  few  impacts  to  small  freshwater  streams  on  the  site.  Operation  of  the  cooling  and  service 
water  systems  would  require  water  to  be  withdrawn  from  and  discharged  back  to  the  Delaware 
River.  Aquatic  impacts  associated  with  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota  in  the 
Delaware  River  and  discharge  of  cooling  water  to  the  Delaware  River  could  occur.  Because  the 
specifications  associated  with  the  water  intake  structure  include  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system 
designed  to  meet  EPA  Phase  I  regulations  for  new  facilities  (66  FR  65256-TN243),  the 
maximum  through-screen  velocity  at  the  water  intake  structure  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps. 

Thus,  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  built  and  operated  at  Site  4-1 ,  the  anticipated  impacts  to 
aquatic  communities  from  impingement  and  entrainment  in  the  Delaware  River  are  expected  to 
be  minimal.  Operational  impacts  associated  with  water  quality  and  discharge  cannot  be 
determined  without  additional  detailed  analysis.  However,  based  on  the  review  team's 
experience  with  other  facilities,  the  review  team  concludes  that,  with  proper  design,  the  impacts 
on  aquatic  resources  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  minimal. 
Maintenance  activities  on  the  site  and  in  offsite  corridors  would  follow  BMPs  required  by  Federal 
and  State  permits  to  minimize  impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Consequently,  impacts  on  aquatic 
ecology  due  to  project  operations  at  Site  4-1  are  expected  to  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  aquatic  resources  is  the  Delaware  River  and  numerous 
freshwater  streams  on  and  near  Site  4-1 .  Past  alteration  and  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River, 
as  described  in  Sections  2.4.2. 1  and  7.3.2,  have  had  long-term  noticeable  and  sometimes 
destabilizing  consequences  on  the  aquatic  resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and 
continue  to  be  the  subject  of  numerous  restoration  activities  in  targeted  portions  of  the  area.  For 
assessment  of  cumulative  impacts  for  Site  4-1 ,  the  ROI  includes  a  6-mi  radius  of  water  resources 
around  the  site  and  a  6-mi  radius  around  the  point  of  the  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  on 
the  Delaware  River. 

New  transmission  lines  to  connect  to  the  SRERP  lines  in  the  region  could  affect  stream  habitat 
within  the  new  transmission  corridor  (NPS  2012-TN2676).  Corridor  development  and 
installation  of  transmission  structures  would  require  BMPs  to  protect  water  quality  and  minimize 
effects  to  aquatic  habitats  that  may  be  at  risk  from  clearing  activities,  runoff,  and  bank  erosion.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  may  result  in  alterations  to  surface-water  drainage  pathways 
and  water  bodies.  Anthropogenic  activities  such  as  residential  or  industrial  development  near 
the  vicinity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  could  present  additional  constraints  on  aquatic 
resources.  It  is  not  expected  that  these  projects  would  have  noticeable  effects  on  water  quality 
within  the  vicinity  because  these  projects  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that 
require  implementation  of  BMPs.  The  review  team  is  also  aware  of  the  potential  for  climate 
change  to  affect  aquatic  resources.  The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic 
organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to 
rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could  lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity 
of  extreme  precipitation  events,  increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average 
temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community 
composition  on  or  near  Site  4-1  through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and 
distribution.  Elevated  water  temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe  weather  phenomena  could 
adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat,  but  specific  predictions  of  aquatic  habitat 
changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change  are  inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact 
resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on  the  intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency 
of  the  aquatic  communities. 

Summary 

Impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG,  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  Properly  siting  the 
associated  transmission  line  and  switchyard;  avoiding  habitat  for  protected  species;  minimizing 
interactions  with  water  bodies  and  watercourses  along  the  corridors;  and  use  of  BMPs  during 
water  intake  and  discharge  structure  installation,  transmission  line  corridor  preparation,  and 
tower  placement  would  minimize  building  and  operation  impacts.  The  review  team  concludes 
that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  most  aquatic  resources,  including  Federally  and  State 
threatened  and  endangered  species,  in  the  region  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  4-1,  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  future  activities,  would  be 
MODERATE,  but  the  incremental  contribution  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at 
Site  4-1  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 2. 5  Socioeconomics 

The  economic  impact  areas  for  Site  4-1  are  Hunterdon  County  in  New  Jersey  and  Bucks  County 
in  Pennsylvania.  The  site  is  located  in  Hunterdon  County,  about  5  mi  east  of  the  Delaware 
River.  Hunterdon  County  is  part  of  the  Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington,  PA-NJ-DE-MD,  Metro 
Area.  The  site  is  about  50  mi  west  of  Newark,  New  Jersey,  and  about  50  mi  north  of 
Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania. 

Because  of  the  geographical  location  of  the  site,  members  of  the  workforce  at  a  new  plant  that 
would  be  drawn  from  the  region  may  live  elsewhere  within  the  metropolitan  statistical  area 
(MSA).  However,  the  review  team  expects  that  most  of  the  in-migrating  construction  and 
operations  workers  would  likely  relocate  in  the  economic  impact  area  counties.  Impacts  beyond 
these  counties  are  not  likely  to  be  significant  in  any  single  jurisdiction,  because  the  number  of 
in-migrating  workers  within  any  single  jurisdiction  outside  of  the  economic  impact  area  would  be 
minor.  Therefore,  this  analysis  focuses  on  the  economic  impact  area  counties.

Physical  and  Aesthetic  Impacts 

Physical  impacts  include  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public,  noise,  air  quality,  buildings, 
roads,  and  aesthetics.  The  physical  impacts  on  workers  would  be  similar  to  those  described  for 
the  PSEG  Site.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  the  Hope  Creek 
Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  workforces  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

About  1 00  houses  are  within  0.5  mi  of  the  site  boundary.  The  site  is  about  0.5  mi  from  an  active 
church  and  1  mi  from  an  elementary  school  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Site  4-1  would  retrieve  its 
cooling  water  from  the  Delaware  River,  requiring  6.6  mi  of  water  pipeline.  PSEG  would  also 
build  a  6.8-mi-long  rail  spur  and  require  3.5  mi  of  road  construction.  Because  the  site  is  a 
greenfield  site,  PSEG  estimates  three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines,  constructed  parallel  to 
each  other,  would  need  to  be  constructed  over  1.1  mi.  PSEG  indicates  that  the  rail  spur  would 
cross  the  New  Jersey  Highlands,  an  area  designated  by  the  State  legislature  for  special 
preservation  and  planning  (PSEG  2010-TN257;  PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Aesthetic  impacts  from 
building  and  operations  at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.1 .6  and 
5. 4. 1.6.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  HCGS  and  SGS  at  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  proximity  of  the  Delaware  River  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield 
site  that  would  have  infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed  rural  areas  and  a  rail  spur  crossing 
the  New  Jersey  Highlands,  the  review  team  expects  the  aesthetic  impacts  from  building  and 
operations  to  be  noticeable  and  locally  destabilizing. 

Demography 

Site  4-1  is  located  in  Franklin  Township,  Hunterdon  County,  4  mi  east  of  Frenchtown  and  about 
20  mi  southeast  from  Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  Hunterdon  County  has  a 
population  of  127,351;  however,  the  center  and  western  portions  of  Hunterdon  County,  where 
the  site  is  located,  are  rural  (USCB  2013-TN2640).  Bucks  County  has  a  population  of  625,249 
(USCB  2013-TN2640);  however,  northeast  Bucks  County,  the  area  closest  to  the  site,  is 
sparsely  populated  and  rural. 

PSEG  estimates  that  the  size  of  the  construction  workforce  needed  for  building  activities  would 
range  from  a  minimum  of  208  workers  to  a  maximum  of  4,100  workers.  Because  the  site  is 
within  the  New  York-Northern  New  Jersey-Long  Island,  NY-NJ-PA,  MSA,  and  due  to  the  large 
workforce  available  in  Bucks  County  (part  of  the  Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington  MSA),  the 
review  team  based  the  analysis  on  the  assumptions  presented  in  Section  4.4.2.  About 
15  percent  (617  workers  during  peak  building)  would  in-migrate  to  the  region.  The  other 
85  percent  (3,483  workers)  would  be  drawn  from  the  existing  workforce  in  the  50-mi  region. 

If  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  were  built  at  Site  4-1 ,  PSEG  expects  an  operations  workforce  of 
600  workers.  For  similar  reasons  as  with  the  building  workforce,  the  review  team  determined 
that  the  basis  for  operations  workers  is  from  Section  5.4.2.  According  to  Section  5.4.2, 

240  workers  would  in-migrate  for  operations. 

The  review  team  determined,  through  a  gravity  model  of  migration,  that  40  percent  of  the 
in-migrating  building  and  operations  workforce  would  reside  in  Hunterdon  County  and 
20  percent  in  Bucks  County.  The  review  team  also  expects  about  10  percent  of  the  in-migrating

workforce  would  reside  in  Somerset  County,  New  Jersey,  and  10  percent  in  Northampton 
County,  Pennsylvania.  However,  due  to  the  large  populations  of  the  two  counties,  the  impact  of 
in-migrating  workers  would  be  minor.  The  other  20  percent  of  in-migrating  workers  would  reside 
throughout  the  50-mi  region.  During  peak  building  activities,  about  246  and  123  workers  would 
move  into  Hunterdon  and  Bucks  County,  respectively.  During  operations,  96  and  48  workers 
would  move  into  Hunterdon  and  Bucks  County,  respectively.  The  single  largest  concentration  of 
new  workers  would  be  in  Raritan  Township  (population  22,185)  in  Hunterdon  County,  where 
about  1 1  percent  of  the  in-migrating  workers  would  reside  (67  for  peak  building  activities  and 
26  for  operations  activities).  Assuming  a  household  size  of  2.68,  about  619  people  would  move 
into  the  economic  impact  area  during  peak  building  and  241  during  operations.  The  analysis  for 
the  building  workforce  is  an  upper  bound  because  many  of  the  workers  live  elsewhere 
permanently  and  would  only  stay  in  the  economic  impact  area  for  the  term  of  their  employment 
at  the  site.  The  largest  increase  among  these  localities  would  be  in  Hunterdon  County,  with  a 
population  increase  of  three-tenths  of  1  percent.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  the 
impacts  of  in-migrating  building  and  operations  workforces  to  be  minimal. 

Of  the  3,483  workers  that  already  live  in  the  region,  some  would  have  been  unemployed  prior  to 
building  activities.  In  March  2013,  the  national  unemployment  rate  for  the  construction  industry 
was  14.7  percent  (BLS  2013-TN2482).  Of  the  workforce  that  would  not  in-migrate,  the  review 
team  assumes  that  512  of  them  would  have  been  previously  unemployed.  Assuming  a 
distribution  similar  to  the  in-migrating  workforce,  40  percent  of  the  unemployed  workers  would 
already  reside  in  Hunterdon  County,  while  20  percent  would  already  reside  in  Bucks  County. 
About  204  workers  would  be  hired  in  Hunterdon  County  and  102  in  Salem  County.  In  the 
economic  impact  area,  675  jobs  would  be  filled  between  unemployed  workers  and  in-migrating 
workers. 

In  201 1 ,  the  unemployment  rate  for  utilities  workers  in  New  Jersey  was  5.7  percent 
(USCB  2013-TN2640).  Therefore,  of  the  operations  workforce  that  already  lives  in  the  region 
(360  workers),  the  review  team  assumed  20  would  have  been  unemployed  when  hired  by 
PSEG.  Assuming  the  same  distribution  as  the  in-migrating  workforce,  40  percent  of  the 
unemployed  workers  would  already  reside  in  Hunterdon  County  (8  workers),  while  20  percent 
(4  workers)  would  already  reside  in  the  Bucks  County.  In  the  economic  impact  area,  1 56  jobs 
would  be  filled  by  unemployed  workers  (12)  and  in-migrating  workers  (144).  In  addition  to  the 
full-time  operations  workforce  at  Site  4-1,  there  would  be  1,000  workers  every  18  to  24  months 
for  outages.  Using  similar  assumptions  as  those  in  Section  5.4.2,  about  70  percent  of  the 
outage  workers  (700  workers)  would  in-migrate  into  the  economic  impact  area  for  less  than  a 
month  at  a  time  and  then  leave  at  the  end  of  the  outage.  Because  outages  last  less  than  a 
month,  outage  workers  typically  do  not  bring  their  families.  The  maximum  size  of  the  in- 
migrating  workforce  during  operations  (144  operations  workers  and  700  outage  workers)  would 
be  about  two  and  a-half  times  the  in-migrating  peak  employment  building  workforce  (369). 
Because  the  in-migrating  building  phase  workforce  would  constitute  less  than  one-half  of  1 
percent  of  the  baseline  population,  the  review  team  expects  the  demographic  impact  of  in- 
migrating  outage  and  operations  workers  to  be  minimal. 

The  review  team  concluded  that  the  increase  in  population  would  not  noticeably  affect  the 
demographic  character  of  the  economic  impact  area  or  any  of  its  counties;  therefore,  the  impact 
would  be  SMALL.

A  small  number  of  operations  workers  and  their  families  would  in-migrate  to  counties  outside  of 
the  economic  impact  area.  Their  impact  on  any  one  jurisdiction  would  not  be  noticeable.  The 
current  and  projected  populations  of  the  regional  area  are  so  large  and  the  in-migrating 
populations  so  small  that  the  in-migrating  workers  would  represent  less  than  1  percent  of  the 
total  population  in  any  of  the  counties  where  these  employees  reside  (Table  9-12).  Therefore, 
the  review  team  concluded  the  demographic  impacts  of  operation  on  the  remainder  of  the  50-mi 
region  also  would  be  SMALL.

Economic  and  Tax  Impacts 
Economy 

Building  and  operations  at  Site  4-1  would  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  local  and  regional 
economy  through  direct  employment  of  the  workforces,  purchase  of  materials  and  supplies  for 
operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  plant  and  any  capital  expenditures  that  occur  within  the 
region. 

Using  similar  assumptions  and  analysis  to  Sections  4.4.3. 1  and  5.4.3. 1,  PSEG  would  employ 
4,100  workers  during  peak  building,  600  full-time  operations  workers,  and  1,000  temporary 
outage  workers  every  18  to  24  months.  PSEG  would  spend  about  $47  million  annually  during 
building  and  $15  million  annually  during  operation  on  materials  and  services  in  the  economic 
impact  area.  The  added  employment  from  this  spending  in  the  economic  impact  area  would 
equate  to  about  512  and  60  indirect  jobs  created  during  building  and  operations,  respectively. 

Although  the  size  of  the  building  workforce  and  associated  payroll  spending  would  vary 
depending  on  the  building  schedule  and  mobilization  each  particular  year,  assuming  an  average 
of  2,722  workers  per  year,  the  review  team  estimates  that  PSEG  would  spend  an  average  of 
$142  million  annually  on  payroll  during  building  in  2012  dollars.  At  peak  construction,  this 
number  rises  to  $214  million. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.4.2,  most  of  these  wages  would  be  paid  to  construction  workers 
residing  in  the  economic  impact  area.  A  total  of  369  construction  workers  are  expected  to  move 
into  the  economic  impact  area  at  peak  construction  employment.  These  369  workers  would 
receive  an  estimated  annual  total  wage  of  $19.26  million,  assuming  $52,200  annual  income  per 
worker.  PSEG  would  hire  about  306  previously  unemployed  construction  workers  who  would 
receive  a  total  of  $1 5.97  million  in  compensation.  This  total  would  be  $35.23  million  for  the 
675  newly  hired  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area.

As  discussed  in  Section  5.4.2,  most  of  the  wages  paid  during  operations  would  go  to  the 
156  workers  who  would  reside  in  the  economic  impact  area.  A  total  of  144  workers  are 
expected  to  move  into  the  economic  impact  area  for  operations.  These  144  workers  would 
receive  an  estimated  annual  total  wage  of  $13.81  million,  assuming  $95,869  annual  income  per 
worker.  PSEG  would  hire  about  12  previously  unemployed  operations  workers  who  already 
reside  in  the  area,  and  they  would  receive  a  total  of  $1 .1 5  million  in  compensation.  This  total 
would  be  $14.96  million  for  the  156  newly  hired  workers  in  the  economic  impact  area. 

Given  the  size  of  the  economies  and  workforces  in  the  economic  impact  area,  the  review  team 
estimated  the  impact  of  building  and  operations  at  the  Site  4-1  would  be  minor,  and  positive. 

Taxes 

Primary  tax  revenues  associated  with  building  and  operations  activities  at  Site  4-1  would  be 
from  (1)  State  and  local  taxes  on  worker  incomes,  (2)  State  sales  taxes  on  worker  expenditures, 
(3)  State  sales  taxes  on  the  purchases  of  materials  and  supplies,  (4)  corporate  taxes,  and 
(5)  local  property  taxes  or  payments  in  lieu  of  taxes  based  on  the  assessed  value  of  the  PSEG 
plant  during  building.  Due  to  the  tax  structure  discussed  and  analyzed  in  Sections  2. 5.2.2, 

4. 4. 3. 2,  and  5. 4. 3. 2  of  this  EIS,  the  review  team  assumed  similar  impacts  on  State  sales  taxes 
on  worker  expenditures  and  on  materials  and  supplies — both  of  which  were  minimal  and 
positive.  The  review  team  also  assumed  similar  corporate  tax  impacts,  which  were  deemed  to 
be  noticeable  and  positive. 

State  and  Local  Income  Taxes.  Pennsylvania  and  New  Jersey  would  receive  additional  income 
tax  revenue  from  the  wages  of  new  workers.  The  exact  amount  of  income  tax  revenue  would 
be  determined  on  the  basis  of  many  factors  such  as  rates,  residency  status,  and  deductions. 
These  income  tax  revenues  would  be  smaller  in  non-peak  building  years  and  during  operations. 

The  majority  of  the  building  workforce  would  already  live  in  the  region,  would  commute  daily  to 
and  from  the  site,  and  would  be  employed  elsewhere  prior  to  building  activities  at  Site  4-1 . 
Sections  4. 4. 3. 2  and  5. 4. 3. 2  discuss  income  tax  levels  in  New  Jersey.  Because  the  PSEG  Site 
would  have  larger  in-migrating  workforces  and  more  previously  unemployed  workers  than 
Site  4-1 ,  the  impacts  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  bounding.  Therefore,  the  income  tax  effects  from 
in-migrating  and  previously  unemployed  local  workers  at  Site  4-1  also  must  be  minimal.  Due  to 
the  size  of  Pennsylvania’s  income  tax  base,  the  review  team  assumed  minimal  impacts  as  well 
for  Pennsylvania. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4. 4. 3. 2,  PSEG  pays  an  energy  receipts  tax  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey 
based  on  revenues  from  electricity  sales.  However,  because  PSEG  would  not  sell  electricity 
from  a  new  plant  during  building,  the  energy  receipts  tax  would  not  change  from  the  baseline  tax 
payments  to  New  Jersey.  PSEG  would  pay  the  energy  receipts  tax  during  operations,  and 
according  to  the  analysis  in  Section  5. 4. 3. 2,  PSEG  would  pay  between  $144  million  and 
$244  million  to  New  Jersey.  These  revenues  would  account  for  between  6  and  1 1  percent  of 
New  Jersey’s  corporate  income  tax  receipts. 

Property  Taxes.  Employees  who  own  their  residences  would  pay  property  taxes  to  the  counties 
and/or  municipalities  in  which  their  homes  were  located.  In  New  Jersey,  property  tax  rates  vary 
from  one  county  to  another  and  also  within  townships  in  the  same  county.  Property  tax  rates  in

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey,  range  between  $1,788  and  $3,168  per  hundred  dollars  of 
assessed  value.  The  rate  for  Franklin  Township,  where  Site  4-1  is  located,  is  $2,361  per 
hundred  (Hunterdon  County  2013-TN2634). 

Property  taxes  paid  by  construction  workers  that  already  live  in  the  economic  impact  area  are  a 
part  of  the  baseline  and  not  relevant  to  this  analysis.  In-migrating  construction  workers  would 
most  likely  move  into  existing  houses  rather  than  building  new  houses,  resulting  in  a  transfer  of 
property  taxes  instead  of  an  increase  in  local  property  tax  revenues.  Based  on  the  above 
assessments,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  property  tax  impact  from 
construction  workers. 

Hunterdon  County  does  not  assess  a  property  tax  against  construction  projects  in  progress. 
Consequently,  PSEG  would  not  pay  property  taxes  to  Hunterdon  County  until  the  project  is 
completed  and  commercial  operations  commence. 

From  the  above  assessments,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  construction- 
phase  property  tax  impacts  in  the  economic  impact  area,  and  that  the  overall  impact  of  new  tax 
revenues  at  the  State  and  local  levels  would  be  minimal  and  positive. 

As  was  the  case  in  the  PSEG  Site  analysis,  the  review  team  assumed  144  in-migrating 
operations  workers  would  either  purchase  or  build  homes  in  the  economic  impact  area.  For 
existing  homes,  the  property  tax  effect  would  be  zero.  For  new  homes,  the  review  team  expects 
only  a  limited  number  of  in-migrating  workers  would  prefer  to  build.  Given  the  magnitude  of  the 
property  tax  base  in  each  of  the  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area,  the  contribution  of  new 
real  property  to  each  area  would  result  in  a  minor  but  beneficial  impact. 

All  of  the  real  property  and  improvements  related  to  Site  4-1  are  located  in  Hunterdon  County, 
New  Jersey.  The  review  team  determined  that  the  2012  township  property  tax  in  Franklin 
Township  was  about  $2,361  per  hundred  dollars  of  assessed  value  on  all  improvements.  For 
an  Advanced  Passive  1000  reactor  (API  000)  design,  the  expected  property  tax  revenue  to 
Hunterdon  County  would  be  about  $234  million  for  the  first  year  of  operation,  declining 
thereafter  over  the  40-year  life  of  the  plant.  In  total,  Franklin  Township  would  collect  about  $4.8 
billion  in  property  tax  revenues  from  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1 .  For  the  Advanced  Boiling  Water 
Reactor  (ABWR)  design,  the  property  tax  revenue  would  be  about  $138  million  for  the  first  year 
of  operation,  declining  thereafter  over  the  40-year  life  of  the  plant.  In  total,  Franklin  Township 
would  collect  about  $2.8  billion  in  property  tax  revenues.  Hunterdon  County’s  2013  budget 
shows  an  expected  total  revenue  of  $89  million  (Hunterdon  County  2013-TN2584).  Therefore,  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  would  add  between  about  272  percent  (API 000)  and  161  percent 
(ABWR)  to  the  current  Hunterdon  County  budget  in  the  first  year  of  operation.  Consequently, 
the  review  team  determined  that  Hunterdon  County  would  experience  a  major  and  beneficial 
impact  from  the  anticipated  new  property  tax  revenues,  and  the  economic  impact  area  and  the 
remainder  of  the  50-mi  region  would  experience  a  minimal  and  beneficial  impact. 

Summary  of  Economic  and  Tax  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concluded  the  economic  and  tax  impacts  of  a  new  nuclear  power 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area 
during  building.  The  review  team  also  concluded  the  economic  impacts  would  be  SMALL  and 
beneficial  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area  during  operations.  The  review  team 
determined  SMALL  and  beneficial  impacts  to  sales  and  excise  tax  and  income  tax  receipts  in 
the  economic  impact  area  and  region.  The  review  team  also  predicts  MODERATE  and 
beneficial  impacts  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  from  PSEG  corporate  tax  payments  and  LARGE 
and  beneficial  impacts  to  Hunterdon  County  from  property  tax  payments. 

Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  review  team’s  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community 
services,  including  transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education. 

Traffic 


Road  access  to  the  Site  4-1  area  is  provided  primarily  by  New  Jersey  Routes  513  and  579,  both 
of  which  are  wide  two-lane  highways.  The  current  daily  vehicle  counts  for  New  Jersey  Routes 
513  and  579  are  3,284  and  4,504,  respectively.  Road  access  to  the  site  itself  is  provided  by 
County  Road  615,  a  narrow  two-lane  road  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  daily  vehicle  count  for 
County  Road  615  is  2,005  vehicles  per  day.  The  site  is  about  8  mi  from  Interstate  78  via  Route 
513.  The  nearest  rail  spur  is  about  7  mi  from  the  site,  and  barge  access  would  not  be  feasible 
for  Site  4-1.  Therefore,  major  components  for  building  and  operations  would  be  delivered  via 
rail.  The  site  would  require  about  3.5  mi  of  roadway  improvements  and  a  rail  spur  (PSEG  2010- 
TN257).  Due  to  the  size  of  the  workforce  for  building,  the  review  team  expects  a  temporary, 
noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing  impact  from  traffic.  Because  the  workforce  for  operations  would 
be  smaller  (even  during  outages),  the  review  team  expects  traffic  impacts  to  be  minimal. 

Recreation 


In  the  economic  impact  area,  Hunterdon  County  has  25  park  areas  totaling  8,281  ac.  Bucks 
County  has  31  park  areas  totaling  over  7,000  ac  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2651).  None  of  the 
parks  found  appear  to  be  within  5  mi  of  the  site. 

Recreational  resources  may  be  affected  by  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  4-1 . 
Impacts  may  include  increased  user  demand  associated  with  the  projected  increase  in 
population  from  in-migrating  workers  and  families;  an  impaired  recreational  experience 
associated  with  the  views  of  the  proposed  cooling  towers,  plumes,  and  offsite  facilities;  or 
access  delays  associated  with  increased  traffic  on  local  roadways. 

Because  of  the  size  of  the  in-migrating  population  compared  to  the  baseline  and  the  minor 
increase  in  traffic,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  minimal  impacts  to  the 
recreational  resources  from  increased  usage  and  traffic  around  the  resources.  However,  due  to 
the  noticeable  physical  offsite  impacts  around  the  New  Jersey  Highlands,  the  review  team 
estimated  a  noticeable  and  destabilizing  aesthetic  impact  on  recreational  resources  in  and 
around  the  New  Jersey  Highlands.

Housing 

As  shown  in  Table  9-13,  an  estimated  294,610  housing  units  are  located  within  the  economic 
impact  area.  Of  these,  17,200  are  vacant,  primarily  in  Bucks  County.  The  review  team 
estimated  demand  for  short-term  housing  primarily  during  the  peak  building  period,  and  demand 
for  long-term  housing  during  operations.  Based  on  this  analysis,  the  review  team  determined 
the  majority  of  the  building  and  operations  workforces  would  reside  in  existing  housing  in  the 
50-mi  region,  with  about  369  construction  workers  and  144  operations  workers  located  within 
the  economic  impact  area.  Considering  that  the  building  workforce  may  choose  short-term 
accommodations  such  as  campsites  or  hotels,  and  some  of  the  operations  workers  may  decide 
to  build  new  residences,  the  review  team  determined  the  existing  housing  supply  is  sufficient  to 
accommodate  both  the  building  and  operations  workforces.  Because  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield 
site,  as  many  as  25  houses  within  the  conceptual  site  boundaries  would  have  to  be  removed  to 
build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  plant  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  review  team  determines  the 
housing  impact  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  4-1  would  be  minimal.

Public  Services 


Hunterdon  County  residents  primarily  rely  on  private  wells  for  drinking  water  and  individual 
septic  systems  and  tanks  for  wastewater  disposal.  There  are  no  public  systems  in  the  county 
(New  Jersey  2013-TN2651 ).  Bucks  County  is  served  by  a  mixture  of  private  water  companies, 
municipal  water  departments,  and  water  supply  authorities.  Forty-seven  of  the  54  municipalities 
in  the  county  are  served  by  these.  The  rest  are  served  by  private  wells.  Bucks  County  has 
3  municipal  sewer  departments  and  22  municipal  authorities  providing  sewage  collection  or 
treatment  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2651 ). 

Because  Hunterdon  County  has  individual,  private  sources  for  water  and  wastewater  instead  of 
a  centralized  municipal  utility,  there  is  no  impact  from  in-migrating  persons  on  Hunterdon 
municipal  water  and  wastewater  services.  Assuming  per  capita  consumption  of  100  gpd.  the 
entire  population  of  Bucks  County  consumes  about  62  million  gpd.  The  influx  of  206  persons 
during  the  construction  period  would  account  for  three-hundredths  of  1  percent  increase  in 
demand  during  building  and  even  less  during  the  operations  period.  Assuming  75  gpd  of 


November  2015 


9-93 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


wastewater  per  person,  the  population  of  Bucks  County  consumes  about  47  million  gpd.  The 
building  workforce  population  increase  in  Bucks  County  would  increase  wastewater  treatment 
demand  by  three-hundredths  of  1  percent  and  even  less  for  operations.  The  review  team, 
therefore,  predicted  a  minimal  increase  in  water  and  wastewater  impacts  in  the  economic 
impact  area. 

Hunterdon  County  has  27  police  departments,  25  emergency  medical  services  (EMS)  squads, 
and  39  fire  departments.  It  also  has  a  200-bed  hospital,  three  family  health  centers,  and  two 
mental  health  facilities  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2651 ).  Bucks  County  has  42  municipal  and 
regional  police  departments,  27  EMS  squads,  and  62  fire  companies.  Bucks  County  also  has 
six  general  hospitals  and  three  specialty  health  centers  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2651 ).  Because 
the  construction  and  operations  workforces  constitute  an  increase  in  population  of  less  than 
1  percent  in  both  of  the  economic  impact  area  counties,  the  review  team  determined  the 
impacts  of  building  and  operations  on  local  public  services  would  be  minor  and  no  mitigation 
would  be  warranted. 

Education 


There  are  numerous  public  school  districts  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Hunterdon  County  has 
28  school  districts  that  enroll  21,426  children  and  a  polytechnical  school  with  384  students 
during  the  2012-2013  school  year  (New  Jersey  2013-TN2651 ).  Bucks  County  has  13  school 
districts  with  89,353  students  enrolled  in  the  2012-2013  school  year  (New  Jersey  2013- 
TN2651).  About  85  percent  of  the  project  workforce  would  be  local  workers  who  currently 
reside  in  the  region.  The  majority  of  these  workers  would  commute  from  their  homes  to  the 
project  site  and  would  not  relocate.  Therefore,  the  majority  of  workers  are  currently  served  by 
the  educational  services  within  the  communities  where  they  reside.  According  to  Sections 
4. 4. 4. 5  and  5.4.4. 5,  the  average  percent  of  the  population  between  5  and  1 8  years  old  for  the 
PSEG  Site  was  17.1  percent.  As  shown  in  Table  9-14,  during  peak  building  there  would  be  an 
estimated  increase  of  105  students  and  41  students  during  operations  in  the  economic  impact 
area.  The  review  team  determined  this  to  be  a  small  increase  compared  to  the  existing  rolls  in 
the  economic  impact  area  (more  than  1 10,000  students).  The  review  team  estimated  minimal 
impacts  on  local  school  districts  and  schools  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  no  mitigation 
would  be  warranted.

Summary  of  Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation  and 
outreach,  the  review  team  concluded  that  nearly  all  infrastructure  and  community  impacts  would 
be  SMALL  for  the  region  and  the  economic  impact  area  during  building  and  operations.  The 
review  team  predicted  MODERATE  traffic  impacts  to  Hunterdon  County  during  building  and  a 
SMALL  impact  during  operations.  The  review  team  predicted  LARGE  impacts  to  Hunterdon 
County  recreational  resources  during  building  and  operations  from  offsite  infrastructure  and 
aesthetic  impacts. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

As  discussed  above,  the  economic  impact  area  for  Site  4-1  is  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey, 
and  Bucks  County,  Pennsylvania.  This  section  discusses  information  pertaining  to  these  areas. 
Table  9-8  discusses  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  associated  with 
Site  4-1.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  could  result  in  cumulative 
impacts  on  the  demographics,  economy,  and  community  infrastructure  of  the  economic  impact 
area  counties  in  conjunction  with  those  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

The  impact  analyses  presented  for  Site  4-1  are  cumulative  in  nature.  Past  and  current 
economic  impacts  associated  with  the  activities  listed  in  Table  9-8  have  already  been 
considered  as  part  of  the  baseline  for  Site  4-1.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  4-1  could  result  in  cumulative  physical  and  socioeconomic  impacts  on  the 
demographics,  economy,  and  community  infrastructure  of  the  economic  impact  area,  in 
conjunction  with  those  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  shown  in  Table  9-8,  and  in  general 
result  in  increased  urbanization.  However,  many  impacts,  such  as  those  on  housing  or  public 
services,  would  decrease  over  time,  particularly  with  increased  tax  revenues.  Furthermore, 

State  and  County  plans,  along  with  modeled  demographics  projections,  include  forecasts  for 
future  development.  Because  the  projects  identified  in  Table  9-8  would  be  consistent  with 
applicable  land-use  plans  and  control  policies,  the  review  team  considers  the  cumulative 
socioeconomic  impacts  from  the  projects  to  be  manageable. 

Summary  of  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Based  on  information  provided  by  PSEG,  a  review  of  existing  reconnaissance-level 
documentation,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operations  activities  on  physical  resources  would  be  SMALL, 
with  the  exception  of  a  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetic  resources.  The  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetic 
resources  is  because  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield  site  that  would  have  infrastructure  in  previously 
undisturbed  rural  areas  and  a  rail  spur  crossing  the  New  Jersey  Highlands.  The  cumulative 
impacts  on  demography  would  be  SMALL.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  taxes  and  the  economy 
would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region,  except  for  a  MODERATE  and  beneficial 
income  tax  impact  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  a  LARGE  and  beneficial  economic  and  tax 
impact  to  Hunterdon  County.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services 
would  be  SMALL  throughout  the  region  with  the  exception  of  a  MODERATE  impact  from  traffic 
to  Hunterdon  County  during  building  activities  and  a  LARGE  impact  to  recreation-based 
aesthetics.  Based  on  the  above  considerations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative 


November  2015

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


socioeconomic  impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  4-1,  with  the  exception  of  the 
physical  impacts  and  the  beneficial  impacts  to  taxes  and  the  economy,  would  not  noticeably 
contribute  to  the  existing  cumulative  socioeconomic  effects  discussed  earlier  in  this  section. 

9. 3. 2. 6  Environmental  Justice 

The  economic  impact  area  for  Site  4-1  is  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey,  and  Bucks  County, 
Pennsylvania.  To  evaluate  the  distribution  of  minority  and  low-income  populations  near 
Site  4-1 ,  the  review  team  conducted  a  demographic  analysis  of  populations  within  the  50-mi 
region  surrounding  the  proposed  site  in  accordance  with  the  methodology  discussed  in 
Section  2.6.1.  In  the  50-mi  region,  2,773  aggregate  minority  and  770  low-income  block  groups 
meet  one  or  both  of  the  criteria  presented  in  Section  2.6.1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Figure  9-5 
and  Figure  9-6  show  the  location  of  block  groups  with  aggregate  minority  and  low-income 
populations  within  the  region.  In  Hunterdon  County,  no  low-income  block  groups  were  found, 
but  one  Hispanic  ethnicity  block  group  was  found  to  meet  one  or  both  of  the  criteria 
(PSEG  201 2-TN2370).  This  block  group  is  between  5  and  1 0  mi  southeast  of  the  site.  The 
block  groups  that  meet  one  or  both  of  the  criteria  in  Bucks  County  are  found  in  the  southern 
portion  of  the  county,  over  20  mi  away  from  the  site.  The  aggregate  minority  block  groups  are 
focused  primarily  along  the  1-95  corridor  from  Philadelphia  to  New  York  City,  with  some  focused 
around  Bethlehem  and  Allentown,  Pennsylvania.  The  rest  of  the  low-income  block  groups  that 
meet  one  or  both  of  the  criteria  are  located  in  and  around  the  Philadelphia,  Trenton,  and  New 
York  City  metro  areas.  There  are  no  low-income  or  minority  high-density  communities  in 
Hunterdon  County  (Hunterdon  County  2010-TN2589).  Therefore,  the  review  team  has  found  no 
pathways  for  impacts  to  these  communities. 

The  review  team  performed  a  reconnaissance-level  analysis  for  the  presence  of  unique 
characteristics  or  practices  in  minority  or  low-income  communities  that  could  result  in 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  from  Site  4-1  compared  to  the  rest  of  the 
population.  All  of  the  populations  are  some  distance  from  the  site  and  therefore  would  not 
receive  any  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  human  health,  environmental,  or  physical 
impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  4-1.  The  socioeconomic  impacts  from  building 
and  operations  at  Site  4-1  to  minority  and  low-income  populations  would  be  similar  to  those  to 
the  general  population  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Based  on  the  analysis  above  and  the  discussion  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Section  9. 3. 2. 5,  the 
review  team  determined  that  there  would  not  be  any  further  disproportionately  high  and  adverse 
impacts  on  environmental  justice  populations  above  and  beyond  those  discussed  in  this  section. 
The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  pathways  for  environmental  justice  impacts. 

9. 3. 2. 7  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey.  The  analysis  also  considers  other 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  impact  historic  and  cultural 
resources,  including  the  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8.  For  the  analysis

of  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  impacts  at  Site  4-1,  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  is  considered  to  be  the  area  of  potential  effect  (APE)  defined  for  this  proposed 
undertaking.  This  includes  the  physical  APE,  defined  as  the  area  directly  affected  by  the  site- 
development,  operation  activities  at  the  site,  and  transmission  lines  and  the  visual  APE.  The 
visual  APE  is  defined  as  the  additional  4.9-mi  radius  around  the  physical  APE.  The  4.9-mi 
radius  was  chosen  by  the  New  Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO)  as  the 
appropriate  distance  for  consideration  of  visual  resources  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  was 
therefore  applied  to  the  alternative  sites  (AKRF  2012-TN2876). 

Reconnaissance-level  activities  in  this  cultural  resource  review  have  a  particular  meaning.  For 
example,  these  activities  include  preliminary  field  investigations  to  confirm  the  presence  or 
absence  of  cultural  resources.  In  developing  this  EIS,  the  review  team  relies  upon 
reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  alternative  site  evaluations.  Reconnaissance-level 
information  consists  of  data  that  are  readily  available  from  agencies  and  other  public  sources. 

It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  visits  to  the  alternative  site  area.  The  following 
information  was  used  to  identify  the  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  at  Site  4-1: 

•  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280), 

•  Field  Verification  of  Key  Resources  at  PSEG  Alternative  Sites  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869),  and 

•  New  Jersey  SHPO  archaeological  site  files. 

Affected  Environment 

Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield  site  located  in  Hunterdon  County  in  northwestern  New  Jersey. 
Historically,  Site  4-1  has  been  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  Site  4-1  encompasses  a  total  of 
1 ,128  ac.  The  location  would  require  3.5  mi  of  new  roads,  a  6.8-mi  railroad  spur,  a  6.8-mi-long 
makeup  water  pipeline,  and  three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines  covering  a  total  distance  of 
84  mi.  The  current  major  industry  in  Hunterdon  County  is  agriculture.  There  are  81  properties 
listed  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)  located  in  Hunterdon  County,  New 
Jersey  (NPS  2013-TN2774). 

Four  archaeological  sites  have  been  recorded  within  1  mi  of  Site  4-1.  These  include  Sites 
28-HU-390,  28-HU-391 ,  28-HU-392,  and  28-HU-393.  Only  one  of  these  four  archaeological 
sites,  28-HU-390,  a  prehistoric  site,  is  located  within  the  conceptual  footprint  for  the  new  plant. 
No  previously  identified  archaeological  sites  are  identified  near  the  conceptual  corridors  for 
Site  4-1. 

There  are  43  previously  identified  architectural  resources  within  4.9  mi  of  Site  4-1  and  its 
ancillary  components.  Resources  include  residences,  historic  districts,  bridges,  mills,  churches, 
and  other  miscellaneous  buildings.  Ten  significant  architectural  resources  have  been  identified 
within  1  mi  of  Site  4-1  and  the  conceptual  corridors.  These  resources  include  historic  districts, 
taverns,  churches,  and  a  Quaker  meeting  house.  Three  significant  (i.e.,  NRHP-listed  or  State 
register-listed)  architectural  resources  are  within  1,000  ft  of  Site  4-1  and  its  conceptual  offsite 
corridors.  They  are  the  Rockhil!  Agricultural  Historic  District,  Pittstown  Historic  District,  and 
Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  Historic  District.  The  Lehigh  Valley  Railroad  Historic  District  is  within  the 
conceptual  rail  spur  needed  for  the  location.  A  review  of  architectural  resources  in  the 
immediate  vicinity  of  Site  4-1  identified  nine  additional  architectural  resources  within  1 ,000  ft  of 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Site  4-1  that  could  potentially  be  eligible  for  NRHP  listing  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869).  These 
resources  include  farm  houses,  farms,  and  a  historic  district.  The  historic  district  is  in  the  Village 
of  Baptistown.  Six  additional  buildings  with  potential  for  NRHP  listing  were  identified  within  1  mi 
of  Site  4-1,  including  two  churches  and  cemeteries,  a  municipal  building,  and  three  residences. 
Another  15  structures  and  architectural  features  that  have  the  potential  for  listing  in  NRHP  were 
identified  between  1  and  10  mi  of  Site  4-1. 

Building  Impacts 

Site  28-HU-390  is  located  within  the  footprint  of  the  plant.  It  would  be  destroyed,  which  would 
destabilize  the  resource.  An  additional  cultural  resources  inventory  would  likely  be  needed  for 
any  portion  of  Site  4-1  that  has  not  been  previously  surveyed.  Other  areas  subject  to  ground 
disturbance  (e.g.,  for  roads  and  pipeline  corridors)  would  also  likely  require  a  survey  to  identify 
potential  historic  and  cultural  resources  and  the  mitigation  measures  to  offset  the  potential 
adverse  effects.  The  types  of  cultural  resource  and  historic  property  impacts  resulting  from 
construction  and  operation  of  new  nuclear  units  would  consist  of  alterations  to  archaeological 
sites  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  visual  alteration  of  the  settings  for  historic  structures. 
In  some  cases  vibrations  from  construction  equipment  could  affect  historic  structures. 

The  existing  viewshed  does  not  contain  any  existing  cooling  towers  or  any  large  industrial 
facilities  with  which  the  proposed  plant  could  blend.  The  visual  impact  to  the  historic  properties 
from  the  building  of  the  plant,  including  the  590-ft-tall  cooling  towers,  would  be  significant. 

No  existing  transmission  corridors  connect  directly  to  Site  4-1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Three 
new  transmission  line  corridors  would  be  needed  to  connect  Site  4-1  to  existing  lines. 
Construction  of  the  SRERP  power  line  may  reduce  the  need  for  the  additional  transmission 
lines.  No  NRHP-listed  or  previously  recorded  historic  or  prehistoric  sites  are  in  the  area  where 
the  SRERP  transmission  line  was  routed.  In  the  event  that  Site  4-1  was  chosen  for  the 
proposed  project,  the  review  team  assumes  that  the  transmission  service  provider  for  this  region 
would  conduct  cultural  resource  surveys  for  all  areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines.  If 
NRHP-eligible  resources  are  identified,  then  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts 
would  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  and  any  interested  parties  as 
required  under  Section  106  of  the  NHPA  (54  USC  300101  et  seq.  -TN4157).  In  addition,  visual 
impacts  from  transmission  lines  could  result  in  significant  alterations  to  the  visual  landscape 
within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  It  is  likely  that  there  would  be  significant  impacts  to 
historic  and  cultural  resources  from  building  a  plant  at  Site  4-1  given  that  significant  resources 
are  within  the  physical  and  visual  APE  for  the  project,  including  offsite  corridors.  These  impacts 
would  be  reduced  if  the  number  and  length  of  the  transmission  lines  are  not  needed  due  to 
electrical  system  improvements  in  the  region. 

Operational  Impacts 

Operational  impacts  from  a  new  plant  located  at  Site  4-1 ,  with  exception  of  visual  impacts, 
would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  Most  impacts  to  cultural  resources  would  occur  during 
preconstruction  and  construction.  Visual  impacts  to  historic  structures  would  occur  within  the 
viewshed  of  the  new  plant  during  operation.  The  visual  impact  during  operation  from  the 
590-ft-tall  cooling  tower  would  be  significant.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Cumulative  Impacts 

Most  cumulative  impacts  would  result  from  non-NRC-licensed  activities  associated  with 
construction  of  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  These  impacts  would  depend  on  the 
locations  of  the  various  activities  and  the  nature,  number,  and  significance  of  cultural  resources 
present.  Existing  information  suggests  that  the  region  surrounding  Site  4-1  contains  intact 
historic  and  cultural  resources.  It  is  possible  that  currently  unknown  cultural  resources  would  be 
found  in  close  proximity  to  areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  Because  site 
28-HU-390  would  be  destroyed  and  because  of  the  impacts  to  the  historic  properties  within  the 
viewshed  from  the  cooling  towers,  the  cumulative  impacts  would  be  expected  to  destabilize 
historic  properties. 

Summary 

Cultural  resources  are  nonrenewable;  therefore,  the  impact  of  destruction  of  cultural  resources 
is  cumulative.  The  impact-level  determination  reflects  the  fact  that  (1 )  cultural  resources  are 
found  within  the  boundaries  of  the  proposed  plant  at  Site  4-1  and  (2)  one  would  be  destroyed  as 
and  (3)  the  cooling  towers  would  visually  impact  historic  properties  in  the  area.  Based  on  the 
reconnaissance-level  information  collected  for  this  EIS,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  of  building  and  operating  new  nuclear 
units  at  Site  4-1  would  be  LARGE.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 
would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  impacts. 

9.3.2  8  Air  Quality 

Criteria  Pollutants 

The  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  offsite  facilities 
at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  expected  for  the  PSEG  Site,  as  described  in 
Chapters  4  and  5.  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield  site  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey,  about  5  mi 
east  of  the  Delaware  River.  Similar  to  Salem  County,  where  the  PSEG  Site  is  located, 
Hunterdon  County  is  classified  as  a  nonattainment  area  for  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQSs  and  in 
attainment  or  better  than  national  standards  for  all  other  criteria  pollutants  (40  CFR  Part  81- 
TN255).  Hunterdon  County  is  in  the  Northeast  Pennsylvania-Upper  Delaware  Valley  Interstate 
Air  Quality  Control  Region  (AQCR;  40  CFR  81 .55  [TN255]),  while  Salem  County  is 
administratively  in  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia  Interstate  AQCR  (40  CFR  81.15  [TN255]). 
Similar  to  the  PSEG  Site,  an  applicability  analysis  would  need  to  be  performed  if  a  nuclear 
power  plant  was  built  on  Site  4-1  per  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  (TN2495),  to  determine 
whether  a  general  conformity  determination  was  needed. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.7,  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude.  Emissions  from  these  activities 
would  be  primarily  the  fugitive  dust  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  engine  exhaust  from 
heavy  equipment  and  vehicles.  These  impacts  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  associated  with 
any  large  construction  project.  During  building  activities,  a  New  Jersey  State  Air  Quality  Permit 
would  be  required  that  would  prescribe  emissions  limits  and  mitigation  measures  to  be 
implemented.  The  applicant  also  plans  to  implement  a  fugitive  dust  control  program 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the  public  and  workers 
include  exposure  to  etiological  agents,  noise,  and  electromagnetic  fields  (EMFs),  and  transport 
of  workers  to  and  from  the  site. 

Most  of  the  nonradiological  impacts  of  building  and  operation  (e.g.,  noise,  etiological  agents, 
and  occupational  injuries)  would  be  localized  and  would  not  have  significant  impact  at  offsite 
locations.  However,  activities  such  as  vehicle  emissions  from  transport  of  personnel  to  and 
from  the  site  would  encompass  a  larger  area.  Therefore,  for  nonradiological  health  impacts 
associated  with  the  influence  of  vehicle  and  other  air  emissions  sources,  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  for  cumulative  impacts  analysis  includes  projects  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  4-1 .  For 
cumulative  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  the 
transmission  line  corridor.  These  geographical  areas  are  expected  to  encompass  areas  where 
cumulative  impacts  to  public  and  worker  health  could  occur  in  combination  with  any  past, 
present,  or  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Building  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  construction  workers  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  those  from  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  as 
evaluated  in  Section  4.8.  They  include  occupational  injuries,  noise,  odor,  vehicle  exhaust,  and 
dust.  Applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations  on  air  quality  and  noise  would  be 
complied  with  during  the  plant  construction  phase.  Site  4-1  does  not  have  any  characteristics 
that  would  be  expected  to  lead  to  fewer  or  more  construction  accidents  than  would  be  expected 
for  the  PSEG  Site.  Transportation  of  personnel  and  construction  materials  at  Site  4-1  would 
result  in  minimal  nonradiological  health  impacts.  Site  4-1  is  in  a  greenfield  area,  and 
construction  impacts  would  likely  be  minimal  on  the  surrounding  areas,  which  are  classified  as 
low-population  areas. 

Operational  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  occupational  health  of  workers  and  members  of  the  public 
from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  those  evaluated  in 
Section  5.8  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Occupational  health  impacts  on  workers  (e.g., 
falls,  electric  shock,  or  exposure  to  other  hazards)  at  Site  4-1  would  likely  be  the  same  as  those 
evaluated  for  workers  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  would 
be  controlled  by  NPDES  permits  issued  by  NJDEP.  The  growth  of  etiological  agents  would  not 
be  significantly  encouraged  at  Site  4-1  because  of  the  temperature  attenuation  in  the  length  of 
the  pipe  required  for  a  discharge  system.  Noise  and  EMF  exposure  would  be  monitored  and 
controlled  in  accordance  with  applicable  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA) 
regulations.  Effects  of  EMFs  on  human  health  would  be  controlled  and  minimized  by 
conformance  with  National  Electric  Safety  Code  (NESC)  criteria.  Nonradiological  impacts  of 
traffic  during  operations  would  be  less  than  the  impacts  during  preconstruction  and  construction. 
Mitigation  measures  used  during  building  to  improve  traffic  flow  would  also  minimize  impacts 
during  operation  of  the  new  plant.

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  and  present  actions  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to 
cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts  include  the  energy  projects  in  Table  9-8,  as  well  as 
vehicle  emissions  and  existing  urbanization.  Reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  in  the 
geographical  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts 
include  expansion  of  natural-gas  pipelines,  improvement  and  new  construction  for  roadways 
and  interstates,  future  transmission  line  development,  and  future  urbanization.  The  review  team 
is  also  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  human  health.  The  review  team 
considered  a  recent  compilation  of  the  state  of  the  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472)  in  the  preparation  of  this  EIS.  Projected  changes  in  climate  for  the  region  include  an 
increase  in  average  temperature;  increased  likelihood  of  drought  in  summer;  more  heavy 
downpours;  and  increase  in  precipitation,  especially  in  the  winter  and  spring,  which  may  alter 
the  presence  of  microorganisms  and  parasites.  In  view  of  the  water  source  characteristics,  the 
review  team  did  not  identify  anything  that  would  alter  its  conclusion  regarding  the  presence  of 
etiological  agents  or  change  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. 

Summary 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  expects  that  the  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  evaluated  for  the  PSEG 
Site.  Although  there  are  past,  present,  and  future  activities  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest 
that  could  affect  nonradiological  health  in  ways  similar  to  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new 
plant  at  Site  4-1,  those  impacts  would  be  localized  and  managed  through  adherence  to  existing 
regulatory  requirements.  Similarly,  impacts  on  public  health  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  4-1  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  review  team  concludes,  therefore,  that 
the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  on 
nonradiological  health  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.2.10  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operations 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from 
building  activities  and  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1,  located  in  Franklin 
Township,  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey  (about  80  mi  north-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site).  The 
analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  radiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  and  the 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-8.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.2,  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield  site;  there  are 
currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  area  within  a 
50-mi  radius  of  Site  4-1.  The  only  facility  that  potentially  affects  radiological  health  within  this 
geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  Limerick  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2.  In  addition, 
medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive  materials  are  likely  to  be  within 
50  mi  of  Site  4-1. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  include 
doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  would 
result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  would  be  well  below 
regulatory  limits.  The  impacts  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  radiological  impacts  of  the  Limerick  Generating  Station  include  doses  from  direct  radiation 
and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  result  in  doses  to  people  and 
biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  are  well  below  regulatory  limits  as  demonstrated  by  the 
ongoing  radiological  environmental  monitoring  program  conducted  around  Limerick  Generating 
Station.  The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  dose  from  direct  radiation  and  effluents  from  medical, 
industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive  material  would  be  an  insignificant 
contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  around  Site  4-1.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  data  from 
the  radiological  environmental  monitoring  programs  conducted  around  currently  operating 
nuclear  power  plants.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC  staffs 
independent  analysis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative  radiological  impacts  from 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  other  existing  and  planned  projects  and 
actions  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  around  Site  4-1  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.2.11  Postulated  Accidents 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  from  postulated  accidents  from  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  radiological  health  from  postulated  accidents,  including  other  Federal  and 
non-Federal  projects  and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-8  within  the  geographic  area  of 
interest.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.2,  Site  4-1  is  a  greenfield  site,  and  there  are  currently  no 
nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  considers  all  existing  and 
proposed  nuclear  power  plants  that  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  probability-weighted 
consequences  (i.e.,  risks)  from  a  severe  accident  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  this  site. 

Existing  facilities  potentially  affecting  radiological  accident  risk  within  this  geographic  area  of 
interest  are  HCGS  Unit  1,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station, 
Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3, 
Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  Susquehanna  Steam  Electric  Station  Units  1  and  2, 
and  Indian  Point  Nuclear  Generating  Units  2  and  3.  In  addition,  a  new  reactor,  known  as  the 
Bell  Bend  Nuclear  Power  Plant,  has  been  proposed  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  next 
to  the  Susquehanna  Steam  Electric  Station. 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 ,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of 
design  basis  accidents  (DBAs)  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  for  a  U.S.  Advanced 
Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (US-APWR),  two  API  000s,  a  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor 
(U.S.  EPR),  or  an  ABWR.  DBAs  are  addressed  specifically  to  demonstrate  that  any  of  these 
four  reactor  designs  is  sufficiently  robust  to  meet  the  NRC  safety  criteria.  The  reactor  designs 
are  independent  of  site  conditions,  and  the  meteorological  data  for  Site  4-1  and  the  PSEG  Site 
are  similar;  therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of  DBAs  at 
Site  4-1  would  be  SMALL. 

Because  the  meteorology,  population  distribution,  and  land  use  for  Site  4-1  are  expected  to  be 
similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site,  risks  from  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
located  at  Site  4-1  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  analyzed  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  risks 
for  the  PSEG  Site  are  presented  in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31  and  are  well  below  the  mean  and 
median  values  for  current-generation  reactors.  In  addition,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.11.2.1, 
estimates  of  average  individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  are  well  below

Commission  safety  goals  (51  FR  30028-TN594).  For  existing  plants  within  the  geographic  area 
of  interest  (i.e.,  whose  50-mi  radius  overlaps  with  the  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site), 
namely  HCGS  Unit  1,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick 
Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3,  Three 
Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  Susquehanna  Steam  Electric  Station  Units  1  and  2,  and 
Indian  Point  Nuclear  Generating  Units  2  and  3,  the  Commission  determined  the  probability- 
weighted  consequences  of  severe  accidents  are  small  (10  CFR  Part  51 ,  Appendix  B,  Table  B-1 
[TN250]).  Because  of  the  NRC  safety  review  criteria,  it  is  expected  that  risks  for  any  new 
reactors  at  any  other  locations  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for  Site  4-1  would  be  below 
the  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  and  would  meet  Commission  safety  goals.  The  severe 
accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  becomes  smaller  as  the  distance  from 
that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  4-1  would 
be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  of  these  operating  nuclear  power  plants  and  would  still  be 
low. 

Finally,  a  single  U.S.  EPR  unit  has  been  proposed  for  the  Bell  Bend  site  next  to  the 
Susquehanna  Steam  Electric  Station.  According  to  the  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement 
for  the  Combined  License  for  Bell  Bend  Nuclear  Power  Plant,  NUREG-2179  (NRC  and  USACE 
2015-TN4278),  the  risks  from  the  proposed  Bell  Bend  Nuclear  Power  Plant  would  also  be  well 
below  the  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  and  would  meet  the  Commission’s  safety  goals. 

The  postulated  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  gets  smaller  as  the 
distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of 
Site  4-1  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  operating  and  proposed  nuclear  power 
plants.  Even  though  there  would  be  potentially  several  plants  included  in  the  combination,  this 
combined  risk  would  still  be  low.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
risks  of  postulated  accidents  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  4-1  would  be  SMALL. 

9.3.3  Site  7-1 

This  section  covers  the  review  team  evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  siting  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site  designated  as  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey, 
located  about  15  mi  north-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  (see  Figure  9-1).  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield 
site  that  is  not  owned  by  PSEG.  The  site  is  located  about  5  mi  from  the  Delaware  River,  which 
would  be  the  source  of  cooling  water  for  new  nuclear  units  at  this  site.  The  site  has  a  total  area 
of  987  ac. 

As  indicated  by  PSEG,  the  use  of  Site  7-1  would  require  infrastructure  upgrades  and 
improvements,  as  follows  (PSEG  2015-TN4280): 

•  Portions  of  the  public  roads  that  currently  provide  access  to  the  site  would  need  to  be 
relocated  around  plant  facilities  and/or  improved  to  increase  their  load-carrying  capacity.  An 
estimated  total  of  3.3  mi  of  road  building  would  be  required,  and  the  ROW  width  would  be 
150  ft. 

•  A  new  rail  spur  would  be  required  to  allow  delivery  of  materials  and  equipment  to  the  site. 
PSEG  has  identified  a  conceptual  route  and  alignment  for  this  new  rail  spur  that  would  be 
6.9  mi  long  and  would  require  a  ROW  width  of  150  ft.

•  A  new  water  supply  pipeline  would  need  to  be  installed  to  withdraw  water  from  the  Delaware 
River.  A  new  discharge  pipeline  would  also  need  to  be  installed  to  convey  blowdown  and 
wastewater  to  the  Delaware  River.  PSEG  assumed  that  the  two  new  pipelines  would  be 
installed  parallel  to  each  other  and  within  the  same  100-ft-wide  ROW.  The  estimated  length 
of  the  route  is  5.1  mi. 

•  Three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines  would  need  to  be  installed  to  connect  to  the  existing 
transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  these  three  new  lines  would  be  installed 
parallel  to  one  another,  each  within  a  200-ft  ROW.  The  length  of  these  three  new  lines 
would  be  5.4  mi. 

•  A  new  switchyard  would  be  required  at  the  connection  of  the  above  new  transmission  lines 
and  the  existing  transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  this  new  switchyard  would 
be  located  on  25  ac. 

The  following  sections  include  a  cumulative  impact  assessment  conducted  for  each  major 
resource  area.  The  assessment  considered  the  specific  resources  and  components  that  could 
be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1,  including  the 
impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  and  operations  and  impacts  of  preconstruction 
activities.  Also  included  in  the  assessment  are  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
Federal.  non-Federal,  and  private  actions  in  the  same  geographical  area  that  could  have 
meaningful  cumulative  impacts  when  considered  together  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  if 
such  a  plant  were  to  be  built  and  operated  at  Site  7-1.  Other  actions  and  projects  considered  in 
this  cumulative  analysis  are  described  in  Table  9-15.

9.3.3. 1  Land  Use 
Affected  Environment 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.3,  Site  7-1  covers  987  ac  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 
(Figure  9-1).  Existing  land  use  at  Site  7-1  is  predominantly  agricultural,  with  large  areas  planted 
in  cultivated  crops.  Most  of  Site  7-1  is  zoned  for  agricultural  use,  and  soils  classified  as  prime 
farmland  or  Farmland  of  Statewide  Importance  occur  across  much  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

About  17  single-family  houses  and  an  active  church  and  a  cemetery  are  located  within  the 
Site  7-1  boundaries.  Also,  although  the  site  is  located  about  4  mi  from  the  nearest  incorporated 
town,  there  are  small  groups  of  houses  within  1  mi  of  the  site.  There  are  no  significant  industrial 
land  uses  on  Site  7-1  or  in  close  proximity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

According  to  the  2012  State  of  New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture  GIS  mapping  conducted 
by  PSEG,  a  total  of  1 96.8  ac  within  the  Site  7-1  boundaries  (19.9  percent  of  the  total  987  ac)  are 
designated  County  Preserved  Farmlands  under  the  State  Farmland  Preservation  Program 
(PSEG  2012-TN2282)  (Figure  9-7).  The  GIS  mapping  indicates  that  there  are  two  County 
Preserved  Farmland  parcels  within  Site  7-1,  both  located  southwest  of  the  intersection  of 
Haines  Neck  Road  and  Marshalltown  Road.  PSEG  conducted  a  review  of  deeds  for  the  parcel 
identified  as  Block  25,  Lot  14,  and  verified  the  presence  of  a  permanent  Deed  of  Easement  on 
the  property.  The  PSEG  review  of  deeds  for  the  parcel  identified  as  Block  25,  Lot  13,  verified 
an  Eight-Year  Preservation  on  the  property  recorded  December  2003.  PSEG  found  no 
evidence  that  this  second  property  is  still  in  the  Farmland  Preservation  Program  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282). 

The  offsite  corridors  for  the  access  roads,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  to  Site  7-1 ,  as  well  as 
the  short  connector  transmission  line  from  Site  7-1  to  the  grid,  would  be  largely  confined  to  the 
immediate  site  vicinity.  Land  uses  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  the  site  itself,  with  most 
of  the  land  in  agricultural  use  and  residences  scattered  throughout  the  area.  There  are  no 
significant  industrial  land  uses  within  the  offsite  corridors  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Building  Impacts 

According  to  PSEG,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  directly  disturb 
(temporarily  and  permanently)  a  total  of  432  ac  on  the  site.  The  remaining  land  within  the 
Site  7-1  boundaries  (555  ac)  would  not  be  directly  disturbed,  but  access  to  this  land  would  be 
controlled  and  it  would  be  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  the  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In 
addition,  developing  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for  Site  7-1  would 
disturb  246  ac  off  the  site.  Therefore,  a  total  of  1 ,233  ac,  not  including  transmission  line  corridors, 
would  be  disturbed  or  made  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-1 .  Land-use 
disturbances  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  and  the  access  road, 
rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  to  support  the  plant  include  impacts  to  about  971  ac  of  planted/ 
cultivated  land,  14  ac  of  developed  land,  46  ac  of  barren  land,  1 16  ac  of  forestland,  1  ac  of  estuarine 
and  marine  deepwater  areas,  8  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  86  ac  of  freshwater 
forested/shrub  wetland,  and  19  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

It  is  likely  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  connect  with  the  potential 
transmission  line  corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints 
within  the  PJM  region  (see  Section  7.0).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  a  connector 
transmission  line  from  Site  7-1  to  the  new  grid  stability  line.  Land-use  disturbances  associated 
with  building  this  5.4-mi-long  connector  line  for  Site  7-1  would  include  about  141  ac  of  planted/ 
cultivated  land,  5  ac  of  developed  land,  9  ac  of  barren  land,  63  ac  of  forested  land,  59  ac  of 
estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area,  70  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  6  ac  of 
freshwater  emergent  wetland,  90  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  9  ac  of  other 
wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site  7-1  has  an  existing  site  elevation  between  15  and  35  ft  MSL.  PSEG  estimated  the 
excavation  and  fill  quantities  for  Site  7-1  based  on  the  quantities  needed  to  raise  the  site  to 
12  ft  above  site  grade  (to  a  final  grade  elevation  of  about  36.9  ft  MSL)  to  provide  adequate  final 
grade  elevation  to  preclude  flooding.  PSEG  estimates  that  the  total  fill  quantity  for  Site  7-1 
would  be  4.6  million  yd3,  with  1 .0  million  yd3  of  Category  1  fill  and  3.6  million  yd3  of  Category  2 
fill.  PSEG  has  stated  that  the  fill  material  for  Site  7-1  could  come  from  the  same  sources  as  the 
fill  material  for  the  PSEG  Site  (i.e.,  existing  permitted  borrow  sites  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and 
Maryland).  However,  PSEG  would  conduct  testing  to  determine  whether  the  material  excavated 
from  Site  7-1  could  be  reused  as  fill  at  the  site  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-1  would  be 
sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the 
site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Building  a  new  plant  would  directly  disturb  432  ac  of  land  and  eliminate 
access  to  and  use  of  another  555  ac  of  land  that  currently  supports  productive  agricultural  and 
rural  residential  uses.  Building  the  new  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for 
Site  7-1  would  disturb  an  additional  246  ac  of  similar  land  uses  off  the  site.  Further,  developing 
the  new  connector  transmission  corridor  from  Site  7-1  to  the  new  grid  stability  lines  would 
disturb  an  additional  412  ac  of  similar  offsite  land  uses.  In  comparison,  there  are  about 
41 ,353  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  9,828  ac  of  developed  land,  2,261  ac  of  barren  land, 

13,015  ac  of  forested  land,  10,170  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area,  5,197  ac  of 
estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  2,262  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  12,610  ac  of 
freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  3,382  ac  of  other  wetlands  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1

(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  land-use  changes  resulting  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1  would  not  noticeably  affect  these  land-use  resources.  However,  building  a  new 
plant  on  Site  7-1  would  require  that  most  of  the  17  houses  within  the  site  boundaries  be 
removed  and  that  any  residents  be  relocated,  that  access  to  an  active  church  and  a  cemetery 
be  restricted  (if  not  eliminated),  and  that  196.8  ac  of  County  Preserved  Farmlands  be 
developed. 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  on  and  off  the  site  for  Site  7-1  would  be  noticeable.  The  review  team  reaches  this 
conclusion  as  a  result  of  the  relocation  of  17  residences  and  the  restriction  of  access  to  an 
active  church  and  a  cemetery,  which  would  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important 
attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity. 

Operational  Impacts 

The  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  smaller  than 
the  impacts  of  building  the  plant,  but  they  would  still  permanently  eliminate  almost  all  access  to 
and  use  of  1,233  ac  of  land  (not  including  transmission  corridors)  that  supports  productive 
agricultural  uses,  rural  residential  uses,  and  an  active  church  and  cemetery.  Most  of  these 
impacts  would  occur  during  the  building  period  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  no  additional 
land-use  impacts  from  operations  would  be  expected.  Additionally,  there  are  sufficient 
agricultural  and  residential  land-use  resources  in  the  vicinity,  and  the  impacts  would  be  minimal. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team  independent 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  negligible. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  includes  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (in  which  Site  7-1  is 
located)  and  the  other  24  counties  located  in  the  50-mi  region  around  the  site.  The  50-mi  region 
includes  counties  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland.  The  direct  and 
indirect  impacts  to  land  use  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 
would  be  confined  to  Salem  County,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  when  combined 
with  other  actions  (discussed  below)  would  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey.  Delaware, 
Maryland,  and  Pennsylvania. 

Table  9-15  lists  projects  that,  in  combination  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1,  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  in  the  region.  One  of  the  projects 
closest  to  Site  7-1  would  be  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS.  In  201 1 .  the  NRC 
issued  new  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Unit  1  (expires  2036),  SGS  Unit  2  (expires  2040),  and 
HCGS  (expires  2046).  The  cumulative  land-use  impact  would  result  from  the  combined 
commitment  of  land  for  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-1  (987  ac)  with  the  land  already  dedicated  to  SGS 
and  HCGS  (734  ac).  Although  this  would  represent  a  relatively  large  land-use  impact  in  Salem 
County,  the  cumulative  impact  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  would  be  relatively  small. 

The  only  other  nuclear  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  within  the  50-mi  region  are  Peach  Bottom 
Units  2  and  3  (located  45  mi  northwest  of  Site  7-1 )  and  Limerick  Generating  Station

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Units  1  and  2  (located  40  mi  north  of  Site  7-1 ).  Because  the  Peach  Bottom  and  Limerick 
projects  are  located  so  far  from  Site  7-1 ,  the  cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  their  continued 
operation  and  development  of  Site  7-1  would  be  relatively  minor  in  the  regional  context. 

Another  project  that  could  occur  in  relatively  close  proximity  to  Site  7-1  is  the  USACE  Delaware 
River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project.  In  this  project,  the  USACE  is  conducting  dredging 
operations  to  deepen  a  section  of  the  Delaware  River,  including  the  portion  of  the  river  adjacent 
to  the  existing  PSEG  property  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  The  primary  land-use  impact  of  this 
deepening  project  would  be  the  USACE  use  of  some  of  the  existing  confined  disposal  facilities 
(CDFs)  along  the  Delaware  River  for  the  disposal  of  dredge  materials.  The  total  dredging 
operation  would  generate  an  estimated  16  million  yd3  of  spoil  material.  The  USACE  NEPA 
documentation  for  the  channel  deepening  project  (USACE  1997-TN2281;  USACE  2009- 
TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262)  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  significant  land-use  impacts 
from  the  project. 

A  third  project  that  could  occur  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-1  is  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM 
region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  identifies  a  new  5-mi-wide  transmission  “macro- 
corridor”  known  as  the  “West  Macro-Corridor”  (WMC).  The  WMC  is  55  mi  long  and  generally 
follows  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from  the  existing  PSEG  property  to  the  Peach 
Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  considers  this  WMC  to  be 
“the  most  effective  route  for  addressing  the  regional  voltage  and  stability  constraints  that  PJM  is 
trying  to  resolve”  (PSEG  2013-TN2669). 

In  its  ER,  PSEG  cites  a  GIS  analysis  that  assumes  a  5-mi-wide  hypothetical  macro-corridor  and 
a  transmission  line  ROW  width  of  200  ft  within  the  corridor  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  PSEG 
analysis  did  not  identify  a  specific  200-ft-wide  ROW  within  the  hypothetical  corridor  but 
calculated  the  amount  of  each  land-use  type  that  could  be  affected  in  a  200-ft-wide  ROW  based 
on  each  land-use  type  as  a  percentage  of  total  land  use  within  the  corridor.  However,  PJM  has 
not  selected  a  specific  route  for  the  potential  new  transmission  line.  The  review  team  has 
determined,  based  on  the  analysis  performed  by  PSEG  and  the  land  uses  that  could  be 
affected,  that  a  new  transmission  line  could  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  land  uses  within  the 
region. 

Most  of  the  other  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  are  not  expected  to  create  noticeable  cumulative 
impacts  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  when  combined  with  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 .  The  other  energy  projects  listed  in  Table  9-1 5  (the  closest 
being  Carneys  Point  Generating  Plant  and  Pedricktown  Combined  Cycle  Cogeneration  Plant) 
are  all  too  far  from  Site  7-1  and  from  each  other  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use 
impacts  in  the  region.  The  new  development/redevelopment  project  listed  (Camp  Pedricktown 
Redevelopment)  also  is  too  far  from  Site  7-1  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in 
the  region.  The  parks  and  recreation  activities  listed  (the  closest  being  Supawna  Meadows 
National  Wildlife  Refuge,  Fort  Mott  State  Park,  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA)  are  not  expected  to 
contribute  to  adverse  land-use  impacts,  especially  on  the  regional  scale.  Finally,  the  Salem 
County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  project  listed  in  Table  9-15  is  located  too  far  from  Site  7-1  to  create 
noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.

The  GCRP  report  Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472) 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions,  and  Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
report  indicates  that  climate  change  could  increase  precipitation,  sea  level,  and  storm  surges  in 
the  Northeast  region,  thus  changing  land  use  through  the  inundation  of  low-lying  areas  that  are 
not  buffered  by  high  cliffs.  However,  cliffs  could  experience  increased  rates  of  erosion  as  a 
result  of  frequent  storm  surges,  flooding  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  Forest  growth  could 
increase  as  a  result  of  more  CO2  in  the  atmosphere.  Existing  parks,  reserves,  and  managed 
areas  would  help  preserve  wetlands  and  forested  areas  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not  affected 
by  the  same  factors.  In  addition,  climate  change  could  reduce  crop  yields  and  livestock 
productivity,  which  might  change  portions  of  agricultural  land  uses  in  the  region  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472).  Thus,  direct  changes  resulting  from  climate  change  could  cause  a  shift  in  land  use  in 
the  50-mi  region  that  would  contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-1 . 

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 
(along  with  the  new  connector  transmission  line  corridor)  would  be  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably, 
but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  site  and 
the  larger  50-mi  region.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review 
team  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  land-use  impacts  of 
developing  Site  7-1  would  be  MODERATE.  The  incremental  contribution  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the 
cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 3. 2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

The  following  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  at  Site  7-1. 

The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  actions,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in 
Table  9-15,  that  could  affect  water  use  and  quality. 

The  potentially  affected  surface-water  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  which 
would  be  affected  by  water  withdrawn  from  and  wastewater  discharged  to  the  river.  Site  7-1  is  a 
987-ac  greenfield  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  located  on  undeveloped  land  5  mi  east  of 
the  Delaware  River  and  about  1 3  mi  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Site  7-1  is  flat  with  elevations 
across  the  site  ranging  from  15  to  35  ft  MSL.  PSEG  has  stated  that  the  Delaware  River  would 
be  the  primary  source  of  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  reach  adjacent  to 
Site  7-1  lies  in  DRBC  water-quality  Zone  5,  which  is  the  same  zone  within  which  the  PSEG  Site 
is  located. 

Flow  data  for  the  Delaware  River  at  USGS  Gaging  Station  01463500  at  Delaware  RM  131.0, 
near  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  are  described  in  Section  2.3.  This  gaging  station  is  located  more 
than  60  mi  upstream  of  the  Site  7-1  conceptual  water  intake  location  at  RM  67.9.  The  mean 
annual  river  flow  at  the  Trenton  gage  is  12,004  cfs.  Mean  annual  flow  during  the  historic  low- 
water  period  of  1961-1967  was  7,888  cfs,  with  the  minimum  monthly  flow  of  1,548  cfs  recorded 
in  July  1965.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


As  mentioned  in  Section  2.3,  the  Coastal  Plain  deposits  dip  and  thicken  to  the  southeast  toward 
the  coast.  Site  7-1  is  located  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and  as  a  result,  the  hydrogeologic 
environment  is  somewhat  different.  In  its  ER,  the  applicant  indicated  that  “plant  groundwater 
requirements  could  be  supplied  by  one  or  two  wells  drilled  to  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey”  aquifer 
system  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  However,  this  unit  is  thought  not  to  exist  or  to  be  very  thin  at  the 
site.  Because  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site  located  away  from  the  Delaware  River,  there  is  no 
hydraulic  fill  or  alluvium.  USGS  studies  (Martin  1998-TN2259;  dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948) 
indicate  that  in  north-central  Salem  County  the  uppermost  aquifer  is  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel 
and  that  this  unit  outcrops  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1 .  The  major  withdrawal  centers  for  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  are  outside  the  outcrop  area  to  the  east.  Site  7-1  falls  outside 
this  usage  area.  As  a  result,  it  is  unlikely  that  groundwater  from  this  aquifer  would  be  used  for 
plant  needs. 

As  indicated  by  dePaul  et  al.  (2009-TN2948),  salinity  within  the  upper  and  middle  Potomac- 
Raritan-Magothy  (PRM)  aquifers  in  the  Site  7-1  area  is  below  the  drinking  water  standard 
(250  mg/L).  These  aquifers  outcrop  to  the  north  at  the  Delaware  River  and  each  aquifer 
supplies  in  excess  of  1  million  gallons  of  water  per  year  near  Site  7-1 .  Regional  pumping  of  the 
middle  PRM  has  drawn  down  water  levels  about  17  ft  in  a  USGS  observation  well  near  Site  7-1, 
and  salinity  within  the  lower  PRM  aquifer  is  at  or  above  250  mg/L  in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  If  the 
PRM  aquifer  were  to  be  used,  groundwater  needed  for  construction  and  operation  of  Site  7-1 
would  likely  be  obtained  from  the  upper  or  middle  PRM  aquifers. 

Building  Impacts 

Impacts  to  surface  waters  from  building  activities  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the 
proposed  PSEG  Site  and  may  occur  from  site-preparation  and  plant  building  activities.  Potential 
impacts  to  surface  water  would  result  from  physical  alteration  of  surface-water  bodies  because 
of  installation  of  intake  and  discharge  structures;  alteration  of  land  surface  and  surface-water 
drainage  pathways;  potential  for  increased  runoff  from  the  site  area  that  may  include  additional 
sediment  load  and  building-related  pollutants;  and  potential  for  impacts  to  wetlands,  floodplains, 
and  surface-water  bodies  from  building  transmission  lines.  Additional  disturbance  to  the 
shoreline  and  river  bottom  may  occur  from  building  a  new  barge  docking  facility,  if  needed.  The 
offsite  building  activities  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  include  building  the  rail 
spur,  access  roads,  and  other  offsite  facilities.  Impacts  from  these  activities  are  expected  to  be 
managed  as  described  in  Section  4.2  for  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  and  would  be  minor. 

PSEG  has  proposed  in  Section  9.3.2  of  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  to  withdraw  surface  water 
or  groundwater  for  building  activities.  The  review  team  assumes  that  the  water  use  for  building 
activities  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  that  for  the  PSEG  Site.  As  estimated  by  PSEG  in 
Section  4.2  of  its  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  water  use  to  support  concrete  plant  operations, 
dust  suppression,  and  potable  water  needs  would  be  1 19  gpm.  Because  water  quality  in  the 
Delaware  River  is  brackish  near  Site  7-1 ,  potable  and  sanitary  use  of  the  river  water  is  not 
expected. 

Dewatering  of  the  plant  area  and  the  nuclear  island  foundation  would  also  likely  be  required  to 
limit  inflow  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  during  construction  at  Site  7-1 .  Because 
this  aquifer  is  unconfined  and  productive  at  Site  7-1,  it  is  assumed  that  dewatering  flow  rates 


NUREG-2168 


9-116

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


would  be  reduced  through  the  use  of  vertical  low-permeability  barriers,  which  would  also  limit 
the  horizontal  effects  of  dewatering.  It  is  assumed  that  the  extracted  groundwater  would  be 
managed  and  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  the  permit  requirements. 

As  mentioned  above,  the  upper  and  middle  PRM  aquifers  could  supply  water  required  for 
building  at  Site  7-1.  Impacts  from  groundwater  use  and  dewatering  during  construction 
activities  would  be  limited  due  to  the  temporary  time  frame  of  construction.  In  addition, 
construction-related  pumping  would  be  bounded  by  the  impacts  from  pumping  to  support  plant 
operation.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  groundwater-use  impacts  of  building  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  water-quality-related  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  expected  for  any  other 
large  project.  Alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  would  occur  during  installation  of  the  makeup 
water  intake  structure  and  the  wastewater  discharge  structure.  During  installation  of  these 
structures,  some  additional  turbidity  in  the  river  is  expected  because  of  disturbance  of  bottom 
sediments.  However,  these  sediments  would  be  localized  to  the  area  needed  to  install  the 
structures  and  engineering  measures  would  be  in  place  as  part  of  BMPs  to  minimize  movement 
of  the  disturbed  sediment  beyond  the  immediate  work  area.  These  impacts  would  also  be 
temporary  and  would  not  occur  after  the  structures  are  installed.  Because  these  activities  would 
occur  in  waters  of  the  United  States,  appropriate  permits  from  the  USACE  and  NJDEP  would  be 
required.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  implement  BMPs  to  control  erosion  and  sedimentation 
and  discharge  of  building-related  pollutants  to  the  Delaware  River  or  to  nearby  water  bodies. 
Because  the  effects  from  building-related  activities  would  be  minimized  using  BMPs,  would  be 
temporary  and  localized,  and  would  be  controlled  under  various  permits,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  impact  from  building-related  activities  on  the  water  quality  of  the  Delaware 
River  and  nearby  water  bodies  would  be  minor. 

During  building  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1,  groundwater  quality  may  be 
affected  by  leaching  of  spilled  effluents  into  the  subsurface.  The  review  team  assumes  that  the 
BMPs  PSEG  has  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  also  be  in  place  at  Site  7-1  during  building 
activities,  and  therefore  the  review  team  concludes  that  any  spills  would  be  quickly  detected  and 
remediated.  In  addition,  groundwater  impacts  would  be  limited  to  the  duration  of  these  activities 
and  therefore  would  be  temporary.  Because  any  spills  related  to  building  activities  would  be 
quickly  remediated  under  BMPs,  the  activities  would  be  temporary,  and  pumping  rates  would  be 
greater  during  operations  than  during  building,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  groundwater- 
quality  impacts  from  building  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minimal 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  surface  water  would  be  withdrawn 
from  the  Delaware  River  to  provide  makeup  water  to  the  new  plant  CWS.  Because  water 
quality  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Site  7-1  is  brackish,  similar  to  that  at  the  PSEG  Site,  it  is 
assumed  that  the  withdrawal  rate  and  the  consumptive  use  rate  at  Site  7-1  would  be  the  same 
as  that  at  the  PSEG  Site:  78,196  gpm  (174.2  cfs)  and  26,420  gpm  (58.9  cfs),  respectively.  As 
described  in  Section  5.2,  applying  an  equivalent  impact  factor  of  0.18  to  account  for  the  salinity 
of  the  withdrawn  river  water  makes  the  water  consumption  equivalent  to  a  freshwater 
consumption  of  4,756  gpm  (10.6  cfs).  This  equivalent  freshwater  consumptive  use  is

0.1  percent  of  the  mean  annual  flow  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  during  the  historic  low-water 
period  of  1961-1967  (7,888  cfs)  and  0.7  percent  of  the  minimum  monthly  flow  (1 ,548  cfs) 
recorded  in  July  1965.  Assuming  similar  tidal  flows  at  Site  7-1  and  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site, 
the  total  consumptive  losses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be 
less  than  0.01  percent  of  the  tidal  flows.  Because  of  the  similarity  of  Site  7-1  to  the  PSEG  Site, 
the  review  team  determined  that  water-use  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
The  review  team  also  determined  that  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  465  ac-ft  or 
6.9  percent  of  its  currently  allocated  storage  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  to  meet  instream  flow 
targets  during  a  DRBC-declared  drought.  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  has  a  storage  capacity  of 
46,000  ac-ft,  far  exceeding  that  needed  to  meet  the  465  ac-ft  exceedance.  In  addition,  DRBC 
allows  for  temporary  or  permanent  acquisition  of  releases  from  other  owners  of  Merrill  Creek 
reservoir  storage  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  determined  that 
surface-water  use  for  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  met  without  a 
noticeable  impact  to  the  instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware  River.  Therefore,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  the  surface-water-use  impact  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-1  would  be  minor. 

Because  Site  7-1  is  located  near  the  PSEG  Site,  Delaware  River  water  quality,  flow 
characteristics,  and  river  cross  section  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  water-quality  impacts  from  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  those  determined  for  the  PSEG  Site 
in  Section  5.2.3  and  that  the  surface-water-quality  impacts  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minor. 

Groundwater  withdrawal,  as  indicated  in  Section  9.3.2  of  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  would 
be  necessary  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses  because  the  Delaware  River  water  is  brackish 
in  the  Site  7-1  area.  For  the  sake  of  consistency  in  comparison,  it  was  assumed  that  the 
amount  of  groundwater  withdrawal  for  general  site  purposes  including  the  potable  and  sanitary 
water  system,  demineralized  water  distribution  system,  fire  protection  system,  and  other 
miscellaneous  systems  at  Site  7-1  would  be  the  same  as  that  required  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As 
discussed  in  ER  Section  3.3  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  an  average  of  210  gpm  and  a  maximum  of 
953  gpm  would  be  needed  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses.  This  water  would  likely  be 
supplied  from  pumping  of  the  upper  or  middle  PRM  aquifers.  As  discussed  in  Section  5. 2. 2. 2, 
an  independent  evaluation  completed  by  the  review  team  indicated  that  pumping  of  the  middle 
PRM  aquifer  at  rates  proposed  by  the  applicant  could  draw  down  water  levels  within  that  aquifer 
16.6  ft  at  a  distance  of  3  mi  from  the  site.  As  mentioned  above,  groundwater  levels  have 
already  been  drawn  down  about  17  ft  near  Site  7-1  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  According  to 
ER  Figure  2.3-20,  existing  groundwater  production  wells  could  be  located  as  close  as  1  mi  from 
Site  7-1 ,  much  closer  than  the  existing  offsite  groundwater  wells  nearest  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Therefore,  the  impact  of  potential  pumping  on  the  nearest  offsite  wells 
would  be  greater  at  Site  7-1  than  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  would  be  noticeable. 

During  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  impacts  on  groundwater  quality 
could  result  from  accidental  spills.  Because  BMPs  would  be  used  to  quickly  remediate  spills 
and  no  intentional  discharge  to  groundwater  would  occur,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
groundwater-quality  impacts  from  accidental  spills  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minimal.  Groundwater 
withdrawal  for  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  likely  be  from  the  upper  or  middle  PRM

aquifers,  which  outcrop  at  the  Delaware  River  east  and  north  of  Site  7-1 .  Although  salinity  is 
currently  below  drinking  water  standards  in  the  region  between  Site  7-1  and  the  outcrop  areas, 
additional  pumping  may  increase  salinity  somewhat  within  the  aquifers  where  they  are 
recharged  by  the  river.  Because  Site  7-1  is  more  than  5  mi  from  the  Delaware  River,  the  review 
team  expects  that  any  salinity  increases  from  pumping  at  the  site  would  be  minor  and  would  be 
localized  to  areas  near  the  river.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  groundwater-quality 
impacts  from  the  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  entire  Delaware  River  Basin.  In  addition  to  water-use  and 
water-quality  impacts  from  building  and  operations  activities,  this  cumulative  analysis  considers 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect  the  same  water 
resources.  The  actions  and  projects  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1  that  are  considered  in  this 
cumulative  analysis  are  listed  in  Table  9-15. 

The  review  team  is  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  the  water  resources 
available  for  cooling  and  the  impacts  of  reactor  operations  on  water  resources  for  other  users. 
Because  Site  7-1  is  located  near  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  the  potential  changes  in  climate 
would  be  similar  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Therefore  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impact 
of  climate  change  on  water  resources  would  be  similar  to  that  for  the  proposed  site. 

Cumulative  Water-Use  Impacts 

Based  on  a  review  of  the  history  of  water-use  and  water-resources  planning  in  the  Delaware 
River  Basin,  the  review  team  determined  that  past  and  present  use  of  the  surface  waters  in  the 
basin  has  been  noticeable,  necessitating  consideration,  development,  and  implementation  of 
careful  planning. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15,  consumptive  water  use  by  SGS  and  HCGS  were  considered 
by  the  review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  surface-water  impacts.  Because  the  water  quality 
and  potential  consumptive  use  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to 
those  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  6.9  percent  of  its  current 
allocation  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir.  As  stated  in  Section  5.2.2,  the  review  team  determined 
that  obtaining  this  additional  allocation  was  feasible  and  would  ensure  that  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  could  operate  without  noticeable  impacts  to  other  water  users  even  under  declared 
drought  conditions  and  without  the  need  to  release  additional  flows  to  meet  instream  flow 
targets  in  the  Delaware  River. 

Mainly  because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  use  from  past  and 
present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be 
MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant’s  incremental 
contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  would  not  be  significant. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15,  regional  groundwater  withdrawal  was  considered  by  the 
review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  groundwater  impacts.  The  two  business  parks  listed  in

Table  9-15  would  most  likely  be  connected  to  the  municipal  water  supply.  Other  projects  do  not 
use  groundwater  or  are  too  far  from  Site  7-1  to  interact  with  groundwater  use  at  the  site. 
However,  as  mentioned  above,  production  wells  could  be  located  as  close  as  1  mi  from  the 
alternative  site  and  groundwater-use  impact  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  noticeable.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
impact  on  groundwater  use  would  be  MODERATE,  and  a  new  plant’s  incremental  contribution 
to  this  impact  would  be  significant. 

Cumulative  Water-Quality  Impacts 

As  stated  in  Section  7.2.2. 1,  DRBC  has  implemented  careful  planning  and  regulation  of  water 
quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  Although  there  have  been  improvements  in  water  quality  in 
the  Delaware  River  Basin  because  of  careful  planning  and  management  policies  put  in  place  by 
DRBC  (e.g.,  improved  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen),  the  presence  of  toxic  compounds  leads  to 
advisories  for  fish  consumption  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  In  its  review  of  the  PSEG  license 
renewal  application  for  SGS  and  HCGS,  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  water  quality  will  likely 
continue  to  be  adversely  affected  by  human  activities  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (NRC  2011- 
TN3131).  The  review  team  concludes  that  past  and  present  actions  in  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  have  resulted  in  noticeable  impacts  to  water  quality. 

The  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  may  result  in  alterations  to  land  surface,  surface-water 
drainage  pathways,  and  water  bodies.  These  projects  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local 
permits  that  would  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  Therefore,  the  impacts  to  surface-water 
quality  from  these  projects  are  not  expected  to  be  noticeable.  The  discharge  for  a  plant  at 
Site  7-1  would  be  located  at  Delaware  RM  67.9,  about  17  mi  from  the  SGS  discharge  and 
outside  the  SGS  thermal  plume  heat  dissipation  area  (HDA).  The  area  affected  by  the  thermal 
plume  from  a  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  small,  would  be  localized  near  the  discharge  outlet,  and 
would  not  interact  with  the  thermal  plumes  from  SGS.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined 
the  cumulative  impact  of  the  combined  discharges  from  SGS  and  a  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  not 
be  noticeable. 

Because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  from  past  and  present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-1  would  be  MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant’s 
incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  would  not  be  significant. 

Based  on  the  proposed  or  possible  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15,  additional  impacts  to 
groundwater  quality  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  two  business  parks  may  rely  on 
groundwater  for  drinking  water  but  would  most  likely  be  connected  to  the  municipal  water 
supply.  Similarly,  the  business  parks  are  expected  to  be  connected  to  the  municipal  sewerage 
system  and  would  not  significantly  impact  groundwater  quality.  As  discussed  earlier,  BMPs 
would  be  implemented  and  dewatering  and  pumping  within  the  Site  7-1  area  are  unlikely  to 
induce  flow  from  an  area  of  higher  salinity  into  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  or  PRM  aquifers. 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.2,  groundwater  withdrawals  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest 
have  noticeably  altered  the  groundwater  quality  in  localized  areas  where  pumping  occurs  near 
aquifer  recharge  areas.  Pumping  near  the  PRM  aquifer  recharge  areas  is  localized  and  not

likely  to  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  near  the  site.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes 
that  the  cumulative  groundwater-quality  impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
future  projects,  as  well  as  climate  change,  would  be  MODERATE,  and  a  new  plant’s 
incremental  contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  would  not  be  significant. 

9. 3. 3. 3  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources 

The  following  analysis  includes  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting 
from  building  activities  and  operations  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-1. 
The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
may  impact  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-15. 

Site  Description 

Site  7-1  is  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  This  is  a  flat  greenfield  site  located  5  mi  east 
of  the  Delaware  River,  which  would  act  as  the  primary  water  source.  The  elevations  on  the  site 
range  from  1 5  to  35  ft  above  MSL.  This  site  is  a  total  of  987  ac  in  area  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains  Landscape  Region.  This  region  contains 
important  freshwater  tidal  waters  and  brackish  waters  of  the  upper  estuary  system  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The  tidal  freshwater  marshes  are  considered 
among  New  Jersey's  most  rare  and  valuable  habitat  types.  Additionally,  the  Southern  Piedmont 
Plains  contains  important  grassland  components  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  system 
including  fens,  wet  meadows,  impounded  agricultural  lands,  and  upland  agricultural  lands.  This 
zone  is  farmed  extensively;  however,  the  area  still  contains  relatively  large  forest  and  wetland 
complexes  in  some  locations.  The  terrestrial  species  of  concern  in  the  Southern  Piedmont 
Plains  are  primarily  found  in  wetland,  forest,  or  grassland  habitats  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  ecological  conditions  for  Site  7-1  and  the  6-mi  vicinity  are  typical  of  the  extensively  farmed 
areas  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains.  Most  of  the  land  is  used  for  agriculture.  The  forested 
areas  consist  mainly  of  scattered  woodlots  and  strips  of  trees  along  streams.  Wetlands  are 
mainly  present  in  isolated  low  areas,  and  some  are  farmed.  There  are  virtually  no  grasslands  in 
the  area.  Offsite  corridors  for  access  roads,  the  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  are  largely 
restricted  to  the  6-mi  vicinity,  and  the  natural  habitats  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  those 
found  on  Site  7-1  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

No  site-specific  surveys  for  threatened  and  endangered  species  were  conducted  at  Site  7-1. 
Information  on  protected  and  rare  species  that  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1  was  obtained 
from  NJDEP  and  the  FWS  ECOS.  Four  Federally  listed  species  are  known  or  believed  to  occur 
in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  7-1 :  the  Federally  listed  swamp  pink  ( Helonias  bullata),  bog  turtle, 
northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis),  and  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa).  All 
four  of  the  Federally  listed  species  are  listed  as  threatened.  NJDEP  considers  all  Federally 
listed  species  as  endangered.  In  addition,  14  State-listed  endangered  species,  15  State-listed 
threatened  species,  and  76  species  listed  by  NJDEP  as  species  of  special  concern  or  regional 
priority  wildlife  species  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1  (FWS  2014-TN3333;  NJDEP  2008- 
TN3117).

The  NJDEP  information  shows  that  a  total  of  nine  listed  animal  species  and  one  listed  plant 
species  have  been  recorded  within  about  1  mi  of  Site  7-1.  The  nearby  Featherbed  Lane  WMA 
provides  habitat  for  one  additional  species  (Table  9-16)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Documentation 
of  the  actual  presence  of  any  of  these  species  on  the  site  and  along  offsite  corridors  would 
require  that  detailed  field  surveys  be  conducted.  NJDEP  data  also  note  the  presence  of  two 
Natural  Heritage  Priority  Sites  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1  (Table  9-16).  These  are  sites  with  specific 
habitats  that  contain  protected  and  rare  species.  Additionally,  there  is  one  plant  species, 
leatherwood  ( Dirca  palustris),  protected  under  the  Highlands  Water  Protection  and  Planning  Act 
(NJSA  13:20-1  et  seq.  -TN4310),  that  has  the  potential  to  be  on  Site  7-1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Wildlife  Sanctuaries,  Refuges,  and  Preserves 

There  are  a  few  wildlife  sanctuaries,  refuges,  and  preserves  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  7-1 
(Figure  9-8)  that  have  the  potential  to  be  affected  by  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear

Salem  River  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Salem  River  is  a  3,225-ac  WMA  located  in  Carneys  Point,  Mannington,  and  Pilesgrove 
Townships,  Salem  County.  This  WMA  has  a  parking  area  and  viewing  platform  that  overlooks 
an  expansive  marsh  along  Mannington  Creek.  The  WMA  provides  foraging  habitat  for  migratory 
waterfowl  such  as  snow  geese  ( Chen  caerulescens),  Ross’s  geese  ( Chen  rossii),  teal  ( Anas 
sp.),  and  other  ducks.  Additionally,  it  supports  passerines  and  raptor  species.  Other  wildlife 
that  occur  at  this  site  include  muskrats  ( Ondatra  zibethicus),  river  otters  ( Lontra  canadensis), 
and  groundhogs  ( Marmota  monax).  Fishing  and  hunting  are  allowed  on  the  WMA  during 
designated  seasons  (NJWLT  2014-TN3200). 

Featherbed  Lane  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Featherbed  Lane  is  a  190-ac  WMA  located  in  Pilesgrove  Township,  Salem  County.  Public 
access  to  this  WMA  is  restricted  to  April  15  through  September  1.  Roadside  bird  watching  is 
allowed  on  the  area  during  this  time  period.  The  WMA  contains  habitat  for  the 
State-endangered  vesper  sparrow  ( Pooecetes  gramineus ),  the  State-threatened  grasshopper 
sparrow  ( Ammodramus  savannarum),  bobolink  ( Dolichonyx  oryzivorus),  and  upland  sandpiper 
( Bartramia  longicauda)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Game  Branch  Preserve 


Game  Branch  is  a  391-ac  preserve  located  in  Carneys  Point  and  Oldman’s  Townships,  Salem 
County.  The  preserve  is  one  of  the  model  holdings  of  the  New  Jersey  Land  Trust.  It  is  a  critical 
area  for  local  and  migratory  wildlife.  It  has  some  of  the  most  extensive  wetland  forests  in  the 
region.  Game  Branch  Preserve  is  located  less  than  1  mi  from  the  Delaware  River  and  acts  as 
an  important  stopover  location  for  migratory  songbirds.  Areas  of  unfragmented  forest  provide 
nesting  habitat  for  interior  forest  species  including  scarlet  tanager  ( Piranga  olivacea)  and 
ovenbird  ( Seiurus  aurocapilla).  Shallow  seasonal  ponds  are  scattered  throughout  the  forested 
wetlands.  These  vernal  ponds  provide  habitat  requirements  for  frogs  and  salamanders  to 
breed.  There  are  several  old  agricultural  fields  on  the  site  that  are  managed  specifically  to 
provide  wildlife  habitat.  The  trust  has  cleared  overgrown  brush  and  replanted  areas  with 
warm-season  grasses  aimed  at  promoting  northern  bobwhite  ( Colinus  virginianus)  habitat  using 
funds  from  the  Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service  Wildlife  Habitat  Incentives  Program 
(PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Building  Impacts 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  have  a  direct  impact  (permanently  and 
temporarily)  on  432  ac  of  land.  A  total  of  555  ac  of  land  within  the  site  boundaries  would  not  be 
directly  disturbed.  However,  certain  building  activities  would  result  in  indirect  disturbance 
(noise,  dust,  etc.)  to  much  of  the  area  within  the  site  boundaries.  This  could  result  in  additional 
wildlife  impacts  in  terms  of  affecting  movements  and  causing  further  displacement  from  the  site. 
The  development  of  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  would  result  in  the 
disturbance  of  an  additional  246  ac  of  potential  habitat.  In  total,  1 ,233  ac  of  potential  habitat 
would  be  directly  or  indirectly  impacted  as  a  result  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-1.  The  total  acreage  of  forest,  wetlands,  and  grassland  habitat  on  the  site  was  estimated

based  on  GIS  mapping  data.  Habitat  disturbances  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1  and  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  to  support  the  plant  include 
impacts  to  about  971  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  14  ac  of  developed  land,  46  ac  of  barren  land. 

1 16  ac  of  forestland,  1  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  areas,  8  ac  of  freshwater  emergent 
wetland,  86  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  19  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Site  7-1  could  connect  with  the  potential  transmission  line  corridor  that  could  be  developed  to 
address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM  region  (see  Section  7.0).  PSEG  would 
need  to  develop  a  connector  line  that  would  extend  5.4  mi  from  Site  7-1  to  the  grid  stability 
transmission  line  and  disturb  a  total  of  412  ac  off  the  site.  Habitat  disturbances  associated  with 
building  a  new  transmission  line  for  Site  7-1  include  about  141  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land, 

5  ac  of  developed  land.  9  ac  of  barren  land,  63  ac  of  forested  land.  59  ac  of  estuarine  and 
marine  deepwater  area,  70  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  6  ac  of  freshwater  emergent 
wetland,  90  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  9  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  amount  of  habitat  that  would  be  potentially  impacted  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  Site  7-1  is  minor  in  comparison  with  the  acreage  of  similar  habitat  present  in  the  6-mi  vicinity. 
There  are  about  41 ,353  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  9,828  ac  of  developed  land,  2,261  ac  of 
barren  land,  13,015  ac  of  forested  land,  10,170  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area, 
5,197  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  2,262  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  12,610  ac 
of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  3.382  ac  of  other  wetlands  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of 
Site  7-1  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  In  addition,  onsite  habitat  is  generally  limited  to  areas  that  are 
relatively  small  and  isolated  from  larger  areas  of  habitat  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Therefore,  the 
impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  due  to  building  activities  are  expected  to  be 
negligible. 

There  is  the  potential  for  impacts  to  open  country  bird  species  (e.g..  bobolink,  eastern 
meadowlark,  grasshopper  sparrow,  and  vesper  sparrow)  and  those  that  frequent  smaller 
woodlots  (e.g.,  Cooper’s  hawk  [Accipiter  cooperii]).  Inadvertent  impacts  to  slower  moving 
species  (e.g.,  eastern  box  turtle  [Terrapene  Carolina  Carolina ])  are  also  a  possibility.  Such 
impacts  would  be  expected  to  be  minor  for  most  species  due  to  the  relatively  minimal  impacts  to 
natural  habitats  and  the  fact  that  there  are  extensive  areas  of  similar  habitats  in  the  6-mi  vicinity. 
However,  wetland  and  forested  areas  are  considered  important  resources  for  Federally  listed 
and  proposed  Federally  listed  species.  The  loss  of  about  114  ac  of  wetlands  and  1 16  ac  of 
forest  could  affect  the  Federally  listed  bog  turtle  and  the  proposed  Federally  listed  northern 
long-eared  bat.  Impacts  to  these  resources  could  warrant  mitigation.  Therefore,  impacts  to 
these  listed  species  as  a  result  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  could  be  noticeable,  but 
not  destabilizing. 

Both  of  the  identified  Natural  Heritage  Priority  Sites  are  more  than  1  mi  from  Site  7-1 ,  and 
neither  is  crossed  by  any  of  the  offsite  corridors.  Portions  of  Salem  River  WMA  would  border 
the  western  boundary  of  Site  7-1 .  It  has  not  been  determined  whether  building  offsite  support 
structures  such  as  the  transmission  line,  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  would  affect 
the  WMA.  Additionally,  wildlife  species  could  be  affected  by  the  nearby  building  activities.

However,  it  is  expected  that  neither  the  Natural  Heritage  Priority  Sites  nor  the  WMA  would  be 
significantly  affected  by  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-1. 

It  is  expected  that  a  project  of  this  size  would  result  in  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources,  including  habitat  loss,  fragmentation,  and  disturbance.  Building  a  nuclear  power 
plant  would  result  in  loss  of  available  onsite  habitat.  Noise,  lights,  and  dust  during  building 
activities  could  displace  species  in  adjacent  areas,  reducing  viable  habitat.  Less  mobile  species 
would  be  impacted  the  most  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1,  and  some 
mortalities  could  occur.  It  is  expected  that  most  wildlife  species  would  be  capable  of  moving  to 
habitat  in  adjacent  areas.  These  displaced  species  may  also  experience  further  impacts, 
resulting  from  increased  competition  for  more  limited  resources.  Adjacent  WMAs,  preserves, 
and  refuges  could  be  affected  by  increased  demand  for  limited  resources  as  a  result  of  species 
displacement.  Habitat  available  on  Site  7-1  is  common  to  Salem  County,  and  sufficient 
terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  resources  exist  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains.  However,  the 
loss  of  wetland  and  forest  habitat  important  to  Federally  listed  and  proposed  Federally  listed 
species  would  be  noticeable.  Thus,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impacts  from 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing. 

Operational  Impacts 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  that  may  result  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  include  those  associated  with  cooling  towers,  transmission 
system  structures,  maintenance  of  transmission  line  ROWs,  and  the  presence  of  nuclear  power 
plant  facilities  that  permanently  eliminate  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Operational  impacts 
would  be  similar  to  those  described  in  Section  5.3.1 ,  although  there  may  be  minor  differences 
as  a  result  of  topography,  climate,  and  elevation.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  the 
operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minimal. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Several  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  could  affect  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  in  ways  similar  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-1 .  Table  9-15  lists  these  projects,  and  a  description  of  their  contributions  to  cumulative 
impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  provided  below.  The  geographic  area  of  interest 
for  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  the  6-mi  vicinity  around  site  7-1  shown  in  Figure  9.8. 

The  Piedmont  Plains  suffered  nearly  50  percent  of  all  development  that  occurred  in  New  Jersey 
between  1984  and  1995.  Grassland,  wetland,  upland  forest,  and  estuarine  emergent  wetlands 
sustained  the  greatest  losses.  Although  the  area  has  suffered  extensive  losses  due  to 
development,  large  areas  of  smaller  fragmented  habitats  exist  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17).  WMAs 
and  parks  in  Table  9-15  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  further  adverse  impacts  to  terrestrial 
and  wetland  resources. 

Most  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  are  operational  and  have  resulted  in  the  conversion  of 
natural  areas  to  industrial  and  commercial  development.  These  past  actions  have  resulted  in 
loss  and/or  fragmentation  of  natural  habitat  and  displacement  of  wildlife.  These  projects  include 
operational  nuclear  power  plants  located  at  the  HCGS,  SGS,  Limerick  Generating  Station,  and 


NUREG-2168

Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  sites.  Additionally,  three  operational  fossil-fuel  power 
plants  and  the  Salem  County  solid-waste  landfill  would  continue  to  contribute  to  cumulative 
impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  The  development  and  operation  of  these  projects 
would  continue  to  reduce,  fragment,  and  degrade  natural  forest,  open  field,  and  wetland  habitats 
in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains.  Operational  projects  with  tall  structures,  such  as  the  cooling 
towers  at  HCGS,  would  cause  avian  and  bat  mortalities.  However,  the  projects  listed  are 
spread  throughout  the  region,  and  avian  and  bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collision  with  tall 
structures  would  not  cause  a  noticeable  effect  to  those  populations. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  NJLWD  projects  that  the  population  of 
Salem  County  will  increase  by  about  5  percent  between  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014- 
TN3332).  Future  urbanization  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural 
lands,  wetlands,  and  forested  areas.  Urbanization  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1  would  reduce  area 
in  natural  vegetation  and  open  space  and  decrease  connectivity  between  wetlands,  forests,  and 
other  wildlife  habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result  of  urbanization  would  result  in  added 
pressures  to  the  remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife  populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected 
that  these  activities  would  substantially  affect  the  overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel 
corridors  near  Site  7-1  or  the  general  extent  of  forested  areas  in  the  6-mi  vicinity. 

Other  reasonably  foreseeable  projects  planned  in  the  area  of  Site  7-1  that  could  add  to  the 
cumulative  impacts  include  a  site-redevelopment  project  as  the  result  of  a  Base  Realignment 
and  Closure  (BRAC)  for  Camp  Pedricktown  and  the  USACE  channel  deepening  project.  The 
Camp  Pedricktown  redevelopment  area  is  currently  developed/disturbed  and,  therefore,  would 
not  further  impact  any  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  The  USACE  channel  deepening 
project  involves  dredging  and  deepening  portions  of  the  main  channel  of  the  Delaware  River 
(USACE  201 1-TN2262).  Terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  could  be  affected  by  the  disposal  of 
dredging  materials,  which  could  potentially  require  new  disposal  facilities.  However,  the  USACE 
NEPA  documentation  for  the  channel  deepening  project  concludes  that  there  are  sufficient 
dredge  disposal  areas  in  the  region  and  there  would  be  no  significant  impacts  from  the  project 
(USACE  1997-TN2281 ;  USACE  2009-TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

The  third  project  with  the  potential  to  affect  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  the  proposed 
transmission  line  corridor  being  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the 
PJM  region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi- 
wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  WMC  and  transmission  line  ROW  that  extends  55  mi  from 
the  existing  PSEG  property  to  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania.  The  transmission  line 
ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide.  The  development  of  the  transmission 
line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  more  than  1 ,500  ac  of  land.  Habitats  that  could  be 
affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests,  mixed  forest,  agricultural 
land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  exact  amounts  of 
the  resources  are  not  known,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  project  would  cause  fragmentation  and 
degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  However,  the  corridor  would  be  expected  to 
follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  A  new  transmission  line  ROW  would  cause 
wildlife  mortalities  as  a  result  of  operations  and  maintenance.  However,  mortalities  would  not 
be  expected  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  wildlife  populations,  and  sufficient  terrestrial  and 
wetland  habitats  exist  elsewhere  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains.  PSEG  identified  more  than

27,000  ac  of  wetland  and  36,000  ac  of  forestland  resources  in  the  5-mi-wide  corridor  that  could 
be  traversed  by  the  potential  new  transmission  line  ROW.  It  is  unknown  exactly  how  much  of 
these  wetlands  and  forestlands  would  be  affected  by  the  ROW,  and  mitigation  may  be 
warranted.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  as  a  result  of  potential  losses  of  wetland 
resources,  the  impact  of  the  new  transmission  line  ROW  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources 
would  be  noticeable. 

The  report  on  climate  change  impacts  in  the  United  States  provided  by  GCRP  (2014-TN3472) 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions.  Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project  temperatures  to  rise  over  the  next  several  decades 
by  4.5°F  to  10°F  if  emissions  continue  or  3°F  to  6°F  if  emissions  are  reduced  substantially. 
Frequency,  intensity,  and  duration  of  heat  waves  are  projected  to  increase  under  both  of  the 
warming  scenarios  but  with  larger  increases  under  the  continuing  emissions  scenario.  Winters 
are  projected  to  be  much  shorter  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more  precipitation.  With  higher 
temperatures,  and  earlier  winter  and  spring  snow  melt,  seasonal  drought  risk  is  projected  to 
increase  in  summer  and  fall  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Increased  frequency  of  summer  heat  stress 
can  also  impact  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity  in  the  Northeast  region.  New  Jersey  is 
projected  to  experience  60  additional  days  above  90°F  by  mid-century  under  the  continuing 
emissions  scenario.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the  global  average  due  to  land 
subsidence,  with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected 
changes  could  potentially  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations. 
Large-scale  shifts  in  the  ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  animal 
migration  that  are  already  occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue. 

The  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-1,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities 
described  above,  would  noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities 
would  result  in  the  loss  or  modification  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats,  which  could  potentially 
affect  important  species  that  live  in  or  migrate  through  the  area.  For  these  reasons,  the  review 
team  has  concluded  that  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  in  conjunction  with  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  would  be  noticeable.  Building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  contribute  to  the  noticeable  impacts. 

Summary 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  were  evaluated  based  on  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  the  conceptual  layout  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  and  an 
independent  review  by  the  review  team.  Permanent  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
and  wildlife  would  result  in  some  localized  effects  on  these  resources.  However,  these 
resources  are  common  to  the  area,  and  impacts  would  be  minimal.  Any  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  temporarily  disturbed  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  return  to 
predisturbed  conditions.  The  potential  loss  of  habitat  important  to  Federally  listed  species  would 
be  a  noticeable  impact,  but  would  not  be  destabilizing.  Operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  conclusion  of  the 
review  team  is  that  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  and  wildlife,  including 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


threatened  and  endangered  species,  would  be  noticeable  in  the  surrounding  landscape  and 
therefore  MODERATE.  The  MODERATE  impact  level  is  based  on  the  potential  loss  and 
fragmentation  of  habitat  important  to  Federally  listed  species.  Building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 3. 4  Aquatic  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  on 
aquatic  ecology  resources  at  Site  7-1.  The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect  aquatic 
resources,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15.  In 
developing  this  EIS,  the  review  team  relied  on  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  the 
alternative  site  evaluation  in  accordance  with  ESRP  9.3  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Reconnaissance- 
level  information  is  data  that  are  readily  available  from  regulatory  and  resources  agencies  (e.g., 
NJDEP,  NMFS.  and  FWS)  and  other  public  sources  such  as  scientific  literature,  books,  and 
Internet  websites.  It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  site  visits  (NRC  2012- 
TN2498:  NRC  2012-TN2499:  NRC  2012-TN2855)  and  documents  provided  by  the  applicant. 

Affected  Environment 

The  affected  aquatic  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of 
Delaware  RM  67.9  and  numerous  salt  marsh  creek  systems  and  streams  on  and  near  Site  7-1 
(S&L  201 0-TN267 1 ).  The  water  withdrawal  rate  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  for  Site  7-1 
would  be  the  same  as  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (78,196  gpm)  because 
Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  same  DRBC  water-quality  zone.  Water  availability  issues  would  also 
be  the  same  as  with  the  PSEG  Site  in  that  an  additional  6.9  percent  of  the  Merrill  Creek 
reservoir  allocation  during  drought  conditions  would  be  needed,  as  described  in  Section  5.2.2. 
There  are  no  known  exceptional  aquatic  resources  at  Site  7-1  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Commercial/Recreational  Species 

Site  7-1  has  the  same  species  as  those  listed  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  Commercial 
fisheries  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  in  offshore  Atlantic  waters  for  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  include  American  Eel,  American  Shad  ( Alosa  sapidissima),  Atlantic  Croaker 
{Micropogonias  undulatus ),  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus),  Black  Drum  ( Pogonias 
cromis ),  Black  Sea  Bass  ( Centropristis  striata),  Bluefish  ( Pomatomus  saltatrix),  Butterfish 
(Peprilus  triacanthus),  Channel  Catfish,  Conger  Eel  {Conger  oceanicus),  Northern  Kingfish 
( Menticirrhus  saxatilis),  Northern  Searobin  ( Prionotus  carolinus),  Scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops), 
Silver  Hake  {Meriuccius  bilinearis),  Spot  ( Leiostomus  xanthurus),  Striped  Bass,  Summer 
Flounder  ( Paralichthys  dentatus),  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis),  White  Perch,  Windowpane 
Flounder  ( Scophthalmus  aquosus),  Winter  Flounder  ( Pseudopleuronectes  americanus),  blue 
crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus),  eastern  oyster  ( Crassostrea  virginica),  horseshoe  crab  ( Limulus 
polyphemus),  knobbed  whelk  ( Busycon  carica),  channeled  whelk  ( Busycotypus  canaliculatus), 
and  the  northern  quahog  clam  ( Mercenaha  mercenaria).  All  of  these  species  are  also 
considered  recreationally  important,  with  the  exception  of  American  Shad,  Atlantic  Menhaden, 
Butterfish,  Conger  Eel,  Silver  Hake,  Windowpane  Flounder,  eastern  oyster,  horseshoe  crab, 
knobbed  whelk,  channeled  whelk,  and  northern  quahog  clam,  and  are  described  in  detail  in

Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Note  that  since  2008  there  has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of 
horseshoe  crabs  in  New  Jersey  (ASMFC  2014-TN351 1 ). 

Non-Native  and  Nuisance  Species 

Site  7-1  has  the  same  potential  for  nuisance  species  as  indicated  for  the  PSEG  Site 
(Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  These  include  the  Asian  shore  crab  ( Hemigrapsus  sanguineus),  Chinese 
mitten  crab  (Eriocheir  sinensis),  Northern  Snakehead,  and  Flathead  Catfish. 

Essential  Fish  Habitats 

The  Site  7-1  water  intake  and  discharge  areas  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  designated  as 
essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  for  many  species  by  the  Mid-Atlantic  Regional  Fishery  Management 
Council,  and  the  NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  and  tidal  waters 
near  the  PSEG  Site  to  be  EFH  for  15  species  (PNNL  2013-TN2687;  NMFS  2013-TN2804),  as 
described  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Due  to  proximity  of  Site  7-1  to  the  PSEG  Site,  EFH  would  be 
expected  to  be  similar  for  Site  7-1 . 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

There  are  no  critical  habitats  designated  by  NMFS  or  FWS  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1 
(NMFS  2013-TN2614;  FWS  2013-TN2147).  Listed  species  found  near  the  proposed  water 
intake  and  discharge  structures,  near  the  possible  barge  facility,  and  along  the  proposed 
transmission  line  corridor  are  listed  in  Table  9-17  (NMFS  2013-TN2804).

and  deposit  eggs  in  nesting  pits  that  are  covered  to  allow  incubation.  Juveniles  hatch,  struggle 
out  of  the  sandy  nest,  and  make  their  way  to  their  respective  ocean  habitats.  Although  there  are 
no  known  records  of  sea  turtles  nesting  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches;  sea  turtles  have  been 
observed  to  forage  in  Delaware  Bay  waters. 

Adult  Shortnose  Sturgeon  use  freshwater  for  spawning  and  estuarine  and  marine  habitats  for 
feeding.  Juveniles  migrate  downriver  to  estuarine  waters  and  may  go  back  and  forth  between 
freshwater  and  estuarine  habitats  for  several  years  before  maturing  to  adults.  Adults  sometimes 
migrate  to  marine  habitats  for  feeding  but  live  the  majority  of  their  life  cycle  in  estuarine  habitats 
(Rohde  et  al.  1994-TN2208:  NOAA  2012-TN2173).  Migration  to  spawning  habitat  occurs  in  late 
winter  and  spring,  and  adults  return  to  estuarine  waters  in  May  and  June  (Gilbert  1989- 
TN2149).  Spawning  occurs  in  freshwaters  characterized  by  low-to-moderate  velocities  and  over 
substrates  that  include  clay,  sand,  gravel,  and  woody  debris.  Sturgeon  feed  on  benthic 
invertebrates  such  as  snails,  insect  larvae,  crustaceans,  and  worms  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149). 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  system  (NOAA  2012-TN2173).  A  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  was  collected  in  a  bottom  trawl  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  just  downriver  of  the 
PSEG  Site  in  2004  (PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Two  Shortnose  Sturgeon  were  collected  in  2008  and 
one  in  2010  from  bottom  trawl  sampling  between  Delaware  River  Kilometer  (RKM)  100  and 
RKM  120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6),  which  is  within  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  in-water 
installation  and  potential  dredging  activities  for  Site  7-1  (PSEG  2009-TN2513; 

PSEG  201 1-TN2571). 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  share  many  life-history  characteristics  with  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  in  that 
adults  migrate  to  freshwater  to  spawn  and  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as  worms, 
crustaceans,  and  aquatic  insects  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Unlike  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  adult 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  prefer  more  marine  habitats  and  make  extensive  migrations  away  from  natal 
estuaries  beginning  as  subadults  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Historically,  the  Delaware  River 
supported  the  largest  population  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (Secor  and 
Waldman  1999-TN2207).  Tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
followed  migration  patterns  similar  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  spawning  potentially  occurring 
mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal  Delaware  reaches  between  Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania,  and 
Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and  Fox  2007-TN2194).  Gill  net  surveys  by  the  Delaware 
Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  collected  more  than  1 ,700  juveniles  near  Artificial  Island  and  the 
Cherry  Island  Flats  (downriver  of  Site  7-1)  between  1991  and  1998  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082). 

A  single  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  2004  and  2009  in  bottom  trawl  sampling  in  Delaware 
River  Estuary  waters  between  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6),  which  is  within 
the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  in-water  installation  and  potential  dredging  activities  for  Site  7-1 
(PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2010-TN2570). 

Three  New  Jersey  threatened  freshwater  mussel  species  may  occur  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1: 
the  tidewater  mucket  and  triangle  floater  (described  in  Section  9. 3. 2. 4)  and  the  eastern 
pondmussel  ( Ligumia  nasuta)  (described  below).  They  are  listed  as  occurring  in  Salem  County. 
New  Jersey  (NatureServe  2012-TN2182;  NatureServe  2012-TN2183;  NatureServe  2012- 
TN2184;  respectively).  However,  there  are  no  State-listed  occurrences  of  freshwater  mussel 
species  within  a  1-mi  radius  of  either  the  Site  7-1  intake  (NJDEP  2013-TN2722)  or  the  Site  7-1 
location  (NJDEP  2013-TN3567).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  eastern  pondmussel  can  be  found  in  the  Delaware  River  in  New  Jersey  and  is  associated 
with  tidewater  tributaries  where  the  substrate  is  characterized  by  silt  and  sand.  The  host  fish 
species  for  the  eastern  pondmussel  is  unknown  (NJDEP  2013-TN2188).  The  eastern 
pondmussel  is  State-listed  as  threatened  in  New  Jersey  (NJDEP  2012-TN2186)  and 
endangered  in  Delaware  (DNREC  201 3-TN3067).  Populations  of  eastern  pondmussel  occur  in 
Burlington,  Camden,  Cumberland,  Gloucester,  and  Salem  Counties  in  southern  New  Jersey  and 
Sussex  County  in  Delaware  (NatureServe  2012-TN2184). 

Field  studies  would  be  required  to  definitively  determine  whether  any  rare  or  protected  species 
are  present  in  streams  in  the  project  area.  Federally  endangered  Shortnose  and  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  are  known  to  occur  near  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential 
dredging  activities  for  Site  7-1. 

Building  Impacts 

Building  the  plant  structures,  roads,  and  transmission  line  and  switchyard  would  disturb  streams 
on  the  site  and  in  offsite  corridors.  A  total  of  8,967  linear  ft  of  streams  would  be  affected  by 
building  activities  on  Site  7-1:  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  In  addition  to  buildings  and  other  structures,  buried  water  intake  and 
discharge  pipes  would  run  5.1  mi  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  the  site.  The  potential  to 
affect  almost  9,000  ft  of  streams  represents  0.3  percent  of  the  total  length  of  streams  within  6  mi 
of  the  site.  A  new  transmission  corridor  and  switchyard  installation  could  affect  an  estimated 
30,936  ft  of  streams,  which  represents  1.1  percent  of  the  total  stream  lengths  in  the  geographic 
area  (S&L  2010-TN2671 ).  However,  potential  impacts  to  streams  from  transmission  corridor 
installation  could  be  avoided  or  minimized  by  final  corridor  placement  and  use  of  BMPs  to 
reduce  erosion  and  sedimentation  effects  from  building  activities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  installation  of  the  water  intake  structures  and  possibly  a  barge  facility  with  a  turning  basin 
would  result  in  disturbance  of  benthic  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Dredging  would 
disturb  about  7  ac  of  bottom  habitat  (about  100,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  intake  structure  and 
possibly  67  ac  (possibly  1,143,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  barge  facility  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  A 
barge  inlet  channel  would  not  be  required.  Installation  and  site-preparation  activities  could 
temporarily  affect  water  quality  but  would  require  Federal  and  State  permitting  and  use  of  BMPs 
to  minimize  and  mitigate  the  temporary  and  localized  effects.  Effects  on  aquatic  organisms  are 
expected  to  be  minimal  and  temporary  because  adjacent  habitat  is  accessible  and  mobile 
aquatic  organisms  such  as  fish  and  most  macroinvertebrates  would  be  able  to  avoid  or  move 
away  from  the  affected  area  during  intake  installation  activities,  but  effects  could  be  greater  if 
the  installation  of  a  barge  facility  with  a  turning  basin  is  required.  However,  the  impacts  of 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  on  the  aquatic  ecology  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  and  streams  on  the  site  and  in  pipeline  corridors  would  be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  there  would  be  no  direct  discharges 
and  few  impacts  to  small  streams  on  the  site.  Operation  of  the  cooling  and  service  water 
systems  would  require  water  to  be  withdrawn  from  and  discharged  back  to  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary,  as  described  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Aquatic  impacts

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


associated  with  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
and  discharge  of  cooling  water  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  could  occur.  Because  the 
specifications  associated  with  the  water  intake  structure  include  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system 
designed  to  meet  the  EPA  Phase  I  regulations  for  new  facilities  (66  FR  65256-TN243),  the 
maximum  through-screen  velocity  at  the  water  intake  structure  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps. 

Thus,  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  built  at  Site  7-1,  the  anticipated  impacts  to  aquatic 
communities  from  impingement  and  entrainment  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  not 
expected  to  be  different  from  those  described  in  the  analysis  presented  in  Section  5.3.2  for  the 
PSEG  Site  and  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  Operational  impacts  associated  with  water  quality 
and  discharge  cannot  be  determined  without  additional  detailed  analysis  but  are  also  expected 
to  be  similar  to  the  effects  described  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Maintenance  activities  on  the  site  and 
in  offsite  corridors  would  follow  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  minimize 
impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Consequently,  impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  due  to  project 
operations  at  Site  7-1  are  expected  to  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  aquatic  resources  is  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Past 
alteration  and  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  as  described  in  Sections  2.4.2. 1  and 
7.3.2.  have  had  long-term  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  consequences  on  the  aquatic 
resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  numerous 
restoration  activities  in  targeted  portions  of  the  area.  For  assessment  of  cumulative  impacts  for 
Site  7-1,  the  ROI  includes  a  6-mi  radius  of  water  resources  around  the  site  and  a  6-mi  radius 
around  the  point  of  the  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

The  non-nuclear  plant  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  may  result  in  alterations  to  surface-water 
drainage  pathways  and  water  bodies.  It  is  not  expected  that  these  projects  would  have 
noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-1  because  they  would  need 
Federal.  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  The  past,  current,  and 
future  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  will  result  in  continued  losses  of  aquatic  species  through 
impingement  and  entrainment  at  the  water  intake  systems  and  alteration  of  thermal  profiles  in 
the  immediate  Delaware  River  Estuary  area  located  near  these  facilities.  Ongoing  restoration 
efforts  through  the  PSEG  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP)  will  continue  to  provide 
mitigation  for  losses  by  increasing  available  habitat  for  early  life  stages  of  aquatic  organisms 
and  restoring  previously  fragmented  habitats.  A  grid  stability  transmission  line  may  be 
necessary  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  and  would  be  similar  to  that 
described  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  7.3.2). 

Anthropogenic  activities  such  as  residential  or  industrial  development  near  the  vicinity  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  could  present  additional  constraints  on  aquatic  resources.  It  is  not 
expected  that  these  projects  would  have  noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  of 
Site  7-1  because  they  would  need  Federal.  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation 
of  BMPs.  The  review  team  is  also  aware  of  the  potential  for  climate  change  to  affect  aquatic 
resources;  however,  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat 
in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels, 
climate  change  could  lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme 
precipitation  events,  increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


(GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on 
or  near  Site  7-1  through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  Elevated 
water  temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe  weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or 
severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat,  but  specific  predictions  of  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region 
due  to  climate  change  are  inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these 
events  would  depend  on  the  intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic 
communities. 

Summary 

Impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG,  NMFS,  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  Properly 
siting  the  associated  transmission  line  and  switchyard;  avoiding  habitat  for  protected  species; 
minimizing  interactions  with  water  bodies  and  watercourses  along  the  corridors;  and  use  of 
BMPs  during  water  intake  and  discharge  structure  installation,  possible  installation  of  a  barge 
facility  with  a  turning  basin,  transmission  line  corridor  preparation,  and  tower  placement  would 
minimize  building  and  operation  impacts.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
impacts  on  most  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  including  Federally  and  State 
threatened  and  endangered  species,  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-1,  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  future  activities,  would  be  MODERATE  to 
LARGE,  but  the  incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would 
not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 3. 5  Socioeconomics 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.3,  Site  7-1  is  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  economic 
impact  area  for  Site  7-1  would  be  the  same  as  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site 
located  5  mi  north  of  the  town  of  Salem  and  4  mi  east  of  the  town  of  Pennsville  (PSEG  2010- 
TN257). 

The  review  team’s  baseline  discussion  focuses  on  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  Site  7-1 .  As 
discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  expects  that  construction  and  operations  workers  for 
Site  7-1  would  likely  settle  in  the  same  areas  as  those  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review 
team  focuses  on  Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware  for  the  majority  of  impacts.  These  four  counties  compose  the  economic 
impact  area  for  Site  7-1. 

Based  on  experience  with  construction  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  PSEG  believes  about  84.5  percent 
of  the  workforce  required  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  come  from  within  the  50-mi 
region  surrounding  the  proposed  site.  PSEG  assumes  the  remaining  15.5  percent  of  workers 
would  relocate  to  the  region  from  outside  and  would  choose  to  reside  in  the  same  four  counties 
that  house  the  majority  of  the  operations  workers.  The  review  team,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.4  and  5.4,  found  similar  estimates.  Thus,  both  adverse  and  beneficial 
socioeconomic  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  be 
noticeable  except  in  these  four  counties.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  finds  the 
assumptions  to  be  reasonable.

Physical  and  Aesthetic  Impacts 

Physical  impacts  include  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public,  noise,  air  quality,  buildings, 
roads,  and  aesthetics.  The  physical  impacts  on  workers  would  be  similar  to  those  described  for 
the  PSEG  Site.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
workforces  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-1  is  within  0.5  mi  of  about  40  houses  and  near  an  active  church  and  cemetery 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  site  is  also  about  1  mi  from  the  Salem  River  WMA.  Site  7-1  would 
retrieve  its  cooling  water  from  the  Delaware  River,  requiring  a  5.1-mi-long  water  pipeline.  PSEG 
would  also  build  a  6.9-mi-long  rail  spur  and  a  3.3-mi-long  road.  Because  the  site  is  a  greenfield 
site,  PSEG  estimates  that  three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines,  constructed  parallel  to  each 
other,  would  need  to  be  constructed  over  5.4  mi.  PSEG  indicates  that  this  transmission  line 
would  pass  through  1  mi  of  the  Supawna  Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  (NWR)  and  would 
be  adjacent  to  the  Salem  River  WMA  (PSEG  2010-TN257;  PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Even  with 
mitigation  measures  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Section  4.4.1 ,  during  the  building  phase  these 
areas  would  receive  adverse  physical  impacts  from  noise,  vibration,  and  fugitive  dust.  Aesthetic 
impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  those  discussed  in 
Sections  4.4.1 .6  and  5.4.1 .6.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  HCGS 
and  SGS  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proximity  of  the  Delaware  River  to  the  PSEG  Site. 
Because  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site,  it  would  create  new  infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed 
rural  areas  and  a  transmission  line  passing  through  an  NWR.  Consequently,  the  review  team 
expects  the  physical  impacts  from  building  and  operations  to  be  noticeable  and  locally 
destabilizing. 

Demography 

Section  2.5.1  discusses  the  baseline  demographic  information  in  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region.  Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic 
impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  predicts  the  same  workforce  requirements  and 
in-migrating  worker  housing  scenario  as  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.2  and  5.4.2.  The  review 
team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  demography  would  be  minimal  in 
the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Economic  and  Tax  Impacts 

Section  2.5.2. 1  discusses  the  baseline  economy  and  Section  2. 5. 2. 2  discusses  the  tax  structure 
in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region.  Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG 
Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the 
analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  economy  and  tax  revenues  from  the  building  and  operations  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1,  the  review  team  predicts  economic  and  tax  impacts  similar 
to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.3  and  5.4.3.  The  review  team  found  that  building-  and 
operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  economy  and  local  tax  revenues  would  range  from 
minimal  and  beneficial  in  the  region  and  economic  impact  area  to  a  major,  beneficial  impact  to 
Salem  County.

Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services,  including 
transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education. 

Traffic 


Section  2. 5. 2. 3  discusses  the  local  roadways  and  transportation  characteristics  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  region.  Sections  4.4.4. 1  and  5.4.4. 1  discuss  the  traffic  impacts  around  the 
PSEG  Site.  Road  access  to  the  Site  7-1  area  is  provided  primarily  by  New  Jersey  Route  540, 
which  is  a  wide  two-lane  highway.  The  current  vehicle  count  on  the  road  is  5,406  vehicles. 
Road  access  to  the  site  itself  is  provided  by  either  County  Road  631  or  County  Road  646. 
County  Road  631  is  a  narrow  two-lane  road,  and  County  Road  645  is  a  wide  two-lane  highway 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  site  is  about  2  mi  from  Interstate  295  and  the  New  Jersey  Turnpike 
via  New  Jersey  Route  540.  The  nearest  rail  spur  is  about  6  mi  east  of  the  site,  and  barge 
access  would  be  provided  by  the  Salem  River,  about  3  mi  southwest  of  the  site.  The  site  would 
require  about  2  mi  of  roadway  improvements  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  Due  to  the  size  of  the 
workforce  for  building  and  the  similarity  of  the  roads  and  their  level  of  service  (LOS)  values 
compared  to  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  expects  a  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing  impact 
from  traffic.  Because  the  workforce  for  operations  would  be  smaller  (even  during  outages),  the 
review  team  expects  traffic  impacts  to  be  minimal. 

Recreation 


Section  2. 5. 2. 4  discusses  the  recreational  activities  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region.  As 
discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 2  and  5. 4. 4. 2,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  any  stresses  to  be 
placed  upon  the  capacity  of  the  recreational  resources  in  the  PSEG  Site’s  economic  impact 
area  and  region  from  new  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families.  This  would  also  be  true  for 
Site  7-1 ’s  recreational  impacts.  The  Salem  River  WMA  would  receive  aesthetic  and  physical 
impacts  from  building  and  operations  due  to  its  location  near  the  site  and  transmission  line 
corridor.  The  Supawna  Meadows  NWR  would  receive  impacts  from  1  mi  of  transmission  lines 
passing  through  it.  Recreational  resources  near  Site  7-1  would  receive  a  noticeable  and 
potentially  destabilizing  recreation-based  aesthetic  impact  from  building  and  operational 
activities  and  a  noticeable  impact  from  access  delays  from  peaking  building  traffic  (PSEG  2010- 
TN257;  PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Housing 

Section  2. 5. 2. 5  discusses  the  baseline  housing  market  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 
Site  7-1  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact 
area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  housing  market 
from  the  building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  the  review  team 
predicts  housing  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 3  and  5. 4. 4. 3.  The 
primary  difference  would  be  that  many  of  the  17  houses  within  the  conceptual  site  boundaries 
would  have  to  be  removed  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  However,  any  taking  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  to  be 
performed  with  an  equitable  compensation,  which  would  render  minimal  any  potential  impact 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


from  that  taking.  The  review  team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the 
local  housing  market  would  be  minimal  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Public  Services 


Section  2. 5. 2. 6  discusses  the  baseline  public  services  information  in  the  economic  impact  area. 
This  includes  water  and  wastewater,  police,  fire,  medical  services,  and  social  services.  Site  7-1 
is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the 
PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  public  services 
infrastructure  from  the  building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  the 
review  team  predicts  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 4  and  5. 4. 4. 4.  The 
review  team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  public  services 
infrastructure  would  be  minimal  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Education 


Section  2. 5. 2. 6  discusses  baseline  education  information  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Site  7-1 
is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the 
PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  education  services  from  the 
building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  the  review  team  predicts 
impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4.4. 5  and  5. 4. 4. 5.  The  review  team  found  that 
building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  education  services  would  be  minimal  in  the 
economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

As  discussed  above,  the  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-1  is  Salem,  Cumberland,  and 
Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  The  review  team 
discusses  information  pertaining  to  these  areas  in  Sections  2.5  and  7.4.1.  Table  9-15  lists  the 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  associated  with  Site  7-1.  Building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  could  result  in  cumulative  impacts  on  the 
demographics,  economy,  and  community  infrastructure  of  the  economic  impact  area  counties  in 
conjunction  with  those  reasonably  foreseeable  actions. 

Within  the  economic  impact  area,  the  project  with  the  greatest  potential  to  affect  cumulative 
socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  the  continued  operation  of  the  three  nuclear  power  units  at 
SGS  and  HCGS.  The  other  projects  involve  continuation  of  development  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  are  included  in  County  comprehensive  plans  and  in  other  public  agency 
planning  processes.  According  to  Section  2. 5. 1.3,  about  1,300  people  are  employed  at  HCGS 
and  SGS,  and  the  majority  of  the  workforce  lives  in  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact 
area.  Each  reactor  has  outages  that  employ  a  further  1 ,034  to  1 ,361  workers  for  about  a  month 
on  a  staggered  18-  to  24-month  schedule  (about  one  outage  every  6  months  at  the  site). 
Operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS  also  contribute  to  economic  activity  and  tax  revenue  to  the  local 
communities.  These  characteristics  are  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5  and  in  the  HCGS  and 
SGS  License  Renewal  EIS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


An  outage  could  take  place  at  the  HCGS/SGS  site  during  peak  building  at  Site  7-1 .  The  review 
team  considers  this  potential  occurrence  in  Section  7.4.  The  majority  of  traffic  impacts 
discussed  in  Section  7.4  would  occur  where  the  HCGS/SGS  workforce,  the  HCGS/SGS  outage 
workforce,  and  the  PSEG  Site  building  workforces  merge  in  and  around  Salem  City 
(PSEG  2013-TN2525).  Because  Site  7-1  is  north  of  Salem  City  and  closer  to  major  interstates, 
the  review  team  determined  that  the  potential  for  cumulative  traffic  impacts  beyond  those 
discussed  in  Section  7.4  is  minimal. 

The  operating  licenses  for  SGS  1  and  2  and  HCGS  expire  in  2036,  2040,  and  2046, 
respectively.  Salem  County  would  see  losses  in  property  tax  revenue,  PSEG  purchases  of 
supplies  and  materials,  and  employment.  However,  this  loss  would  be  partially  offset  by  the 
continued  operations  at  Site  7-1  compared  to  the  baseline  discussed  in  Section  2.5. 

Based  on  the  above  considerations,  PSEG’s  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts 
from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-1  would  not  noticeably  contribute  to  the  existing 
cumulative  socioeconomic  effects  compared  to  those  already  discussed  earlier  in  this  section. 

The  cumulative  effects  on  demography,  housing,  public  services,  and  education  would  all  be 
SMALL  in  the  region  and  economic  impact  area.  Salem  County  would  receive  a  MODERATE 
impact  on  traffic  from  building  activities  and  a  SMALL  traffic  impact  from  operations.  Cumulative 
physical,  aesthetic,  and  recreation  impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-1  would  be 
MODERATE  to  LARGE  within  Salem  County  and  SMALL  everywhere  else  in  the  region  and 
economic  impact  area.  The  cumulative  impacts  to  the  economy  and  the  tax  base  would  be 
SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region  and  economic  impact  area,  with  the  exception  of  a 
LARGE  and  beneficial  impact  to  Salem  County’s  economy  and  tax  base. 

Summary  of  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

Based  on  information  provided  by  PSEG,  a  review  of  existing  reconnaissance-level 
documentation,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation,  the  review  team  concluded  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operations  activities  on  physical  resources  would  be  SMALL, 
with  the  exception  of  a  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetic  resources.  The  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetic 
resources  is  because  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site  and  the  proposed  action  would  create  new 
infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed  rural  areas  and  a  transmission  line  passing  through  an 
NWR.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  taxes  and  the  economy  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial 
throughout  the  region,  except  for  a  MODERATE  and  beneficial  income  tax  impact  to  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  and  a  LARGE  and  beneficial  economic  and  tax  impact  to  Salem  County.  The 
cumulative  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services  would  be  SMALL  throughout  the 
region  with  the  exception  of  a  MODERATE  impact  from  traffic  to  Salem  County  during  building 
activities  and  a  LARGE  impact  to  recreation-based  aesthetics.  Based  on  the  above 
considerations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  from  building 
and  operations  at  Site  7-1  (with  the  exception  of  the  physical  impacts  and  the  beneficial  impact 
to  taxes  and  economy)  would  not  noticeably  contribute  to  the  existing  cumulative  socioeconomic 
effects  compared  to  those  already  discussed  earlier  in  this  section.

9. 3. 3. 6  Environmental  Justice 

The  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-1  includes  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties 
in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  Because  of  the  proximity  of  Site  7-1  to  the 
PSEG  Site  (about  12  mi),  the  review  team  determined  that  the  analysis  of  populations  for  the 
PSEG  Site  was  a  close  approximation  of  an  independent  assessment  of  Site  7-1  according  to 
the  methodology  described  in  Section  2.6.1.  Therefore,  the  review  team  used  the  distribution  of 
minority  and  low-income  populations  around  the  PSEG  Site  to  determine  minority  and  low- 
income  population  distributions  around  Site  7-1.  This  distribution  is  discussed  in  detail  in 
Section  2.6.  The  closest  minority  groups  to  Site  7-1  are  located  to  the  north  about  4  mi  away  in 
Pennsville.  to  the  west  about  5  mi  away  in  Salem,  and  to  the  east  about  5  mi  away  in  Carneys 
Point.  The  closest  low-income  populations  of  interest  to  Site  7-1  are  located  to  the  south  in 
Salem  and  Carneys  Point  (PSEG  2012-TN2450).  The  review  team  found  no  indication  of 
subsistence  activities  in  the  economic  impact  area.  As  discussed  in  Sections  2.5  and  2.6.  the 
majority  of  migrant  populations  are  outage  workers  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  closest 
high-density  communities  are  in  Salem  and  Penns  Grove,  north  of  Carneys  Point 
(Salem  County  2010-TN2486). 

Within  a  mile  west  of  the  power  block  area  of  Site  7-1  and  near  the  proposed  water  pipeline 
route,  an  active,  predominantly  African-American,  church  exists.  Due  to  its  proximity  to  Site  7-1 . 
the  greenfield  characteristics  of  Site  7-1 .  and  the  proximity  of  the  proposed  pipeline  to  the 
church,  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  may  occur  for  the  church  and  its 
congregation.  As  discussed  in  Section  9. 3. 3. 7,  this  church  is  also  potentially  eligible  for  listing  in 
the  NRHP.  In  addition,  the  proposed  water  pipeline  could  traverse  an  aggregate  minority 
census  block  group  in  Pennsville  near  the  Delaware  River,  which  could  impose 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  to  that  block  group. 

As  discussed  in  Section  9. 3. 3. 5,  the  review  team  expects  that  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  have  some  adverse  physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  on  the 
local  population.  However,  due  to  the  proximity  of  the  predominantly  African-American  church 
to  the  site  and  pipeline,  and  the  pipeline  traversing  an  aggregate  minority  block  group  near 
Pennsville,  the  review  team  found  the  presence  of  environmental  and  physical  pathways  such 
that  there  could  be  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  in  the  economic  impact  area 
around  Site  7-1  during  building  and  operations.  For  the  rest  of  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region,  the  review  team  expects  environmental  justice  impacts  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG 
Site. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Based  on  the  analysis  above  and  the  discussion  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Section  9. 3. 3. 5,  the 
review  team  found  potential  environmental  and  physical  pathways  such  that  there  could  be 
disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  in  the  economic  impact  area  around  Site  7-1  during 
building  and  operations  due  to  the  pipeline  traversing  an  aggregate  minority  block  group  near 
Pennsville  and  near  a  predominantly  African-American  church.  The  review  team  did  not  identify 
any  pathways  for  environmental  justice  impacts  from  the  continued  operations  at  HCGS  and 
SGS.

9. 3. 3. 7  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Site  7-1  is  5  mi  east  of  the  Delaware 
River.  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
actions  that  could  impact  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties,  including  the  Federal  and 
non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15.  For  the  analysis  of  impacts  on  cultural  resources  and 
historical  properties  at  Site  7-1,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  considered  to  be  the  APE  that 
would  be  defined  for  this  proposed  undertaking.  This  includes  the  physical  APE,  defined  as  the 
area  directly  affected  by  the  site  development,  operation  activities  at  the  site,  and  transmission 
lines,  and  the  visual  APE.  The  visual  APE  is  defined  as  the  additional  4.9-mi  radius  around  the 
physical  APE.  The  4.9-mi  radius  was  chosen  by  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  as  the  appropriate 
distance  for  consideration  of  visual  resources  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  was  therefore  applied  to 
the  alternative  sites  (AKRF  2012-TN2876). 

Reconnaissance-level  activities  in  this  cultural  resource  review  have  a  particular  meaning.  For 
example,  these  activities  include  preliminary  field  investigations  to  confirm  the  presence  or 
absence  of  cultural  resources.  In  developing  this  EIS,  the  review  team  relies  upon 
reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  alternative  site  evaluation.  Reconnaissance-level 
information  consists  of  data  that  are  readily  available  from  agencies  and  other  public  sources. 

It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  visits  to  the  alternative  site  area.  The  following 
information  was  used  to  identify  the  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  at  Site  7-1: 

•  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  Field  Verification  of  Key  Resources  at  PSEG 
Alternative  Sites  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869),  and 

•  New  Jersey  SHPO  archaeological  site  files. 

Affected  Environment 

Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site  located  in  Salem  County  in  southwestern  New  Jersey.  Historically, 
Site  7-1  has  been  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  Site  7-1  encompasses  a  total  of  987  ac.  The 
location  would  require  3.3  mi  of  new  roads,  a  6.9-mi  railroad  spur,  a  5.1-mi-long  makeup  water 
pipeline,  and  three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines  covering  a  total  distance  of  96  mi.  The 
current  major  industry  in  Salem  County  is  agriculture.  There  are  23  properties  located  in  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey,  listed  on  the  NRHP  (NPS  2013-TN2400).  The  closest  listed  property  to 
Site  7-1  is  the  Salem  County  Alms  House  and  Insane  Asylum  (within  1 ,000  ft  of  the  rail  spur  that 
would  need  to  be  constructed  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  were  to  be  built  at  Site  7-1 ). 

Three  archaeological  sites  are  recorded  within  1  mi  of  Site  7-1.  These  include  prehistoric  sites 
28-SA-73,  28-SA-13,  and  28-SA-137.  Of  these  three  archaeological  sites,  Site  28-SA-73,  is  the 
closest  to  the  proposed  Site  7-1.  Site  28-SA-73  is  located  0.4  mi  from  Site  7-1.  The  other  two 
archaeological  sites  are  about  0.75  mi  from  Site  7-1.  Three  additional  archaeological  sites 
(28-SA-119,  28-SA-176,  and  28-SA-61)  are  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  offsite  infrastructure 
corridors.  All  three  of  these  latter  archaeological  sites  date  to  the  prehistoric  era. 

There  are  26  previously  identified  architectural  resources  within  4.9  mi  of  Site  7-1  and  the 
conceptual  corridors.  Resources  include  residences,  historic  districts,  churches,  and  municipal

buildings.  There  are  six  architectural  resources  identified  within  1  mi  of  Site  7-1  and  the 
conceptual  infrastructure  corridors.  These  resources  include  the  South  Woodstown  Historic 
District,  three  residential  buildings,  one  farmstead,  and  the  Finn's  Point  Rear  Range  Light.  A 
review  of  architectural  resources  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  Site  7-1  identified  six  additional 
architectural  resources  within  1,000  ft  of  Site  7-1  that  could  potentially  be  eligible  for  listing  on 
the  NRHP  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869).  These  resources  include  two  farm  houses,  a  residence,  and 
a  church  and  associated  cemetery.  Two  additional  residential  buildings  with  potential  for  listing 
on  the  NRHP  were  identified  within  1  mi  of  Site  7-1 .  Another  23  structures  and  architectural 
features  that  have  the  potential  for  NRHP  listing  were  identified  between  1  and  4.9  mi  of 
Site  7-1. 

Building  Impacts 

Additional  inventories  of  cultural  resources  would  likely  be  needed  for  any  portion  of  Site  7-1  not 
previously  surveyed.  Other  lands  that  might  be  acquired  to  support  the  plant  (e.g.,  for  roads 
and  pipeline  corridors)  would  also  likely  require  a  survey  to  identify  potential  historic  and  cultural 
resources  and  mitigation  measures  to  offset  the  potential  adverse  effects  of  ground-disturbing 
activities.  The  types  of  cultural  resource  and  historical  property  impacts  resulting  from 
construction  and  operation  of  new  nuclear  units  would  consist  of  alterations  to  archaeological 
sites  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  visual  alteration  of  the  settings  for  historic  structures. 
In  some  cases  vibrations  from  construction  equipment  could  affect  historic  structures. 

Visual  impacts  from  the  building  of  the  590-ft-tall  cooling  towers  would  impact  the  historic 
properties  within  the  viewshed.  Because  the  site  is  not  next  to  an  existing  plant  with  a  similar 
cooling  tower,  the  viewscape  would  be  significantly  altered. 

There  are  no  existing  transmission  corridors  connecting  directly  to  Site  7-1  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Three  new  transmission  line  corridors  would  be  needed  to  connect  Site  7-1  to 
existing  lines.  There  are  no  NRHP-listed  or  known  historic  or  prehistoric  sites  in  the  area  where 
the  transmission  line  would  be  routed.  In  the  event  that  Site  7-1  was  chosen  for  the  proposed 
project,  the  review  team  assumes  that  the  transmission  service  provider  for  this  region  would 
conduct  cultural  resource  surveys  for  all  areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines.  If  NRHP- 
eligible  resources  are  identified,  then  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be 
developed  in  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  and  any  interested  parties  as  required 
under  Section  106  of  the  NHPA  (54  USC  3001010  et  seq.  -TN4157).  In  addition,  visual  impacts 
from  transmission  lines  could  result  in  significant  alterations  to  the  visual  landscape  within  the 
geographic  area  of  interest.  Building  impacts  are  expected  to  range  from  noticeable  to 
potentially  destabilizing  because  significant  (i.e.,  NRHP-listed)  resources  are  in  close  proximity 
to  Site  7-1 .  It  is  unlikely  that  no  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  result  from 
building  a  plant  at  Site  7-1. 

Operational  Impacts 

Operational  impacts  from  a  new  plant  located  at  Site  7-1  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal  with 
the  exception  of  visual  impacts.  Most  impacts  to  cultural  resources  would  occur  during 
preconstruction  and  construction.  The  visual  impacts  to  historic  properties  from  the  operation  of 
the  cooling  tower  would  be  noticeable.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Cumulative  Impacts 

Cumulative  impacts  would  result  from  non-NRC-licensed  activities  associated  with  construction 
of  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  These  impacts  would  depend  on  the  locations  of  the 
various  activities  and  the  nature,  number,  and  significance  of  cultural  resources  present. 
Existing  information  suggests  that  the  region  surrounding  Site  7-1  contains  intact  historic  and 
cultural  resources.  It  is  possible  that  currently  unknown  cultural  resources  might  be  found  in 
close  proximity  to  areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines,  so  the  transmission 
service  provider  for  this  region  would  need  to  conduct  cultural  resource  surveys  for  all  areas 
needed  for  the  transmission  lines  if  this  site  is  selected.  Based  on  the  likelihood  for  visual 
impacts  to  the  known  historic  properties  in  the  area,  the  cumulative  effect  would  be  noticeable. 
However,  if  cultural  resources  are  found  and  cannot  be  avoided,  the  effect  could  be 
destabilizing. 

Summary 

Cultural  resources  are  nonrenewable;  therefore,  the  impact  of  destruction  of  cultural  resources 
is  cumulative.  Based  on  the  reconnaissance-level  information  collected  for  this  EIS,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  of  building  and 
operating  new  nuclear  units  at  Site  7-1  would  be  MODERATE.  This  impact-level  determination 
reflects  that  cultural  resources  with  the  potential  for  meeting  NRHP  criteria  are  found  in  close 
proximity  to  the  boundaries  of  the  proposed  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  making  complete  avoidance 
unlikely.  The  incremental  contribution  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-1  would 
be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9.3.3  8  Air  Quality 

Criteria  Pollutants 

The  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  offsite  facilities 
at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  expected  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  Site  7-2  because  all 
three  sites  are  located  in  Salem  County.  Salem  County  is  in  the  Philadelphia-Wilmington- 
Atlantic  City  (PA-NJ-MD-DE)  nonattainment  area  for  8-hour  ozone  NAAQSs  (40  CFR  Part  81- 
TN255)  and  administratively  in  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia  Interstate  Air  Quality  Control 
Region  (AQCR)  (40  CFR  81.15  [TN255]).  With  the  exception  of  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQSs,  air 
quality  in  Salem  County  is  in  attainment  with  or  better  than  national  standards  for  criteria 
pollutants.  An  applicability  analysis  would  need  to  be  performed  if  a  nuclear  power  plant  was 
built  at  Site  7-1  per  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  (TN2495),  to  determine  whether  a  general 
conformity  determination  was  needed. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.7,  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  from  building  a  nuclear  power  plant 
are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude.  Emissions  from  these  activities  would 
be  primarily  the  fugitive  dust  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  engine  exhaust  from  heavy 
equipment  and  vehicles.  These  impacts  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  associated  with  any 
large  construction  project.  During  building  activities,  a  New  Jersey  State  Air  Quality  Permit 
would  be  required  that  would  prescribe  emissions  limits  and  mitigation  measures  to  be 
implemented.  The  applicant  also  plans  to  implement  a  fugitive  dust  control  program 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Section  5.7  discusses  air-quality  impacts  during  operations.  Emissions  during  operations  would 
primarily  be  from  operation  of  the  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines,  and  commuter  traffic.  Stationary  sources  such  as  the  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines  (operating  infrequently)  and  auxiliary  boilers  (operating  mostly  during  the  winter 
months)  would  be  operated  according  to  State  and  Federal  regulatory  requirements. 

A  Title  V  operating  permit  administered  through  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  ensure 
compliance  with  NAAQSs  and  other  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  prescribe  mitigation 
measures  to  ensure  compliance.  There  are  13  major  sources  of  air  emissions  in  Salem  County 
with  existing  Title  V  operating  permits  (EPA  2013-TN2504).  These  existing  sources  include  the 
energy  and  industrial  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15.  The  existing  energy  and  industrial  projects 
and  the  planned  development  and  transportation  projects  would  contribute  to  air-quality  impacts 
in  Salem  County.  However,  the  impacts  on  air  quality  in  the  county  from  emissions  from 
Site  7-1  would  be  temporary  and  not  noticeable  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects.  The  cumulative  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  minor. 

Greenhouse  Gases 

The  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  related  to  nuclear  power  are  discussed  in 
Section  7.6.  The  impacts  of  the  emissions  are  not  sensitive  to  the  location  of  the  source. 
Consequently,  the  discussion  in  Section  7.6  would  be  applicable  to  a  nuclear  power  plant 
located  at  Site  7-1 .  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  national  and  worldwide  cumulative 
impacts  of  GHG  emissions  are  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  The  review  team  further 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing,  with  or  without 
the  GHG  emissions  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1. 

Summary 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  on  air-quality  resources  in  the  geographic  areas  of 
interest  would  be  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  and  MODERATE  for  GHG  emissions.  The 
incremental  contribution  of  impacts  on  air-quality  resources  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact 
for  both  criteria  pollutants  and  GHG  emissions. 

9. 3. 3. 9  Nonradiological  Health 

The  following  impact  analysis  considers  nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  public  and 
workers  from  building  activities  and  operations  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1,  which  is 
located  in  Mannington  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (about  15  mi  north-northeast  of 
the  PSEG  Site).  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
future  actions  that  could  affect  nonradiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  The 
building-related  activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the  public 
and  workers  include  exposure  to  dust  and  vehicle  exhaust,  occupational  injuries,  noise,  and  the 
transport  of  construction  materials  and  personnel  to  and  from  the  site.  The  operation-related 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the  public  and  workers 
include  exposure  to  etiological  agents,  noise,  and  EMFs  and  transport  of  workers  to  and  from 
the  site. 

Most  of  the  nonradiological  impacts  of  building  and  operation  (e.g.,  noise,  etiological  agents, 
and  occupational  injuries)  would  be  localized  and  would  not  have  significant  impact  at  offsite 
locations.  However,  activities  such  as  vehicle  emissions  from  transport  of  personnel  to  and 
from  the  site  would  encompass  a  larger  area.  Therefore,  for  nonradiological  health  impacts 
associated  with  the  influence  of  vehicle  and  other  air  emissions  sources,  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  for  cumulative  impacts  analysis  includes  projects  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-1 .  For 
cumulative  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  the 
transmission  line  corridor.  These  geographical  areas  are  expected  to  encompass  areas  where 
cumulative  impacts  to  public  and  worker  health  could  occur  in  combination  with  any  past, 
present,  or  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Building  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  construction  workers  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  those  from  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  as 
evaluated  in  Section  4.8.  They  include  occupational  injuries,  noise,  odor,  vehicle  exhaust,  and 
dust.  Applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations  on  air  quality  and  noise  would  be 
complied  with  during  the  plant  construction  phase.  Site  7-1  does  not  have  any  characteristics 
that  would  be  expected  to  lead  to  fewer  or  more  construction  accidents  than  would  be  expected 
for  the  PSEG  Site.  Transportation  of  personnel  and  construction  materials  at  Site  7-1  would 
result  in  minimal  nonradiological  health  impacts.  Site  7-1  is  in  a  greenfield  area,  and 
construction  impacts  would  likely  be  minimal  on  the  surrounding  areas,  which  are  classified  as 
low-population  areas. 

Operational  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  occupational  health  of  workers  and  members  of  the  public 
from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  those  evaluated  in 
Section  5.8  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Occupational  health  impacts  on  workers  (e.g., 
falls,  electric  shock,  or  exposure  to  other  hazards)  at  Site  7-1  would  likely  be  the  same  as  those 
evaluated  for  workers  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Discharges  to  the  Delaware  River  would 
be  controlled  by  NPDES  permits  issued  by  NJDEP.  The  growth  of  etiological  agents  would  not 
be  significantly  encouraged  at  Site  7-1  because  of  the  temperature  attenuation  in  the  length  of 
the  pipe  required  for  a  discharge  system.  Noise  and  EMF  exposure  would  be  monitored  and 
controlled  in  accordance  with  applicable  OSHA  regulations.  Effects  of  EMFs  on  human  health 
would  be  controlled  and  minimized  by  conformance  with  NESC  criteria.  Nonradiological 
impacts  of  traffic  during  operations  would  be  less  than  the  impacts  during  building.  Mitigation 
measures  used  during  building  to  improve  traffic  flow  would  also  minimize  impacts  during 
operation  of  a  new  plant.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  and  present  actions  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to 
cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts  include  the  energy  projects  in  Table  9-15,  as  well  as 
vehicle  emissions  and  existing  urbanization.  Reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  in  the 
geographical  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts 
include  expansion  of  natural-gas  pipelines,  improvement  and  new  construction  for  roadways 
and  interstates,  future  transmission  line  development,  and  future  urbanization.  The  review  team 
is  also  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  human  health  and  used  a  recent 
compilation  of  the  state  of  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014-TN3472)  in  the  preparation  of 
this  EIS.  Projected  changes  in  climate  for  the  region  include  an  increase  in  average 
temperature,  increased  likelihood  of  drought  in  summer,  more  heavy  downpours,  and  an 
increase  in  precipitation,  especially  in  the  winter  and  spring,  which  may  alter  the  presence  of 
microorganisms  and  parasites.  In  view  of  the  water  source  characteristics,  the  review  team  did 
not  identify  anything  that  would  alter  its  conclusion  regarding  the  presence  of  etiological  agents 
or  change  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. 

Summary 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  expects  that  the  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  evaluated  for  the  PSEG 
Site.  Although  there  are  past,  present,  and  future  activities  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest 
that  could  affect  nonradiological  health  in  ways  similar  to  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new 
plant  at  Site  7-1,  those  impacts  would  be  localized  and  managed  through  adherence  to  existing 
regulatory  requirements.  Similarly,  the  impacts  on  public  health  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
operating  at  Site  7-1  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  review  team  concludes,  therefore, 
that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.3.10  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operations 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  to  the  public  and  workers  from 
building  activities  and  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1 ,  which  is  located  in 
Mannington  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (about  15  mi  north-northeast  of  the  PSEG 
Site).  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
actions  that  could  affect  radiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects 
and  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.3,  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site; 
there  are  currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  area 
within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-1 .  Other  nuclear  reactor  sites  that  potentially  affect  the 
radiological  health  within  this  geographic  area  of  interest  are  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2, 
Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station 
Units  2  and  3.  The  Shieldalloy  radioactive  materials  decommissioning  site  in  Newfield,  New 
Jersey,  is  also  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-1 .  In  addition,  medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities 
that  use  radioactive  materials  are  likely  to  be  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-1.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  radiological  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  include 
doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  would 
result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  would  be  well  below 
regulatory  limits.  The  impacts  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Limerick  Generating  Station 
Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3  include  doses  from  direct 
radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  result  in  doses  to 
people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  are  well  below  regulatory  limits  as 
demonstrated  by  the  ongoing  radiological  environmental  monitoring  program  conducted  around 
HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom 
Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3.  The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  dose  from  direct 
radiation  and  effluents  from  medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive 
material  would  be  an  insignificant  contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  around  Site  7-1.  This 
conclusion  is  based  on  data  from  the  radiological  environmental  monitoring  programs  conducted 
around  currently  operating  nuclear  power  plants.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG 
and  the  NRC  staffs  independent  analysis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
radiological  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  other  existing 
and  planned  projects  and  actions  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  around  Site  7-1  would  be 
SMALL. 

9. 3.3.11  Postulated  Accidents 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  from  postulated  accidents  from  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  analysis 
also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect 
radiological  health  from  postulated  accidents,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects 
and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-15  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  As  described  in 
Section  9.3.3,  Site  7-1  is  a  greenfield  site,  and  there  are  currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the 
site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  considers  all  existing  and  proposed  nuclear  power  plants 
that  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  probability-weighted  consequences  (i.e. ,  risks)  from  a 
severe  accident  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  this  site.  Existing  facilities  potentially  affecting 
radiological  accident  risk  within  this  geographic  area  of  interest  are  HCGS  Unit  1 ,  SGS  Units  1 
and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2, 
Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3,  Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1, 
and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2. 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 ,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of 
DBAs  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  for  a  US-APWR,  two  API 000s,  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an 
ABWR.  DBAs  are  addressed  specifically  to  demonstrate  that  any  of  these  four  reactor  designs 
is  sufficiently  robust  to  meet  the  NRC  safety  criteria.  The  reactor  designs  are  independent  of 
site  conditions,  and  the  meteorological  conditions  at  the  alternative  sites  and  the  PSEG  Site  are 
similar;  therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of  DBAs  at 
Site  7-1  would  be  SMALL. 

Because  the  meteorology,  population  distribution,  and  land  use  for  Site  7-1  are  expected  to  be 
similar  to  the  PSEG  Site,  risks  from  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  reactor  located  at  Site  7-1  are 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


expected  to  be  similar  to  those  analyzed  for  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  These  risks  for  the 
PSEG  Site  are  presented  in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31  and  are  well  below  the  mean  and  median 
values  for  current-generation  reactors.  In  addition,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.11.2.1,  estimates 
of  average  individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  are  well  below  Commission 
safety  goals  (51  FR  30028-TN594).  For  existing  plants  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest 
(i.e.,  whose  50-mi  radius  overlaps  with  the  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site),  namely  HCGS 
Unit  1,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick  Generating 
Station  Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3,  Three  Mile  Island 
Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2,  the  Commission 
has  determined  the  probability-weighted  consequences  of  severe  accidents  to  be  small  (10  CFR 
Part  51,  Appendix  B.  Table  B-1  [TN250]).  Because  of  the  NRC  safety  review  criteria,  it  is 
expected  that  risks  for  any  new  reactors  at  any  other  locations  within  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  for  Site  7-1  would  be  well  below  the  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  and  would 
meet  Commission  safety  goals.  The  severe  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power 
plant  becomes  smaller  as  the  distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at 
any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-1  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  these 
operating  nuclear  power  plants  and  would  still  be  low. 

The  postulated  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  decreases  as  the 
distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of 
Site  7-1  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  ail  of  these  operating  and  proposed  nuclear 
power  plants.  Even  though  there  would  be  potentially  several  plants  included  in  the 
combination,  this  combined  risk  would  still  be  low.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that 
the  cumulative  risks  of  postulated  accidents  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-1  would  be 
SMALL. 

9.3.4  Site  7-2 

This  section  covers  the  review  team  evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  siting  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site  designated  as  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey, 
located  about  12  mi  east-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  (see  Figure  9-1).  Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield 
site  that  is  not  owned  by  PSEG.  The  site  is  located  about  12  mi  from  the  Delaware  River,  which 
would  be  the  source  of  cooling  water  for  new  nuclear  units  at  this  site.  The  site  has  a  total  area 
of  996  ac. 

As  indicated  by  PSEG,  the  use  of  Site  7-2  would  require  infrastructure  upgrades  and 
improvements,  as  follows  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

•  Portions  of  the  public  roads  that  currently  provide  access  to  the  site  would  need  to  be 
relocated  around  plant  facilities  and/or  improved  to  increase  their  load-carrying  capacity.  An 
estimated  total  of  2.2  mi  of  road  building  would  be  required,  and  the  ROW  width  would  be 
150  ft. 

•  A  new  rail  spur  would  be  required  to  allow  delivery  of  materials  and  equipment  to  the  site. 
PSEG  has  identified  a  conceptual  route  and  alignment  for  this  new  rail  spur  that  would  be 
5.4  mi  long  and  would  require  a  ROW  width  of  150  ft.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


•  A  new  water  supply  pipeline  would  need  to  be  installed  to  withdraw  water  from  the  Delaware 
River.  A  new  discharge  pipeline  would  also  need  to  be  installed  to  convey  blowdown  and 
wastewater  to  the  Delaware  River.  PSEG  assumed  the  two  new  pipelines  would  be 
installed  parallel  to  each  other  and  within  the  same  100-ft-wide  ROW.  The  estimated  length 
of  the  route  is  12.9  mi. 

•  An  existing  500-kV  transmission  line  crosses  the  site,  and  this  existing  line  would  be  used 
for  a  two-circuit  connection  for  the  new  facilities  at  the  site;  however,  a  portion  of  the  existing 
transmission  line  would  have  to  be  rerouted  to  avoid  plant  facilities. 

•  A  third,  new  connection  from  Site  7-2  to  the  transmission  system  would  be  required.  This 
new  transmission  line  would  be  installed  within  a  200-ft  ROW,  and  the  route  would  be  4.1  mi 
long. 

•  A  new  switchyard  would  be  required  at  the  connection  of  the  above  new  transmission  line 
and  the  existing  transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  this  new  switchyard  would  be 
located  on  25  ac. 

The  following  sections  include  a  cumulative  impact  assessment  conducted  for  each  major 
resource  area.  The  assessment  considered  the  specific  resources  and  components  that  could 
be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  including 
impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  and  operations  and  impacts  of  preconstruction 
activities.  Also  included  in  the  assessment  are  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
Federal,  non-Federal,  and  private  actions  in  the  same  geographical  area  that  could  have 
meaningful  cumulative  impacts  when  considered  together  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  if 
such  a  plant  were  to  be  built  at  Site  7-2.  Other  actions  and  projects  considered  in  this 
cumulative  analysis  are  listed  in  Table  9-18.

9.3.4. 1  Land  Use 
Affected  Environment 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.4,  Site  7-2  covers  996  ac  in  Alloway  Township,  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey  (Figure  9-1).  Existing  land  use  at  Site  7-2  is  predominantly  agricultural,  with  large  areas 
planted  in  cultivated  crops.  Most  of  Site  7-2  is  zoned  for  agricultural  use,  and  soils  classified  as 
prime  farmland  or  Farmland  of  Statewide  Importance  occur  across  much  of  the  site 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

There  are  about  46  single-family  houses,  as  well  as  a  private  school,  located  within  the  Site  7-2 
boundaries.  Also,  although  the  site  is  located  more  than  6  mi  from  the  nearest  incorporated 
town,  there  are  small  groups  of  houses  within  1  mi  of  the  site.  There  are  no  significant  industrial 
land  uses  on  or  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

According  to  2012  State  of  New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture  GIS  mapping  conducted  by 
PSEG.  there  are  no  County  Preserved  Farmlands  within  the  Site  7-2  boundaries.  Also,  there 
are  no  lands  under  DCRs  within  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  offsite  corridors  for  the  access  roads,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  to  Site  7-2,  as  well  as 
the  short  connector  transmission  line  from  Site  7-2  to  the  grid,  would  be  largely  confined  to  the 
immediate  site  vicinity.  Land  uses  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  the  site  itself,  with  most 
of  the  land  in  agricultural  use  and  residences  scattered  throughout  the  area.  There  are  no 
significant  industrial  land  uses  within  the  offsite  corridors  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Building  Impacts 

According  to  PSEG,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  directly  disturb 
(temporarily  and  permanently)  a  total  of  394  ac  on  the  site.  The  remaining  land  within  the 
Site  7-2  boundaries  (602  ac)  would  not  be  directly  disturbed,  but  access  to  this  land  would  be 
controlled,  and  it  would  be  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  a  nuclear  power  plant.  In  addition, 
developing  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for  Site  7-2  would  disturb 
294  ac  off  the  site.  Therefore,  a  total  of  1 ,290  ac,  not  including  transmission  line  corridors, 


November  2015 


9-151 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


would  be  disturbed  or  made  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  the  new  plant  at  Site  7-2.  Land 
uses  affected  by  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  and  support  facilities  at  Site  7-2  include  about 
1 ,102  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  11  ac  of  developed  land,  29  ac  of  barren  land,  95  ac  of 
forest  land,  7  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area,  33  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine 
wetland,  5  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  37  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and 
6  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

It  is  likely  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  connect  with  the  potential 
transmission  line  corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints 
within  the  PJM  region  (see  Section  7.0).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  a  connector 
transmission  line  from  Site  7-2  to  this  new  grid  stability  line.  This  4.1-mi  connector  transmission 
line  corridor  would  disturb  about  105  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  3  ac  of  developed  land,  1  ac 
of  barren  land,  56  ac  of  forest  land,  11  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  less  than 
1  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site  7-2  has  an  existing  site  elevation  between  120  and  140  ft  above  MSL.  Because  the 
existing  site  elevation  would  provide  adequate  final  grade  elevation  to  preclude  flooding,  PSEG 
has  stated  that  no  additional  fill  above  existing  grade  elevation  would  be  required.  PSEG 
estimates  the  total  fill  quantity  for  Site  7-2  would  be  3.5  million  yd3,  with  0.9  million  yd3  of 
Category  1  fill  and  2.6  million  yd3  of  Category  2  fill.  PSEG  has  stated  the  fill  material  for  Site  7-2 
could  come  from  the  same  sources  as  the  fill  material  for  the  PSEG  Site  (i.e. ,  existing  permitted 
borrow  sites  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Maryland).  However,  PSEG  would  likely  conduct  a 
new  search  for  fill  material  sources  if  Site  7-2  were  developed  and  would  conduct  testing  to 
determine  whether  the  material  excavated  from  Site  7-2  could  be  reused  as  fill  at  the  site 
(PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be 
sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the 
site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Building  a  new  plant  would  directly  disturb  394  ac  of  land  and  would 
eliminate  access  to  and  use  of  another  602  ac  of  land  that  currently  supports  productive 
agricultural  and  rural  residential  uses.  Building  the  new  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water 
pipeline  corridors  for  Site  7-2  would  disturb  294  ac  of  similar  land  uses  off  the  site.  Further, 
developing  the  new  connector  transmission  corridor  from  Site  7-2  to  the  new  grid  stability  lines 
would  disturb  an  additional  168  ac  of  similar  offsite  land  uses.  Land  uses  in  the  vicinity  of 
Site  7-2  include  about  53,694  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  3,783  ac  of  developed  land, 

1 ,869  ac  of  barren  land,  28,083  ac  of  forest  land,  1 38  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater 
area,  291  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  768  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland, 

1 0,839  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  1 ,052  ac  of  other  wetland.  Building  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  permanently  or  temporarily  disturb  about  5  percent  of  the 
available  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area  and  1 1  percent  of  the  available  estuarine  and 
marine  wetland  in  the  vicinity.  Additionally,  building  a  new  plant  on  Site  7-2  would  require  that 
most  of  the  46  houses  within  the  site  boundaries  be  removed,  that  any  residents  be  relocated, 
and  that  access  to  a  private  school  be  restricted  (if  not  eliminated)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  the  combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  on  Site  7-2  would  be  noticeable.  The  review  team  reaches  this  conclusion  because  of 


NUREG-2168 


9-152 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


the  conversion  of  existing  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  areas  and  estuarine  and  marine 
wetland  land  uses  to  heavy  industrial  and  transmission  corridor  use,  the  relocation  of 
46  residences,  and  the  restriction  of  access  to  a  private  school.  These  impacts  would  alter 
noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the  site  and  in 
the  vicinity. 

Operational  Impacts 

The  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  smaller  than 
the  impacts  of  building,  but  they  would  still  permanently  eliminate  almost  all  access  to  and  use 
of  1.290  ac  of  land  (not  including  transmission  corridors)  that  supports  productive  agricultural 
uses,  rural  residential  uses,  and  a  private  school.  Most  of  the  impacts  would  occur  during  the 
building  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  operation  of  a  plant  is  not  expected  to  cause 
additional  impacts.  Additionally,  there  are  sufficient  agricultural  and  residential  land-use 
resources  available  in  the  vicinity.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and 
the  review  team's  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  the  land-use  impacts  of 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  negligible. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  includes  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (in  which  Site  7-2  is 
located),  and  the  other  24  counties  located  in  the  50-mi  region  around  the  site.  The  50-mi 
region  includes  counties  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware.  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland.  The  direct  and 
indirect  impacts  to  land  use  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2 
would  be  confined  to  Salem  County,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  when  combined 
with  other  actions  (discussed  below)  would  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware. 
Maryland,  and  Pennsylvania. 

Table  9-18  lists  projects  that,  in  combination  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-2.  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  in  the  region.  One  of  the  projects 
closest  to  Site  7-2  would  be  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS.  In  201 1 .  NRC  issued 
new  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Unit  1  (expires  in  2036),  SGS  Unit  2  (expires  in  2040),  and 
HCGS  (expires  in  2046).  The  cumulative  land-use  impact  would  result  from  the  combined 
commitment  of  land  for  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-2  (996  ac)  with  the  land  already  dedicated  to  SGS 
and  HCGS  (734  ac).  Although  this  would  represent  a  relatively  noticeable  land-use  impact  in 
Salem  County,  the  cumulative  impact  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  would  be  negligible.  None 
of  the  other  nuclear  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  are  located  within  the  50-mi  region. 

Another  project  that  would  occur  in  relatively  close  proximity  to  Site  7-2  is  the  USACE  Delaware 
River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project.  In  this  project,  the  USACE  is  conducting  dredging 
operations  to  deepen  a  section  of  the  Delaware  River,  including  the  portion  of  the  river  adjacent 
to  the  existing  PSEG  property  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  The  primary  land-use  impact  of  this 
deepening  project  would  be  use  of  some  existing  CDFs  along  the  Delaware  River  for  the 
disposal  of  dredge  materials.  The  total  dredging  operation  would  generate  an  estimated 
16  million  yd3  of  spoil  material.  NEPA  documentation  for  the  channel  deepening  project 
(USACE  1997-TN2281;  USACE  2009-TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262)  concludes  there  would 
be  no  significant  land-use  impacts  from  the  project.

A  third  project  that  could  occur  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-2  is  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM 
region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  identifies  a  new  5-mi-wide  transmission  macro¬ 
corridor  known  as  the  WMC  (“West  Macro-Corridor”).  The  WMC  is  55  mi  long  and  generally 
follows  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from  the  PSEG  property  to  the  Peach  Bottom 
Substation  in  Pennsylvania  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  considers  the  WMC  to  be  “the  most 
effective  route  for  addressing  the  regional  voltage  and  stability  constraints  that  PJM  is  trying  to 
resolve”  (PSEG  2013-TN2669). 

However,  in  its  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  PSEG  cites  a  GIS  analysis  that  assumes  a  5-mi-wide 
hypothetical  macro-corridor  and  a  transmission  line  ROW  width  of  200  ft  within  the  corridor. 

This  PSEG  analysis  did  not  identify  a  specific  200-ft-wide  ROW  within  the  hypothetical  corridor 
but  calculated  the  amount  of  each  land-use  type  that  could  be  affected  in  a  200-ft-wide  ROW 
based  on  each  land-use  type  as  a  percentage  of  total  land  use  within  the  corridor  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  However,  PJM  has  not  selected  a  specific  route  for  the  potential  new  transmission 
line.  The  review  team  has  determined,  based  on  the  analysis  performed  by  PSEG  and  the  land 
uses  that  could  be  affected,  that  a  new  transmission  line  could  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  land 
uses  within  the  region. 

Most  of  the  other  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  are  not  expected  to  create  noticeable  cumulative 
impacts  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  when  combined  with  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2.  The  other  energy  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  (the  closest 
being  Deepwater  Energy  Center  and  Carneys  Point  Generating  Plant)  are  all  too  far  from 
Site  7-2  and  from  each  other  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region. 

The  new  development/redevelopment  projects  listed  (Millville  Municipal  Airport  Improvements 
and  Camp  Pedricktown  Redevelopment)  also  are  too  far  from  Site  7-2  to  create  noticeable 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.  The  parks  and  recreation  activities  listed  (the  closest 
being  Parvin  State  Park,  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  and  Supawna  Meadows  NWR)  are  not 
expected  to  contribute  to  adverse  land-use  impacts,  especially  on  the  regional  scale.  Finally, 
the  Salem  County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  project  listed  in  Table  9-18  is  located  too  far  from 
Site  7-2  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region. 

The  GCRP  report  Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  In  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472) 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions,  and  Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
report  indicates  that  climate  change  could  increase  precipitation,  sea  level,  and  storm  surges  in 
the  Northeast  region,  thus  changing  land  use  through  the  inundation  of  low-lying  areas  that  are 
not  buffered  by  high  cliffs.  However,  cliffs  could  experience  increased  rates  of  erosion  as  a 
result  of  frequent  storm  surges,  flooding  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  Forest  growth  could 
increase  as  a  result  of  more  CO2  in  the  atmosphere.  Existing  parks,  reserves,  and  managed 
areas  would  help  preserve  wetlands  and  forested  areas  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not  affected 
by  the  same  factors.  In  addition,  climate  change  could  reduce  crop  yields  and  livestock 
productivity,  which  might  change  portions  of  agricultural  land  uses  in  the  region  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472).  Thus,  direct  changes  resulting  from  climate  change  could  cause  a  shift  in  land  use  in 
the  50-mi  region  that  would  contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2.

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2 
(along  with  the  new  connector  transmission  line  corridor)  would  be  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably, 
but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team's  independent 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  land-use  impacts  would  be  MODERATE. 
The  incremental  contribution  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2 
would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 4. 2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

The  following  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  at  Site  7-2. 

The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  actions  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in 
Table  9-18  that  could  affect  water  use  and  quality. 

Affected  Environment 

The  potentially  affected  surface-water  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  which 
would  be  affected  by  water  withdrawn  from  and  wastewater  discharged  to  the  river.  Site  7-2  is  a 
996-ac  greenfield  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  site  is  located  on  flat  land  12  mi  east 
of  the  Delaware  River  and  about  1 5  mi  east  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Elevations  across  the  site  range 
from  120  to  140  ft  MSL.  As  stated  by  PSEG  in  its  ER,  the  Delaware  River  would  be  the  primary 
source  of  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  reach  nearest  to  Site  7-2  lies  in 
DRBC  water-quality  Zone  5.  which  is  the  same  zone  within  which  the  PSEG  Site  is  located. 

Flow  data  for  the  Delaware  River  at  USGS  Gaging  Station  01463500  at  RM  131 .0,  near 
Trenton,  New  Jersey,  are  described  in  Section  2.3.  This  gaging  station  is  located  more  than 
80  mi  upstream  of  the  Site  7-2  conceptual  water  intake  location  at  RM  48.4.  The  mean  annual 
river  flow  at  the  Trenton  gage  is  12,004  cfs.  Mean  annual  flow  during  the  historic  low-water 
period  of  1961-1967  was  7,888  cfs,  with  the  minimum  monthly  flow  of  1,548  cfs  recorded  in 
July  1965. 

As  mentioned  in  Section  2.3,  the  Coastal  Plain  deposits  dip  and  thicken  to  the  southeast  toward 
the  coast.  Site  7-2  is  located  east  of  the  PSEG  Site  and,  as  a  result,  the  hydrogeologic 
environment  is  somewhat  different.  Because  it  is  a  greenfield  site  located  away  from  the  river, 
there  is  no  hydraulic  fill  or  alluvium.  Studies  from  NJGS  (Sugarman  2001-TN3218)  and  USGS 
(Martin  1998-TN2259;  dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948)  indicate  that  in  eastern  Salem  County  the 
uppermost  aquifer  is  the  unconfined  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system  and  that  this  unit 
outcrops  in  the  area  just  north  and  east  of  Site  7-2. 

In  its  ER  the  applicant  indicated  that  “plant  groundwater  requirements  could  be  supplied  by  one 
or  two  wells  drilled  to  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey”  aquifer  system  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This 
aquifer  system  ranges  from  20  to  350  ft  thick  (USGS  2013-TN3228).  However,  because 
Site  7-2  is  located  near  the  outcrop  area  of  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system,  the 
thickness  is  probably  at  the  lower  end  of  this  range  (Martin  1998-TN2259),  and  water  quality 
may  be  poor  due  to  the  surface-water-freshwater/saltwater  interface  that  is  interpreted  to  occur

within  the  unit  in  areas  west  of  the  site  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  a  result,  it  is  not  likely 
that  the  aquifer  is  widely  used  in  the  area  immediately  surrounding  Site  7-2,  and  pumping  may 
induce  flow  of  brackish  water  from  the  west. 

USGS  studies  also  indicate  that  the  Vincentown  is  very  thin  or  not  present  at  Site  7-2  and  that 
the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  and  the  PRM  aquifers  are  deeper  at  Site  7-2  than  at  the  PSEG  Site 
and  are  of  varying  quality.  Salinity  levels  within  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  are  below 
the  drinking  water  standard  (250  mg/L).  USGS  indicates  that  the  position  of  the  250  mg/L  line 
of  salinity  concentration,  which  is  located  in  southern  Cumberland  and  Salem  Counties,  has 
extended  to  around  2  mi  inland  of  the  Delaware  River  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  However, 
this  is  8  mi  southeast  of  Site  7-2.  Salinity  values  within  the  upper  and  middle  PRM  aquifers  are 
above  the  drinking  water  standard.  Salinity  within  the  lower  PRM  aquifer  is  reported  to  exceed 
10,000  mg/L  for  chloride  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  a  result,  it  is  likely  that  groundwater 
needed  for  construction  and  operation  at  Site  7-2  would  be  obtained  from  the  Wenonah-Mount 
Laurel  aquifer. 

Building  Impacts 

Impacts  to  surface  waters  from  building  activities  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the 
PSEG  Site  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of  site-preparation  and  plant  building  activities.  Potential 
impacts  to  surface  waters  would  result  from  physical  alteration  of  surface-water  bodies  because 
of  installation  of  intake  and  discharge  structures;  alteration  of  land  surface  and  surface-water 
drainage  pathways;  potential  for  increased  runoff  from  the  site  area  that  may  include  additional 
sediment  load  and  building-related  pollutants;  and  potential  for  impacts  to  wetlands,  floodplains, 
and  surface-water  bodies  from  building  transmission  lines.  Additional  disturbance  to  the 
shoreline  and  river  bottom  may  occur  from  building  a  new  barge  docking  facility,  if  needed.  The 
offsite  building  activities  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  include  building  the  rail 
spur,  access  roads,  and  other  offsite  facilities  including  the  new  makeup  water  pipeline,  the  new 
blowdown  pipeline,  and  a  new  transmission  line  from  Site  7-2  to  an  existing  500-kV  corridor. 

PSEG  has  proposed  in  Section  9.3.2  of  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  to  withdraw  either  surface 
water  or  groundwater  for  building  activities.  The  review  team  assumes  that  water  use  for 
building  activities  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  that  for  the  PSEG  Site.  As  estimated  by  PSEG 
in  ER  Section  4.2  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  water  use  to  support  concrete  plant  operations,  dust 
suppression,  and  potable  water  would  be  1 19  gpm.  Because  water  quality  in  the  Delaware 
River  is  brackish  near  Site  7-2,  potable  and  sanitary  use  of  the  river  water  is  not  expected. 

Dewatering  of  the  plant  area  and  the  nuclear  island  foundation  would  also  likely  be  required  to 
limit  inflow  from  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system  during  construction  at  Site  7-2. 

Because  these  units  are  unconfined  and  productive,  it  is  assumed  that  dewatering  flow  rates 
would  be  reduced  through  the  use  of  vertical  low-permeability  barriers,  which  would  also  limit 
the  horizontal  effects  of  dewatering.  It  is  assumed  that  the  extracted  groundwater  would  be 
managed  and  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  the  permit  requirements. 

Impacts  from  groundwater  use  and  dewatering  during  construction  activities  would  be  limited 
due  to  the  temporary  time  frame  of  construction.  In  addition,  construction-related  pumping 
would  be  bounded  by  the  impacts  from  pumping  to  support  plant  operations.  Therefore,  the

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


review  team  concludes  that  the  groundwater-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  Site  7-2  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  water-quality-related  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  expected  for  any  other 
large  project.  Alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  would  occur  during  installation  of  the  makeup 
water  intake  structure  and  the  wastewater  discharge  structure.  During  installation  of  these 
structures,  some  additional  turbidity  in  the  river  is  expected  because  of  the  disturbance  of 
bottom  sediments.  However,  these  sediments  would  be  localized  to  the  area  needed  to  install 
the  structures,  and  engineering  measures  would  be  in  place  as  part  of  BMPs  to  minimize 
movement  of  the  disturbed  sediment  beyond  the  immediate  work  area.  These  impacts  also 
would  be  temporary  and  would  not  occur  after  the  structures  are  installed.  Because  these 
activities  would  occur  in  waters  of  the  United  States,  appropriate  permits  from  USACE  and 
NJDEP  would  be  required.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  implement  BMPs  to  control  erosion 
and  sedimentation  as  well  as  discharge  of  building-related  pollutants  to  the  Delaware  River  or 
to  nearby  water  bodies.  Because  the  effects  from  building-related  activities  would  be  minimized 
using  BMPs,  would  be  temporary  and  localized,  and  would  be  controlled  under  various  permits, 
the  review  team  concluded  the  impact  from  building-related  activities  on  the  water  quality  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  nearby  water  bodies  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  groundwater  quality  may  be  affected  by  leaching  of  spilled  effluents  into  the 
subsurface.  The  review  team  assumes  that  the  BMPs  PSEG  has  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site 
would  also  be  in  place  at  Site  7-2  during  building  activities,  and  therefore  the  review  team 
concludes  that  any  spills  would  be  quickly  detected  and  remediated.  In  addition,  groundwater 
impacts  would  be  limited  to  the  duration  of  these  activities  and  therefore  would  be  temporary. 
Because  any  spills  related  to  building  activities  would  be  quickly  remediated  under  BMPs,  the 
activities  would  be  temporary,  and  pumping  rates  would  be  greater  during  operations  than 
during  building,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  groundwater-quality  impacts  from  building  at 
Site  7-2  would  be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2.  surface  water  would  be  withdrawn 
from  the  Delaware  River  to  provide  makeup  water  to  the  plant  CWS.  Because  water  quality  in 
the  Delaware  River  near  Site  7-2  is  brackish,  similar  to  that  at  the  PSEG  Site,  it  is  assumed  that 
the  withdrawal  rate  and  the  consumptive  water  use  at  Site  7-2  would  be  the  same  as  at  the 
PSEG  Site:  78.196  gpm  (174.2  cfs)  for  withdrawal  and  26.420  gpm  (58.9  cfs)  for  consumptive 
use.  As  described  in  Section  5.2,  applying  an  equivalent  impact  factor  of  0.18  to  account  for  the 
salinity  of  the  withdrawn  river  water  makes  the  water  consumption  equivalent  to  a  freshwater 
consumption  of  4,756  gpm  (10.6  cfs).  This  equivalent  freshwater  consumptive  use  is 
0.1  percent  of  the  mean  annual  flow  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  during  the  historic  low-water 
period  of  1961-1967  (7,888  cfs),  and  0.7  percent  of  the  minimum  monthly  flow  (1,548  cfs) 
recorded  in  July  1965.  Assuming  similar  tidal  flows  at  Site  7-2  and  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site, 
the  total  consumptive  losses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be 
less  than  0.01  percent  of  the  tidal  flows.  Because  of  the  similarity  of  Site  7-2  to  the  PSEG  Site, 
the  review  team  determined  that  operational  water-use  impacts  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to 
those  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  determined  that  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an 
additional  465  ac-ft  or  6.9  percent  of  allocated  storage  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  to  meet

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


instream  flow  targets  during  a  DRBC-declared  drought.  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  has  a  storage 
capacity  of  46,000  ac-ft,  far  exceeding  that  needed  to  meet  the  465  ac-ft  exceedance.  In 
addition,  DRBC  allows  for  temporary  or  permanent  acquisition  of  releases  from  other  owners  of 
Merrill  Creek  reservoir  storage  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team 
determined  that  surface-water  use  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  met 
without  a  noticeable  impact  to  the  instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware  River.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  surface-water-use  impact  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minor. 

Because  Site  7-2  is  located  near  the  PSEG  Site,  Delaware  River  water  quality,  flow 
characteristics,  and  river  cross  section  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  water-quality  impacts  from  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those  determined  for  the  PSEG  Site 
in  Section  5.2.3  and  that  the  surface-water-quality  impacts  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minor. 

Groundwater  withdrawal,  as  was  indicated  in  ER  Section  9.3.2  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  would  be 
necessary  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses,  because  Delaware  River  water  is  brackish  in  the 
Site  7-2  area.  For  the  sake  of  consistency  in  comparison,  it  was  assumed  that  the  amount  of 
groundwater  withdrawal  for  general  site  purposes,  including  the  potable  and  sanitary  water 
system,  demineralized  water  distribution  system,  fire  protection  system,  and  other 
miscellaneous  systems  at  Site  7-2,  would  be  the  same  as  required  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As 
discussed  in  ER  Section  3.3  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280),  an  average  of  210  gpm  and  a  maximum  of 
953  gpm  would  be  required  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses.  This  water  could  likely  be 
supplied  from  pumping  of  groundwater  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer.  According  to 
USGS  there  are  production  wells  to  the  north  and  west  of  the  alternative  site  at  distances  of 
8  and  10  mi,  respectively  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  These  wells  withdrew  more  than 
1  million  gal  per  year  (as  of  2003)  and  depressed  groundwater  levels  about  2  ft  within  a  mile  of 
the  wells.  If  the  groundwater  needs  of  the  plant  were  supplied  by  wells  within  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  pumping  rates  would  be  greater  than  those  discussed  above 
and  drawdowns  would  be  greater  and  extend  farther.  These  pumping  impacts  could  extend  to  a 
wellhead  protection  area,  which  is  located  within  1  mi  of  the  site  according  to  ER  Figure  2.3-20 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280),  but  would  not  affect  the  aquifer  beyond  this  localized  area.  Groundwater 
withdrawal  would  also  be  regulated  by  both  the  DRBC  and  the  NJDEP.  As  a  result,  impacts  to 
water  use  due  to  pumping  of  groundwater  during  operation  would  be  minor. 

During  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  impacts  on  groundwater  quality 
could  result  from  accidental  spills.  Because  BMPs  would  be  used  to  quickly  remediate  spills 
and  no  intentional  discharge  to  groundwater  would  occur,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
groundwater-quality  impacts  from  operations  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minimal.  Groundwater 
withdrawal  for  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  likely  be  from  the  Wenonah-Mount 
Laurel  aquifer.  Although  salinity  is  currently  below  drinking  water  standards  in  the  area  of 
Site  7-2,  additional  pumping  may  increase  salinity  somewhat  within  the  aquifer.  However, 

USGS  results  (Pope  and  Gordon  1999-TN3006)  show  that  changes  in  aquifer  salinity  have 
been  more  responsive  to  historic  sea  levels  than  to  regional  groundwater  withdrawals  in  the 
20th  century.  In  addition,  groundwater  is  not  likely  used  heavily  in  the  area  of  Site  7-2.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  groundwater-quality  impacts  from  the  operation  of  a 
new  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

In  addition  to  water-use  and  water-quality  impacts  from  building  and  operations  activities,  this 
cumulative  analysis  considers  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  the  same  water  resources.  The  actions  and  projects  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-2  that 
are  considered  in  this  cumulative  analysis  are  listed  in  Table  9-18. 

The  review  team  is  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  the  water  resources 
available  for  cooling  and  the  impacts  of  reactor  operations  on  water  resources  for  other  users. 
Because  Site  7-2  is  located  near  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  the  potential  changes  in  climate 
would  be  similar  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Therefore  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impact 
of  climate  change  on  water  resources  would  be  similar  to  the  proposed  site. 

Cumulative  Water-Use  Impacts 

Based  on  a  review  of  the  history  of  water  use  and  water  resources  planning  in  the  Delaware 
River  Basin,  the  review  team  determined  that  past  and  present  use  of  the  surface  waters  in  the 
basin  has  been  noticeable,  necessitating  the  consideration,  development,  and  implementation 
of  careful  planning. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18,  consumptive  water  use  of  SGS  and  HCGS  were  considered 
by  the  review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  surface-water  impacts.  Because  the  water  quality 
and  potential  consumptive  water  use  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar 
to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  6.9  percent  of  its  current 
allocation  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir.  As  stated  in  Section  5.2.2,  the  review  team  determined 
that  obtaining  this  additional  allocation  was  feasible  and  would  ensure  that  a  new  plant  could 
operate  without  noticeable  impact  to  other  water  users,  even  under  declared  drought  conditions, 
and  without  the  need  to  release  additional  flows  to  meet  instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware 
River. 

Mainly  because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  use  from  past  and 
present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be 
MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant's  incremental 
contribution  to  this  impact  would  not  be  significant. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18.  regional  groundwater  withdrawal  was  considered  by  the 
review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  groundwater  impacts.  Other  projects  do  not  use 
groundwater  or  are  too  far  from  Site  7-2  to  interact  with  groundwater  use  at  the  site.  On  a 
regional  scale,  pumping  of  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  has  drawn  down  water  levels 
more  than  60  ft  around  high  use  areas  such  as  Camden,  but  these  effects  do  not  extend  to  the 
Site  7-2  area  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  discussed  previously,  drawdowns  within  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  are  expected  to  be  localized  around  the  wells.  As  a  result,  the 
groundwater-use  impact  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2 


November  2015

would  be  minor.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  on 
groundwater  use  would  be  MODERATE.  The  new  plant  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to 
the  cumulative  impact. 

Cumulative  Water-Quality  Impacts 

As  stated  in  Section  7.2.2. 1,  DRBC  has  implemented  careful  planning  and  regulation  of  water 
quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  Although  there  have  been  improvements  in  water  quality 
(e.g.,  improved  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen)  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  because  of  careful 
planning  and  management  policies  put  in  place  by  DRBC,  the  presence  of  toxic  compounds 
leads  to  advisories  for  fish  consumption  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  In  its  review  of  the  PSEG 
license  renewal  application  for  SGS  and  HCGS,  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  water  quality  will 
likely  continue  to  be  adversely  affected  by  human  activities  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin 
(NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ).  The  review  team  concludes  that  past  and  present  actions  in  the 
Delaware  River  Basin  have  resulted  in  a  noticeable  impact  to  water  quality. 

The  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  may  result  in  alterations  to  land  surface,  surface-water 
drainage  pathways,  and  water  bodies.  These  projects  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local 
permits  that  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  Therefore,  the  impacts  to  surface-water  quality 
from  these  projects  are  not  expected  to  be  noticeable.  The  discharge  for  a  plant  at  Site  7-2 
would  be  located  at  Delaware  RM  48.4,  about  2.6  mi  from  the  SGS  discharge  and  within  the 
SGS  thermal  plume  HDA  during  the  summer  months.  The  area  affected  by  the  combined 
thermal  plumes  from  SGS  and  a  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  small  and  localized.  In  addition,  the 
extent  of  largest  excess  temperatures  from  a  new  plant  would  be  localized  near  the  discharge 
outlet  far  from  the  areas  of  large  excess  temperatures  at  SGS.  Also,  while  reviewing  the 
NJPDES  application  for  a  new  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River,  DRBC  and  NJDEP  would  have 
the  opportunity  to  designate  an  HDA  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  require  discharge  rules 
that  would  protect  the  aquatic  environment.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  the 
cumulative  impact  of  the  combined  discharges  from  SGS  and  a  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  not 
noticeably  affect  the  Delaware  River. 

Because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  from  past  and  present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-2  would  be  MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant’s 
incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  would  not  be  significant. 

Based  on  the  proposed  or  possible  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18,  additional  impacts  to 
groundwater  water  quality  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  As  discussed  previously,  BMPs  would 
be  implemented  and  dewatering  and  pumping  within  the  Site  7-2  area  is  unlikely  to  induce  flow 
from  an  area  of  higher  salinity  into  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.2,  groundwater  withdrawals  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest 
have  noticeably  altered  the  groundwater  quality  in  localized  areas  where  pumping  occurs  near 
aquifer  recharge  areas.  This  is  a  concern  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  where  pumping  from  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  may  induce  the  flow  of  saline  water  from  the  overlying 
Vincentown  aquifer.  Because  of  the  distance  of  Site  7-2  from  the  Delaware  River,  pumping 
from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  is  not  likely  to  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  on 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


groundwater  quality  near  Site  7-2.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
groundwater-quality  impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects,  as 
well  as  climate  change,  would  be  MODERATE.  The  new  plant  would  not  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 4. 3  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources 

The  following  analysis  includes  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting 
from  building  activities  and  operations  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-2. 
The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
may  impact  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-18. 

Site  Description 

Site  7-2  is  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  This  is  a  flat  greenfield  site  located  12  mi  east 
of  the  Delaware  River,  which  would  act  as  the  primary  water  source.  The  elevations  on  this  site 
range  from  120  to  140  ft  above  MSL.  The  site  has  a  total  area  of  996  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains  Landscape  Region.  This  region  contains 
important  freshwater  tidal  waters  and  brackish  waters  of  the  upper  estuary  system  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The  tidal  freshwater  marshes  are  considered  to 
be  among  New  Jersey’s  most  rare  and  valuable  habitat  types.  Additionally,  the  Southern 
Piedmont  Plains  contains  important  grassland  components  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
system  including  fens,  wet  meadows,  impounded  agricultural  lands,  and  upland  agricultural 
lands.  This  area  is  farmed  extensively,  but  still  contains  relatively  large  forest  and  wetland 
complexes  in  some  locations.  The  terrestrial  species  of  concern  in  the  Southern  Piedmont 
Plains  are  primarily  found  in  wetland,  forest,  or  grassland  habitats  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  ecological  conditions  for  Site  7-2  and  the  6-mi  vicinity  are  typical  of  the  extensively  farmed 
parts  of  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains.  Most  of  the  land  is  used  for  agriculture.  The  forested 
areas  consist  mainly  of  scattered  woodlots  and  strips  of  trees  along  streams.  Wetlands  in  this 
area  are  very  small  and  restricted  to  isolated  low  areas.  There  are  virtually  no  grasslands  in  the 
area.  Offsite  corridors  for  access  roads,  the  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines  are  largely  restricted 
to  the  immediate  site  vicinity,  and  the  natural  habitats  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  those 
found  on  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

No  site-specific  surveys  for  threatened  and  endangered  species  were  conducted  at  Site  7-2. 
Information  on  protected  and  rare  species  that  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-2  was  obtained 
from  NJDEP  and  the  FWS  ECOS.  There  are  four  Federally  listed  species  known  to  or  believed 
to  occur  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  7-2:  the  swamp  pink  ( Helonias  bullata),  the  bog  turtle 
( Glyptemys  muhlenbergii ),  the  northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis),  and  the  rufa  red 
knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa).  All  four  Federally  listed  species  are  listed  as  threatened.  NJDEP 
considers  all  Federally  listed  species  as  endangered.  In  addition,  14  State-listed  endangered 
species,  15  State-listed  threatened  species,  and  76  species  listed  by  NJDEP  as  being  of

special  concern  or  regional  priority  wildlife  species  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-2 
(FWS  2014-TN3333;  NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  NJDEP  information  shows  that  a  total  of  eight  listed  animal  species  and  two  listed  plant 
species  have  been  recorded  within  about  1  mi  of  Site  7-2  (Table  9-19)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Documentation  of  the  actual  presence  of  any  of  these  species  on  the  site  and  along  offsite 
corridors  would  require  that  detailed  field  surveys  be  conducted.  NJDEP  data  also  note  the 
presence  of  two  Natural  Heritage  Priority  Sites  in  the  area  of  Site  7-2.  One  site  is  0.6  mi  from 
Site  7-2,  and  the  other  is  0.8  mi  from  Site  7-2.  These  are  sites  with  specific  habitats  that  contain 
protected  and  rare  species.  Additionally,  there  is  one  State-listed  endangered  plant  species, 
Chinquapin  ( Castanea  pumila),  protected  under  the  Highlands  Water  Protection  and  Planning 
Act  (NJSA  13:20-1  et  seq.  -TN4310),  that  has  the  potential  of  being  on  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).

Thunderqut  Pond  Wildlife  Management  Area 

This  2,169-ac  WMA  is  located  along  the  Deep  Run  River  in  Alloway  Township,  Salem  County. 
The  habitat  on  this  WMA  consists  of  mixed  coniferous/deciduous  forest  and  areas  of  deciduous 
wooded  wetlands.  No  access  is  allowed  to  the  onsite  Sycamore  Lake  from  January  1  through 
July  31  to  afford  protection  for  nesting  bald  eagles  ( Haliaeetus  leucocephalus).  This  lake  was 
constructed  in  1955,  is  about  15  ac  in  size,  and  is  used  primarily  for  recreational  purposes 
(e.g.,  fishing  and  boating)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Maskell’s  Mill  Pond  Wildlife  Management  Area 

This  1 ,1 12-ac  WMA  is  located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County.  The  site 
offers  boat  and  canoe  access  to  Maskell’s  Mill  Pond.  The  southern  arm  of  the  pond  is  more 
secluded  and  contains  a  wooden  bridge  where  visitors  can  access  the  area.  Habitat  in  the 
WMA  consists  of  deciduous  oak-pine  forest.  It  supports  red-eared  sliders  ( Trachemys  scripta 
elegans),  painted  turtles  ( Chrysemys  picta),  and  eastern  box  turtles  ( Terrapene  Carolina 
Carolina).  It  also  supports  a  diversity  of  birds,  including  bald  eagle,  prairie  warbler  ( Dendroica 
discolor),  scarlet  tanager,  wood  thrush  ( Hylocichla  mustelina),  and  northern  bobwhite 
(NJWLT  2014-TN3204). 

Building  Impacts 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-2  would  directly  impact  (permanently  and 
temporarily)  394  ac  of  land.  A  total  of  602  ac  of  land  within  the  site  boundaries  would  not  be 
directly  disturbed.  However,  certain  building  activities  would  result  in  indirect  disturbance 
(noise,  dust,  etc.)  to  much  of  the  area  within  the  site  boundaries.  This  could  result  in  additional 
wildlife  impacts  in  terms  of  affecting  movements  and  causing  further  displacement  from  the  site. 
The  development  of  the  access  road,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipeline  corridors  would  result  in  the 
disturbance  of  an  additional  294  ac  of  potential  habitat.  In  total,  1 ,290  ac  of  potential  habitat 
would  be  directly  or  indirectly  impacted  as  a  result  of  building  at  Site  7-2.  The  total  acreage  of 
forest,  wetlands,  and  grassland  habitat  on  the  site  was  estimated  based  on  GIS  mapping  data. 
Terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  that  would  be  affected  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
and  support  facilities  at  Site  7-2  include  about  1 , 1 02  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  11  ac  of 
developed  land,  29  ac  of  barren  land,  95  ac  of  forest  land,  7  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine 
deepwater  area,  33  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  5  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland, 

37  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  6  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  likely  connect  with  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM 
region  (see  Section  7.0).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  a  connector  transmission  line 
from  Site  7-2  to  this  new  grid  stability  line.  The  line  would  be  routed  through  a  200-ft  corridor  for 
4.1  mi  and  would  disturb  about  105  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  3  ac  of  developed  land,  1  ac  of 
barren  land,  56  ac  of  forest  land,  11  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  less  than  1  ac 
of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  amount  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  disturbed  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  Site  7-2  would  be  minimal  for  most  of  the  habitats  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  There  are 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


about  53,694  ac  of  planted/cultivated  lands,  1 ,869  ac  of  barren  land,  28,  083  ac  of  forest,  768  ac 
of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  1 0,839  ac  of  freshwater  forest/shrub  wetland,  and  1 ,052  ac  of 
other  wetland  habitat  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  However,  5  percent  of  the  1 38  ac  of 
estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  habitat  available  and  1 1  percent  of  the  291  ac  of  estuarine  and 
marine  wetland  habitat  available  would  be  disturbed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  a  result, 
building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  support  structures,  and  transmission  line  at  Site  7-2  would 
have  a  noticeable  impact  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 

There  is  the  potential  for  impacts  to  open  country  bird  species  (e.g.,  American  kestrel  [Falco 
sparverius ])  and  those  that  frequent  smaller  woodlots  (e.g.,  Cooper’s  hawk  [Accipiter  coo peri /]). 
Fragmentation  and  loss  of  forested  areas  could  also  potentially  impact  species  that  are  more 
area  sensitive  such  as  wood  thrush.  Inadvertent  impacts  to  slower  moving  species  (e.g., 
eastern  box  turtle)  are  also  a  possibility.  Potential  impacts  to  the  Federally  threatened  swamp 
pink  due  to  wetland  disturbance  are  a  possible  concern.  However,  swamp  pink  occurs  in 
palustrine  forested  wetlands  with  canopy  closures  of  20  to  100  percent  (Section  2.4.1).  Habitat 
for  the  swamp  pink  would  not  be  expected  at  Site  7-2.  However,  wetland  and  forested  areas 
are  considered  important  resources  for  the  Federally  listed  and  proposed  Federally  listed 
species.  The  loss  of  about  87  ac  of  wetlands  and  95  ac  of  forest  could  affect  the  Federally 
listed  bog  turtle  and  northern  long-eared  bat.  Impacts  to  these  resources  may  warrant 
mitigation.  Therefore,  impacts  to  important  wildlife  species  as  a  result  of  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-2  could  be  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing. 

Displaced  wildlife  species  may  be  forced  into  the  Franks  Cabin  and  Pecks  Corner  sites  and  the 
Maskell’s  Mill  Pond  and  Thundergut  Pond  WMAs  as  a  result  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-2.  Displaced  wildlife  species  could  place  added  pressure  on  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  as  a  result  of  increased  competition  for  limited  resources.  However,  these 
sites  would  not  be  expected  to  be  directly  impacted  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-2. 

It  is  expected  that  a  project  of  this  size  would  result  in  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources,  including  habitat  loss,  fragmentation,  and  disturbance.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  result  in  the  loss  of  available  onsite  habitat.  Noise,  lights,  and  dust  during  building 
activities  could  displace  species  in  adjacent  areas,  reducing  viable  habitat.  Less  mobile  species 
would  be  impacted  the  most  by  building  at  Site  7-2,  and  some  mortality  would  be  expected. 

More  mobile  wildlife  species  would  be  capable  of  moving  to  habitat  in  adjacent  areas.  These 
displaced  species  may  experience  impacts  as  a  result  of  increased  competition  for  more  limited 
resources.  Adjacent  WMAs,  preserves,  and  refuges  could  be  affected  by  increased  demand  for 
limited  resources  as  a  result  of  species  displacement.  The  habitat  available  at  Site  7-2  is 
common  to  Salem  County,  and  sufficient  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  exist  in  the  Southern 
Piedmont  Plains.  However,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  the  impacts  to  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  noticeable  as  a 
result  of  the  disturbance  of  a  significant  portion  of  wetlands  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  and  the  loss  of 
wetland  and  forest  habitat  that  is  important  to  Federally  listed  and  proposed  Federally  listed 
species.

Operational  Impacts 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  that  may  result  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  include  those  associated  with  cooling  towers,  transmission 
system  structures,  maintenance  of  transmission  line  ROWs,  and  the  presence  of  project 
facilities  that  permanently  eliminate  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Operational  impacts  would 
be  similar  to  those  described  in  Section  5.3.1 ,  although  there  may  be  minor  differences  as  a 
result  of  topography,  climate,  and  elevation.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  the 
operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minimal. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Several  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  could  affect  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  in  ways  similar  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-2.  Table  9-18  lists  these  projects,  and  descriptions  of  their  contributions  to  cumulative 
impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  are  provided  below. 

The  Piedmont  Plains  suffered  nearly  50  percent  of  all  development  that  occurred  in  New  Jersey 
between  1984  and  1995.  Grassland,  wetland,  upland  forest,  and  estuarine  emergent  wetlands 
sustained  the  greatest  losses.  Although  the  area  has  suffered  extensive  losses  due  to 
development,  large  areas  of  smaller  fragmented  habitats  exist  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  WMAs  and  parks  listed  in  Table  9-18  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  adverse  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 

Most  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  are  operational  and  have  resulted  in  the  conversion  of 
natural  areas  to  industrial  and  commercial  development.  These  past  actions  have  resulted  in 
loss  and/or  fragmentation  of  natural  habitat  and  displacement  of  wildlife.  These  projects  include 
operational  nuclear  power  plants  located  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  Additionally,  three  operational 
fossil-fuel  power  plants,  Camp  Pedricktown  Redevelopment,  and  the  Salem  County  Solid  Waste 
Landfill  would  continue  to  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 
The  development  and  operation  of  these  projects  would  continue  to  reduce,  fragment,  and 
degrade  natural  forest,  open  field,  and  wetland  habitats  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains. 
Operational  projects  with  tall  structures,  such  as  the  cooling  towers  at  HCGS,  would  cause 
avian  and  bat  mortalities.  However,  the  projects  listed  are  spread  throughout  the  region,  and 
avian  and  bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collision  with  tall  structures  would  not  cause  a  noticeable 
effect  to  avian  or  bat  populations. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  NJLWD  projects  that  the  population  of 
Salem  County  will  increase  by  about  5  percent  between  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014- 
TN3332).  Although  NJLWD  predicts  relatively  low  population  growth,  the  development  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  coupled  with  additional  projects  outlined  in  Table  9-18  could  substantially 
increase  the  currently  projected  level  of  urbanization  for  the  area.  Urbanization  in  the  vicinity  of 
Site  7-2  would  reduce  area  in  natural  vegetation  and  open  space  and  decrease  connectivity 
between  wetlands,  forests,  and  other  wildlife  habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result  of 
urbanization  would  result  in  added  pressures  to  the  remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife 
populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that  these  activities  would  substantially  affect  the

overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel  corridors  near  Site  7-2  or  the  general  extent  of 
forested  areas  in  the  site  vicinity. 

Other  reasonably  foreseeable  projects  planned  in  the  area  of  Site  7-2  that  could  add  to  the 
cumulative  impacts  include  a  site-redevelopment  project  as  the  result  of  a  BRAC  for  Camp 
Pedricktown,  an  airport  infrastructure  upgrade,  and  the  USACE  channel  deepening  project. 

The  Camp  Pedricktown  redevelopment  area  and  Millville  Municipal  Airport  improvements  are 
currently  developed/disturbed  and.  therefore,  would  not  further  impact  any  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources.  The  USACE  channel  deepening  project  involves  dredging  and  deepening 
portions  of  the  main  channel  of  the  Delaware  River  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  Terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  could  be  affected  by  the  disposal  of  dredging  materials,  which  could 
potentially  require  new  disposal  facilities.  However,  the  USACE  NEPA  documentation  for  the 
channel  deepening  project  concludes  that  there  are  sufficient  dredge  disposal  areas  in  the 
region  and  that  there  would  be  no  significant  impacts  from  the  project  (USACE  1997-TN2281; 
USACE  2009-TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

The  fourth  project  with  the  potential  to  affect  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  the  proposed 
transmission  line  corridor  being  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the 
PJM  region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi- 
wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  WMC  (“West  Macro-Corridor”)  and  transmission  line  ROWs 
that  extend  55  mi  from  the  PSEG  property  to  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania.  The 
transmission  line  ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide.  The  development  of 
the  transmission  line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  more  than  1 .500  ac  of  land.  Habitats 
that  could  be  affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests,  mixed  forest, 
agricultural  land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  exact 
amounts  of  the  resources  are  not  known,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  project  would  cause 
fragmentation  and  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  However,  the  corridor 
would  be  expected  to  follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  A  new  transmission  line 
ROW  would  cause  wildlife  mortalities  as  a  result  of  operations  and  maintenance.  However, 
mortalities  would  not  be  expected  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  wildlife  populations,  and 
sufficient  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  exist  elsewhere  in  the  Southern  Piedmont  Plains. 
PSEG  identified  more  than  27,000  ac  of  wetland  and  36,000  ac  of  forestland  resources  in  the 
5-mi-wide  corridor  that  could  be  traversed  by  the  potential  new  transmission  line  ROW.  It  is 
unknown  exactly  how  much  of  these  wetlands  and  forestlands  would  be  affected  by  the  ROW, 
and  mitigation  may  be  required  by  applicable  permitting  entities.  The  review  team  has 
determined  that  as  a  result  of  potential  losses  of  wetland  resources,  the  impact  of  a  new 
transmission  line  ROW  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  noticeable. 

The  report  on  climate  change  impacts  in  the  United  States  provided  by  GCRP  (2014-TN3472) 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions.  Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project  temperatures  to  rise  2.5°F  to  4°F  in  the  winter  and 
1 ,5°F  to  3.5°F  in  the  summer  over  the  next  several  decades.  Winters  are  projected  to  be  much 
shorter  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more  precipitation.  Cities  that  currently  experience  few  days 
above  100°F  each  summer  would  average  20  or  more  days.  Hot  summer  conditions  would 
come  3  weeks  earlier  and  last  3  additional  weeks  into  the  fall.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise 
more  than  the  global  average,  with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


These  projected  changes  could  potentially  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife 
populations.  Large-scale  shifts  in  the  ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and 
animal  migration  that  are  already  occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue. 

The  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-2,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities 
described  above,  would  noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities 
would  result  in  the  loss  or  modification  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  that  could  potentially 
affect  important  species  that  live  in  or  migrate  through  the  area.  For  these  reasons,  the  review 
team  has  concluded  that  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  in  conjunction  with  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  would  be  noticeable.  Building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  contribute  to  the  noticeable  impacts. 

Summary 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  were  evaluated  based  on  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  the  conceptual  layout  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  and  an 
independent  review  by  the  review  team.  Permanent  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
and  wildlife  would  result  in  effects  to  these  resources.  Additionally,  impacts  to  these  resources 
from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  noticeable.  Any  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  temporarily  disturbed  by  building  a  new  plant  are  expected  to  return  to 
predisturbed  conditions.  Operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be 
similar  to  those  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  conclusion  of  the  review  team  is  that 
cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  and  wildlife,  including  threatened  and 
endangered  species,  would  be  noticeable  in  the  surrounding  landscape  and  therefore 
MODERATE.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  a 
significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 4. 4  Aquatic  Resources 

The  following  analysis  evaluates  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  on  aquatic 
ecology  resources  at  Site  7-2.  The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past, 
present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  that  could  affect  aquatic  resources.  In  developing  this  EIS,  the 
review  team  relied  on  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  the  alternative  site  evaluation 
in  accordance  with  ESRP  9.3  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Reconnaissance-level  information  is  data 
that  are  readily  available  from  regulatory  and  resources  agencies  (e.g.,  NMFS,  FWS,  and 
NJDEP)  and  other  public  sources  such  as  scientific  literature,  books,  and  Internet  websites.  It 
can  also  include  information  obtained  through  site  visits  (NRC  2012-TN2498;  NRC  2012- 
TN2499;  NRC  2012-TN2855)  and  documents  provided  by  the  applicant. 

Affected  Environment 

The  affected  aquatic  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of 
Delaware  RM  48.4,  and  numerous  salt  marsh  creek  systems  and  streams  on  and  near  Site  7-2 
(S&L  2010-TN2671 ).  The  water  withdrawal  rate  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  for  Site  7-2

would  be  the  same  as  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (78,196  gpm)  because 
Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  same  DRBC  water-quality  zone.  Water  availability  issues  at  Site  7-2 
would  also  be  the  same  as  for  the  PSEG  Site  in  that  an  additional  6.9  percent  of  the  Merrill 
Creek  reservoir  allocation  would  be  needed  during  drought  conditions,  as  described  in  Section 
5.2.2.  There  are  no  known  exceptional  aquatic  resources  at  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Commercial/Recreational  Species 

Site  7-2  has  the  same  species  as  those  listed  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  Commercial 
fisheries  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  in  offshore  Atlantic  waters  for  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  include  American  Eel,  American  Shad,  Atlantic  Croaker,  Atlantic  Menhaden,  Black 
Drum,  Black  Sea  Bass,  Bluefish,  Butterfish,  Channel  Catfish,  Conger  Eel,  Northern  Kingfish, 
Northern  Searobin,  Scup,  Silver  Hake,  Spot,  Striped  Bass,  Summer  Flounder,  Weakfish,  White 
Perch,  Windowpane  Flounder,  Winter  Flounder,  blue  crab,  eastern  oyster,  horseshoe  crab, 
knobbed  whelk,  channeled  whelk,  and  the  northern  quahog  clam.  All  of  these  species  are  also 
considered  recreationally  important,  with  the  exception  of  American  Shad,  Atlantic  Menhaden, 
Butterfish,  Conger  Eel,  Silver  Hake,  Windowpane  Flounder,  eastern  oyster,  horseshoe  crab, 
knobbed  whelk,  channeled  whelk,  and  northern  quahog  clam,  and  are  described  in  detail  in 
Section  2.4. 2. 3.  Note  that  since  2008  there  has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of 
horseshoe  crabs  in  New  Jersey  (ASMFC  2014-TN351 1). 

Non-Native  and  Nuisance  Species 

Site  7-2  has  the  same  potential  for  nuisance  species  as  those  listed  for  the  PSEG  Site 
(Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  These  include  the  Asian  shore  crab,  Chinese  mitten  crab,  Northern 
Snakehead,  and  Flathead  Catfish. 

Essential  Fish  Habitats 

The  Site  7-2  water  intake  and  discharge  areas  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  designated  as 
EFH  for  many  species  by  the  Mid-Atlantic  Regional  Fishery  Management  Council,  and  the 
NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  and  tidal  waters  near  the  PSEG 
Site  to  be  EFH  for  15  species  (PNNL  2013-TN2687;  NMFS  2013-TN2804),  as  described  in 
Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Due  to  proximity,  Site  7-2  EFH  would  be  expected  to  be  similar  to  that  for  the 
PSEG  Site. 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

There  are  no  critical  habitats  designated  by  NMFS  or  FWS  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-2.  Listed 
species  found  near  the  proposed  water  intake  and  discharge  structures,  near  the  possible  barge 
docking  facility  and  inlet  channel,  and  along  the  proposed  transmission  line  corridor  are  listed  in 
Table  9-20  (NMFS  2013-TN2804). 

The  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  Federally  and  State  endangered.  The  Federally 
threatened  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  of  the  loggerhead  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  State  endangered  for 
both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  The  Atlantic  green  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  endangered  at  both 
the  Federal  and  State  of  Delaware  levels  and  listed  as  threatened  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

All  sea  turtles  have  certain  life-history  similarities  in  that  females  swim  ashore  to  sandy  beaches

and  deposit  eggs  in  nesting  pits  that  are  covered  to  allow  incubation.  Juveniles  hatch,  struggle 
out  of  the  sandy  nest,  and  make  their  way  to  their  respective  ocean  habitats.  Although  there  are 
no  known  records  of  sea  turtles  nesting  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  sea  turtles  have  been 
observed  to  forage  in  Delaware  Bay  waters.

Adult  Shortnose  Sturgeon  use  freshwater  for  spawning  and  estuarine  and  marine  habitats  for 
feeding.  Juveniles  migrate  downriver  to  estuarine  waters  and  may  go  back  and  forth  between 
freshwater  and  estuarine  habitats  for  several  years  before  maturing  to  adults.  Adults  sometimes 
migrate  to  marine  habitats  for  feeding  but  live  the  majority  of  their  life  cycle  in  estuarine  habitats 
(Rohde  et  al.  1994-TN2208;  NOAA  2012-TN2173).  Migration  to  spawning  habitat  occurs  in  late 
winter  and  spring,  and  adults  return  to  estuarine  waters  in  May  and  June  (Gilbert  1989- 
TN2149).  Spawning  occurs  in  freshwaters  characterized  by  low-to-moderate  velocities  and  over 
substrates  that  include  clay,  sand,  gravel,  and  woody  debris.  Sturgeon  feed  on  benthic 
invertebrates  such  as  snails,  insect  larvae,  crustaceans,  and  worms  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149). 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  system  (NOAA  2012-TN2173).  A  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  was  collected  in  a  bottom  trawl  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  just  downriver  of  the 
PSEG  Site  in  2004  (PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Two  Shortnose  Sturgeon  were  collected  in  2008  and 
one  in  2010  from  bottom  trawl  sampling  between  Delaware  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1 
and  RM  74.6),  which  is  upriver  of  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential 
dredging  activities  for  Site  7-2  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  share  many  life-history  characteristics  with  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  in  that 
adults  migrate  to  freshwater  to  spawn  and  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as  worms, 
crustaceans,  and  aquatic  insects  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Unlike  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  adult 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  prefer  more  marine  habitats  and  make  extensive  migrations  away  from  natal 
estuaries  beginning  as  subadults  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Historically,  the  Delaware  River 
supported  the  largest  population  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (Secor  and 
Waldman  1999-TN2207).  Tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
followed  migration  patterns  similar  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  spawning  potentially  occurring

mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal  Delaware  reaches  between  Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania,  and 
Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and  Fox  2007-TN2194).  Gill  net  surveys  by  the  Delaware 
Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  collected  more  than  1 ,700  juveniles  near  Artificial  Island  and  the 
Cherry  Island  Flats  (upriver  of  Site  7-2)  between  1 991  and  1 998  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082).  A

River  Estuary  waters  between  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6).  which  is  upriver 
of  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential  dredging  activities  for  Site  7-2 
(PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2010-TN2570). 

Three  New  Jersey  threatened  freshwater  mussel  species,  tidewater  mucket,  triangle  floater,  and 
eastern  pondmussel  (previously  described  in  Sections  9. 3. 2. 4  and  9. 3. 3. 4),  are  listed  as 
occurring  in  Salem  County.  New  Jersey  (NatureServe  2012-TN2182;  NatureServe  2012- 
TN2183;  NatureServe  2012-TN2184;  respectively);  however,  there  are  no  State-listed 
occurrences  of  freshwater  mussel  species  within  a  1-mi  radius  of  either  the  Site  7-2  intake 
(NJDEP  201 3-TN2722)  or  the  Site  7-2  location  (NJDEP  201 3-TN3577). 

Field  studies  would  be  required  to  definitively  determine  whether  any  rare  or  protected  species 
are  present  in  streams  in  the  project  area.  Federally  endangered  Shortnose  and  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  are  known  to  occur  near  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential 
dredging  activities  at  Site  7-2. 

Building  Impacts 

Building  the  plant  structures,  roads,  and  transmission  lines  and  switchyard  would  disturb 
streams  on  the  site  and  along  offsite  corridors.  In  addition  to  buildings  and  other  structures, 
buried  water  intake  and  discharge  pipes  would  run  12.9  mi  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to 
the  site.  The  total  length  of  streams  that  would  be  affected  by  building  activities  on  Site  7-2, 
including  the  access  roads,  rail  spur,  and  water  pipelines,  is  9.710  ft  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

This  represents  0.7  percent  of  the  total  length  of  streams  within  6  mi  of  the  site.  In  addition,  an 
estimated  2,130  ft  of  streams  could  be  affected  by  activities  related  to  the  new  transmission 
corridor  and  switchyard  installation  (representing  less  than  0.5  percent  of  the  total  stream 
lengths  in  the  area)  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  However,  potential  impacts  to  streams  from 
transmission  corridor  installation  could  be  avoided  or  minimized  by  final  corridor  placement  and 
use  of  BMPs  to  reduce  erosion  and  sedimentation  effects  from  building  activities  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  installation  of  the  water  intake  structure,  and  possibly  a  barge  facility  with  a  turning  basin, 
would  result  in  disturbance  of  benthic  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Dredging  would 
disturb  about  6  ac  of  bottom  habitat  (about  145,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  intake  structure  and 
possibly  67  ac  (possibly  1,197,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  barge  facility  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  A 
barge  inlet  channel  may  also  be  needed.  Dredging  the  barge  inlet  channel  would  disturb  an 
additional  43  ac  of  benthic  habitat  and  would  remove  an  additional  490,000  yd3  of  dredged 
material  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  Installation  and  site-preparation  activities  could  temporarily  affect 
water  quality  but  would  require  Federal  and  State  permitting  and  use  of  BMPs  to  minimize  and 
mitigate  the  temporary  and  localized  effects.  Effects  on  aquatic  organisms  are  expected  to  be 
minimal  and  temporary  because  adjacent  habitat  is  accessible  and  mobile  aquatic  organisms 
such  as  fish  and  most  macroinvertebrates  would  be  able  to  avoid  or  move  away  from  the

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


affected  area  during  intake  installation  activities,  but  effects  could  be  greater  if  the  installation  of 
a  barge  facility  with  a  turning  basin  and  inlet  channel  are  required.  However,  the  impact  on 
aquatic  ecology  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  streams  on  the  site  and  in  pipeline  corridors 
would  be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  there  would  be  no  direct  discharges 
and  few  impacts  to  small  streams  on  the  site.  Operation  of  the  cooling  and  service  water 
systems  would  require  water  to  be  withdrawn  from  and  discharged  back  to  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  as  described  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Aquatic  impacts  associated  with  impingement  and 
entrainment  of  aquatic  biota  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  discharge  of  cooling  water  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  could  occur.  Because  the  specifications  associated  with  the  water 
intake  structure  include  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system  designed  to  meet  the  EPA  Phase  I 
regulations  for  new  facilities  (66  FR  65256-TN243),  the  maximum  through-screen  velocity  at  the 
water  intake  structure  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps.  Thus,  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  built  at 
Site  7-2,  the  anticipated  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  from  impingement  and  entrainment  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  not  expected  to  be  different  from  those  described  in  the  analysis 
presented  in  Section  5.3.2  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  Operational 
impacts  associated  with  water  quality  and  discharge  cannot  be  determined  without  additional 
detailed  analysis,  but  are  also  expected  to  be  similar  to  the  effects  described  for  the  PSEG  Site. 
Maintenance  activities  on  the  site  and  in  offsite  corridors  would  follow  BMPs  required  by  Federal 
and  State  permits  to  minimize  impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Consequently,  impacts  on  aquatic 
ecology  due  to  project  operations  at  Site  7-2  are  expected  to  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  alteration  and  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  as  described  in  Sections  2.4.2. 1 
and  7.3.2,  have  had  long-term  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  consequences  on  the 
aquatic  resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  numerous 
restoration  activities  in  targeted  portions  of  the  area.  For  assessment  of  cumulative  impacts  for 
Site  7-2,  the  ROI  includes  a  6-mi  radius  of  water  resources  around  the  site,  and  a  6-mi  radius 
around  the  point  of  the  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

The  non-nuclear  plant  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18  may  result  in  alterations  to  surface-water 
drainage  pathways  and  water  bodies.  It  is  not  expected  that  these  projects  would  have 
noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-2  because  they  would  need 
Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  The  past,  current,  and 
future  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  will  result  in  continued  losses  of  aquatic  species  through 
impingement  and  entrainment  at  the  water  intake  systems  and  alteration  of  thermal  profiles  in  the 
immediate  Delaware  River  Estuary  area  located  near  these  facilities.  Ongoing  restoration  efforts 
through  the  PSEG  EEP  will  continue  to  provide  mitigation  for  losses  by  increasing  available 
habitat  for  early  life  stages  of  aquatic  organisms  and  restoring  previously  fragmented  habitats. 

A  grid  stability  transmission  line  may  be  necessary  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-2,  and  would  be  similar  to  that  described  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  7.3.2).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Anthropogenic  activities  such  as  residential  or  industrial  development  near  the  vicinity  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  could  present  additional  constraints  on  aquatic  resources.  It  is  not 
expected  that  these  projects  would  have  noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  of 
Site  7-2  because  they  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation 
of  BMPs.  The  review  team  is  also  aware  of  the  potential  for  climate  change  affecting  aquatic 
resources,  but  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the 
geographic  area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate 
change  could  lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation 
events,  increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472).  Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  Site 
7-2  through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  Elevated  water 
temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe  weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely 
reduce  aquatic  habitat,  but  specific  predictions  of  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to 
climate  change  are  inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events 
would  depend  on  the  intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities. 

Summary 

Impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG,  NMFS,  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  Properly 
siting  the  associated  transmission  line  and  switchyard;  avoiding  habitat  for  protected  species; 
minimizing  interactions  with  water  bodies  and  watercourses  along  the  corridors;  and  use  of 
BMPs  during  water  intake  and  discharge  structure  installation,  possible  installation  of  a  barge 
facility  with  a  turning  basin  and  inlet  channel,  transmission  line  corridor  preparation,  and  tower 
placement  would  minimize  building  and  operation  impacts.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  on  most  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  including 
Federally  and  State  threatened  and  endangered  species,  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  future  activities,  would 
be  MODERATE  to  LARGE.  The  new  plant  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the 
cumulative  impact. 

9.3.45  Socioeconomics 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.4,  Site  7-2  is  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  economic 
impact  area  for  Site  7-2  would  be  the  same  as  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  site  is  a  greenfield  site 
located  12  mi  east-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  approximately  6  mi  north  of  the  town  of 
Shiloh  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2010-TN257). 

The  review  team’s  baseline  discussion  focuses  on  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  Site  7-2.  As 
discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  expects  that  construction  and  operations  workers  for 
Site  7-2  would  likely  settle  in  the  same  areas  as  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
focuses  on  Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware  for  the  majority  of  impacts.  These  four  counties  compose  the  economic 
impact  area  for  Site  7-2. 

Based  on  experience  with  construction  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  PSEG  believes  about  84.5  percent 
of  the  workforce  required  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  come  from  within  the  50-mi

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


region  surrounding  the  proposed  site.  PSEG  assumes  the  remaining  15.5  percent  of  workers 
would  relocate  to  the  region  from  outside  and  would  choose  to  reside  in  the  same  four  counties 
that  house  the  majority  of  the  operations  workers.  The  review  team,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.4  and  5.4,  found  similar  estimates.  Thus,  both  adverse  and  beneficial 
socioeconomic  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  would  not  be  noticeable  except  in 
these  four  counties.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  finds  the  assumptions  to  be 
reasonable. 

Physical  and  Aesthetic  Impacts 

Physical  impacts  include  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public,  noise,  air  quality,  buildings, 
roads,  and  aesthetics.  The  physical  impacts  on  workers  would  be  similar  to  those  described  for 
the  PSEG  Site.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
workforces  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-2  is  within  0.5  mi  of  a  school  and  housing  developments.  Site  7-2  would  retrieve  its 
cooling  water  from  the  Delaware  River,  requiring  a  13-mi-long  water  pipeline  that  would  go 
through  WMAs  that  are  used  for  hunting,  trapping,  and  birding  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  PSEG 
would  also  build  a  5.4-mi-long  rail  spur  and  2.2  mi  of  new  road  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because 
the  site  is  a  greenfield  site,  PSEG  would  have  to  reroute  an  existing  transmission  line  about 
1 .8  mi  and  build  another  4.1-mi-long  transmission  line.  Even  with  mitigation  measures  similar  to 
those  discussed  in  Section  4.4.1,  during  the  building  phase,  these  areas  would  receive  adverse 
physical  impacts  from  noise,  vibration,  and  fugitive  dust.  Aesthetic  impacts  from  building  and 
operations  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.1 .6  and  5.4.1 .6.  The 
primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  HCGS  and  SGS  near  the  PSEG  Site  and 
the  proximity  of  the  Delaware  River  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield  site  and 
would  create  new  infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed  rural  areas,  and  new  infrastructure 
would  affect  previously  undisturbed  WMAs,  the  review  team  expects  the  aesthetic  impacts  from 
building  and  operations  to  be  noticeable  and  locally  destabilizing. 

Demography 

Section  2.5.1  discusses  the  baseline  demographic  information  in  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region.  Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic 
impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  predicts  the  same  workforce  requirements  and 
in-migrating  worker  housing  scenario  as  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.2  and  5.4.2.  The  review 
team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  demography  would  be  minimal  in 
the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Economic  and  Tax  Impacts 

Section  2.5.2. 1  discusses  the  baseline  economy  and  Section  2. 5. 2. 2  discusses  the  tax  structure 
in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region.  Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG 
Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the 
analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  economy  and  tax  revenues  from  the  building  and  operations  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  the  review  team  predicts  economic  and  tax  impacts  similar 
to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.3  and  5.4.3.  The  review  team  found  that  building-  and 


NUREG-2168 


9-174 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  economy  and  local  tax  revenues  would  range  from 
minimal  and  beneficial  in  the  region  and  economic  impact  area  to  a  major,  beneficial  impact  to 
Salem  County. 

Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services,  including 
transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education. 

Traffic 


Section  2. 5. 2. 3  discusses  the  local  roadways  and  transportation  characteristics  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  region.  Sections  4.4.4. 1  and  5.4.4. 1  discuss  the  traffic  impacts  around  the 
PSEG  Site.  Road  access  to  the  Site  7-2  area  is  provided  primarily  by  New  Jersey  Route  540, 
which  is  a  wide  two-lane  highway.  The  current  vehicle  count  on  the  road  is  5.406  vehicles. 

Road  access  to  the  site  itself  is  provided  by  County  Road  635.  a  narrow  two-lane  road 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  site  is  about  19  mi  from  Interstate  295  and  the  New  Jersey 
Turnpike  via  Route  540.  The  nearest  rail  spur  is  about  5  mi  east  of  the  site,  and  barge  access 
would  be  provided  by  the  Delaware  River,  about  10  mi  southwest  of  the  site.  The  site  would 
require  about  4  mi  of  roadway  improvements  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  Due  to  the  size  of  the 
workforce  for  building  and  the  similarity  of  the  roads  and  their  LOS  values  compared  to  the 
PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  expects  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact  from  traffic. 
Because  the  workforce  for  operations  is  smaller  (even  during  outages),  the  review  team  expects 
traffic  impacts  to  be  minimal. 

Recreation 


Section  2. 5. 2. 4  discusses  the  recreational  activities  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 

As  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 2  and  5. 4. 4. 2.  the  review  team  does  not  expect  any  stresses  to 
be  placed  upon  the  capacity  of  the  recreational  resources  in  the  PSEG  Site's  economic  impact 
area  and  region  from  new  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families.  This  would  also  be  true  for 
Site  7-2's  recreational  impacts.  Also,  like  the  PSEG  Site,  recreational  resources  near  Site  7-2 
would  receive  a  noticeable  aesthetic  impact  from  building  and  operational  activities  and  a 
noticeable  impact  from  traffic  during  peak  building  activities. 

However,  because  the  pipeline  corridor  would  cross  three  WMAs  where  there  is  trapping, 
hunting,  and  fishing,  the  review  team  expects  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing  impacts  on 
recreational  activities  in  these  areas  from  the  new  infrastructure  (PSEG  2010-TN257; 

PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Housing 

Section  2. 5. 2. 5  discusses  the  baseline  housing  market  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 
Site  7-2  is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact 
area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  housing  market 
from  the  building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2.  the  review  team 
predicts  housing  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 3  and  5. 4.4. 3.  The

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


primary  difference  would  be  that  many  of  the  46  houses  within  the  conceptual  site  boundaries 
would  have  to  be  removed  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
However,  any  taking  related  to  a  new  power  plant  would  have  to  be  performed  with  an  equitable 
compensation,  which  would  render  minimal  any  potential  impact  from  that  taking.  The  review 
team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  housing  market  would  be 
minimal  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Public  Services 

Section  2. 5.2.6  discusses  the  baseline  public  services  information  in  the  economic  impact  area. 
This  includes  water  and  wastewater,  police,  fire,  medical  services,  and  social  services.  Site  7-2 
is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the 
PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  public  services 
infrastructure  from  the  building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  the 
review  team  predicts  the  impacts  to  be  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 4  and 
5. 4. 4. 4.  The  review  team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  public 
services  infrastructure  would  be  minimal  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Education 


Section  2. 5. 2. 6  discusses  baseline  education  information  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Site  7-2 
is  located  in  the  same  county  as  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the 
PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  education  services  from  the 
building  and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  the  review  team  predicts 
impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.4. 5  and  5. 4. 4. 5.  The  review  team  found  that 
building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  education  services  would  be  minimal  in 
the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Summary  of  Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

The  review  team  has  concluded  from  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  review  of  existing 
reconnaissance-level  documentation,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation  that  the  impact  of 
building  and  operations  activities  on  regional  infrastructure  and  community  services — including 
housing,  public  services,  and  education — would  be  minor.  Physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  from 
building  and  operations  would  be  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing.  The  estimated  peak 
workforce  would  have  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact  on  traffic  near  Site  7-2. 
Increased  traffic  would  have  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact  on  recreational  facilities; 
however,  physical-aesthetic  impacts  would  have  a  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing 
impact  on  recreational  facilities  and  activities  near  Site  7-2. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

As  discussed  above,  the  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-2  is  Salem,  Cumberland,  and 
Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  The  review  team 
discusses  information  pertaining  to  these  areas  in  Sections  2.5  and  7.4.1.  Table  9-18  lists  the 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  associated  with  Site  7-2.  Building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  could  result  in  cumulative  impacts  on  the 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


demographics,  economy,  and  community  infrastructure  of  the  economic  impact  area  counties  in 
conjunction  with  those  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Within  the  economic  impact  area,  the  project  with  the  greatest  potential  to  affect  cumulative 
socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  the  continued  operation  of  the  three  nuclear  units  at  HCGS 
and  SGS.  The  other  projects  involve  continuation  of  development  in  the  economic  impact  area 
and  are  included  in  county  comprehensive  plans  and  in  other  public  agency  planning  processes. 
According  to  Section  2. 5. 1.3.  about  1,300  people  are  employed  at  HCGS  and  SGS,  and  the 
majority  of  the  workforce  lives  in  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Each  reactor 
has  outages  that  employ  a  further  1 .034  to  1 .361  workers  for  about  1  month  on  a  staggered 
18-  to  24-month  schedule  (about  an  outage  every  6  months  at  the  site).  Operations  at  HCGS 
and  SGS  also  contribute  to  economic  activity  and  tax  revenue  to  the  local  communities.  These 
characteristics  are  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5  and  in  the  HCGS  and  SGS  License  Renewal 
EIS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131). 

An  outage  at  the  HCGS/SGS  site  could  occur  during  peak  building  at  Site  7-2.  The  review  team 
considers  this  potential  occurrence  in  Section  7.4.  The  majority  of  traffic  impacts  discussed  in 
Section  7.4  would  occur  where  the  HCGS/SGS  workforce.  HCGS/SGS  outage  workforce,  and 
the  PSEG  Site  building  workforce  merge  in  and  around  Salem  City  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 
Because  Site  7-2  is  southeast  of  Salem  City,  the  review  team  expects  cumulative  impacts 
similar  to  those  discussed  in  Section  7.4  because  the  three  traffic  streams  may  merge  in  and 
around  Salem  City. 

The  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  expire  in  2036,  2040,  and  2046, 
respectively.  Salem  County  would  see  a  loss  in  property  tax  revenue.  PSEG  purchases  of 
supplies  and  materials,  and  employment.  However,  this  loss  would  be  partially  offset  by  the 
continued  operations  at  Site  7-2  compared  to  the  baseline  discussed  in  Section  2.5. 

Summary  of  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

The  review  team  expects  the  cumulative  effects  of  most  of  the  physical  impacts  to  be  SMALL 
with  the  exception  of  a  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetics.  The  LARGE  aesthetic  impact  is  because 
Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield  site  and  would  create  new  infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed  rural 
areas,  and  new  infrastructure  would  affect  previously  undisturbed  WMAs.  The  cumulative 
impacts  on  demography  would  be  SMALL.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  taxes  and  the  economy 
would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region,  except  for  a  MODERATE  and  beneficial 
income  tax  impact  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  a  LARGE  and  beneficial  economic  and  tax 
impact  to  Salem  County.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services 
would  be  SMALL  throughout  the  region,  with  the  exception  of  a  MODERATE  impact  from  traffic 
to  Salem  County  during  building  activities  and  a  LARGE  impact  to  recreation-based  aesthetics. 
Based  on  the  above  considerations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  socioeconomic 
impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-2  (with  the  exception  of  the  physical  and 
recreational  aesthetic  impacts  and  the  beneficial  impacts  to  taxes  and  the  economy)  would  not 
noticeably  contribute  to  the  existing  cumulative  socioeconomic  effects  discussed  earlier  in  this 
section.

9. 3. 4. 6  Environmental  Justice 

The  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-2  includes  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties 
in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  Because  of  the  proximity  of  Site  7-2  to  the 
PSEG  Site  (about  12  mi),  the  review  team  determined  that  the  analysis  of  populations  for  the 
PSEG  Site  was  a  close  approximation  of  an  independent  assessment  of  Site  7-2,  according  to 
the  methodology  discussed  in  Section  2.6.1.  Therefore,  the  review  team  used  the  distribution  of 
minority  and  low-income  populations  around  the  PSEG  Site  to  determine  minority  and  low- 
income  population  distributions  around  Site  7-2.  This  distribution  is  discussed  in  detail  in 
Section  2.6.  The  closest  minority  groups  to  Site  7-2  are  located  about  7  mi  to  the  north,  in 
Salem.  The  closest  low-income  populations  of  interest  to  Site  7-2  are  located  about  6  mi  to  the 
west,  in  Upper  Deerfield  Township  in  Cumberland  County  (PSEG  2012-TN2450).  The  review 
team  found  no  indication  of  subsistence  activities  in  the  economic  impact  area.  As  discussed  in 
Sections  2.5  and  2.6,  the  majority  of  migrant  populations  are  outage  workers  at  HCGS  and 
SGS.  The  closest  high-density  communities  are  in  Salem  and  Penns  Grove,  north  of  Carneys 
Point  (Salem  County  2010-TN2486). 

As  discussed  in  Section  9. 3. 4. 5,  the  review  team  expects  that  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  have  some  adverse  physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  to  the 
local  population.  However,  even  though  the  review  team  expects  adverse  physical  impacts 
during  building  and  operations,  distance,  intervening  foliage,  and  topography  would  significantly 
diminish  such  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations.  Therefore,  the  review  team  does 
not  expect  the  adverse  physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  to  be  disproportionately  high  and 
adverse  toward  minority  and  low-income  populations.  For  the  rest  of  the  economic  impact  area 
and  region,  the  review  team  expects  environmental  justice  impacts  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  environmental  justice  impacts. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Based  on  the  analysis  above  and  the  discussion  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Section  9. 3. 4. 5,  the 
review  team  determined  that  there  would  not  be  any  further  disproportionately  high  and  adverse 
impacts  on  environmental  justice  populations  above  and  beyond  those  discussed  in  this  section. 
The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  pathways  for  environmental  justice  impacts  from  the 
continued  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS. 

9.3.4  7  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past, 
present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  impact  historic  and  cultural  resources, 
including  the  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-1 8.  For  the  analysis  of  historic 
and  cultural  impacts  at  Site  7-2,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  considered  to  be  the  APE  that 
would  be  defined  for  this  proposed  undertaking.  This  includes  the  physical  APE,  defined  as  the 
area  directly  affected  by  the  site-development  and  operation  activities  at  the  site,  the 
transmission  lines,  and  the  visual  APE.  The  visual  APE  is  defined  as  the  additional  4.9-mi 
radius  around  the  physical  APE.  The  4.9-mi  radius  was  chosen  by  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  as

the  appropriate  distance  for  consideration  of  visual  resources  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  was 
therefore  applied  to  the  alternative  sites  (AKRF  2012-TN2876). 

Reconnaissance-level  activities  in  this  cultural  resource  review  have  a  particular  meaning.  For 
example,  these  activities  include  preliminary  field  investigations  to  confirm  the  presence  or 
absence  of  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties.  In  developing  this  E IS,  the  review  team 
relies  upon  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  its  alternative  site  evaluation. 
Reconnaissance-level  information  consists  of  data  that  are  readily  available  from  agencies  and 
other  public  sources.  It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  visits  to  the  alternative 
site  area.  The  following  information  was  used  to  identify  the  cultural  resources  and  historical 
properties  at  Site  7-2: 

•  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280), 

•  Field  Verification  of  Key  Resources  at  PSEG  Alternative  Sites  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869),  and 

•  New  Jersey  SHPO  archaeological  site  files. 

Affected  Environment 

Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield  located  in  Salem  County  in  southwestern  New  Jersey.  Site  7-2  is  12  mi 
east  of  the  Delaware  River.  Site  7-2  contains  agricultural  fields  as  well  as  wood  lots  and 
wetland  areas.  Historically,  portions  of  the  Site  7-2  have  been  used  for  agricultural  purposes. 
Site  7-2  encompasses  a  total  of  996  ac.  The  location  would  require  2.2  mi  of  new  roads,  a 
5.4-mi  railroad  spur,  and  a  12.9-mi-long  makeup  water  pipeline.  An  existing  500-kV 
transmission  line  crosses  the  location,  but  1.8  mi  of  this  existing  line  would  need  to  be  rerouted. 
A  4.1 -mi  connector  transmission  line  would  be  needed  to  connect  to  the  existing  lines  running  to 
the  HCGS/SGS  site.  A  new  line  may  also  be  needed  to  ensure  grid  stability.  The  new  line 
would  run  about  107  mi.  The  current  major  industry  in  Salem  County  is  agriculture. 

Twenty-three  properties  listed  on  the  NRHP  are  located  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 
(NPS  2013-TN2400).  The  closest  listed  property  to  Site  7-2  is  the  Nathaniel  Chambliss  House 
(within  1 ,000  ft  of  Site  7-2). 

No  known  archaeological  sites  have  been  recorded  within  Site  7-2.  Two  historic  period 
archaeological  sites  are  recorded  within  the  1-mi  APE  around  Site  7-2:  Sites  28-SA-184  and 
28-SA-185.  Four  archaeological  sites  are  close  to  the  conceptual  pipeline  corridor.  Three  of 
the  sites  date  to  the  historic  period  and  the  fourth  to  the  prehistoric  era. 

Three  previously  identified  architectural  resources  are  within  4.9  mi  of  Site  7-2  and  its  ancillary 
components.  Resources  include  residences  and  a  church.  Two  architectural  resources  are 
within  1  mi  of  Site  7-2  and  the  conceptual  corridors:  the  Deerfield  Presbyterian  Church  and  the 
Phillip  Fries  House.  A  review  of  architectural  resources  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  Site  7-2 
identified  six  additional  architectural  resources  within  1,000  ft  of  Site  7-2  that  could  potentially  be 
eligible  for  NRHP  listing  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869).  These  resources  are  all  residences.  Two  of  the 
residences  are  within  the  Site  7-2  footprint.  An  additional  26  resources  that  have  potential  for 
eligibility  for  NRHP  listing  were  noted  between  1  and  4.9  mi  from  Site  7-2.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Building  Impacts 

No  known  historic  or  cultural  resources  exist  within  Site  7-2.  However,  additional  cultural 
resource  inventories  would  likely  be  needed  for  any  portion  of  Site  7-2  that  has  not  been 
previously  surveyed.  Other  lands  that  are  acquired  to  support  the  new  plant  (e.g.,  for  roads  and 
pipeline  corridors)  would  also  likely  require  a  survey  to  identify  potential  cultural  resources  and 
historical  properties  and  mitigation  measures  to  offset  the  potential  adverse  effects  of  ground- 
disturbing  activities.  The  types  of  historic  property  and  cultural  resource  impacts  resulting  from 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  consist  of  alterations  to 
archaeological  sites  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  visual  alteration  of  the  setting  for  a 
historic  structure.  In  some  cases  vibrations  from  construction  equipment  could  affect  historic 
structures. 

There  is  one  existing  transmission  corridor  connecting  directly  to  Site  7-2  and  a  second  existing 
line;  however,  a  4.1-mi  connector  would  be  needed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  One  new 
transmission  line  corridor  would  also  be  needed  for  Site  7-2.  There  are  no  NRHP-listed  or 
recorded  historic  or  prehistoric  sites  in  the  area  where  the  transmission  line  would  be  routed.  In 
the  event  that  Site  7-2  was  chosen  for  the  proposed  project,  the  review  team  assumes  that  the 
transmission  service  provider  for  this  region  would  conduct  cultural  resource  surveys  for  all 
areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines.  If  NRHP-eligible  resources  are  identified,  then  efforts 
to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey 
SHPO  and  any  interested  parties  as  required  under  NHPA  Section  106  (54  USC  300101  et 
seq.  -TN4157).  In  addition,  visual  impacts  from  transmission  lines  could  result  in  significant 
alterations  to  the  visual  landscape  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  Building  impacts  are 
expected  to  be  noticeable  because  listed  or  eligible  resources  are  within  the  viewshed  of  Site  7- 
2  and  the  introduction  of  a  power  plant  and  cooling  tower  is  new  to  the  viewshed.  It  is  likely  that 
archaeological  resources  would  not  be  found  at  Site  7-2. 

Operational  Impacts 

Operational  impacts  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  located  at  Site  7-2,  with  the  exception  of 
visual  impacts  from  the  plant  and  cooling  tower,  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  Most 
impacts  to  cultural  resources  would  occur  during  preconstruction  and  construction.  Visual 
impacts  to  historic  structures  would  occur  within  the  viewshed  of  a  new  plant  during  operation. 

It  is  anticipated  that  visual  effects  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  from  operation  would  be 
noticeable. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  visual  impacts  to  cultural  and  historic  resources  from  a  new  plant  and  cooling  towers  would 
be  noticeable.  Cumulative  impacts  would  also  result  from  non-NRC-licensed  activities 
associated  with  construction  of  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  These  impacts  would 
depend  on  the  locations  of  the  various  activities  and  the  nature,  number,  and  significance  of  the 
historic  and  cultural  resources  present.  Existing  information  suggests  that  the  region 
surrounding  Site  7-2  contains  intact  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties.  It  is  possible 
that  currently  unknown  cultural  resources  could  be  found  in  close  proximity  to  areas  needed  for 
the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  Due  to  the  visual  effect  to  the  historic  resources  from  the 


NUREG-2168 


9-180 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


plant  and  the  cooling  tower  and  the  effects  of  the  non-NRC-licensed  activities,  the  effects  on  the 
cultural  and  historic  resources  are  expected  to  be  noticeable.  Because  of  the  uncertainty 
associated  with  the  lack  of  previous  cultural  surveys,  cumulative  impacts  could  be  greater 
depending  on  whether  significant  resources  were  encountered  and  whether  they  could  be 
avoided. 

Summary 

Cultural  resources  are  nonrenewable;  therefore,  the  impact  from  the  destruction  of  cultural 
resources  is  cumulative.  Based  on  the  reconnaissance-level  information  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  from 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  MODERATE.  The 
incremental  contribution  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  a 
significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact.  This  impact-level  determination  reflects  the  fact 
that  significant  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  are  found  within  the  viewshed  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  and  associated  facilities  at  Site  7-2.  However,  if  Site  7-2  were  to  be 
developed,  additional  cultural  resource  surveys  might  reveal  additional  historic  and  cultural 
resources,  which  could  result  in  greater  cumulative  impacts. 

9.3.4  8  Air  Quality 

Criteria  Pollutants 

The  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  offsite  facilities 
at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those  expected  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  Site  7-1  because  all  three 
sites  are  located  in  Salem  County.  Salem  County  is  in  the  PA-NJ-MD-DE  nonattainment  area 
for  8-hour  ozone  NAAQSs  (40  CFR  Part  81-TN255)  and  administratively  in  the  Metropolitan 
Philadelphia  Interstate  AQCR  (40  CFR  81.15  [TN255]).  With  the  exception  of  the  8-hour  ozone 
NAAQSs.  air  quality  in  Salem  County  is  in  attainment  with  or  better  than  national  standards  for 
criteria  pollutants.  An  applicability  analysis  would  need  to  be  performed  if  a  nuclear  power  plant 
was  built  at  Site  7-2  per  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B  (TN2495),  to  determine  whether  a  general 
conformity  determination  was  needed. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.7.  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  from  building  a  nuclear  power  plant 
are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude.  Emissions  from  these  activities  would 
be  primarily  the  fugitive  dust  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  engine  exhaust  from  heavy 
equipment  and  vehicles.  These  impacts  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  associated  with  any 
large  construction  project.  During  building  activities,  a  New  Jersey  State  Air  Quality  Permit 
would  be  required  that  would  prescribe  emissions  limits  and  mitigation  measures  to  be 
implemented.  The  applicant  also  plans  to  implement  a  fugitive  dust  control  program 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Section  5.7  discusses  air-quality  impacts  during  operations.  Emissions  during  operations  would 
primarily  be  from  operation  of  the  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines,  and  commuter  traffic.  Stationary  sources  such  as  the  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines  (operating  infrequently)  and  auxiliary  boilers  (operating  mostly  during  the  winter 
months)  would  be  operated  according  to  State  and  Federal  regulatory  requirements. 


November  2015 


9-181 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


A  Title  V  operating  permit  administered  through  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  ensure 
compliance  with  NAAQSs  and  other  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  prescribe  mitigation 
measures  to  ensure  compliance.  There  are  13  major  sources  of  air  emissions  in  Salem  County 
with  existing  Title  V  operating  permits  (EPA  2013-TN2504).  These  existing  sources  include  the 
energy  and  industrial  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18.  The  existing  energy  and  industrial  projects 
and  the  planned  development  and  transportation  projects  would  contribute  to  air-quality  impacts 
in  Salem  County.  However,  the  impacts  on  air  quality  in  the  county  from  emissions  from 
Site  7-2  would  be  temporary  and  not  noticeable  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects.  The  cumulative  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and 
operating  a  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  minor. 

Greenhouse  Gases 

The  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  related  to  nuclear  power  are  discussed  in 
Section  7.6.  The  impacts  of  the  emissions  are  not  sensitive  to  the  location  of  the  source. 
Consequently,  the  discussion  in  Section  7.6  would  be  applicable  to  a  nuclear  power  plant 
located  at  Site  7-2.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  national  and  worldwide  cumulative 
impacts  of  GHG  emissions  are  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  The  review  team  further 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing,  with  or  without 
the  GHG  emissions  of  the  project  at  Site  7-2. 

Summary 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  on  air-quality  resources  in  the  geographic  areas  of 
interest  would  be  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  and  MODERATE  for  GHG  emissions.  The 
incremental  contribution  of  impacts  on  air-quality  resources  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  SMALL  for  both  criteria  pollutants  and  GHG  emissions. 

9. 3. 4. 9  Nonradiological  Health 

The  following  impact  analysis  considers  nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  public  and 
workers  from  building  activities  and  operations  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-2,  which  is  located  in  Alloway  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (about  12  mi 
east-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site).  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect  nonradiological  health  within  the 
geographic  area  of  interest,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  and  those  projects 
listed  in  Table  9-18.  The  building-related  activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of 
members  of  the  public  and  workers  include  exposure  to  dust  and  vehicle  exhaust,  occupational 
injuries,  noise,  and  the  transport  of  construction  materials  and  personnel  to  and  from  the  site. 
The  operation-related  activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the 
public  and  workers  include  exposure  to  etiological  agents,  noise,  and  EMFs  and  transport  of 
workers  to  and  from  the  site. 

Most  of  the  nonradiological  impacts  of  building  and  operation  (e.g.,  noise,  etiological  agents, 
and  occupational  injuries)  would  be  localized  and  would  not  have  significant  impact  at  offsite 
locations.  However,  activities  such  as  vehicle  emissions  from  transport  of  personnel  to  and 


NUREG-2168 


9-182 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


from  the  site  would  encompass  a  larger  area.  Therefore,  for  nonradiological  health  impacts 
associated  with  vehicle  and  other  air  emissions  sources,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for 
cumulative  impacts  analysis  includes  projects  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-2.  For  cumulative 
impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  the  transmission 
line  corridor.  These  geographical  areas  are  expected  to  encompass  areas  where  cumulative 
impacts  to  public  and  worker  health  could  occur  in  combination  with  any  past,  present,  or 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Building  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  construction  workers  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those  from  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  as 
evaluated  in  Section  4.8.  They  include  occupational  injuries,  noise,  odor,  vehicle  exhaust,  and 
dust.  Applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations  on  air  quality  and  noise  would  be 
complied  with  during  the  plant  construction  phase.  Site  7-2  does  not  have  any  characteristics 
that  would  be  expected  to  lead  to  fewer  or  more  construction  accidents  than  would  be  expected 
for  the  PSEG  Site.  Transportation  of  personnel  and  construction  materials  at  Site  7-2  would 
result  in  minimal  nonradiological  health  impacts.  Site  7-2  is  in  a  greenfield  area,  and 
construction  impacts  would  likely  be  minimal  on  the  surrounding  areas,  which  are  classified  as 
low-population  areas. 

Operational  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  members  of  the  public  and  on  the  occupational  health  of 
workers  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  those 
evaluated  in  Section  5.8  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Occupational  health  impacts  on 
workers  (e.g.,  falls,  electric  shock,  or  exposure  to  other  hazards)  at  Site  7-2  would  likely  be  the 
same  as  those  evaluated  for  workers  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Discharges  to  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  controlled  by  NPDES  permits  issued  by  NJDEP.  The  growth  of 
etiological  agents  would  not  be  significantly  encouraged  at  Site  7-2  because  of  the  temperature 
attenuation  in  the  length  of  the  pipe  required  for  a  discharge  system.  Noise  and  EMF  exposure 
would  be  monitored  and  controlled  in  accordance  with  applicable  OSHA  regulations.  Effects  of 
EMFs  on  human  health  would  be  controlled  and  minimized  by  conformance  with  NESC  criteria. 
Nonradiological  impacts  of  traffic  during  operations  would  be  less  than  the  impacts  during 
building.  Mitigation  measures  used  during  building  to  improve  traffic  flow  would  also  minimize 
impacts  during  operation  of  a  new  plant. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  and  present  actions  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to 
cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts  include  the  energy  projects  in  Table  9-18  and  vehicle 
emissions  and  existing  urbanization.  Reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  in  the 
geographical  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts 
include  expansion  of  natural-gas  pipelines,  improvements  and  new  construction  for  roadways 
and  interstates,  future  transmission  line  development,  and  future  urbanization.  The  review  team 
is  also  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  human  health,  and  a  recent 
compilation  of  the  state  of  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014-TN3472)  has  been  considered  in

the  preparation  of  this  EIS.  Projected  changes  in  climate  for  the  region  include  an  increase  in 
average  temperature;  increased  likelihood  of  drought  in  summer;  more  heavy  downpours;  and 
an  increase  in  precipitation,  especially  in  the  winter  and  spring,  which  could  alter  the  presence 
of  microorganisms  and  parasites.  In  view  of  the  water  source  characteristics,  the  review  team 
did  not  identify  anything  that  would  alter  its  conclusion  regarding  the  presence  of  etiological 
agents  or  change  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. 

Summary 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  expects  that  the  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  evaluated  for  the  PSEG 
Site.  Although  there  are  past,  present,  and  future  activities  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest 
that  could  affect  nonradiological  health  in  ways  similar  to  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new 
plant  at  Site  7-2,  the  impacts  from  such  activities  would  be  localized  and  managed  through 
adherence  to  existing  regulatory  requirements.  Similarly,  impacts  on  public  health  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  operating  at  Site  7-2  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  The  review  team 
concludes,  therefore,  that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.4.10  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operations 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from 
building  activities  and  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2,  which  is  located  in 
Alloway  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (about  12  mi  east-northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site). 
The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  radiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  and  the 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-18.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.4,  Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield  site;  there 
are  currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  area  within 
a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-2.  Other  nuclear  reactor  sites  that  potentially  affect  the  radiological 
health  within  this  geographic  area  of  interest  are  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Limerick 
Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3.  The 
Shieldalloy  radioactive  materials  decommissioning  site  in  Newfield,  New  Jersey,  is  also  within 
50  mi  of  Site  7-2.  In  addition,  medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive 
materials  are  likely  to  be  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-2. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  include 
doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  would 
result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  would  be  well  below 
regulatory  limits.  The  impacts  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Limerick  Generating  Station,  and  Peach 
Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  include  doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous 
radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off 
the  site  that  are  well  below  regulatory  limits  as  demonstrated  by  the  ongoing  radiological 
environmental  monitoring  program  conducted  around  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Limerick 
Generating  Station,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station.  The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


dose  from  direct  radiation  and  effluents  from  medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use 
radioactive  material  would  be  an  insignificant  contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  around 
Site  7-2.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  data  from  the  radiological  environmental  monitoring 
programs  conducted  around  currently  operating  nuclear  power  plants.  Based  on  the  information 
provided  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC  staffs  independent  analysis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  radiological  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and 
other  existing  and  planned  projects  and  actions  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest  around 
Site  7-2  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.4.11  Postulated  Accidents 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  from  postulated  accidents  from  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  analysis 
also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect 
radiological  health  from  postulated  accidents,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects 
and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-18,  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  As  described  in 
Section  9.3.4,  Site  7-2  is  a  greenfield  site,  and  there  are  currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the 
site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  considers  all  existing  and  proposed  nuclear  power  plants 
that  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  probability-weighted  consequences  (i.e. ,  risks)  from  a 
severe  accident  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  this  site.  Existing  facilities  potentially  affecting 
radiological  accident  risk  within  this  geographic  area  of  interest  are  HCGS  Unit  1 ,  SGS  Units  1 
and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2, 
Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3,  Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1, 
and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2. 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 ,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of 
DBAs  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  for  a  US-APWR,  two  API  000s,  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an 
ABWR.  DBAs  are  addressed  specifically  to  demonstrate  that  any  of  these  four  reactor  designs 
is  sufficiently  robust  to  meet  NRC  safety  criteria.  The  reactor  designs  are  independent  of  site 
conditions  and  meteorological  conditions  at  Site  7-2  and  the  PSEG  Site  are  similar;  therefore, 
the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of  DBAs  at  Site  7-2  would  be 
SMALL. 

Because  the  meteorology,  population  distribution,  and  land  use  for  Site  7-2  are  expected  to  be 
similar  to  those  of  the  PSEG  Site,  risks  from  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
located  at  Site  7-2  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  analyzed  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  risks 
for  the  PSEG  Site  are  presented  in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31  and  are  well  below  the  mean  and 
median  values  for  current-generation  reactors.  In  addition,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.1 1 .2.1 , 
estimates  of  average  individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  are  well  below 
Commission  safety  goals  (51  FR  30028-TN594).  For  existing  plants  within  the  geographic  area 
of  interest  (i.e.,  whose  50-mi  radius  overlaps  with  the  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site), 
namely  HCGS  Unit  1,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick 
Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3,  Three 
Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2,  the 
Commission  has  determined  the  probability-weighted  consequences  of  severe  accidents  are 
small  (10  CFR  Part  51,  Appendix  B,  Table  B-1  [TN250]).  Because  of  NRC  safety  review 
criteria,  it  is  expected  that  risks  for  any  new  reactors  at  any  other  locations  within  the  geographic

area  of  interest  for  Site  7-2  would  be  well  below  the  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  and 
would  meet  Commission  safety  goals.  The  severe  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear 
power  plant  becomes  smaller  as  the  distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the 
combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-2  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for 
all  these  operating  nuclear  power  plants  and  would  still  be  low. 

The  postulated  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  becomes  smaller  as  the 
distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of 
Site  7-2  site  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  these  operating  and  proposed  nuclear 
power  plants.  Even  though  several  plants  would  potentially  be  included  in  the  combination,  this 
combined  risk  would  still  be  low.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
risks  of  postulated  accidents  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-2  would  be  SMALL. 

9.3.5  Site  7-3 

This  section  covers  the  review  team  evaluation  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  siting  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site  designated  as  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey, 
located  about  10  mi  southeast  of  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  (see  Figure  9-1 ).  Site  7-3  is  a 
greenfield  site  that  is  not  owned  by  PSEG;  however,  PSEG  currently  possesses  a  DCR  for  a 
portion  of  this  site.  The  site  is  located  about  1  mi  from  the  Delaware  River,  which  would  be  the 
source  of  cooling  water  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  this  site.  The  total  area  of  the  site  is  886  ac. 

As  indicated  by  PSEG,  the  use  of  Site  7-3  would  require  the  following  infrastructure  upgrades 
and  improvements  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

•  Portions  of  the  public  roads  that  currently  provide  access  to  the  site  would  need  to  be 
relocated  around  plant  facilities  and/or  improved  to  increase  their  load-carrying  capacity.  An 
estimated  total  of  4.2  mi  of  road  building  would  be  required,  and  the  ROW  width  would  be 
150  ft. 

•  Because  Site  7-3  is  located  near  the  Delaware  River,  barge  transport  could  be  used  to 
deliver  materials  and  equipment  to  the  site,  and  no  rail  spur  would  be  needed.  However,  a 
new  road  would  be  required  between  the  barge  unloading  location  and  the  site.  The  length 
of  this  new  road  is  estimated  to  be  about  1  mi  within  a  150-ft-wide  ROW. 

•  A  new  water  supply  pipeline  would  need  to  be  installed  to  withdraw  water  from  the  Delaware 
River.  A  new  discharge  pipeline  would  also  need  to  be  installed  to  convey  blowdown  and 
wastewater  to  the  Delaware  River.  PSEG  assumed  that  the  two  new  pipelines  would  be 
installed  parallel  to  each  other  and  within  the  same  100-ft-wide  ROW.  The  estimated  length 
of  the  route  is  0.7  mi. 

•  Three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines  would  need  to  be  installed  to  connect  to  the  existing 
transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  these  three  new  lines  would  be  installed 
parallel  to  one  another,  each  within  a  200-ft  ROW.  The  length  of  these  three  new  lines 
would  be  6.8  mi. 

•  A  new  switchyard  would  be  required  at  the  connection  of  the  above  new  transmission  lines 
and  the  existing  transmission  line  system.  PSEG  assumed  that  this  new  switchyard  would 
be  located  on  25  ac.

The  following  sections  include  a  cumulative  impact  assessment  conducted  for  each  major 
resource  area.  The  assessment  considered  the  specific  resources  and  components  that  could 
be  affected  by  the  incremental  effects  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  Site  7-3,  including  the  impacts  of 
NRC-authorized  construction  and  operations  and  impacts  of  preconstruction  activities.  Also 
included  in  the  assessment  are  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  Federal, 
non-Federal,  and  private  actions  in  the  same  geographical  area  that  could  have  meaningful 
cumulative  impacts  when  considered  together  with  a  new  nuclear  plant  if  such  plant  were  to  be 
built  at  Site  7-3.  Other  actions  and  projects  considered  in  this  cumulative  analysis  are  described 
in  Table  9-21 .

9. 3. 5.1  Land  Use 
Affected  Environment 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.5,  Site  7-3  covers  886  ac  in  Greenwich  Township,  Cumberland 
County,  New  Jersey  (Figure  9-1).  Existing  land  use  at  Site  7-3  is  predominantly  agricultural, 
with  large  areas  planted  in  cultivated  crops.  Soils  classified  as  prime  farmland  occur  across 
much  of  the  site.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Most  of  Site  7-3  is  zoned  Rural  Residential,  and  there  are  nine  single-family  houses  located 
within  the  site  boundaries.  Also,  although  the  site  is  located  more  than  6  mi  from  the  nearest 
incorporated  town,  there  are  small  concentrations  of  houses  within  2  mi  of  the  site.  There  are 
no  significant  industrial  land  uses  on  or  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-3  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

According  to  2012  State  of  New  Jersey  Department  of  Agriculture  GIS  mapping  conducted  by 
PSEG,  there  are  no  County  Preserved  Farmlands  within  the  Site  7-3  boundaries.  However, 

Site  7-3  contains  an  871-ac  tract  of  land  (the  “Bayside  Tract”)  that  is  owned  by  PSEG  but 
protected  under  a  DCR  as  part  of  the  PSEG  EEP  (Figure  9-10)  (PSEG  2012-TN2282).  The 
Bayside  Tract  covers  more  than  98  percent  of  the  total  886  ac  within  the  Site  7-3  boundaries. 
The  purpose  of  the  DCR  on  the  Bayside  Tract  is  to  preserve  the  property  in  a  predominantly 
natural  state  with  a  site-specific  management  plan  approved  by  the  State  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282). 

The  offsite  corridors  for  the  access  roads  and  water  pipelines  to  Site  7-3,  as  well  as  the  short 
connector  transmission  line  from  Site  7-3  to  the  grid,  would  be  largely  confined  to  the  immediate 
site  vicinity,  and  land  uses  within  these  corridors  are  similar  to  the  site  itself,  with  most  of  the 
land  in  agricultural  use  and  residences  scattered  throughout  the  area.  There  are  no  significant 
industrial  land  uses  within  the  offsite  corridors  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Building  Impacts 

According  to  PSEG,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  directly  disturb 
(temporarily  and  permanently)  a  total  of  395  ac  on  the  site.  The  remaining  land  within  Site  7-3 
(491  ac)  would  not  be  directly  disturbed,  but  access  to  this  land  would  be  controlled  and  it  would 
be  unavailable  for  uses  not  related  to  a  nuclear  power  plant.  In  addition,  developing  the  access 
road  and  water  pipeline  corridors  for  Site  7-3  would  disturb  84  ac  off  the  site.  Therefore,  a  total 
of  970  ac,  not  including  transmission  line  corridors,  would  be  disturbed  or  made  unavailable  for 
uses  not  related  to  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-3.  Land  uses  affected  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-3  and  support  facilities  include  about  575  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  3  ac  of 
developed  land,  1 1 5  ac  of  barren  land,  1 22  ac  of  forest  land,  7  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine 
deepwater  area,  97  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  7  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland, 

61  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  1  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

It  is  likely  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  connect  with  the  potential 
transmission  line  corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints 
within  the  PJM  region  (see  Section  7.0).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  a  connector 
transmission  line  from  Site  7-3  to  this  new  grid  stability  line.  This  6.8-mi  connector  transmission 
line  corridor  would  disturb  about  209  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  less  than  1  ac  of  developed 
land,  19  ac  of  barren  land,  225  ac  of  forest  land,  2  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  areas, 
24  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  less  than  1  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  96  ac  of 
freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  less  than  1  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Site  7-3  is  predominantly  zoned  Rural  Residential,  and  the  definitions  for  this  zoning 
classification  indicate  that  “power  generation  is  not  an  allowable  use”  (PSEG  2010-TN257). 
Therefore,  the  current  zoning  designation  would  have  to  be  changed  or  a  variance  granted 
before  the  site  could  be  developed  for  a  nuclear  power  plant.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


PSEG  has  stated  that  most  of  the  nine  houses  within  the  Site  7-3  boundaries  would  have  to  be 
removed  before  the  site  could  be  developed  for  a  nuclear  power  plant.  PSEG  anticipates  that 
the  offsite  corridors  could  be  developed  without  removing  existing  houses,  but  has  stated  that 
some  houses  would  be  located  in  close  proximity  to  the  various  ROW  alignments  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  871-ac  Bayside  Tract  owned  by  PSEG  and  preserved  under  a  DCR  was  not  purchased 
using  funds  from  the  State  of  New  Jersey  Green  Acres  Program,  so  removing  the  DCR  would 
be  guided  by  the  New  Jersey  Conservation  Restriction  and  Historic  Preservation  Restriction  Act 
(NJSA  13:8B-1  et  seq.  -TN4308),  which  provides  a  specific  process  for  clearing  DCR 
restrictions  from  privately  held  lands  (see  Section  4.1.2)  (PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

Site  7-3  has  an  existing  site  elevation  between  0  and  20  ft  MSL.  PSEG  estimates  that  the  total 
fill  quantity  for  Site  7-3  would  be  6.1  million  yd3,  with  1 .3  million  yd3  of  Category  1  fill  and 
4.8  million  yd3  of  Category  2  fill.  PSEG  has  stated  that  the  fill  material  for  Site  7-3  could  come 
from  the  same  sources  as  the  fill  material  for  the  PSEG  Site  (i.e. ,  existing  permitted  borrow  sites 
in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Maryland).  However,  PSEG  would  conduct  testing  to  determine 
whether  the  material  excavated  from  Site  7-3  could  be  reused  as  fill  at  the  site  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2282). 

Overall,  the  land-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  at  the 
site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  directly  disturb  395  ac  of  land 
and  eliminate  access  to  and  use  of  another  491  ac  of  land  that  currently  supports  productive 
agricultural  and  rural  residential  uses.  Building  the  new  access  road  and  water  pipeline 
corridors  for  Site  7-3  would  disturb  84  ac  of  similar  land  uses  off  the  site.  Further,  developing 
the  new  connector  transmission  corridor  from  Site  7-3  to  the  new  grid  stability  lines  would 
disturb  an  additional  510  ac  of  similar  offsite  land  uses.  Land  uses  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-3 
include  about  19,393  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  640  ac  of  developed  land,  1 ,192  ac  of  barren 
land,  9,704  ac  of  forest  land,  37,691  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area,  1 9,684  ac  of 
estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  81 1  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  4,744  ac  of  freshwater 
forested/shrub  wetland,  and  529  ac  of  other  wetland.  Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-3  would  permanently  or  temporarily  disturb  about  1 1  percent  of  the  available  barren  land 
in  the  vicinity.  Additionally,  building  a  new  plant  on  Site  7-3  would  require  that  most  of  the  nine 
houses  within  the  site  boundaries  be  removed,  that  any  residents  be  relocated,  and  that  871  ac 
of  land  owned  by  PSEG  but  preserved  as  open  space  under  a  DCR  be  developed  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction 
activities  on  Site  7-3  would  be  noticeable.  The  review  team  reaches  this  conclusion  because 
the  conversion  of  existing  barren  land  to  heavy  industrial  and  transmission  corridor  use  and  the 
relocation  of  nine  residences  would  alter  noticeably,  but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of 
existing  land  uses  at  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Operational  Impacts 

The  land-use  impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  smaller  than 
the  impacts  of  building,  but  they  would  still  permanently  eliminate  almost  all  access  to  and  use 
of  970  ac  of  land  that  supports  productive  agricultural  and  rural  residential  uses.  Most  of  the 
impacts  would  occur  during  the  building  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  operations  are  not 
expected  to  cause  additional  impacts.  Additionally,  there  are  sufficient  agricultural  and 
residential  land-use  resources  in  the  vicinity.  Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  land-use 
impacts  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minimal. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

The  geographic  area  of  interest  for  consideration  of  cumulative  land-use  impacts  at  Site  7-3 
includes  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  (in  which  Site  7-3  is  located)  and  the  other  counties 
in  New  Jersey,  New  York,  and  Pennsylvania  within  the  50-mi  region  around  Site  7-3.  The  direct 
and  indirect  impacts  to  land  use  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3 
would  be  confined  to  Cumberland  County,  but  the  cumulative  impacts  to  land  use  when 
combined  with  other  actions  (discussed  below)  could  extend  to  other  counties  in  New  Jersey, 
New  York,  and  Pennsylvania. 

Table  9-21  lists  projects  that,  in  combination  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  Site  7-3,  could  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  in  the  region.  One  of  the  projects 
closest  to  Site  7-3  is  the  USACE  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project.  In  this 
project,  the  USACE  is  conducting  dredging  operations  to  deepen  a  section  of  the  Delaware 
River,  including  the  portion  of  the  river  near  Site  7-3  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  The  primary 
land-use  impact  of  this  deepening  project  would  be  the  USACE  use  of  some  of  the  existing 
CDFs  along  the  Delaware  River  for  the  disposal  of  dredge  materials.  The  total  dredging 
operation  would  generate  an  estimated  16  million  yd3  of  spoil  material.  The  USACE  NEPA 
documentation  for  the  channel  deepening  project  (USACE  1997-TN2281;  USACE  2009- 
TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262)  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  significant  land-use  impacts 
from  the  project. 

Another  project  that  would  be  in  relatively  close  proximity  to  Site  7-3  is  the  continued  operation 
of  SGS  and  HCGS.  In  201 1 ,  the  NRC  issued  new  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Unit  1  (expires 
2036),  SGS  Unit  2  (expires  2040),  and  HCGS  (expires  2046).  A  cumulative  land-use  impact 
would  result  from  the  combined  commitment  of  land  for  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-3  (886  ac)  with  the 
land  already  dedicated  to  SGS  and  HCGS  (734  ac).  Although  this  would  represent  a  relatively 
large  land-use  impact  in  Salem  and  Cumberland  Counties,  the  cumulative  impact  to  land  use  in 
the  50-mi  region  would  be  relatively  small.  None  of  the  other  nuclear  projects  listed  in 
Table  9-21  are  located  within  the  50-mi  region. 

A  third  project  that  could  occur  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-3  is  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM 
region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PSEG  identifies  a  new  5-mi-wide  transmission  macro- 
corridor  known  as  the  WMC  (“West  Macro-Corridor”).  The  WMC  is  55  mi  long  and  generally 
follows  existing  transmission  line  corridors  from  the  PSEG  property  to  the  Peach  Bottom 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Substation  in  Pennsylvania  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG  considers  the  WMC  to  be  “the  most 
effective  route  for  addressing  the  regional  voltage  and  stability  constraints  that  PJM  is  trying  to 
resolve”  (PSEG  2013-TN2669). 

However,  in  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  cites  a  GIS  analysis  that  assumes  a  5-mi-wide 
hypothetical  macro-corridor  and  a  transmission  line  ROW  width  of  200  ft  within  the  corridor. 

This  PSEG  analysis  did  not  identify  a  specific  200-ft-wide  ROW  within  the  hypothetical  corridor 
but  calculated  the  amount  of  each  land-use  type  that  could  be  affected  in  a  200-ft-wide  ROW 
based  on  each  land-use  type  as  a  percentage  of  total  land  use  within  the  corridor  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  However,  PJM  has  not  selected  a  specific  route  for  the  potential  new  transmission 
line.  The  review  team  has  determined,  based  on  the  analysis  performed  by  PSEG  and  the  land 
uses  that  could  be  affected,  that  a  new  transmission  line  could  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  land 
uses  in  the  region. 

Most  of  the  other  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  are  not  expected  to  create  noticeable  cumulative 
impacts  to  land  use  in  the  50-mi  region  when  combined  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-3.  The  other  energy  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  (the  closest  being  Cumberland 
Generating  Station  and  Card’s  Corner  Energy  Center)  are  all  too  far  from  Site  7-3  and  from  each 
other  to  create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.  The  new  development/ 
redevelopment  project  listed  (Millville  Municipal  Airport  Improvements)  is  too  far  from  Site  7-3  to 
create  noticeable  cumulative  land-use  impacts  in  the  region.  The  parks  and  recreation  activities 
listed  (the  closest  being  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  and  Bombay  Hook  NWR)  are  not  expected  to 
contribute  to  adverse  land-use  impacts,  especially  on  the  regional  scale. 

The  GCRP  report  Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  In  the  United  States  (GCRP  2014-TN3472), 
summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate  changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report 
divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions,  and  Site  7-3  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The 
report  indicates  that  climate  change  could  increase  precipitation,  sea  level,  and  storm  surges  in 
the  Northeast  region,  thus  changing  land  use  through  the  inundation  of  low-lying  areas  that  are 
not  buffered  by  high  cliffs.  However,  cliffs  could  experience  increased  rates  of  erosion  as  a 
result  of  frequent  storm  surges,  flooding  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  Forest  growth  could 
increase  as  a  result  of  more  CO2  in  the  atmosphere.  Existing  parks,  reserves,  and  managed 
areas  would  help  preserve  wetlands  and  forested  areas  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not  affected 
by  the  same  factors.  In  addition,  climate  change  could  reduce  crop  yields  and  livestock 
productivity,  which  might  change  portions  of  agricultural  land  uses  in  the  region  (GCRP  2014- 
TN3472).  Thus  direct  changes  resulting  from  climate  change  could  cause  a  shift  in  land  use  in 
the  50-mi  region  that  would  contribute  to  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3. 

Overall,  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the 
cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3 
(along  with  the  new  connector  transmission  line  corridors)  would  be  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably, 
but  not  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  existing  land  uses  in  the  geographic  area  of  interest. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s  independent 
review,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  land-use  impacts  would  be  MODERATE. 
The  incremental  contribution  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3 
would  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact.

9. 3. 5. 2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

The  following  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  activities  and  operations  at  Site  7-3. 

The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  actions,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in 
Table  9-21 ,  that  could  affect  water  use  and  quality. 

The  potentially  affected  surface-water  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  which 
would  be  affected  by  water  withdrawn  from  and  wastewater  discharged  to  the  river.  Site  7-3  is 
an  886-ac  greenfield  site  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey,  located  less  than  1  mi  east  of  the 
Delaware  River  at  RM  41 .6,  about  1 0  mi  downriver  from  the  PSEG  Site.  Site  7-3  is  flat,  with 
elevations  ranging  from  0  to  20  ft  MSL.  PSEG  has  stated  in  its  ER  that  the  Delaware  River 
would  be  the  primary  source  of  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  reach 
adjacent  to  Site  7-3  lies  in  DRBC  water-quality  Zone  5,  which  is  the  same  zone  within  which  the 
PSEG  Site  is  located. 

Flow  data  for  the  Delaware  River  at  USGS  Gaging  Station  01463500  at  RM  131.0,  near 
Trenton,  New  Jersey,  are  described  in  Section  2.3.  This  gaging  station  is  located  about  90  mi 
upstream  of  the  Site  7-3  conceptual  water  intake  location  at  RM  41.6.  The  mean  annual  river 
flow  at  the  Trenton  gage  is  12,004  cfs.  Mean  annual  flow  during  the  historic  low-water  period  of 
1961-1967  was  7,888  cfs,  with  the  minimum  monthly  flow  of  1 ,548  cfs  recorded  in  July  1965. 

As  mentioned  in  Section  2.3,  the  Coastal  Plain  deposits  dip  and  thicken  to  the  southeast  toward 
the  coast.  Site  7-3  is  located  southeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  and,  as  a  result,  the  hydrogeologic 
environment  is  somewhat  different.  Because  it  is  a  greenfield  site,  there  is  no  hydraulic  fill  and 
the  surficial  unit  is  alluvium  from  the  Delaware  River.  Studies  from  NJGS  (Sugarman  2001- 
TN3218)  and  USGS  (Martin  1998-TN2259;  dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948)  indicate  that  in  western 
Cumberland  County  the  uppermost  aquifer  is  the  unconfined  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer 
system. 

In  its  ER  the  applicant  indicated  that  “plant  groundwater  requirements  could  be  supplied  by  one 
or  two  wells  drilled  to  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey”  aquifer  system  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  This 
aquifer  system  ranges  from  20  to  350  ft  thick  (USGS  2013-TN3228).  However,  because 
Site  7-3  is  located  near  the  Delaware  River  within  the  outcrop  area  of  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey 
aquifer  system,  the  thickness  is  probably  at  the  lower  end  of  this  range  (Martin  1998-TN2259), 
and  salinity  within  the  unit  may  be  near  levels  measured  within  the  Delaware  River  (dePaul  et 
al.  2009-TN2948).  As  a  result,  it  is  not  likely  that  the  aquifer  is  widely  used  in  the  area 
immediately  surrounding  Site  7-3,  and  pumping  may  induce  flow  of  saline  water  from  the  river. 

USGS  studies  also  indicate  that  the  Vincentown  aquifer  is  very  thin  or  not  present  at  Site  7-3, 
and  that  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system  is  separated  from  the  underlying  Wenonah- 
Mount  Laurel  aquifer  by  a  thickened  confining  sequence,  which  may  help  to  limit  flow  between 
the  units.  Salinity  levels  within  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  are  at  or  near  the  drinking 
water  standard  (250  mg/L)  but  are  less  than  levels  within  the  Delaware  River.  Salinity  values 
within  the  upper  and  middle  PRM  aquifers  are  above  the  drinking  water  standard.  Salinity  within 
the  lower  PRM  is  reported  to  exceed  10,000  mg/L  for  chloride  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As

a  result,  it  is  likely  that  groundwater  needed  for  construction  and  operation  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
obtained  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 

Building  Impacts 

Impacts  to  surface  waters  from  building  activities  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the 
PSEG  Site  and  may  occur  from  site-preparation  and  plant  building  activities.  Potential  impacts 
to  surface  water,  including  wetlands  and  floodplains,  could  result  from  physical  alteration  of 
surface-water  bodies  because  of  installation  of  intake  and  discharge  structures,  alteration  of 
land  surface  and  surface-water  drainage  pathways,  increased  runoff  from  the  site  area  that 
could  include  additional  sediment  load  and  building-related  pollutants,  and  building  transmission 
lines.  Additional  disturbance  to  the  shoreline  and  river  bottom  may  occur  from  building  a  new 
barge  docking  facility,  if  needed.  Offsite  building  activities  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
would  include  building  access  roads  and  other  facilities  including  a  new  makeup  water  pipeline, 
a  new  blowdown  pipeline,  and  three  new  transmission  lines  from  Site  7-3  to  the  existing  500-kV 
transmission  system. 

PSEG  has  proposed  in  Section  9.3.2  of  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  to  withdraw  either  surface 
water  or  groundwater  for  building  activities.  The  review  team  assumes  that  water  use  for 
building  activities  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  that  for  the  PSEG  Site.  As  estimated  by  PSEG 
in  ER  Section  4.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  water  use  to  support  concrete  plant  operations,  dust 
suppression,  and  potable  water  would  be  1 19  gpm.  Because  water  quality  in  the  Delaware 
River  is  brackish  near  Site  7-3,  potable  and  sanitary  use  of  the  river  water  is  not  expected. 

Dewatering  of  the  plant  area  and  the  nuclear  island  foundation  would  also  likely  be  required  to 
limit  inflow  from  the  river  alluvium  and  the  Kirkwood-Cohansey  aquifer  system  during 
construction  at  Site  7-3.  Because  these  units  are  unconfined  and  productive,  it  is  assumed  that 
dewatering  flow  rates  would  be  reduced  through  the  use  of  vertical  low-permeability  barriers, 
which  would  also  limit  the  horizontal  effects  of  dewatering.  It  is  assumed  that  the  extracted 
groundwater  would  be  managed  and  disposed  of  in  compliance  with  the  permit  requirements. 

Impacts  from  groundwater  use  and  dewatering  during  construction  activities  would  be  limited 
due  to  the  temporary  time  frame  of  construction.  In  addition,  construction-related  pumping 
would  be  bounded  by  the  impacts  from  pumping  to  support  plant  operations.  Therefore,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  groundwater-use  impacts  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  Site  7-3  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  water-quality-related  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  expected  for  any  other 
large  project.  Alterations  to  the  Delaware  River  would  occur  during  installation  of  the  makeup 
water  intake  structure  and  the  wastewater  discharge  structure.  During  installation  of  these 
structures,  some  additional  turbidity  in  the  river  is  expected  because  of  disturbance  of  bottom 
sediments.  However,  these  sediments  would  be  localized  to  the  area  needed  to  install  the 
structures,  and  engineering  measures  would  be  in  place  as  part  of  BMPs  to  minimize  movement 
of  the  disturbed  sediment  beyond  the  immediate  work  area.  These  impacts  would  also  be 
temporary  and  would  not  occur  after  the  structures  were  installed.  Because  these  activities 
would  occur  in  waters  of  the  United  States,  appropriate  permits  from  the  USACE  and  NJDEP 
would  be  required.  PSEG  would  be  required  to  implement  BMPs  to  control  erosion  and

sedimentation  and  discharge  of  building-related  pollutants  to  the  Delaware  River  or  to  nearby 
water  bodies.  Because  the  effects  from  building-related  activities  would  be  minimized  using 
BMPs,  would  be  temporary  and  localized,  and  would  be  controlled  under  various  permits,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  impact  from  building-related  activities  on  the  water  quality  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  nearby  surface-water  bodies  would  be  minor. 

During  building,  groundwater  quality  may  be  affected  by  leaching  of  spilled  effluents  into  the 
subsurface.  The  review  team  assumes  that  the  BMPs  PSEG  has  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site 
would  also  be  in  place  at  Site  7-3  during  building  activities  and  that  any  spills  would  be  quickly 
detected  and  remediated.  In  addition,  groundwater-quality  impacts  would  be  limited  to  the 
duration  of  these  activities,  and  therefore  would  be  temporary.  Because  any  spills  related  to 
building  activities  would  be  quickly  remediated  under  BMPs,  the  activities  would  be  temporary, 
and  pumping  rates  would  be  greater  during  operations  than  during  building,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  groundwater-quality  impacts  from  building  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  surface  water  would  be  withdrawn 
from  the  Delaware  River  to  provide  makeup  water  to  the  new  plant  CWS.  Because  water 
quality  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Site  7-3  is  brackish,  similar  to  that  at  the  PSEG  Site,  it  is 
assumed  that  the  withdrawal  rate  and  the  consumptive  use  rate  at  Site  7-3  would  be  the  same 
as  that  at  the  PSEG  Site:  78,196  gpm  (174.2  cfs)  and  26,420  gpm  (58.9  cfs),  respectively.  As 
described  in  Section  5.2,  applying  an  equivalent  impact  factor  of  0.18  to  account  for  the  salinity 
of  the  withdrawn  river  water  makes  the  water  consumption  equivalent  to  a  freshwater 
consumption  of  4,756  gpm  (10.6  cfs).  This  equivalent  freshwater  consumptive  use  is 
0.1  percent  of  the  mean  annual  flow  at  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  during  the  historic  low-water 
period  of  1961-1967  (7,888  cfs)  and  0.7  percent  of  the  minimum  monthly  flow  of  1 ,548  cfs 
recorded  in  July  1 965.  Assuming  similar  tidal  flows  at  Site  7-3  and  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  total 
consumptive  losses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  less  than 
0.01  percent  of  the  tidal  flows.  Because  of  the  similarity  of  Site  7-3  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site, 
the  review  team  determined  that  water-use  impacts  would  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
The  review  team  also  determined  that  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  465  ac-ft  or 
6.9  percent  of  its  currently  allocated  storage  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  to  meet  instream  flow 
targets  during  a  DRBC-declared  drought.  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  has  a  storage  capacity  of 
46,000  ac-ft,  far  exceeding  that  needed  to  meet  the  465  ac-ft  exceedance.  In  addition,  the 
DRBC  allows  for  temporary  or  permanent  acquisition  of  releases  from  other  owners  of  Merrill 
Creek  reservoir  storage  (DRBC  2004-TN2278).  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  determined 
that  surface-water  use  for  operations  would  be  met  without  a  noticeable  impact  to  the  instream 
flow  targets  in  the  Delaware  River.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  surface- 
water-use  impact  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minor. 

Because  Site  7-3  is  located  near  the  PSEG  Site,  the  Delaware  River  water  quality,  flow 
characteristics,  and  river  cross  section  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  water-quality  impacts  from  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  those  determined  for  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site  in  Section  5.2.3  and  that  the  surface-water-quality  impacts  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minor.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Groundwater  withdrawal,  as  was  indicated  in  ER  Section  9.3.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  would  be 
necessary  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses,  as  the  Delaware  River  water  is  brackish  in  the 
Site  7-3  area.  For  the  sake  of  consistency  in  comparison,  it  was  assumed  that  the  amount  of 
groundwater  withdrawal  needed  for  general  site  purposes,  including  the  potable  and  sanitary 
water  system,  demineralized  water  distribution  system,  fire  protection  system,  and  other 
miscellaneous  systems  at  Site  7-3  would  be  the  same  as  that  required  at  the  proposed  PSEG 
Site.  As  discussed  in  ER  Section  3.3  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  an  average  of  210  gpm  and  a 
maximum  of  953  gpm  would  be  required  to  provide  freshwater  for  plant  uses.  This  water  could 
likely  be  supplied  from  pumping  of  groundwater  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 
According  to  the  USGS  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948)  there  is  a  cluster  of  production  wells 
located  6-7  mi  to  the  north  of  Site  7-3  that  withdrew  more  than  1  million  gal  per  year  (as  of 
2003)  and  depressed  groundwater  levels  about  2  ft  within  a  mile  of  the  wells.  If  the  groundwater 
needs  of  the  plant  were  supplied  by  wells  within  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer,  pumping 
rates  would  be  greater  than  those  discussed  above  and  drawdowns  could  be  greater  and 
extend  farther.  However,  because  impacts  of  pumping  are  localized,  it  is  not  likely  that  these 
pumping  impacts  would  extend  to  a  wellhead  protection  area  indicated  by  ER  Figure  2.3-20  to 
be  located  7  mi  north  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Groundwater  withdrawal  would  also  be 
regulated  by  both  DRBC  and  NJDEP.  As  a  result,  impacts  to  water  use  due  to  pumping  of 
groundwater  during  operation  would  be  minor. 

During  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  impacts  on  groundwater  quality 
could  result  from  accidental  spills.  Because  BMPs  would  be  used  to  quickly  remediate  spills 
and  no  intentional  discharge  to  groundwater  would  occur,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
groundwater-quality  impacts  from  operations  would  be  minimal.  Groundwater  withdrawal  for 
operation  of  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  likely  be  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer. 
Because  salinity  is  currently  at  levels  near  the  drinking  water  standard  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3, 
additional  pumping  may  increase  salinity  somewhat  within  the  aquifer.  However,  results  from 
the  USGS  (Pope  and  Gordon  1999-TN3006)  showed  that  changes  in  aquifer  salinity  have  been 
more  responsive  to  historic  sea  levels  than  to  the  regional  groundwater  withdrawals  in  the 
20th  century.  In  addition,  groundwater  is  not  likely  used  heavily  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3. 

Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  groundwater-quality  impacts  from  the  operation  of  a 
new  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

In  addition  to  water-use  and  water-quality  impacts  from  building  and  operations  activities,  this 
cumulative  analysis  considers  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  the  same  water  resources.  The  actions  and  projects  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-3 
considered  in  this  cumulative  analysis  are  listed  in  Table  9-21. 

The  review  team  is  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  the  water  resources 
available  for  cooling  and  the  impacts  of  reactor  operations  on  water  resources  for  other  users. 
Because  Site  7-3  is  located  near  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  the  potential  changes  in  climate 
would  be  similar  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Therefore  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  impact 
of  climate  change  on  water  resources  would  be  similar  to  that  at  the  proposed  site.

Cumulative  Water-Use  Impacts 

Based  on  a  review  of  the  history  of  water-use  and  water-resources  planning  in  the  Delaware 
River  Basin,  the  review  team  determined  that  past  and  present  use  of  the  surface  waters  in  the 
basin  has  been  noticeable,  necessitating  consideration,  development,  and  implementation  of 
careful  planning. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21,  consumptive  water  use  by  SGS  and  HCGS  were  considered 
by  the  review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  surface-water  impacts.  Because  the  water-quality 
impacts  and  potential  consumptive  use  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  would  need  to  acquire  an  additional  6.9  percent 
allocation  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir.  As  stated  in  Section  5.2.2,  the  review  team  determined 
that  obtaining  this  additional  allocation  was  feasible  and  would  ensure  that  the  plant  could 
operate  without  noticeable  impact  to  other  water  users,  even  under  declared  drought  conditions, 
and  without  the  need  to  release  additional  flows  to  meet  instream  flow  targets  in  the  Delaware 
River. 

Mainly  because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River, 
the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  use  from  past  and 
present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
MODERATE  and  that  a  new  plant's  incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  would  not  be 
significant. 

Of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21,  regional  groundwater  withdrawal  was  considered  by  the 
review  team  in  evaluating  cumulative  groundwater  impacts.  Other  projects  do  not  use 
groundwater  or  are  too  far  from  Site  7-3  to  interact  with  groundwater  use  at  the  site.  On  a 
regional  scale,  pumping  of  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  has  drawn  down  water  levels 
more  than  460  ft  around  high-use  areas  such  as  Camden,  but  these  effects  do  not  extend  to  the 
Site  7-3  area  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  discussed  previously,  drawdowns  within  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  are  expected  to  be  localized  around  the  wells.  As  a  result,  the 
groundwater-use  impact  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3 
would  be  minor.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  on 
groundwater  use  would  be  MODERATE  and  that  a  new  plant's  incremental  contribution  to  this 
impact  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

Cumulative  Water-Quality  Impacts 

As  stated  in  Section  7.2.2. 1,  DRBC  has  implemented  careful  planning  and  regulation  of  water 
quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  Although  there  have  been  improvements  in  water  quality  in 
the  Delaware  River  Basin  because  of  careful  planning  and  management  policies  put  in  place  by 
DRBC  (e.g.,  improved  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen),  the  presence  of  toxic  compounds  leads  to 
advisories  for  fish  consumption  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  In  its  review  of  the  PSEG  license 
renewal  application  for  SGS  and  HCGS.  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  water  quality  will  likely 
continue  to  be  adversely  affected  by  human  activities  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (NRC  2011- 
TN3131).  The  review  team  concludes  that  past  and  present  actions  in  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  have  resulted  in  noticeable  impact  to  water  quality.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  could  result  in  alterations  to  land  surface,  surface-water 
drainage  pathways,  and  water  bodies.  These  projects  would  need  Federal,  State,  and  local 
permits  that  would  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  Therefore,  the  impacts  to  surface-water 
quality  from  these  projects  are  not  expected  to  be  noticeable.  The  discharge  for  a  plant  at 
Site  7-3  would  be  located  at  Delaware  RM  41.6,  about  9.4  mi  from  the  SGS  discharge  and 
outside  the  SGS  thermal  plume  HDA.  The  area  affected  by  the  thermal  plume  from  a  plant  at 
Site  7-3  would  be  small,  would  be  localized  near  the  discharge  outlet,  and  would  not  interact 
with  the  thermal  plumes  from  SGS.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  the  cumulative 
impact  of  the  combined  discharges  from  SGS  and  a  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  not  be  noticeable. 

Because  of  extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  waters  from  the  Delaware  River,  the 
review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impact  to  surface-water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River 
Basin  from  past  and  present  actions  and  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-3  would  be  MODERATE.  However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant’s 
incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative 
impact. 

As  discussed  in  Section  7.2,  groundwater  withdrawals  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest 
have  noticeably  altered  the  groundwater  quality  in  localized  areas  where  pumping  occurs  near 
recharge  areas.  This  is  a  concern  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  where  pumping  from  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  may  induce  flow  of  saline  water  from  the  overlying  Vincentown 
aquifer.  The  proposed  site  is  located  near  the  river  and  within  the  outcrop  area  of  the  Kirkwood- 
Cohansey  aquifer,  however  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  is  separated  from  the  surficial  aquifer 
by  a  thickened  confining  sequence  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  Though  salinity  levels  may 
increase  slightly,  pumping  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer  is  not  likely  to  contribute  to 
cumulative  impacts  on  groundwater  quality  near  Site  7-3.  Based  on  the  proposed  or  possible 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-21,  additional  impacts  to  groundwater  quality  are  expected  to  be 
minimal.  As  discussed  previously,  BMPs  would  be  implemented  and  dewatering  and  pumping 
within  the  Site  7-3  area  is  unlikely  to  induce  flow  from  an  area  of  higher  salinity  into  the 
Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  aquifer.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative 
groundwater-quality  impacts  of  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects,  as 
well  as  climate  change,  would  be  MODERATE,  and  a  new  plant’s  incremental  contribution 
would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 5. 3  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources 

The  following  analysis  includes  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting 
from  building  activities  and  operations  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-3. 
The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
may  impact  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources,  including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  listed  in  Table  9-21. 

Site  Description 

Site  7-3  is  located  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey.  It  is  a  flat  greenfield  site  located  less 
than  1  mi  east  of  the  Delaware  River,  which  would  act  as  the  primary  water  source.  The

elevations  on  this  site  range  from  0  to  20  ft  above  MSL.  The  site  has  a  total  area  of  886  ac 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Site  7-3  is  located  in  the  Shoreline  Zone  of  the  Delaware  Bay  Landscape  Region  (New  Jersey 
Wildlife  Action  Plan).  Critical  habitats  in  this  zone  include  beaches,  dunes,  tidal  wetlands,  and 
freshwater  wetlands.  The  area  also  contains  rich  farmlands  inland  from  the  Delaware  Bay 
shoreline  and  small  amounts  of  upland  and  wetland  forest.  Several  thousand  acres  of  marsh 
habitat  have  been  restored  since  1996.  The  Shoreline  Zone  provides  critical  habitat  for 
migratory  birds  and  wildlife  along  the  coastal  plains  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  general  ecological  conditions  on  Site  7-3  are  typical  of  the  farmlands  found  in  the  Shoreline 
Zone.  Most  of  the  land  is  used  for  agriculture.  The  forested  areas  consist  mainly  of  scattered 
woodlots  and  strips  of  trees  along  streams.  The  tidal  and  freshwater  wetlands  in  the  area  are 
found  primarily  in  isolated  low  areas,  and  some  of  the  wetlands  are  farmed.  There  are  some 
managed  grasslands  in  the  area.  The  offsite  corridors  for  access  roads  and  water  pipelines  are 
largely  confined  to  the  immediate  site  vicinity,  and  the  natural  habitats  within  these  corridors  are 
similar  to  Site  7-3  itself  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Site  7-3  and  vicinity  does  contain  more  areas  of  managed  and  natural  habitat  than  the  other 
alternative  sites  under  consideration.  This  includes  a  conservation  easement  that  contains  a 
relatively  extensive  network  of  buffers  and  hedgerows  with  taller  trees  and  low  shrubs.  Fields  in 
the  area  are  also  maintained  in  warm  and  cold  season  grasses  for  wildlife  habitat. 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

No  site-specific  surveys  for  threatened  and  endangered  species  were  conducted  at  Site  7-3. 
Information  on  protected  and  rare  species  that  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3  was  obtained 
from  NJDEP  and  the  FWS  ECOS.  There  are  two  Federally  listed  threatened  plant  species  and 
one  Federally  listed  threatened  avian  species  known  or  having  the  potential  to  occur  in  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  Site  7-3:  the  Federally  listed  sensitive  joint-vetch  ( Aeschynomene  virginica),  swamp 
pink  ( Helonias  bullata),  and  the  Federally  listed  threatened  rufa  red  knot  ( Calldrls  canutus  rufa). 
NJDEP  considers  all  Federally  listed  species  as  endangered.  Additionally,  8  State-listed 
endangered  species,  5  State-listed  threatened  species,  and  43  species  listed  by  NJDEP  as 
species  of  special  concern  or  regional  priority  wildlife  species  may  occur  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3 
(FWS  2014-TN3333;  NJDEP  2008-TN31 17). 

The  NJDEP  information  shows  that  a  total  of  13  listed  animal  species  have  been  recorded 
within  about  1  mi  of  Site  7-3.  Table  9-22  lists  the  species  that  have  been  recorded  within  the 
area  of  Site  7-3  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Documentation  of  the  actual  presence  of  any  of  these 
species  on  the  site  and  along  offsite  corridors  would  require  that  detailed  field  surveys  be 
conducted.  There  were  no  Natural  Heritage  Sites  noted  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  Site  7-3 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Wildlife  Sanctuaries,  Refuges,  and  Preserves 

There  are  four  WMAs  and  one  state  park  within  a  6-mi  radius  of  Site  7-3  (Figure  9-1 1 )  that  could 
be  affected  by  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2389).  A  brief  description  of  these  areas  is  given  below. 

Gumtree  Corner  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Gumtree  Corner  is  a  1 ,1 04-ac  WMA  located  in  Stow  Creek  Township,  Cumberland  County.  The 
WMA  is  located  just  east  of  Stow  Creek  and  contains  mainly  tidal  marsh  and  open  field  habitat, 
with  some  areas  of  deciduous  forest.  The  site  provides  foraging  and  nesting  habitat  for  bald 
eagle  ( Haliaeetus  leucocephalus),  osprey  ( Pandion  haliaetus),  and  great  blue  heron  ( Ardea 
herodias)  (PSEG  2012-TN2389).

Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Mad  Horse  Creek  is  a  9,498-ac  WMA  located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem 
County.  The  WMA  is  an  area  made  up  mainly  of  tidal  marsh  on  the  Delaware  Bay.  The  site 
provides  foraging  and  nesting  habitat  for  migratory  bird  species  such  as  the  bald  eagle,  osprey, 
and  great  blue  heron.  Parking  and  a  boat  ramp  are  provided  at  the  end  of  Stowneck  Road 
(PSEG  2012-TN2389). 

Dix  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Dix  is  a  4,225-ac  WMA  located  in  Fairfield  Township,  Cumberland  County,  east  of  the 
Cohansey  River  where  it  meets  the  Delaware  Bay  to  the  south.  The  area  is  mainly  made  up  of 
tidal  marsh,  with  small  areas  of  open  field  and  deciduous  forest.  The  WMA  contains  habitat  for 
black  rail  ( Laterallus  jamaicensis),  northern  harrier  ( Circus  cyaneus),  and  bald  eagle.  The  WMA 
is  also  frequented  by  river  otters  ( Lontra  canadensis)  and  most  of  the  passerine  avian  species 
found  in  New  Jersey  (NJWLT  2014-TN3205). 

Cohansey  River  Wildlife  Management  Area 

Cohansey  River  WMA  is  993  ac  in  size  and  is  located  in  Hopewell  Township,  Cumberland 
County.  This  WMA  is  made  up  of  several  noncontiguous  parcels  along  the  Cohansey  River. 

The  area  consists  of  mainly  tidal  wetlands.  The  WMA  contains  habitat  for  great  blue  heron,  and 
foraging  habitat  for  bald  eagle.  It  also  acts  as  a  buffer  for  nesting  bald  eagles  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2389). 

Stow  Creek  State  Park 


Stow  Creek  State  Park  is  767  ac  in  size,  located  about  5  mi  from  Delaware  Bay.  Stow  Creek 
State  Park  habitat  includes  tidal  marshes  with  dense  growth  of  tall  grasses.  The  marsh  habitat 
supports  a  variety  of  wildlife  such  as  muskrat  ( Ondatra  zibethicus),  marsh  wrens  ( Cistothorus 
palustris),  rails  ( Laterallus  sp.),  red-winged  blackbirds  (Agelaius  phoeniceus),  swallows,  purple 
martins  ( Progne  subis),  northern  harriers,  red-tailed  hawks  ( Buteo  jamaicensis),  osprey,  eagles, 
waterfowl  and  wading  birds,  white-tailed  deer  ( Odocolleus  virginlanus),  and  fox  ( Vulpes  sp  ).  A 
viewing  platform  at  the  site  overlooks  the  extensive  salt  marsh  (NJWLT  2014-TN3206). 

Building  Impacts 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  directly  impact  (permanently  and 
temporarily)  395  ac  of  land.  A  total  of  491  ac  of  land  within  the  site  boundaries  would  not  be 
directly  disturbed.  However,  certain  building  activities  would  result  in  indirect  disturbance 
(noise,  dust,  etc.)  to  much  of  the  area  within  the  site  boundaries.  This  could  result  in  additional 
wildlife  impacts  in  terms  of  affecting  movements  and  causing  further  displacement  from  the  site. 
The  development  of  the  access  road  and  water  pipeline  corridors  would  result  in  the  disturbance 
of  an  additional  84  ac  of  potential  habitat.  In  total,  970  ac  of  potential  habitat  would  be  directly 
or  indirectly  impacted  as  a  result  of  building  at  Site  7-3.  The  total  acreage  of  forest,  wetlands, 
and  grassland  habitat  on  the  site  was  estimated  based  on  GIS  mapping  data.  Terrestrial  and 
wetland  habitats  that  would  be  affected  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  support

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


facilities  at  Site  7-3  include  about  575  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  3  ac  of  developed  land. 

1 1 5  ac  of  barren  land,  1 22  ac  of  forest  land,  7  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  deepwater  area, 

97  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  7  ac  of  freshwater  emergent  wetland,  61  ac  of 
freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  1  ac  of  other  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  likely  connect  with  the  potential  transmission  line 
corridor  that  could  be  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the  PJM 
region  (see  Section  7.0).  However,  PSEG  would  need  to  develop  three  connector  transmission 
lines  from  Site  7-3  to  this  new  500-kV  grid  stability  line.  The  lines  would  be  routed  through  a 
200-ft  corridor  for  6.8  mi  and  would  disturb  about  209  ac  of  planted/cultivated  land,  less  than 
1  ac  of  developed  land,  1 9  ac  of  barren  land,  225  ac  of  forest  land,  2  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine 
deepwater  areas,  24  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  less  than  1  ac  of  freshwater  emergent 
wetland,  96  ac  of  freshwater  forested/shrub  wetland,  and  less  than  1  ac  of  other  wetlands 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  amount  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  disturbed  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  Site  7-3  would  be  minimal  for  the  majority  of  habitats  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  There  are 
about  1 9,393  ac  of  planted/cultivated  lands,  9,704  ac  of  forest,  37,691  ac  of  estuarine  and 
marine  deepwater,  1 9,684  ac  of  estuarine  and  marine  wetland,  811  ac  of  freshwater  emergent 
wetland,  4,744  ac  of  freshwater  forest/shrub  wetland,  and  529  ac  of  other  wetland  habitat 
available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  However,  134  ac,  or  1 1  percent,  of  the  1 ,192.1  ac  of  barren  habitat 
available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  would  be  disturbed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As  a  result,  building  a 
nuclear  power  plant,  support  structures,  and  transmission  line  at  Site  7-3  would  have  a 
noticeable  impact  to  barren  habitats.  However,  barren  habitats  lack  vegetative  cover  or  the 
vegetation  is  sparse,  are  not  ideal  foraging  habitat,  and  lack  necessary  structure  to  support 
many  wildlife  species. 

There  is  the  potential  for  impacts  to  open  country  bird  species  and  those  that  frequent  smaller 
woodlots.  Fragmentation  and  loss  of  forested  areas  could  also  potentially  impact  more  area- 
sensitive  species  such  as  red-shouldered  hawk  and  wood  thrush.  Inadvertent  impacts  to  slower 
moving  species  (e.g.,  eastern  box  turtle  [Terrapene  Carolina  Carolina ])  are  also  a  possibility. 

The  larger  amount  of  natural  habitat  in  this  area  coupled  with  its  proximity  to  the  coast  would 
increase  concerns  regarding  potential  impacts  to  listed  species  such  as  bald  eagle,  osprey,  and 
northern  harrier.  Such  impacts  would  be  expected  to  be  minor  based  on  the  fact  that  there  are 
extensive  areas  of  similar  habitats  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  However,  Federally  listed  species  could 
be  affected  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-3.  The  Federally  listed  species 
sensitive  joint-vetch  and  swamp  pink  could  be  affected  by  the  loss  of  about  295  ac  of  wetland 
habitat,  and  the  Federally  threatened  rufa  red  knot  could  be  affected  by  disturbance  along  the 
Delaware  Bay  shoreline.  Therefore,  the  impacts  to  these  species  from  building  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  could  be  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing. 

Building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  could  force  displaced  wildlife  species  into  Mad 
Horse  Creek  WMA,  Dix  WMA,  Cohansey  River  WMA,  or  Stow  Creek  State  Park.  Displaced 
wildlife  species  could  place  added  pressure  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  as  a  result  of 
increased  competition  for  limited  resources.  However,  these  sites  would  not  be  expected  to  be 
directly  impacted  by  building  activities  at  Site  7-3.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


It  is  expected  that  a  project  of  this  size  would  result  in  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources,  including  habitat  loss,  disturbance,  and  fragmentation.  Building  a  nuclear  power 
plant  would  result  in  the  loss  of  available  habitat  on  the  site.  Noise,  lights,  and  dust  during 
building  activities  could  displace  species  in  adjacent  areas,  reducing  viable  habitat.  Less  mobile 
species  would  be  impacted  the  most  by  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  and  some 
mortality  would  be  expected.  More  mobile  wildlife  species  would  be  capable  of  moving  to 
habitat  in  adjacent  areas.  These  displaced  species  may  experience  impacts  as  a  result  of 
increased  competition  for  more  limited  resources.  Adjacent  WMAs,  preserves,  and  refuges 
could  be  affected  by  increased  demand  for  limited  resources  as  a  result  of  species 
displacement.  The  habitat  available  at  Site  7-3  is  common  to  Cumberland  County,  and 
sufficient  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  exist  in  the  Shoreline  Zone  of  the  Delaware  Bay 
ecoregion.  However,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  from  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  noticeable  as  a  result  of 
the  loss  of  wetland  and  the  potential  loss  of  shoreline  habitat  that  is  important  to  Federally  listed 
species. 

Operational  Impacts 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  that  may  result  from  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  include  those  associated  with  cooling  towers,  transmission 
system  structures,  maintenance  of  transmission  line  ROWs,  and  the  presence  of  project 
facilities  that  permanently  eliminate  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Operational  impacts  would 
be  similar  to  those  described  in  Section  5.3.1 ,  although  there  may  be  minor  differences  as  a 
result  of  topography,  climate,  and  elevation.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  the 
operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minimal. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Several  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  could  affect  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  in  ways  similar  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-3.  Table  9-21  lists  these  projects,  and  descriptions  of  their  contributions  to  cumulative 
impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  are  provided  below. 

The  Delaware  Bay  Landscape  Region  supports  expansive  salt  marshes,  upland  forests  and 
forested  wetlands,  and  sandy  beaches.  There  are  large  amounts  of  agricultural  lands  as  well, 
but  the  region  has  the  lowest  density  of  urban  areas  in  the  State  (NJDEP  2008-TN31 17).  The 
WMAs  and  parks  listed  in  Table  9-21  are  not  expected  to  contribute  to  adverse  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 

Most  of  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  are  operational  and  have  resulted  in  the  conversion  of 
natural  areas  to  industrial  and  commercial  development.  These  past  actions  have  resulted  in 
loss  and/or  fragmentation  of  natural  habitat  and  displacement  of  wildlife.  These  projects  include 
operational  nuclear  power  plants  located  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  Additionally,  the  five  operating 
fossil-fuel  plants  and  the  Salem  County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  listed  in  Table  9-21  would  continue 
to  contribute  to  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  The  development  and 
operation  of  these  projects  would  continue  to  reduce,  fragment,  and  degrade  natural  forest, 
open  field,  and  wetland  habitats  in  the  Shoreline  Zone.  Operational  projects  with  tall  structures 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


such  as  the  cooling  towers  at  HCGS  would  cause  avian  mortalities.  However,  the  projects  listed 
are  spread  throughout  the  region,  and  avian  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collision  with  tall  structures 
would  not  cause  a  noticeable  effect  to  avian  populations. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  NJLWD  projects  that  the  population  of 
Cumberland  County  will  increase  by  about  10  percent  between  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014- 
TN3332).  Future  urbanization  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural 
lands,  wetlands,  and  forested  areas.  Urbanization  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-3  would  reduce  areas 
in  natural  vegetation  and  open  space,  and  decrease  connectivity  between  wetlands,  forests, 
and  other  wildlife  habitat.  Although  NJLWD  predicts  relatively  low  population  growth,  the 
development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  coupled  with  additional  projects  outlined  in 
Table  9-21  could  substantially  increase  the  currently  projected  level  of  urbanization  for  the  area. 

Other  reasonably  foreseeable  projects  planned  in  the  area  of  Site  7-3  that  could  add  to  the 
cumulative  impacts  include  an  airport  infrastructure  upgrade  and  the  USACE  channel 
deepening  project.  The  Millville  Municipal  Airport  improvements  would  occur  on 
developed/disturbed  land  and.  therefore,  would  not  further  impact  any  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources.  The  USACE  channel  deepening  project  involves  dredging  and  deepening  portions 
of  the  main  channel  of  the  Delaware  River  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  Terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  could  be  affected  by  the  disposal  of  dredging  materials,  which  could  potentially 
require  new  disposal  facilities.  However,  the  USACE  NEPA  documentation  for  the  channel 
deepening  project  concludes  that  there  are  sufficient  dredge  disposal  areas  in  the  region  and 
there  would  be  no  significant  impacts  from  the  project  (USACE  1997-TN2281;  USACE  2009- 
TN2663;  USACE  201 1-TN2262). 

The  third  project  with  the  potential  to  affect  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  the  proposed 
transmission  line  corridor  being  developed  to  address  voltage  and  stability  constraints  within  the 
PJM  region.  In  its  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi- 
wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  WMC  (“West  Macro-Corridor”)  and  transmission  line  ROWs 
that  extend  55  mi  from  the  PSEG  property  to  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania.  The 
transmission  line  ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide.  The  development  of 
the  transmission  line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  more  than  1 .500  ac  of  land.  Habitats 
that  could  be  affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests,  mixed  forest, 
agricultural  land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  exact 
amounts  of  the  resources  are  not  known,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  project  would  cause 
fragmentation  and  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  However,  the  corridor 
would  be  expected  to  follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  A  new  transmission  line 
ROW  would  cause  wildlife  mortalities  as  a  result  of  operations  and  maintenance.  However, 
mortalities  would  not  be  expected  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  wildlife  populations,  and 
sufficient  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  exist  elsewhere  in  the  Shoreline  Zone  of  the  Delaware 
Bay  Landscape  Region.  PSEG  identified  more  than  64,000  ac  of  wetland  resources  in  the 
5-mi-wide  corridor  that  could  be  traversed  by  the  potential  new  transmission  line  ROW 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  It  is  unknown  exactly  how  much  of  these  wetlands  would  be  affected  by 
the  ROW,  and  mitigation  may  be  required  by  applicable  permitting  entities.  The  review  team 
has  determined  that,  as  a  result  of  potential  losses  of  wetland  resources,  the  impact  of  the  new 
transmission  line  ROW  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  noticeable.

divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions.  Site  7-3  is  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  ~he 
GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project  temperatures  to  rise  over  the  next  several  decades 
by  4.5°F  to  10°F  if  emissions  continue  or  3°F  to  6°F  if  emissions  are  reduced  substantially. 
Frequency,  intensity,  and  duration  of  heat  waves  are  projected  to  increase  under  both  of  the 
warming  scenarios  but  with  larger  increases  under  the  continuing  emissions  scenario.  Winters 
are  projected  to  be  much  shorter  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more  precipitation.  With  higher 
temperatures,  and  earlier  winter  and  spring  snow  melt,  seasonal  drought  risk  is  projected  to 
increase  in  summer  and  fall  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Increased  frequency  of  summer  heat  stress 
can  also  impact  crop  yields  and  livestock  productivity  in  the  Northeast  region.  New  Jersey  is 
projected  to  experience  60  additional  days  above  90°F  by  mid-century  under  the  continuing 
emissions  scenario.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the  global  average  due  to  land 
subsidence,  with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected 
changes  could  potentially  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations 
Large-scale  shifts  in  the  ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  anima 
migration  that  are  already  occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue. 

The  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  on  Site  7-3,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities  described  above,  would 
noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities  would  result  in  the  loss  or 
modification  of  terrestrial  habitats  which  could  potentially  affect  important  species  that  live  in  or 
migrate  through  the  area.  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  has  concluded  that  impacts  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
Site  7-3,  in  conjunction  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions, 
would  be  noticeable.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  contribute  to  the 
noticeable  impacts. 

Summary 

Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  were  evaluated  based  on  information  provided  by 
PSEG,  the  conceptual  layout  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  and  an  independent 
review  by  the  review  team.  Permanent  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  and  wildlife 
would  result  in  effects  on  these  resources.  Additionally,  impacts  to  these  resources  from 
building  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  noticeable.  Any  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  temporarily  disturbed  by  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  are  expected  to  return 
to  pre-building  conditions.  Operational  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be 
similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  conclusion  of  the  review  team  is  that 
cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  plants  and  wildlife,  including  threatened  and 
endangered  species,  and  wildlife  habitat  would  be  noticeable  in  the  surrounding  landscape  and 
therefore  MODERATE.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
a  significant  contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 5. 4  Aquatic  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  from  building 
activities  and  operations  at  Site  7-3.  The  analysis  also  considers  cumulative  impacts  from  other

past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  affect  aquatic  resources, 
including  the  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21.  In  developing  this 
EIS,  the  review  team  relied  on  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  the  alternative  site 
evaluation  in  accordance  with  ESRP  9.3  (NRC  2000-TN614).  Reconnaissance-level 
information  is  data  that  are  readily  available  from  regulatory  and  resources  agencies  (e.g., 
NJDEP,  NMFS,  and  FWS)  and  other  public  sources  such  as  scientific  literature,  books,  and 
Internet  websites.  It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  site  visits  (NRC  2012- 
TN2498;  NRC  2012-TN2499;  NRC  2012-TN2855)  and  documents  provided  by  the  applicant. 

Affected  Environment 

The  affected  aquatic  environment  consists  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of 
Delaware  RM  41.6  and  numerous  salt  marsh  creek  systems  and  streams  on  and  near  Site  7-3 
(S&L  201 0-TN267 1 ).  The  water  withdrawal  rate  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  for  Site  7-3 
would  be  the  same  as  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (78,196  gpm)  because 
Site  7-3  is  located  in  the  same  DRBC  water-quality  zone.  Water  availability  issues  would  also 
be  the  same  as  for  the  PSEG  Site  in  that  an  additional  6.9  percent  of  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir 
allocation  would  be  needed  during  drought  conditions  as  described  in  Section  5.2.2.  There  are 
no  known  exceptional  aquatic  resources  at  Site  7-3  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Commercial/Recreational  Species 

Site  7-3  has  the  same  species  as  those  listed  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  2.4. 2. 3).  Commercial 
fisheries  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  in  offshore  Atlantic  waters  for  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  include  American  Eel,  American  Shad,  Atlantic  Croaker.  Atlantic  Menhaden,  Black 
Drum,  Black  Sea  Bass,  Bluefish,  Butterfish,  Channel  Catfish,  Conger  Eel,  Northern  Kingfish, 
Northern  Searobin,  Scup,  Silver  Hake,  Spot,  Striped  Bass,  Summer  Flounder,  Weakfish,  White 
Perch,  Windowpane  Flounder,  Winter  Flounder,  blue  crab,  eastern  oyster,  horseshoe  crab, 
knobbed  whelk,  channeled  whelk,  and  the  northern  quahog  clam.  All  of  these  species  are  also 
considered  recreationally  important,  with  the  exception  of  American  Shad,  Atlantic  Menhaden, 
Butterfish,  Conger  Eel,  Silver  Hake,  Windowpane  Flounder,  eastern  oyster,  horseshoe  crab, 
knobbed  whelk,  channeled  whelk,  and  northern  quahog  clam,  and  are  described  in  detail  in 
Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Note  that  since  2008  there  has  been  a  moratorium  in  place  on  the  harvest  of 
horseshoe  crabs  in  New  Jersey  (ASMFC  2014-TN351 1 ). 

Non-Native  and  Nuisance  Species 

Site  7-3  has  the  same  potential  for  nuisance  species  as  those  listed  for  the  PSEG  Site 
(Section  2. 4. 2. 3).  These  include  the  Asian  shore  crab,  Chinese  mitten  crab,  Northern 
Snakehead,  and  Flathead  Catfish. 

Essential  Fish  Habitats 


The  Site  7-3  water  intake  and  discharge  areas  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  designated  as 
EFH  for  many  species  by  the  Mid-Atlantic  Regional  Fishery  Management  Council,  and  the 
NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  and  tidal  waters  near  the  PSEG 
Site  to  be  EFH  for  15  species  (PNNL  2013-TN2687;  NMFS  2013-TN2804),  as  described  in 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Due  to  proximity  of  Site  7-3  to  the  PSEG  Site,  EFH  would  be  expected  to  be 
similar  for  Site  7-3. 

Federally  and  State-Listed  Species 

There  are  no  critical  habitats  designated  by  NMFS  or  FWS  in  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-3 
(NMFS  2013-TN2614;  FWS  2013-TN2147).  Listed  species  found  near  the  proposed  water 
intake  and  discharge  structures,  near  the  possible  barge  docking  facility  and  inlet  channel,  and 
along  the  proposed  transmission  line  corridor  are  listed  in  Table  9-23.

The  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  Federally  and  State  endangered.  The  Federally 
threatened  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  of  the  loggerhead  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  State  endangered  for 
both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  The  Atlantic  green  sea  turtle  is  listed  as  endangered  at  both 
the  Federal  and  State  of  Delaware  levels  and  is  listed  as  threatened  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 
All  sea  turtles  have  certain  life-history  similarities  in  that  females  swim  ashore  to  sandy  beaches 
and  deposit  eggs  in  nesting  pits  that  are  covered  to  allow  incubation.  Juveniles  hatch,  struggle 
out  of  the  sandy  nest,  and  make  their  way  to  their  respective  ocean  habitats.  Although  there  are 
no  known  records  of  sea  turtles  nesting  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  sea  turtles  have  been 
observed  to  forage  in  Delaware  Bay  waters. 

Adult  Shortnose  Sturgeon  use  freshwater  for  spawning  and  estuarine  and  marine  habitats  for 
feeding.  Juveniles  migrate  downriver  to  estuarine  waters  and  may  go  back  and  forth  between 
freshwater  and  estuarine  habitats  for  several  years  before  maturing  to  adults.  Adults  sometimes 
migrate  to  marine  habitats  for  feeding  but  live  the  majority  of  their  life  cycle  in  estuarine  habitats 
(Rohde  et  al.  1994-TN2208;  NOAA  2012-TN2173).  Migration  to  spawning  habitat  occurs  in  late 
winter  and  spring,  and  adults  return  to  estuarine  waters  in  May  and  June  (Gilbert  1989- 
TN2149).  Spawning  occurs  in  freshwaters  characterized  by  low-to-moderate  velocities  and  over 
substrates  that  include  clay,  sand,  gravel,  and  woody  debris.  Sturgeon  feed  on  benthic 
invertebrates  such  as  snails,  insect  larvae,  crustaceans,  and  worms  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).

Shortnose  Sturgeon  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  system  (NOAA  2012-TN2173).  A  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  was  collected  in  a  bottom  trawl  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  downriver  of  the 
PSEG  Site  in  2004  (PSEG  2005-TN2566).  Two  Shortnose  Sturgeon  were  collected  in  2008  and 
one  in  2010  from  bottom  trawl  sampling  between  Delaware  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1 
and  RM  74.6),  which  is  upriver  of  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential 
dredging  activities  for  Site  7-3  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  share  many  life-history  characteristics  with  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  in  that 
adults  migrate  to  freshwater  to  spawn  and  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as  worms, 
crustaceans,  and  aquatic  insects  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Unlike  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  adult 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  prefer  more  marine  habitats  and  make  extensive  migrations  away  from  natal 
estuaries  beginning  as  subadults  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Historically,  the  Delaware  River 
supported  the  largest  population  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon  along  the  Atlantic  coast  (Secor  and 
Waldman  1999-TN2207).  Tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
followed  migration  patterns  similar  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  spawning  potentially  occurring 
mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal  Delaware  reaches  between  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and 
Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and  Fox  2007-TN2194).  Gill  net  surveys  by  the  Delaware 
Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  collected  more  than  1,700  juveniles  near  Artificial  Island  and  the 
Cherry  Island  Flats  (upriver  of  Site  7-3)  between  1991  and  1998  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082). 

A  single  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was  collected  in  2004  and  2009  in  bottom  trawl  sampling  in  Delaware 
River  Estuary  waters  between  RKM  100  and  RKM  120  (RM  62.1  and  RM  74.6),  which  is  upriver 
of  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential  dredging  activities  for  Site  7-3 
(PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2010-TN2570). 

Two  New  Jersey  threatened  freshwater  mussel  species,  the  tidewater  mucket  and  the  eastern 
pondmussel  (previously  described  in  Sections  9. 3. 2. 4  and  9. 3. 3. 4),  are  listed  as  occurring  in 
Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  (NatureServe  2012-TN2182;  NatureServe  2012-TN2184; 
respectively);  however,  there  are  no  State-listed  occurrences  of  freshwater  mussel  species 
within  a  1-mi  radius  of  Site  7-3  site  and  intake  locations  (NJDEP  2013-TN3578). 

Field  studies  would  be  required  to  definitively  determine  whether  any  rare  or  protected  species 
are  present  in  streams  in  the  project  area.  Federally  endangered  Shortnose  and  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  are  known  to  occur  near  the  proposed  areas  for  in-water  installation  and  potential 
dredging  activities  for  Site  7-3. 

Building  Impacts 

Building  the  plant  structures,  roads,  and  transmission  line  and  switchyard  would  disturb  streams 
on  the  site  and  along  offsite  corridors.  In  addition  to  buildings  and  other  structures,  buried  water 
intake  and  discharge  pipes  would  run  0.7  mi  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  the  site.  The 
total  length  of  streams  that  would  be  affected  by  site-development  activities  on  Site  7-3, 
including  access  roads,  rail  spurs,  and  water  pipelines,  is  3,747  ft  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This 
represents  0.1  percent  of  the  total  length  of  streams  within  6  mi  of  the  site.  In  addition,  an 
estimated  9,508  ft  of  streams  could  be  affected  by  building  activities  associated  with  the  new 
transmission  corridor  and  the  switchyard,  representing  less  than  0.5  percent  of  the  total  stream 
lengths  in  the  area  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  However,  potential  impacts  to  streams  from 
transmission  corridor  installation  could  be  avoided  or  minimized  by  final  corridor  placement  and

use  of  BMPs  to  reduce  erosion  and  sedimentation  effects  from  building  activities  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

The  installation  of  the  water  intake  structure,  and  possibly  a  barge  facility  with  a  turning  basin, 
would  result  in  disturbance  of  benthic  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Dredging  would 
disturb  about  11  ac  of  bottom  habitat  (about  185,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  intake  structure  and 
possibly  67  ac  (possibly  1 ,089,000  yd3  dredged)  for  the  barge  facility  (S&L  201 0-TN267 1 ). 

A  barge  inlet  channel  may  also  be  needed.  Dredging  the  barge  inlet  channel  would  disturb  an 
additional  82  ac  of  benthic  habitat  and  would  remove  an  additional  990,000  yd3  of  dredged 
material  (S&L  2010-TN2671).  Installation  and  site-preparation  activities  could  temporarily  affect 
water  quality  but  would  require  Federal  and  State  permitting  and  use  of  BMPs  to  minimize  and 
mitigate  the  temporary  and  localized  effects.  Effects  on  aquatic  organisms  are  expected  to  be 
minimal  and  temporary  as  adjacent  habitat  is  accessible,  and  mobile  aquatic  organisms  such  as 
fish  and  most  macroinvertebrates  would  be  able  to  avoid  or  move  away  from  the  affected  area 
during  intake  installation  activities,  but  effects  could  be  greater  if  the  installation  of  a  barge 
facility  with  a  turning  basin  and  inlet  channel  are  required.  However,  the  impact  on  aquatic 
ecology  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  streams  on  the  site  and  in  pipeline  corridors  would 
be  minimal. 

Operational  Impacts 

During  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  there  would  be  no  direct  discharges 
and  few  impacts  to  small  streams  on  the  site.  Operation  of  the  cooling  and  service  water 
systems  would  require  water  to  be  withdrawn  from  and  discharged  back  to  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  as  described  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Aquatic  impacts  associated  with  impingement  and 
entrainment  of  aquatic  biota  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  discharge  of  cooling  water  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  could  occur.  Because  the  specifications  associated  with  the  water 
intake  structure  include  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system  designed  to  meet  EPA  Phase  I 
regulations  for  new  facilities  (66  FR  65256-TN243),  the  maximum  through-screen  velocity  at  the 
water  intake  structure  would  be  less  than  0.5  fps.  Thus,  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  is  built  at 
Site  7-3,  the  anticipated  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  from  impingement  and  entrainment  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  not  expected  to  be  different  from  those  in  the  PSEG  Site 
analysis  presented  in  Section  5.3.2  and  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  Operational  impacts 
associated  with  water  quality  and  discharge  cannot  be  determined  without  additional  detailed 
analysis  but  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  effects  described  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Maintenance 
activities  on  the  site  and  in  offsite  corridors  would  follow  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State 
permits  to  minimize  impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Consequently,  impacts  on  aquatic  ecology 
due  to  project  operations  at  Site  7-3  are  expected  to  be  minor. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  alteration  and  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  as  described  in  Sections  2.4.2. 1 
and  7.3.2,  have  had  long-term  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  consequences  on  the 
aquatic  resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and  continue  to  be  the  subject  of  numerous 
restoration  activities  in  targeted  portions  of  the  area.  For  assessment  of  cumulative  impacts  for 
Site  7-3,  the  ROI  includes  a  6-mi  radius  of  water  resources  around  the  site  and  a  6-mi  radius 
around  the  point  of  the  water  intake  and  discharge  structures  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


The  non-nuclear  plant  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  may  result  in  alterations  to  surface-water 
drainage  pathways  and  water  bodies.  It  is  not  expected  that  these  projects  would  have 
noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  of  Site  7-3  because  they  would  need 
Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  The  past,  current,  and 
future  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  will  result  in  continued  losses  of  aquatic  species  through 
impingement  and  entrainment  at  the  water  intake  systems  and  alteration  of  thermal  profiles  in 
the  immediate  Delaware  River  Estuary  area  located  near  these  facilities.  Ongoing  restoration 
efforts  through  the  PSEG  EEP  will  continue  to  provide  mitigation  for  losses  by  increasing 
available  habitat  for  early  life  stages  of  aquatic  organisms  and  restoring  previously  fragmented 
habitats.  A  grid  stability  transmission  line  may  be  necessary  for  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-3  and  would  be  similar  to  that  described  for  the  PSEG  Site  (Section  7.3.2). 

Anthropogenic  activities  such  as  residential  or  industrial  development  near  the  vicinity  of 
Site  7-3  could  present  additional  constraints  on  aquatic  resources.  It  is  not  expected  that  these 
projects  would  have  noticeable  effects  on  water  quality  within  the  vicinity  because  they  would 
need  Federal,  State,  and  local  permits  that  require  implementation  of  BMPs.  The  review  team 
is  also  aware  of  the  potential  for  climate  change  affecting  aquatic  resources;  however,  the 
potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic  area  of 
interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could  lead  to 
regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events,  increases  in 
annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472).  Such 
changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  Site  7-3  through 
changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  Elevated  water  temperatures, 
droughts,  and  severe  weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic 
habitat,  but  specific  predictions  of  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change 
are  inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on 
the  intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities. 

Summary 

Impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information  provided  by 
PSEG,  NMFS,  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  Properly 
siting  the  associated  transmission  line  and  switchyard;  avoiding  habitat  for  protected  species; 
minimizing  interactions  with  water  bodies  and  watercourses  along  the  corridors;  and  use  of 
BMPs  during  water  intake  and  discharge  structure  installation,  possible  installation  of  a  barge 
facility  with  a  turning  basin  and  inlet  channel,  transmission  line  corridor  preparation,  and  tower 
placement  would  minimize  building  and  operation  impacts.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  on  most  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  including 
Federally  and  State  threatened  and  endangered  species,  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  future  activities,  would 
be  MODERATE  to  LARGE,  but  a  new  plant’s  incremental  impact  would  not  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact. 

9. 3. 5. 5  Socioeconomics 

As  discussed  in  Section  9.3.5,  Site  7-3  is  located  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey.  Due  to 
its  proximity  to  the  PSEG  Site,  the  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-3  would  be  the  same  as  for

the  PSEG  Site.  The  site  is  a  greenfield  site  located  10  mi  southeast  of  the  PSEG  Site  and 
about  2  mi  west  of  the  community  of  Greenwich  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280;  PSEG  201 0-TN257). 

The  review  team’s  baseline  discussion  focuses  on  the  50-mi  region  surrounding  Site  7-3.  As 
discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  expects  that  construction  and  operations  workers  for 
Site  7-3  would  likely  settle  in  the  same  areas  as  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
focuses  on  Salem,  Cumberland,  and  Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle 
County  in  Delaware  for  the  majority  of  impacts.  These  four  counties  compose  the  economic 
impact  area  for  Site  7-3. 

Based  on  experience  with  construction  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  PSEG  believes  about  84.5  percent 
of  the  workforce  required  to  build  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  come  from  within  the  50-mi 
region  surrounding  the  proposed  site.  PSEG  assumes  the  remaining  15.5  percent  of  workers 
would  relocate  to  the  region  from  outside  and  would  choose  to  reside  in  the  same  four  counties 
that  house  the  majority  of  the  operations  workers.  The  review  team,  as  discussed  in 
Sections  4.4  and  5.4,  found  similar  estimates.  Thus,  both  adverse  and  beneficial 
socioeconomic  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  would  not  be  noticeable  except  in 
these  four  counties.  As  discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  finds  the  assumptions  to  be 
reasonable. 

Physical  and  Aesthetic  Impacts 

Physical  impacts  include  impacts  on  workers  and  the  general  public,  noise,  air  quality,  buildings, 
roads,  and  aesthetics.  The  physical  impacts  on  workers  would  be  similar  to  those  described  for 
the  PSEG  Site.  The  primary  differences  would  be  due  to  the  presence  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
workforces  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-3  is  within  1  mi  of  a  wildlife  preserve.  Site  7-3  would  retrieve  its  cooling  water  from  the 
Delaware  River,  requiring  less  than  a  1 -mi-long  water  pipeline  that  would  go  through  WMAs  that 
are  used  for  hunting,  trapping,  and  birding  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  PSEG  would  also  build  a 
4.2-mi-long  road  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Because  the  site  is  a  greenfield  site,  PSEG  estimates 
three  new  500-kV  transmission  lines,  constructed  parallel  to  each  other,  would  need  to  be 
constructed  over  6.8  mi.  This  transmission  lines  would  be  adjacent  to  the  Stow  Creek  WMA 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Even  with  mitigation  measures  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Section 
4.4.1,  during  the  building  phase  these  areas  would  receive  adverse  physical  impacts  from  noise, 
vibration,  and  fugitive  dust.  Aesthetic  impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-3  would  be 
similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.1 .6  and  5.4.1 .6.  The  primary  differences  would  be 
due  to  the  presence  of  HCGS  and  SGS  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proximity  of  the  Delaware 
River  to  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  Site  7-3  is  a  greenfield  site,  it  would  create  new  infrastructure 
in  previously  undisturbed  rural  areas  and  WMAs.  Consequently,  the  review  team  expects  the 
aesthetic  impacts  from  building  and  operations  to  be  noticeable  and  locally  destabilizing. 

Demography 

Section  2.5.1  discusses  the  baseline  demographic  information  in  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region.  Site  7-3  is  located  in  Cumberland  County;  however,  it  is  about  8  mi  southeast  of  Lower 
Alloways  Creek  Township  (the  closest  township  to  the  PSEG  Site).  Due  to  its  proximity  to

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Salem  County,  the  review  team  predicts  the  same  workforce  requirements  and  in-migrating 
worker  housing  scenario  as  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.2  and  5.4.2.  The  review  team  found  that 
building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  demography  would  be  minimal  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  the  region. 

Economic  and  Tax  Impacts 

Section  2.5.2. 1  discusses  the  baseline  economy  and  Section  2. 5. 2. 2  discusses  the  tax  structure 
in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region.  Site  7-3  is  located  in  Cumberland  County,  about  10  mi 
from  the  PSEG  Site,  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the 
purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  economy  and  tax  revenues  from  the  building 
and  operations  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  the  review  team  predicts  economic  and 
tax  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4.4.3  and  5.4.3.  The  exception  would  be  in 
relation  to  property  taxes,  because  PSEG  would  pay  property  taxes  to  Cumberland  County. 

The  review  team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  economy  and 
local  tax  revenues  would  be  minimal  and  beneficial  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Employees  who  own  their  residences  would  pay  property  taxes  to  the  counties  and/or 
municipalities  in  which  their  homes  were  located.  In  New  Jersey,  property  tax  rates  vary  from 
one  county  to  another  and  also  within  townships  in  the  same  county.  Property  tax  rates  in 
Cumberland  County.  New  Jersey,  range  between  $1,733  and  $5,503  per  hundred  dollars  of 
assessed  value.  The  rate  in  Greenwich  Township,  where  Site  7-3  is  located,  is  $3,592  per 
hundred. 

Property  taxes  paid  by  construction  workers  who  already  live  in  the  economic  impact  area  are  a 
part  of  the  baseline  and  not  relevant  to  this  analysis.  In-migrating  workers  would  most  likely 
move  into  existing  houses  rather  than  build  a  new  home,  so  the  in-migrating  workforce  would 
result  in  a  transfer  of  property  taxes  instead  of  an  increase  in  local  property  tax  revenues. 

Based  on  the  above  assessments,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  property  tax 
impact  from  construction  workers. 

Cumberland  County  does  not  assess  a  property  tax  against  construction  projects  in  progress. 
PSEG  would  not  pay  property  taxes  to  Cumberland  County  until  a  new  power  plant  is  completed 
at  Site  7-3  and  commercial  operations  commence. 

From  the  above  assessments,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  construction- 
phase  property  tax  impacts  in  the  economic  impact  area,  and  that  the  overall  impact  of  new  tax 
revenues  at  the  state  and  local  levels  would  be  minimal  and  positive. 

As  was  the  case  in  the  PSEG  Site  analysis,  the  review  team  assumed  that  198  in-migrating 
operations  workers  would  have  to  either  purchase  or  build  new  homes  in  the  economic  impact 
area.  For  existing  homes,  the  property  tax  effect  would  be  zero;  for  new  homes,  the  review 
team  expects  a  limited  number  of  in-migrating  workers  would  prefer  to  build.  Given  the 
magnitude  of  the  property  tax  base  in  each  of  the  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area,  the 
contribution  of  new  real  property  to  each  area  would  result  in  a  minor  but  beneficial  impact.

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


All  of  the  real  property  and  improvements  related  to  Site  7-3  would  be  located  in  Greenwich 
Township,  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey.  The  review  team  determined  that  Greenwich 
Township  imposes  a  $3,592  per  hundred  dollars  of  assessed  value  property  tax  on  all 
improvements.  For  an  API 000  design,  the  expected  property  tax  revenue  to  Greenwich 
Township  would  be  about  $356  million  per  year  (unadjusted  for  depreciation).  For  the  ABWR 
design,  the  property  tax  revenue  would  be  about  $210  million  per  year.  Cumberland  County’s 
2013  budget  shows  expected  total  revenues  of  $125  million  (Cumberland  County  2013- 
TN2585).  Therefore,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  add  between  about  285  percent 
(API  000)  and  93  percent  (ABWR)  to  the  current  Cumberland  County  budget.  Consequently, 
the  review  team  determined  that  Cumberland  County  would  experience  a  major  and  beneficial 
impact  from  the  anticipated  new  property  tax  revenues,  and  the  economic  impact  area  would 
experience  a  minimal  and  beneficial  impact. 

Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

This  section  provides  the  estimated  impacts  on  infrastructure  and  community  services,  including 
transportation,  recreation,  housing,  public  services,  and  education. 

Traffic 


Section  2. 5. 2. 3  discusses  the  local  roadways  and  transportation  characteristics  in  the  economic 
impact  area  and  region.  Sections  4.4.4. 1  and  5.4.4. 1  discuss  the  traffic  impacts  around  the 
PSEG  Site.  Road  access  to  the  Site  7-3  area  is  provided  primarily  by  County  Roads  623  and 
639,  both  of  which  are  narrow  two-lane  roads.  Road  access  to  the  site  itself  is  provided  by 
either  County  Road  631  or  County  Road  646.  Access  to  the  site  is  provided  by  Country 
Road  642,  where  the  daily  traffic  count  is  230  vehicles  in  both  directions  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
The  site  is  about  27  mi  from  Interstate  295  and  the  New  Jersey  Turnpike  via  New  Jersey 
Route  49  and  County  Road  551.  The  nearest  rail  spur  is  about  9  mi  northeast  of  the  site,  and 
barge  access  would  be  provided  by  the  Delaware  River,  about  1  mi  from  the  site.  The  site 
would  require  about  3  mi  of  roadway  improvements  (PSEG  2010-TN257).  Because  the  roads 
leading  to  Site  7-3  are  narrow  two-lane  roads  with  low  traffic  volumes,  peak  building  traffic 
would  be  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing  to  local  traffic.  Due  to  the  size  of  the 
operations  workforce,  with  an  outage,  compared  to  the  building  workforce,  the  review  team 
expects  a  minimal  traffic  impact  during  operations. 

Recreation 


Section  2. 5. 2. 4  discusses  the  recreational  activities  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 
As  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 2  and  5. 4. 4. 2,  the  review  team  does  not  expect  any  stresses  to 
be  placed  upon  the  capacity  of  the  recreational  resources  in  the  PSEG  Site’s  economic  impact 
area  and  region  from  new  in-migrating  workers  and  their  families.  This  would  also  be  true  for 
Site  7-3’s  recreational  impacts.  Also,  like  the  PSEG  Site,  recreational  resources  near  Site  7-3 
would  receive  a  noticeable  aesthetic  impact  from  building  and  operational  activities  and  a 
noticeable  impact  from  traffic  during  peak  building  activities.  The  Stow  Creek  WMA  would 
receive  aesthetic  impacts  from  building  and  operations  due  to  its  location  near  the  site  and 
transmission  line  corridor. 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


However,  because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  sited  in  an  area  with  known  hunting  and 
trapping,  the  review  team  expects  a  further  destabilizing  impact  on  recreational  activities  in 
these  areas  from  the  new  infrastructure  (PSEG  2010-TN257;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Housing 

Section  2. 5. 2. 5  discusses  the  baseline  housing  market  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region. 
Site  7-3  is  located  about  10  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as 
the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  housing  market  from  the 
building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  the  review  team  predicts 
housing  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 3  and  5. 4. 4. 3.  The  primary 
difference  would  be  that  many  of  the  nine  houses  within  the  conceptual  site  boundaries  would 
have  to  be  removed  to  build  and  operate  a  new  plant  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  However,  any 
taking  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  to  be  performed  with  an  equitable 
compensation,  which  would  render  minimal  any  potential  impact  from  that  taking.  The  review 
team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  housing  market  would  be 
minimal  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Public  Services 


Section  2. 5.2.6  discusses  the  baseline  public  services  information  in  the  economic  impact  area. 
This  includes  water  and  wastewater,  police,  fire,  medical  services,  and  social  services.  Site  7-3 
is  located  in  Cumberland  County,  about  10  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site,  and  has  the  same  economic 
impact  area  as  the  PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  public 
services  infrastructure  from  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3, 
the  review  team  predicts  impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 4  and  5. 4. 4. 4. 

The  primary  differences  between  the  PSEG  Site  and  Site  7-3  would  be  because  local 
police/fire/EMS  response  to  the  site  during  construction  and  operation  would  have  to  come  from 
Cumberland  County  services.  The  review  team  found  that  building-  and  operations-related 
impacts  on  the  local  public  services  infrastructure  would  be  minimal  in  the  economic  impact 
area  and  the  region. 

Education 


Section  2. 5.2.6  discusses  baseline  education  information  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Site  7-3 
is  located  about  10  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  and  has  the  same  economic  impact  area  as  the 
PSEG  Site.  For  the  purposes  of  the  analysis  of  impacts  to  the  local  education  services  from  the 
building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  the  review  team  predicts 
impacts  similar  to  those  discussed  in  Sections  4. 4. 4. 5  and  5. 4. 4. 5.  The  review  team  found  that 
building-  and  operations-related  impacts  on  the  local  education  services  would  be  minimal  in  the 
economic  impact  area  and  the  region. 

Summary  of  Infrastructure  and  Community  Service  Impacts 

The  review  team  concluded  from  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  review  of  existing 
reconnaissance-level  documentation,  and  its  own  independent  evaluation  that  the  impact  of 
building  and  operations  activities  on  regional  infrastructure  and  community  services — including 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


housing,  public  services,  and  education — would  be  minor.  Physical-aesthetic  impacts  from 
building  and  operations  would  be  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing.  The  estimated  peak 
workforce  would  have  a  noticeable,  and  potentially  destabilizing,  impact  on  traffic  near  Site  7-3. 
Increased  traffic  would  have  a  noticeable,  but  not  destabilizing,  impact  on  recreational  facilities, 
but  recreation-based  aesthetic  impacts  would  have  a  noticeable  and  potentially  destabilizing 
impact  on  recreational  facilities  and  activities  near  Site  7-3.  The  cumulative  impacts  to 
economic  and  tax  impacts  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region  and  economic 
impact  area,  with  the  exception  of  a  MODERATE  and  beneficial  income  tax  effect  to  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  and  a  LARGE  and  beneficial  impact  to  Cumberland  County’s  economy  and  tax 
base. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

As  discussed  above,  the  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-3  is  Salem,  Cumberland,  and 
Gloucester  Counties  in  New  Jersey,  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  The  review  team 
discusses  information  pertaining  to  these  areas  in  Sections  2.5  and  7.4.1.  Table  9-21  lists  the 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  associated  with  Site  7-3.  Building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  could  result  in  cumulative  impacts  on  the 
demographics,  economy,  and  community  infrastructure  of  the  economic  impact  area  counties  in 
conjunction  with  those  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Within  the  economic  impact  area,  the  project  with  the  greatest  potential  to  affect  cumulative 
socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  the  continued  operation  of  the  three  nuclear  units  at  HCGS 
and  SGS.  The  other  projects  involve  continuation  of  development  in  the  economic  impact  area 
and  are  included  in  county  comprehensive  plans  and  in  other  public  agency  planning  processes. 
According  to  Section  2. 5. 1.3,  about  1,300  people  are  employed  at  HCGS  and  SGS  and  the 
majority  of  the  workforce  lives  in  the  four  counties  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Each  reactor 
has  outages  that  employ  a  further  1,034  to  1,361  workers  for  about  1  month  on  a  staggered  18- 
to  24-month  schedule  (about  one  outage  every  6  months  at  the  site).  Operations  at  HCGS  and 
SGS  also  contribute  to  economic  activity  and  tax  revenue  to  the  local  communities.  These 
characteristics  are  discussed  further  in  Section  2.5  and  in  the  HCGS  and  SGS  License  Renewal 
EIS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

An  outage  at  HCGS/SGS  could  occur  during  peak  building  at  Site  7-3.  The  review  team 
considers  this  potential  occurrence  in  Section  7.4.  The  majority  of  traffic  impacts  discussed  in 
Section  7.4  would  occur  where  the  HCGS/SGS  workforce,  the  HCGS/SGS  outage  workforce, 
and  the  PSEG  Site  building  workforce  merge  in  and  around  Salem  City  (PSEG  2013-TN2525). 
Because  Site  7-3  is  south  of  Salem  City  and  farther  from  major  interstates,  the  review  team 
determined  the  potential  for  cumulative  traffic  impacts  beyond  those  discussed  in 
Section  9. 3. 5. 5  is  minimal. 

The  operating  licenses  for  SGS  Units  1  and  2  and  HCGS  expire  in  2036,  2040,  and  2046 
respectively.  Salem  County  would  see  a  loss  in  tax  revenue,  PSEG  purchases  of  supplies  and 
materials,  and  employment.  However,  this  loss  would  be  partially  offset  by  the  continued 
operations  at  Site  7-3  compared  to  the  baseline  discussed  in  Section  2.5.  The  property  tax 
revenue  would  not  be  offset,  however,  because  Site  7-3  is  in  Cumberland  County.

Summary  of  Socioeconomic  Impacts 

The  review  team  expects  the  cumulative  effects  of  most  of  the  physical  impacts  to  be  SMALL 
with  the  exception  of  a  LARGE  impact  to  aesthetics  because  Site  7-3  is  a  greenfield  site  and 
would  create  new  infrastructure  in  previously  undisturbed  rural  areas  and  WMAs.  The 
cumulative  impacts  on  demography  would  be  SMALL.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  taxes  and 
the  economy  would  be  SMALL  and  beneficial  throughout  the  region,  except  for  a  MODERATE 
and  beneficial  income  tax  impact  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  a  LARGE  and  beneficial 
economic  and  tax  impact  to  Cumberland  County.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  infrastructure  and 
community  services  would  be  SMALL  throughout  the  region,  with  the  exception  of  a  LARGE 
impact  from  traffic  to  Cumberland  County  during  building  activities  and  a  MODERATE  to 
LARGE  impact  to  recreation-based  aesthetics.  Based  on  the  above  considerations,  the  review 
team  concludes  that  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  from  building  and  operations  at  Site  7-3 
(with  the  exception  of  the  physical  and  recreational  aesthetic  impacts  and  the  beneficial  impacts 
to  taxes  and  the  economy)  would  not  noticeably  contribute  to  the  existing  cumulative 
socioeconomic  effects  discussed  earlier  in  this  section. 

9. 3. 5. 6  Environmental  Justice 

The  economic  impact  area  for  Site  7-3  includes  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Cumberland  Counties 
in  New  Jersey  and  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  Because  of  the  proximity  of  Site  7-3  to  the 
PSEG  Site  (about  10  mi),  the  review  team  determined  the  analysis  of  populations  for  the  PSEG 
Site  was  a  close  approximation  of  an  independent  assessment  of  Site  7-3  (see  Section  2.6.1 ). 
Therefore,  the  review  team  used  the  distribution  of  minority  and  low-income  populations  around 
the  PSEG  Site  to  determine  minority  and  low-income  population  distributions  around  Site  7-3. 
This  distribution  is  discussed  in  detail  in  Section  2.6.  The  closest  minority  and  low-income 
groups  to  Site  7-3  are  located  about  7  mi  away  to  the  northeast  in  Bridgeton  (PSEG  2012- 
TN2450).  The  review  team  found  no  indication  of  subsistence  activities  in  the  economic  impact 
area.  As  discussed  in  Sections  2.5  and  2.6,  the  majority  of  migrant  populations  are  outage 
workers  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  The  closest  high-density  communities  are  in  Bridgeton 
(Cumberland  County  2010-TN2496). 

As  discussed  in  Section  9. 3. 5. 5,  the  review  team  expects  that  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  have  some  adverse  physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  to  the 
local  population.  However,  even  though  the  review  team  expects  adverse  physical  impacts 
during  building  and  operations,  distance,  intervening  foliage,  and  topography  would  significantly 
diminish  such  impacts  on  minority  or  low-income  populations.  Therefore,  the  review  team  does 
not  expect  the  adverse  physical  and  aesthetic  impacts  to  be  disproportionately  high  and 
adverse  for  minority  and  low-income  populations.  For  the  rest  of  the  economic  impact  area  and 
region,  the  review  team  expects  environmental  justice  impacts  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  Therefore  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  environmental  justice  impacts  at 
Site  7-3. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Based  on  the  analysis  above  and  the  discussion  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Section  9. 3. 5. 5,  the 
review  team  determined  that  there  would  not  be  any  further  disproportionately  high  and  adverse 
impacts  on  environmental  justice  populations  above  and  beyond  those  discussed  in  this  section.

The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  pathways  for  environmental  justice  impacts  from  the 
continued  operations  at  HCGS  and  SGS. 

9. 3. 5. 7  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey.  Site  7-3  is  less  than  1  mi  east  of 
the  Delaware  River.  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  actions  that  could  impact  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties, 
including  the  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21 .  For  the  analysis  of  historic 
and  cultural  impacts  at  Site  7-3,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  is  considered  to  be  the  APE  that 
would  be  defined  for  this  proposed  undertaking.  This  includes  the  physical  APE,  defined  as  the 
area  directly  affected  by  site-development  and  operation  activities  at  the  site  and  transmission 
lines,  and  the  visual  APE.  The  visual  APE  is  defined  as  the  additional  4.9-mi  radius  around  the 
physical  APE.  The  4.9-mi  radius  was  chosen  by  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  as  the  appropriate 
distance  for  consideration  of  visual  resources  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  was  therefore  applied  to 
the  alternative  sites  (AKRF  2012-TN2876). 

Reconnaissance-level  activities  in  this  cultural  resource  review  have  a  particular  meaning.  For 
example,  these  activities  include  preliminary  field  investigations  to  confirm  the  presence  or 
absence  of  cultural  resources  and  historical  properties.  However,  in  developing  this  EIS,  the 
review  team  relies  upon  reconnaissance-level  information  to  perform  alternative  site 
evaluations.  Reconnaissance-level  information  consists  of  data  that  are  readily  available  from 
agencies  and  other  public  sources.  It  can  also  include  information  obtained  through  visits  to  the 
alternative  site  area.  The  following  information  was  used  to  identify  the  cultural  resources  and 
historical  properties  at  Site  7-3: 

•  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280), 

•  Field  Verification  of  Key  Resources  at  PSEG  Alternative  Sites  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869),  and 

•  New  Jersey  SHPO  archaeological  site  files. 

Affected  Environment 

Site  7-3  is  a  greenfield  located  in  Cumberland  County  in  southern  New  Jersey.  Historically, 

Site  7-3  has  been  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  Site  7-3  encompasses  a  total  of  886  ac.  The 
location  would  require  4.2  mi  of  new  roads,  a  0.7-mi-long  makeup  water  pipeline,  and  three  new 
500-kV  transmission  lines  covering  a  total  distance  of  6.8  mi.  A  fourth  line,  for  grid  stability, 
could  also  be  needed  and  would  run  107  mi.  Due  to  the  close  proximity  of  Site  7-3  to  the 
Delaware  River,  delivery  of  materials  for  the  plant  would  be  by  barge.  A  new  road  would 
connect  Site  7-3  to  the  barge  facility.  The  current  major  industry  in  Cumberland  County  is 
agriculture.  Twenty-six  properties  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey,  are  listed  in  the  NRHP 
(NPS  2013-TN2775).  The  four  listed  properties  closest  to  Site  7-3  are  the  Bridgeton  Historic 
District,  the  Greenwich  Historic  District,  Bethel  African  Methodist  Episcopal  (A.M.E.)  Church, 
and  the  Thomas  Maskel  House  (within  1 ,000  ft  of  Site  7-3). 

No  archaeological  sites  have  been  previously  recorded  within  the  1-mi  APE  around  Site  7-3. 

Two  archaeological  sites  were  noted  in  close  proximity  to  the  conceptual  transmission  corridor.

Thirteen  previously  identified  architectural  resources  are  within  4.9  mi  of  Site  7-3  and  its 
ancillary  components.  Resources  include  residences  and  historic  districts.  Nine  architectural 
resources  have  been  identified  within  1  mi  of  Site  7-3  and  the  conceptual  corridors:  the 
Deerfield  Pike  Tollgate  House.  General  Giles  House,  Old  Broad  Street  Presbyterian  Church  and 
Cemetery.  East  Commerce  Street  Historic  District,  Jeremiah  Buck  House.  Samuel  Seeley 
House.  Potter's  Tavern,  Bethel  A.M.E.  Church,  and  9  Manheim  Avenue.  A  review  of 
architectural  resources  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  Site  7-3  identified  13  additional  architectural 
resources  that  could  potentially  be  eligible  for  listing  in  the  NRHP  within  1 .000  ft  of  Site  7-3; 
however,  none  were  within  the  footprint  (AKRF  201 1-TN2869).  These  resources  included 
residences  and  farmhouses.  Three  additional  buildings  (two  residences  and  a  school)  with 
potential  for  listing  in  the  NRHP  were  identified  within  1  mi  of  Site  7-3.  Another  12  structures 
and  architectural  features  that  have  the  potential  for  listing  on  the  NRHP  were  identified 
between  1  and  4.9  mi  of  Site  7-3. 

Building  Impacts 

Additional  cultural  resources  inventories  would  likely  be  needed  for  any  portion  of  Site  7-3  that 
has  not  been  previously  surveyed.  Other  lands  that  might  be  acquired  to  support  the  plant  (e.g., 
for  roads  and  pipeline  corridors)  would  also  likely  require  a  survey  to  identify  potential  cultural 
resources  and  historical  properties  and  mitigation  measures  to  offset  the  potential  adverse 
effects  of  ground-disturbing  activities.  The  types  of  historic  and  cultural  resource  impacts 
resulting  from  construction  and  operation  of  new  nuclear  units  would  consist  of  alterations  to 
archaeological  sites  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  visual  alterations  to  the  settings  for 
historic  structures.  In  some  cases  vibrations  from  construction  equipment  could  also  affect 
historic  structures. 

There  are  no  existing  transmission  corridors  connecting  directly  to  Site  7-3  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  Three  new  transmission  line  corridors  would  be  needed  to  connect  Site  7-3  to 
existing  lines.  There  are  two  previously  recorded  historic  and  cultural  resource  sites  in  the  area 
where  the  transmission  line  would  be  routed.  In  the  event  that  Site  7-3  is  chosen  for  the 
proposed  project,  the  review  team  assumes  that  the  transmission  service  provider  for  this  region 
would  conduct  cultural  resource  surveys  for  all  areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines.  In 
addition,  visual  impacts  from  the  plant,  the  cooling  towers,  and  the  transmission  lines  would 
result  in  noticeable  alterations  to  the  visual  landscape  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest. 
Building  impacts  are  expected  to  be  noticeable  because  significant  (i.e.,  NRHP-listed)  resources 
are  in  close  proximity  to  Site  7-3. 

Operational  Impacts 

Operational  impacts  from  a  new  plant  located  at  Site  7-3,  with  the  exception  of  the  visual 
impacts,  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal.  Most  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources 
would  occur  during  preconstruction  and  construction.  Noticeable  visual  impacts  to  historic 
structures  could  occur  within  the  viewshed  of  the  new  plant  during  operation. 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Cumulative  Impacts 

Noticeable  cumulative  impacts  would  occur  to  the  historic  properties  within  the  viewshed  from 
the  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  associated  with  the  plant.  Cumulative  impacts 
would  also  result  from  the  non-NRC-licensed  activities  associated  with  construction  of  the 
transmission  lines  and  pipelines.  Therefore,  cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable  due  to  the 
impact  to  historic  properties  within  the  viewshed  of  Site  7-3,  depending  on  what  resources  were 
encountered.  If  unidentified  archaeological  or  historical  resources  are  found  on  Site  7-3  or  in 
areas  needed  for  the  transmission  lines  and  pipelines,  then  the  impacts  could  be  greater. 

Summary 

Cultural  resources  are  nonrenewable;  therefore,  the  impact  from  destruction  of  cultural 
resources  is  cumulative.  Based  on  the  reconnaissance-level  information,  the  review  team 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  MODERATE.  The  incremental 
contribution  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  the  cumulative  impact.  This  impact-level  determination  reflects  the  fact  that 
cultural  resources  and  historical  properties  are  found  within  the  viewshed  and  would  be  affected 
by  the  plant,  cooling  tower,  and  transmission  lines. 

9. 3. 5. 8  Air  Quality 

Criteria  Pollutants 

The  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  and  offsite  facilities 
at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  expected  for  the  PSEG  Site.  As  with  Salem  County, 
in  which  the  PSEG  Site  is  located,  the  county  in  which  Site  7-3  is  located  (Cumberland  County) 
is  classified  as  a  nonattainment  area  for  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAGSs  and  in  attainment  or  better 
than  national  standards  for  all  other  criteria  pollutants  (40  CFR  Part  81-TN255). 

Administratively,  Cumberland  County  is  in  the  New  Jersey  Intrastate  AOCR  (40  CFR  81.331 
[TN255]),  while  neighboring  Salem  County  is  in  the  Metropolitan  Philadelphia  Interstate  AOCR 
(40  CFR  81.15  [TN255]).  As  with  the  PSEG  Site,  an  applicability  analysis  would  need  to  be 
performed  if  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  was  built  on  Site  7-3  per  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B 
(TN2495),  to  determine  whether  a  general  conformity  determination  was  needed. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.7,  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  from  building  a  nuclear  power  plant 
are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  limited  in  magnitude.  Emissions  from  these  activities  would 
be  primarily  the  fugitive  dust  from  ground-disturbing  activities  and  engine  exhaust  from  heavy 
equipment  and  vehicles.  These  impacts  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  associated  with  any 
large  construction  project.  During  building  activities,  a  New  Jersey  State  Air  Guality  Permit 
would  be  required  that  would  prescribe  emissions  limits  and  mitigation  measures  to  be 
implemented.  The  applicant  also  plans  to  implement  a  fugitive  dust  control  program 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Section  5.7  discusses  air-quality  impacts  during  operations.  Emissions  during  operations  would 
primarily  be  from  operation  of  the  cooling  towers,  auxiliary  boilers,  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines,  and  commuter  traffic.  Stationary  sources  such  as  the  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 


NUREG-2168

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


turbines  (operating  infrequently)  and  auxiliary  boilers  (operating  mostly  during  the  winter 
months)  would  be  operated  according  to  State  and  Federal  regulatory  requirements. 

A  Title  V  operating  permit  administered  through  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  ensure 
compliance  with  NAAQSs  and  other  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  prescribe  mitigation 
measures  to  ensure  compliance.  There  are  17  major  sources  of  air  emissions  in  Cumberland 
County  with  existing  Title  V  operating  permits  (EPA  2013-TN2515).  These  existing  sources 
include  the  energy  and  industrial  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21.  The  existing  energy  and 
industrial  projects  (including  various  glass  manufacturers)  and  the  planned  developments  and 
road-widening  transportation  project  would  contribute  to  air-quality  impacts  in  Cumberland 
County.  However,  the  impacts  on  air  quality  in  the  county  from  emissions  from  Site  7-3  would 
be  temporary  and  not  noticeable  when  combined  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  projects.  The  cumulative  air-quality  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  minor. 

Greenhouse  Gases 

The  cumulative  impacts  of  GHG  emissions  related  to  nuclear  power  are  discussed  in 
Section  7.6.  The  impacts  of  the  emissions  are  not  sensitive  to  the  location  of  the  source. 
Consequently,  the  discussion  in  Section  7.6  would  be  applicable  to  a  nuclear  power  plant 
located  at  Site  7-3.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  national  and  worldwide  cumulative 
impacts  of  GHG  emissions  are  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  The  review  team  further 
concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing,  with  or  without 
the  GHG  emissions  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3. 

Summary 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  cumulative  impacts  from  other  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  on  air-quality  resources  in  the  geographic  areas  of 
interest  would  be  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  and  MODERATE  for  GHG  emissions.  The 
incremental  contribution  of  impacts  on  air-quality  resources  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  SMALL  for  both  criteria  pollutants  and  GHG  emissions. 

9. 3. 5. 9  Nonradiological  Health 

The  following  impact  analysis  considers  nonradiological  health  impacts  from  building  activities 
and  operations  on  the  public  and  workers  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  which  is 
located  in  Greenwich  Township,  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  (about  10  mi  southwest  of  the 
PSEG  Site).  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
future  actions  that  could  affect  nonradiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal 
projects  and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest.  The 
building-related  activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the  public 
and  workers  include  exposure  to  dust  and  vehicle  exhaust,  occupational  injuries,  noise,  and  the 
transport  of  construction  materials  and  personnel  to  and  from  the  site.  The  operation-related 
activities  that  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  health  of  members  of  the  public  and  workers 
include  exposure  to  etiological  agents,  noise,  and  EMFs  and  transport  of  workers  to  and  from 
the  site. 


November  2015 


9-223 


NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Most  of  the  nonradiological  impacts  of  building  and  operation  (e.g.,  noise,  etiological  agents, 
and  occupational  injuries)  would  be  localized  and  would  not  have  significant  impact  at  offsite 
locations.  However,  activities  such  as  vehicle  emissions  from  transport  of  personnel  to  and 
from  the  site  would  encompass  a  larger  area.  Therefore,  for  nonradiological  health  impacts 
associated  with  vehicle  and  other  air  emissions  sources,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for 
cumulative  impacts  analysis  includes  projects  within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-3.  For  cumulative 
impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines,  the  geographical  area  of  interest  is  the  transmission 
line  corridor.  These  geographical  areas  are  expected  to  encompass  areas  where  cumulative 
impacts  to  public  and  worker  health  could  occur  in  combination  with  any  past,  present,  or 
reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions. 

Building  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  the  construction  workers  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  those  for  construction  workers  building  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site,  as  evaluated  in  Section  4.8.  They  include  occupational  injuries,  noise,  odor,  vehicle 
exhaust,  and  dust.  Applicable  Federal,  State,  and  local  regulations  on  air  quality  and  noise 
would  be  complied  with  during  the  plant  construction  phase.  Site  7-3  does  not  have  any 
characteristics  that  would  be  expected  to  lead  to  fewer  or  more  construction  accidents  than 
would  be  expected  for  the  PSEG  Site.  Transportation  of  personnel  and  construction  materials 
at  Site  7-3  would  result  in  minimal  nonradiological  health  impacts.  Site  7-3  is  in  a  greenfield 
area,  and  construction  impacts  would  likely  be  minimal  on  the  surrounding  population  areas, 
which  are  classified  as  low-population  areas. 

Operational  Impacts 

Nonradiological  health  impacts  on  members  of  the  public  and  on  the  occupational  health  of 
workers  from  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  those 
evaluated  in  Section  5.8  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Occupational  health  impacts  on 
workers  (e.g.,  falls,  electric  shock,  or  exposure  to  other  hazards)  at  Site  7-3  would  likely  be  the 
same  as  those  evaluated  for  workers  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Discharges  to  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  controlled  by  NPDES  permits  issued  by  NJDEP.  The  growth  of 
etiological  agents  would  not  be  significantly  encouraged  at  Site  7-3  because  of  the  temperature 
attenuation  in  the  length  of  the  pipe  required  for  a  discharge  system.  Noise  and  EMF  exposure 
would  be  monitored  and  controlled  in  accordance  with  applicable  OSHA  regulations.  Effects  of 
EMFs  on  human  health  would  be  controlled  and  minimized  by  conformance  with  NESC  criteria. 
Nonradiological  impacts  of  traffic  during  operations  would  be  less  than  the  impacts  during 
building.  Mitigation  measures  used  during  building  to  improve  traffic  flow  would  also  minimize 
impacts  during  operation. 

Cumulative  Impacts 

Past  and  present  actions  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to 
cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts  include  the  energy  projects  in  Table  9-21,  as  well  as 
vehicle  emissions  and  existing  urbanization.  Reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  in  the 
geographical  area  of  interest  that  could  contribute  to  cumulative  nonradiological  health  impacts 
include  expansion  of  natural-gas  pipelines,  improvements  to  and  new  construction  for  roadways 


NUREG-2168 


9-224 


November  2015 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


and  interstates,  future  transmission  line  development,  and  future  urbanization.  The  review  team 
is  also  aware  of  the  potential  climate  changes  that  could  affect  human  health,  and  a  recent 
compilation  of  the  state  of  knowledge  in  this  area  (GCRP  2014-TN3472)  was  considered  in  the 
preparation  of  this  EIS.  Projected  changes  in  climate  for  the  region  include  an  increase  in 
average  temperature,  increased  likelihood  of  drought  in  summer,  more  heavy  downpours,  and 
an  increase  in  precipitation,  especially  in  the  winter  and  spring,  which  could  alter  the  presence 
of  microorganisms  and  parasites.  In  view  of  the  water  source  characteristics,  the  review  team 
did  not  identify  anything  that  would  alter  its  conclusions  regarding  the  presence  of  etiological 
agents  or  change  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. 

Summary 

Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team's  independent  evaluation,  the 
review  team  expects  that  the  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  evaluated  for  the  PSEG 
Site.  Although  there  are  past,  present,  and  future  activities  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest 
that  could  affect  nonradiological  health  in  ways  similar  to  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  the  impacts  from  such  activities  would  be  localized  and 
managed  through  adherence  to  existing  regulatory  requirements.  Similarly,  impacts  on  public 
health  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  operating  at  Site  7-3  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal. 
The  review  team  concludes,  therefore,  that  the  cumulative  impacts  on  nonradiological  health  of 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.5.10  Radiological  Impacts  of  Normal  Operations 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  on  the  public  and  workers  from 
building  activities  and  operations  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3,  which  is  located  in 
Greenwich  Township,  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey  (about  10  mi  southwest  of  the  PSEG 
Site).  The  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
actions  that  could  affect  radiological  health,  including  other  Federal  and  non-Federal  projects 
and  the  projects  listed  in  Table  9-16.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.5,  Site  7-3  is  a  greenfield  site; 
there  are  currently  no  nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  is  the  area 
within  a  50-mi  radius  of  Site  7-3.  Other  nuclear  reactor  sites  that  potentially  affect  the 
radiological  health  within  this  geographic  area  of  interest  are  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  and 
Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3.  The  Shieldalloy  radioactive  materials 
decommissioning  site  in  Newfield,  New  Jersey,  is  also  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-3.  In  addition, 
medical,  industrial,  and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive  materials  are  likely  to  be  within 
50  mi  of  Site  7-3. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  include 
doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These  pathways  would 
result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  would  be  well  below 
regulatory  limits.  The  impacts  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  those  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  radiological  impacts  of  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station 
include  doses  from  direct  radiation  and  liquid  and  gaseous  radioactive  effluents.  These 
pathways  result  in  doses  to  people  and  biota  other  than  humans  off  the  site  that  are  well  below 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


regulatory  limits  as  demonstrated  by  the  ongoing  radiological  environmental  monitoring  program 
conducted  around  HCGS,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  and  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station.  The 
NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  dose  from  direct  radiation  and  effluents  from  medical,  industrial, 
and  research  facilities  that  use  radioactive  material  would  be  an  insignificant  contribution  to  the 
cumulative  impact  around  Site  7-3.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  data  from  the  radiological 
environmental  monitoring  programs  conducted  around  currently  operating  nuclear  power  plants. 
Based  on  the  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC  staffs  independent  analysis,  the 
NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  cumulative  radiological  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  and  other  existing  and  planned  projects  and  actions  in  the  geographic  area 
of  interest  around  Site  7-3  would  be  SMALL. 

9. 3.5.11  Postulated  Accidents 

The  following  impact  analysis  includes  radiological  impacts  from  postulated  accidents  from  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  that 
could  affect  radiological  health  from  postulated  accidents,  including  other  Federal  and 
non-Federal  projects  and  those  projects  listed  in  Table  9-21  within  the  geographic  area  of 
interest.  As  described  in  Section  9.3.5,  Site  7-3  is  a  greenfield  site;  currently  there  are  no 
nuclear  facilities  on  the  site.  The  geographic  area  of  interest  considers  all  existing  and 
proposed  nuclear  power  plants  that  have  the  potential  to  increase  the  probability-weighted 
consequences  (i.e.,  risks)  from  a  severe  accident  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  the  site. 

Existing  facilities  potentially  affecting  radiological  accident  risk  within  this  geographic  area  of 
interest  are  HCGS  Unit  1,  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station, 

Limerick  Generating  Station  Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  Units  2  and  3, 
Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and  Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2. 

As  described  in  Section  5.1 1 ,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of 
DBAs  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minimal  for  a  US-APWR,  two  API  000s,  a  U.S.  EPR,  or  an 
ABWR.  DBAs  are  addressed  specifically  to  demonstrate  that  any  of  these  four  reactor  designs 
is  sufficiently  robust  to  meet  the  NRC  safety  criteria.  The  reactor  designs  are  independent  of 
site  conditions,  and  the  meteorological  characteristics  of  Site  7-3  and  the  PSEG  Site  are  similar; 
therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  environmental  consequences  of  DBAs  at  Site  7-3 
would  be  SMALL. 

Because  the  meteorology,  population  distribution,  and  land  use  for  Site  7-3  are  expected  to  be 
similar  to  the  PSEG  Site,  risks  from  a  severe  accident  for  a  new  reactor  located  at  Site  7-3  are 
expected  to  be  similar  to  those  analyzed  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  risks  for  the  PSEG  Site  are 
presented  in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31  and  are  well  below  the  mean  and  median  values  for 
current-generation  reactors.  In  addition,  as  discussed  in  Section  5.11.2.1,  estimates  of  average 
individual  early  fatality  and  latent  cancer  fatality  risks  are  well  below  Commission  safety  goals 
(51  FR  30028-TN594).  For  existing  plants  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  (i.e.,  whose 
50-mi  radius  overlaps  with  the  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site),  namely  HCGS  Unit  1, 

SGS  Units  1  and  2,  Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Limerick  Generating  Station 
Units  1  and  2,  Peach  Bottom  Units  1  and  2,  Three  Mile  Island  Nuclear  Station  Unit  1,  and 
Calvert  Cliffs  Nuclear  Power  Plant  Units  1  and  2,  the  Commission  has  determined  the 
probability-weighted  consequences  of  severe  accidents  are  small  (10  CFR  Part  51,  Appendix  B,

Table  B-1  [TN250]).  Because  of  the  NRC  safety  review  criteria,  it  is  expected  that  risks  for  any 
new  reactors  at  any  other  locations  within  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for  Site  7-3  would  be 
well  below  risks  for  current-generation  reactors  and  would  meet  Commission  safety  goals.  The 
severe  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  becomes  smaller  as  the  distance 
from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-3 
would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  these  operating  nuclear  power  plants  and  would 
still  be  low. 

The  postulated  accident  risk  due  to  any  particular  nuclear  power  plant  gets  smaller  as  the 
distance  from  that  plant  increases.  However,  the  combined  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of 
Site  7-3  site  would  be  bounded  by  the  sum  of  risks  for  all  of  these  operating  and  proposed 
nuclear  power  plants.  Even  though  there  would  be  potentially  several  plants  included  in  the 
combination,  this  combined  risk  would  still  be  low.  On  this  basis,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that 
the  cumulative  risks  of  postulated  accidents  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  Site  7-3  would  be 
SMALL. 

9.3.6  Comparison  of  the  Impacts  of  the  Proposed  Action  and  Alternative  Sites 

This  section  summarizes  the  review  team  characterization  of  the  cumulative  impacts  related  to 
locating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  and  at  each  of  the  four 
alternative  sites.  The  sites  selected  for  detailed  review  as  part  of  the  alternative  sites 
environmental  analysis  included  the  four  sites  designated  as  Site  4-1,  Site  7-1,  Site  7-2,  and 
Site  7-3  in  New  Jersey  (see  Figure  9-1).  Comparisons  are  made  between  the  PSEG  Site  and 
the  alternative  sites  to  determine  whether  one  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  "environmentally 
preferable”(1)  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NRC  determination  as  to  whether  an  alternative  site  would 
be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site  is  independent  of  the  USACE  determination  of 
a  LEDPA  pursuant  to  CWA  Section  404(b)(1 )  Guidelines  at  40  CFR  Part  230  (TN427).  The 
USACE  will  conclude  its  analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite  alternatives  in  its  permit  decision 
documents. 

The  need  to  compare  the  PSEG  Site  with  alternative  sites  arises  from  the  requirement  in  NEPA 
Section  1 02(2)(c)(iii)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  that  EISs  include  an  analysis  of  alternatives 
to  the  proposed  action.  The  NRC  criteria  to  be  used  in  assessing  whether  a  proposed  site  is  to 
be  rejected  in  favor  of  an  alternative  site  are  based  on  whether  the  alternative  site  is  “obviously 
superior”  to  the  site  proposed  by  the  applicant  (PSCO  v.  NRC  1978-TN2633).  An  alternative 
site  is  obviously  superior  to  the  proposed  site  if  it  is  "clearly  and  substantially"  superior  to  the 
proposed  site  (NRC  1978-TN2636).  The  standard  of  obviously  superior  “is  designed  to 
guarantee  that  a  proposed  site  will  not  be  rejected  in  favor  of  an  alternate  unless,  on  the  basis 
of  appropriate  study,  the  Commission  can  be  confident  that  such  action  is  called  for” 

(NECNP  v.  NRC  1978-TN2632). 

The  “obviously  superior”  test  is  appropriate  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  analysis  performed  by  the 
NRC  in  evaluating  alternative  sites  is  necessarily  imprecise.  Key  factors  considered  in  the 


(1)  As  defined  in  Section  9.3  of  NUREG-1555,  an  “environmentally  preferred”  alternative  site  is  a  site  for 
which  the  environmental  impacts  are  sufficiently  less  than  for  the  proposed  site  so  that  environmental 
preference  for  the  alternative  site  can  be  established  (NRC  2000-TN614).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


alternative  site  analysis,  such  as  population  distribution  and  density,  hydrology,  air  quality, 
aquatic  and  terrestrial  ecological  resources,  aesthetics,  land  use,  and  socioeconomics,  are 
difficult  to  quantify  in  common  metrics.  Given  this  difficulty,  any  evaluation  of  a  particular  site 
must  have  a  wide  range  of  uncertainty.  Second,  the  PSEG  Site  has  been  analyzed  in  detail, 
with  the  expectation  that  most  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  site  have 
been  identified.  The  alternative  sites  have  not  undergone  a  comparable  level  of  detailed  study. 
For  these  reasons,  a  proposed  site  may  not  be  rejected  in  favor  of  an  alternative  site  when  the 
alternative  site  is  marginally  better  than  the  proposed  site,  only  when  it  is  obviously  superior 
(NRC  1978-TN2636).  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  does  not  require  that  a  nuclear 
plant  be  constructed  on  the  single  best  site  for  environmental  purposes.  Rather,  “all  that  NEPA 
requires  is  that  alternative  sites  be  considered  and  that  the  effects  on  the  environment  of 
building  the  plant  at  the  alternative  sites  be  carefully  studied  and  factored  into  the  ultimate 
decision”  (NECNP  v.  NRC  1978-TN2632). 

The  NRC  staff  review  of  alternative  sites  consists  of  a  two-part  sequential  test  (NRC  2000- 
TN614).  The  first  part  of  the  test  determines  whether  any  of  the  alternative  sites  are 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  applicant-proposed  site.  The  NRC  staff  considers  whether  the 
applicant  has  (1)  reasonably  identified  candidate  sites,  (2)  evaluated  the  likely  environmental 
impacts  of  building  and  operation  at  these  sites,  and  (3)  used  a  logical  means  of  comparing 
sites  that  led  to  applicant  selection  of  the  proposed  site.  Based  on  the  independent  NRC 
review,  the  NRC  staff  determines  whether  any  of  the  alternative  sites  are  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  applicant-proposed  site.  If  the  NRC  staff  determines  that  one  or  more 
alternative  sites  are  environmentally  preferable,  then  it  would  compare  the  estimated  costs 
(i.e.,  environmental,  economic,  and  time)  of  constructing  the  proposed  plant  at  the  applicant- 
proposed  site  and  at  the  environmentally  preferable  site  or  sites  (NRC  2000-TN614).  The 
second  part  of  the  test  determines  whether  an  environmentally  preferable  alternative  site  is 
obviously  superior  to  the  applicant-proposed  site.  The  NRC  staff  must  determine  that  (1 )  one  or 
more  important  aspects,  either  singly  or  in  combination,  of  an  environmentally  preferable 
alternative  site  are  obviously  superior  to  the  corresponding  aspects  of  the  applicant-proposed 
site  and  (2)  the  alternative  site  does  not  have  offsetting  deficiencies  in  other  important  areas. 

An  NRC  staff  conclusion  that  an  alternative  site  is  obviously  superior  to  the  applicant-proposed 
site  would  normally  lead  to  a  recommendation  that  the  application  for  the  license  be  denied. 

Section  9.3.6. 1  reviews  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Cumulative  impact  levels  for  the  PSEG  Site  (from 
Chapter  7)  and  the  four  alternative  sites  (from  Sections  9.3.2,  9.3.3,  9.3.4,  and  9.3.5)  are  given 
in  Table  9-24.  Sections  9. 3. 6. 2  and  9. 3. 6. 3  discuss  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  relation  to  the  alternative  sites  as  they  relate  to 
“environmentally  preferable”  and  “obviously  superior”  evaluations. 

9. 3. 6. 1  Comparison  of  Cumulative  Impacts  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  Alternative  Sites 

The  review  team  characterizations  of  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  at  the  four  alternative  sites  are  listed 
by  resource  area  in  Table  9-24.

(b)  The  entry  “None”  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts  to  minority  or  low- 
income  populations  from  the  proposed  action.  Rather,  “None”  means  that,  while  there  may  be  adverse  impacts, 
those  impacts  do  not  affect  minority  or  low-income  populations  in  any  disproportionate  manner,  relative  to  the 
general  population.  Similarly,  the  entry  “Potential”  means  that  the  review  team  has  determined  the  presence  of 
pathways  by  which  a  minority  or  low-income  population  could  be  affected  disproportionately. 


The  review  team  evaluated  the  environmental  resource  areas  listed  in  Table  9-24  using  the 
NRC  three-level  standard  of  impact  significance:  SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE.  These 
levels  were  developed  using  the  CEQ  guidelines  and  set  forth  in  the  footnotes  to  10  CFR 
Part  51 ,  Subpart  A,  Appendix  B,  Table  B-1  (TN250).

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


SMALL  -  Environmental  effects  are  not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that  they  will 
neither  destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute  of  the  resource. 

MODERATE  -  Environmental  effects  are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  to 
destabilize,  important  attributes  of  the  resource. 

LARGE  -  Environmental  effects  are  clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to 
destabilize  important  attributes  of  the  resource. 

The  review  team  performed  reconnaissance-level  reviews  of  each  of  the  four  alternative  sites 
and  reviewed  information  provided  in  the  PSEG  ER  and  RAI  responses,  information  from  other 
Federal  and  State  agencies,  and  information  gathered  during  visits  to  each  alternative  site.  The 
review  team  found  that  PSEG  implemented  a  reasonable  process  to  select  alternative  sites  and 
used  a  logical  process  to  compare  the  impacts  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  those  at  the  alternative  sites. 
The  following  discussion  summarizes  the  review  team’s  independent  assessment  of  the  PSEG 
Site  and  alternative  sites. 

Full  explanations  for  the  cumulative  impact  characterizations  are  provided  in  Chapter  7  for  the 
PSEG  Site  and  in  Sections  9.3.2,  9.3.3,  9.3.4,  and  9.3.5  for  the  four  alternative  sites.  The 
review  team  assignment  of  impact  category  levels  is  based  on  professional  judgment, 
experience,  and  consideration  of  controls  likely  to  be  imposed  under  required  Federal,  State,  or 
local  permits  that  would  not  be  acquired  until  an  application  for  a  construction  permit  or 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  were  under  way.  These  considerations  and 
assumptions  were  similarly  applied  at  each  of  the  alternative  sites  to  provide  comparisons  of 
impact  levels  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  each  of  the  four  alternative  sites. 

9. 3. 6. 2  Environmentally  Preferable  Sites 

Neither  the  PSEG  Site  nor  any  of  the  four  alternative  sites  appear  to  have  inherent 
characteristics  that  would  completely  preempt  building  a  nuclear  plant  at  that  location. 

However,  as  shown  in  Table  9-24,  the  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  or  at  one  of  the  alternative  sites  vary  across  the 
impact  categories. 

The  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
or  at  any  one  of  the  alternative  sites  are  SMALL  for  several  impact  categories  (e.g., 
demography,  radiological  health,  and  postulated  accidents).  The  resource  categories  for  which 
the  impact  level  at  an  alternative  site  would  be  the  same  as  for  the  proposed  site  do  not 
contribute  to  the  alternative  site  being  judged  to  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed 
site  (e.g.,  taxes  and  economy,  and  air  quality).  Therefore,  these  resource  categories  are  not 
discussed  further  in  determining  whether  an  alternate  site  is  environmentally  preferable  to  the 
proposed  site.  Where  there  is  a  range  of  impacts  for  a  resource  category,  the  upper  value  of 
that  range  is  used  for  the  comparison.  In  addition,  for  those  cases  in  which  the  cumulative 
impacts  for  a  resource  category  would  be  greater  than  SMALL,  consideration  is  given  to  those 
cases  in  which  the  impacts  of  the  project  at  the  specific  site  would  not  make  a  significant 
contribution  to  the  cumulative  impact  level.

Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


Site  4-1 

For  most  resources,  the  environmental  impacts  at  Site  4-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  cumulative  impacts  to  groundwater  use  and  quality  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
MODERATE,  as  compared  to  SMALL  at  Site  4-1.  However,  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  plant  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  MODERATE  impacts  at  the  PSEG 
Site,  so  there  is  no  real  difference  between  the  sites  in  this  regard.  Similarly,  the  impacts  to 
aquatic  resources  is  shown  as  MODERATE  to  LARGE  for  the  PSEG  Site,  as  compared  to 
MODERATE  for  Site  4-1,  but  at  both  sites  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  is  not  a 
significant  contributor  to  the  impacts.  For  surface-water  use,  the  table  indicates  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  at  both  sites  are  MODERATE.  However,  at  Site  4-1  building  and  operating 
a  new  nuclear  plant  is  a  significant  contributor  to  the  impacts,  while  at  the  PSEG  Site  it  is  not. 
Therefore,  Site  4-1  is  less  favorable  in  regard  to  surface-water-use  impacts.  Finally,  Table  9-24 
also  shows  greater  impacts  at  Site  4-1  for  physical  impacts,  infrastructure  and  community 
services,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources.  For  all  three  of  these  resource  areas,  the  higher 
impacts  are  related  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  site.  Based  on  this 
comparison  of  the  sites,  Site  4-1  is  not  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-1 

For  most  resources,  the  environmental  impacts  at  Site  7-1  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  However,  Table  9-24  shows  greater  impacts  at  Site  7-1  for  physical  impacts, 
infrastructure  and  community  services,  and  environmental  justice.  For  all  three  of  these 
resource  areas,  the  higher  impacts  are  related  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant 
at  the  site.  In  addition,  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  Site  7-1  would  be  a 
significant  contributor  to  the  MODERATE  groundwater-use  impacts,  while  at  the  PSEG  Site, 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  is  not  a  significant  contributor,  which  means  that 
Site  7-1  is  less  favorable  in  this  regard.  Based  on  this  comparison  of  the  sites,  Site  7-1  is  not 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-2 

For  most  resources,  the  environmental  impacts  at  Site  7-2  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  However,  Table  9-24  shows  greater  impacts  at  Site  7-2  for  physical  impacts  and  for 
infrastructure  and  community  services.  For  both  of  these  two  resource  areas,  the  higher 
impacts  are  related  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  site.  Based  on  this 
comparison  of  the  sites,  Site  7-2  is  not  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site. 

Site  7-3 

For  most  resources,  the  environmental  impacts  at  Site  7-3  would  be  similar  to  the  impacts  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  However,  Table  9-24  shows  greater  impacts  at  Site  7-3  for  physical  impacts  and  for 
infrastructure  and  community  services.  For  both  of  these  two  resource  areas,  the  higher 
impacts  are  related  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  site.  Based  on  this 
comparison  of  the  sites,  Site  7-3  is  not  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site. 

In  conclusion,  although  there  are  differences  and  distinctions  between  the  cumulative

PSEG  Site  or  at  one  of  the  alternative  sites,  the  review  team  concludes  that  these  differences 
are  not  sufficient  to  determine  that  any  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  proposed  site  for  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In  such  a 
case,  the  proposed  site  prevails  because  none  of  the  alternative  sites  is  clearly  environmentally 
preferable. 

9. 3. 6. 3  Obviously  Superior  Sites 

None  of  the  alternative  sites  was  determined  to  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  none  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be 
obviously  superior  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The  USACE  will  make  its  LEDPA  decision  in  a  permit 
decision  document. 

9.4  System  Design  Alternatives 

The  review  team  considered  several  alternative  designs  for  the  heat  dissipation  systems  and 
CWS.  The  heat  dissipation  from  the  CWS  during  operation  requires  the  most  capacity,  and  for 
an  extended  time,  to  support  the  cooling  needs  of  a  commercial  power  reactor.  The  heat 
dissipation  needs  from  other  cooling  systems  such  as  the  service  water  system  (SWS)  are 
smaller.  For  the  suite  of  reactor  designs  being  considered  for  the  PSEG  Site,  the  bounding 
CWS  would  need  to  dissipate  1.508  *  1010  Btu  per  hour,  while  the  bounding  SWS  would  need  to 
dissipate  a  maximum  of  4.72  *  108  Btu  per  hour,  about  32  times  less  than  the  CWS.  Therefore, 
the  review  team  only  considered  alternative  heat  dissipation  systems  and  water  treatment 
systems  for  the  CWS.  The  review  team  considered  alternative  water  sources  for  both  CWS  and 
SWS  because  the  cooling  water  withdrawal  of  both  systems  has  the  potential  to  affect  the 
environment. 

The  CWS  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  as  described  by  PSEG  in  the  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280)  would  be  a  closed-loop  system  composed  of  wet  cooling  towers,  water 
pumps,  and  cooling  tower  basins.  The  water  lost  as  evaporation  and  drift  from  CWS  and  SWS 
cooling  towers  and  as  blowdown  from  CWS  and  SWS  cooling  tower  basins  would  be 
replenished  by  makeup  water  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  via  a  new  intake  structure. 
CWS  and  SWS  are  discussed  in  Section  3.2. 

9.4.1  Heat  Dissipation  Systems 

Waste  heat,  about  two-thirds  of  a  commercial  nuclear  reactor’s  thermal  generation,  is  rejected 
to  the  environment  via  latent  heat  exchange  (e.g.,  by  evaporating  water)  or  sensible  heat 
exchange  (e.g.,  via  warmer  air  or  water).  Sections  4.2  and  5.2  describe  the  impacts  of  the  wet, 
closed-loop  cooling  towers  proposed  and  described  by  PSEG  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
The  following  sections  describe  alternative  heat  dissipation  systems  considered  by  the  review 
team  for  the  PSEG  Site. 

Because  the  final  reactor  design  has  not  been  chosen  at  this  stage,  several  options  exist  for  the 
closed-loop  heat  dissipation  system  for  the  PSEG  Site,  including  wet  MDCTs,  NDCTs,  and 
fan-assisted  NDCTs.  The  review  team  has  not  compared  these  three  designs  to  each  other 
because  PSEG  has  not  yet  selected  a  specific  design.  One  of  the  designs  would  be  chosen  by 


NUREG-2168

PSEG  if,  at  some  time  in  the  future,  it  requests  authorization  from  the  NRC  (e.g.,  a  combined 
license)  to  construct  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  plant.  The  review  team  would  compare  the 
chosen  design  to  the  other  two  designs  at  that  time.  The  makeup  water  for  the  closed-cycle 
heat  dissipation  system  would  be  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  via  the  new  intake  system. 

9. 4. 1.1  Plant  Cooling  System  -  Once-Through  Operation 

A  once-through  heat  dissipation  system  withdraws  water  from  a  water  source,  circulates  the 
water  through  the  condenser  where  heat  exchange  warms  the  circulating  water,  and  discharges 
virtually  the  same  amount  of  water  back  to  the  water  source.  Typically,  the  withdrawal  point  (the 
intake  system)  and  the  discharge  point  (the  discharge  system)  are  separated  by  sufficient 
distance  to  prevent  recirculation  of  the  discharge  warm  water  back  to  the  intake  and  loss  of 
efficiency.  For  the  PSEG  Site,  the  Delaware  River  would  be  the  source  of  cooling  water.  There 
is  no  consumptive  loss  in  a  once-through  heat  dissipation  system;  however,  the  elevated 
temperature  of  the  discharge  would  result  in  induced  evaporative  loss  from  the  water  source. 
Once-through  systems  typically  require  a  large  amount  of  circulating  water  and.  therefore,  have 
the  potential  for  hydrologic  alterations  to  the  water  source  and  may  cause  higher  levels  of 
impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  organisms.  A  once-through  cooling  system  for  a 
2,200-MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  require  a  circulating  water  flow  of 
1 .7  to  2.1  million  gpm. 

The  review  team  has  determined,  based  on  a  review  of  EPA  316(b)  Phase  I  regulations 
(EPA  2001-TN2384),  that  a  once-through  cooling  system  for  new  nuclear  reactors  is  not  likely  to 
be  permitted  in  the  future  except  in  rare  situations.  The  review  team  also  has  determined  a 
once-through  heat  dissipation  system  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  proposed  system  because  of  the  impacts  (1)  from  building  large  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  (2)  from  requiring  large  amounts  of  water  to  be  withdrawn,  and  (3)  to  the 
aquatic  ecosystem  caused  by  potential  impingement  and  entrainment. 

9. 4. 1.2  Cooling  Ponds  and  Spray  Ponds 

A  heat  dissipation  system  using  cooling  ponds  circulates  water  in  a  human-made  pond  where 
waste  heat  is  transferred  to  the  atmosphere  primarily  via  evaporation  and,  to  a  limited  extent, 
through  radiation  and  conduction.  Spray  ponds  are  cooling  ponds  that  use  sprays  to  augment 
evaporative  cooling  by  providing  greater  contact  area  with  air  over  the  pond.  Because  of  the 
spraying  of  cooling  water  into  the  air,  the  area  required  can  be  substantially  smaller  than  a 
cooling  pond  that  does  not  use  sprays.  Generally,  cooling  ponds  and  spray  ponds  are  closed- 
cycle  systems  isolated  from  natural  water  bodies;  they  require  makeup  water  from  an  external 
source  and  occasionally  discharge  water  to  a  receiving  water  body  to  control  concentration  of 
dissolved  solids.  The  makeup  water  source  is  not  the  heat  sink  for  these  designs. 

While  cooling  ponds  and  spray  ponds  would  avoid  the  building  and  operating  expense  of 
cooling  towers,  they  would  require  substantial  land  area.  Because  of  this  land-use  requirement, 
the  review  team  determined  a  heat  dissipation  system  using  cooling  ponds  or  spray  ponds 
would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  a  closed-loop  heat  dissipation  system  for  the  PSEG 
Site.

9.4. 1.3  Dry  Cooling  Towers 

A  heat  dissipation  system  using  dry  cooling  towers  directly  rejects  waste  heat  to  the  atmosphere 
without  using  water  for  evaporative  cooling.  Waste  heat  is  transferred  to  the  air  using 
conduction  and  convection;  therefore,  the  heat  exchange  depends  on  the  temperature  of  the 
ambient  air  and  thermal  properties  of  the  piping  within  the  cooling  tower.  NDCTs  or  MDCTs  can 
be  used  for  dry  cooling.  The  most  common  dry  cooling  tower  cools  the  steam  from  turbine 
exhaust  by  piping  it  through  large  ducts  to  an  air-cooled  condenser  located  next  to  the  turbine 
building.  Air  is  blown  over  the  cooling  coils  to  cool  the  steam  and  condense  it  to  water,  which  is 
returned  for  recirculation. 

Dry  cooling  towers  would  reduce  or  eliminate  water-related  impacts  of  the  heat  dissipation 
system  because  no  makeup  water  or  blowdown  discharge  would  be  required.  However,  dry 
cooling  systems  typically  require  much  larger  cooling  systems,  result  in  some  loss  of  steam 
turbine  efficiency  because  the  approach  temperature  is  limited  by  the  dry-bulb  temperature 
rather  than  the  lower  wet-bulb  temperature,  and  result  in  parasitic  energy  drain  if  a  large  array  of 
fans  is  used  for  forced  draft  in  dry  MDCTs.  Because  the  review  team  has  determined  in 
Sections  4.2  and  5.2  that  water-use  impacts  from  construction  and  operation  of  a  wet 
closed-loop  heat  dissipation  system  would  be  SMALL,  and  even  though  a  dry  cooling  system 
would  eliminate  water-use  impacts,  a  dry  cooling  system  is  not  environmentally  preferable  to  the 
proposed  system. 

9. 4. 1.4  Combination  Wet-Dry  Cooling  Tower  System 

A  heat  dissipation  system  using  a  combination  wet-dry  cooling  tower  system  uses  cooling 
towers  that  have  both  a  wet  and  a  dry  section.  Depending  on  ambient  air  temperature  and 
relative  humidity,  the  wet-dry  cooling  tower  system  could  be  run  in  fully  wet  or  fully  dry  mode. 
Consumptive  water  use  is  maximized  when  the  system  is  running  in  fully  wet  mode  and  is 
minimized  or  eliminated  when  operating  in  fully  dry  mode.  The  reduction  in  consumptive  water 
use  and  blowdown  depend  on  the  duration  for  which  the  dry  mode  is  active.  As  with  the  dry 
cooling  towers,  the  dry  portion  of  the  cooling  system  is  not  as  efficient  as  the  wet  portion  and 
requires  parasitic  energy  to  move  large  amounts  of  cooling  air  through  the  heat  exchangers. 
Because  the  wet-dry  cooling  tower  has  a  dry  section,  land-use  requirements  are  increased. 

Because  the  review  team  has  determined  in  Chapters  4  and  5  that  water-use  impacts  from 
construction  and  operation  of  a  wet  closed-loop  heat  dissipation  system  would  be  SMALL,  and 
even  though  a  wet-dry  cooling  system  would  reduce  water-use  impacts,  a  wet-dry  cooling 
system  is  not  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  system. 

9.4.2  Circulating  Water  System  Alternatives 

The  review  team  evaluated  alternatives  to  the  proposed  intake  and  discharge  systems  for  the 
proposed  cooling  system.  In  this  evaluation,  the  review  team  used  the  water  requirements  of 
the  heat  dissipation  system,  which  define  the  capacity  requirements  of  the  intake  and  discharge 
systems.  Because  the  final  reactor  design  has  not  been  chosen  at  this  stage,  several  options 
exist  for  the  closed-loop  heat  dissipation  system  for  the  PSEG  Site,  including  wet  MDCTs, 
NDCTs,  and  fan-assisted  NDCTs.  The  makeup  water  for  the  closed-cycle  heat  dissipation

system  would  be  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  via  a  new  intake  system,  and  the 
blowdown  from  the  cooling  tower  basins  would  be  discharged  to  the  Delaware  River  via  a  new 
discharge  system.  The  review  team  evaluated  alternative  water  supply  sources  for  the  normal 
heat  sink. 

9. 4. 2. 1  Intake  Alternatives 

The  proposed  intake  system  is  described  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 2  and  would  consist  of  a  1 10-ft  by 
200-ft  intake  structure  on  the  Delaware  River  with  a  bar  rack  and  trash  rake  to  prevent  debris 
from  entering  the  structure  and  a  traveling  screen  to  keep  smaller  debris  and  fish  out  of  the 
intake  bays.  As  stated  in  Sections  4.2  and  5.2,  the  impacts  from  construction  and  operation  of 
the  intake  system  on  water  use  and  water  quality  of  the  resource  would  be  SMALL;  however, 
the  review  team  considered  alternatives  to  the  proposed  intake  system  including  a  radial 
collector  well  system,  an  intake  pipe,  an  intake  canal,  and  modifications  to  the  existing  HCGS 
service  water  intake  system. 

Radial  Collector  Wells 

The  review  team  considered  a  radial  collector  well  system  as  an  intake  alternative  because 
such  an  intake  system  reduces  the  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  by  reducing  or  eliminating 
impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  organisms.  A  radial  collector  well  system  also  can 
reduce  water  treatment  requirements  when  the  water  source  is  turbid. 

A  radial  collector  well  system  is  composed  of  a  central  shaft  that  acts  as  the  collector  and  has 
lateral  well  screens  that  project  radially  from  the  central  shaft.  The  lateral  well  screens  typically 
extend  below  a  surface-water  source  and  slowly  withdraw  surface  water  through  substrate 
sediments,  thereby  filtering  out  some  of  the  suspended  sediment  present  in  the  surface  water. 
The  soil  properties  along  the  shoreline  of  the  Delaware  River  on  the  Artificial  Island  would 
support  a  well  production  capacity  of  about  3,500  gpm.  Because  the  makeup  water  withdrawal 
for  the  proposed  heat  dissipation  system  is  an  average  of  78,196  gpm  with  a  maximum  of 
80,600  gpm,  the  review  team  determined  23  wells  would  be  needed  to  withdraw  the  required 
makeup  water  from  the  Delaware  River. 

Spacing  between  the  collector  wells  is  determined  by  several  factors,  including  consideration  of 
limiting  drawdown  in  individual  wells.  In  general,  spacing  between  collector  wells  could  be 
1 ,500  ft  or  more.  With  a  1 ,500-ft  spacing,  installation  of  23  wells  would  require  a  shoreline 
length  of  more  than  6  mi.  The  Delaware  River  shoreline  along  the  Artificial  Island,  including  the 
built-up  areas  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  is  less  than  4  mi.  Building  the  radial  collector  well  system 
would  affect  23  locations  along  the  shoreline.  The  radial  collector  arms  of  the  collector  wells 
can  get  plugged  with  sediment  over  time  and  require  backflushing. 

The  cooling  system  for  the  PSEG  Site  also  could  require  a  safety-related  intake,  which  would 
need  to  be  highly  reliable  and  continuously  operational.  Because  of  limited  availability  of 
shoreline  to  install  the  radial  collector  well  system,  the  high  reliability  requirement  of  a  safety- 
related  intake,  a  potential  for  substantial  building  impacts  at  multiple  well  locations  along  the 
Delaware  River  shoreline,  and  the  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  intake  system 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


being  SMALL  (see  Sections  4.2  and  5.2),  the  review  team  has  determined  that  a  radial  collector 
well  system  would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  intake  system. 

Intake  Pipe 

The  review  team  considered  an  intake  pipe  that  would  connect  the  forebay  of  the  intake 
structure  to  the  intake  point  located  a  significant  distance  offshore  in  deeper  waters  because 
such  an  intake  system  has  the  potential  to  reduce  the  impacts  on  aquatic  organisms  by  placing 
the  intake  point  in  less  productive  habitat. 

The  intake  pipe  connecting  the  forebay  of  the  intake  structure  to  the  intake  point  would  be  a 
reinforced  concrete  pipe  placed  on  a  crushed  stone  bedding  in  a  dredged  area  along  the  pipe  in 
the  Delaware  River.  The  pipe  would  also  be  protected  with  riprap  or  armoring.  The  pipe  would 
be  designed  to  balance  flow  velocities  to  minimize  sediment  deposition  within  the  pipe,  which 
requires  a  relatively  higher  flow,  and  to  minimize  impacts  to  aquatic  life,  which  requires  lower 
flows.  The  pipe  would  be  designed  with  a  velocity  cap  or  an  array  of  wedge  wire  screens.  Two 
coal-fired  plants  along  the  Delaware  River  use  intake  pipes  with  wedge  wire  screens,  but  these 
systems  are  located  in  deeper  waters  in  a  freshwater  portion  near  the  transition  zone.  Some 
power  plant  cooling  water  intakes  use  wedge  wire  screens  effectively,  but  no  power  plants  with 
intake  flows  exceeding  100  Mgd  have  installed  these  screens  (EPA  2001-TN2384).  The 
makeup  water  withdrawal  for  the  proposed  heat  dissipation  system  is  an  average  of  78,196  gpm 
(about  113  Mgd)  with  a  maximum  of  80,600  gpm  (about  116  Mgd).  Near  the  PSEG  Site,  where 
the  Delaware  River  flow  is  dominated  by  tidal  fluctuations  and  biofouling  is  a  significant  concern, 
frequent  cleaning  of  wedge  wire  screens  may  become  necessary  (EPA  2001-TN2384). 
Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  that  an  intake  pipe  with  a  velocity  cap  may  be  preferable 
to  one  with  wedge  wire  screens. 

The  intake  pipe  would  require  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  and  building  activity  along  the 
pipe  that  may  affect  aquatic  resources.  There  is  no  significant  difference  between  the  impacts 
on  aquatic  resources  during  operations  of  the  intake  pipe  and  those  of  the  proposed  intake 
system  because  both  would  be  equipped  with  measures  protective  of  aquatic  organisms. 
Because  the  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  intake  system  would  be 
SMALL  (see  Sections  4.2  and  5.2)  and  the  intake  pipe  would  not  result  in  any  significant 
difference  compared  to  the  proposed  intake  system,  the  review  team  determined  an  intake  pipe 
would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  intake  system. 

Intake  Canal 

The  review  team  considered  an  intake  canal  connected  to  the  Delaware  River  on  which  an 
intake  structure  could  be  located.  The  intake  structure  would  still  be  required  to  meet  the 
regulatory  requirements  of  the  CWA  316(b)  rule  for  protection  of  aquatic  resources.  The  intake 
canal  would  result  in  greater  land  use  and  could  also  result  in  favorable  habitat  conditions  for 
aquatic  life  over  time.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  an  intake  canal  would  not  provide 
significant  advantages  compared  to  the  proposed  intake  system,  and  because  the  impacts  of 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  intake  system  would  be  SMALL  (see  Sections  4.2 
and  5.2),  an  intake  canal  would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  intake 
system.

Hope  Creek  Service  Water  Intake  System 

The  review  team  considered  modifications  to  the  existing  HCGS  service  water  intake  system 
(SWIS)  as  an  alternative  to  the  proposed  intake  system  because  the  SWIS  has  empty  bays  that 
were  intended  for  the  use  of  the  cancelled  HCGS  Unit  2,  and  using  this  existing  facility,  if 
feasible,  would  reduce  impacts  from  construction  of  a  new  intake  system. 

There  are  two  empty  bays  in  the  HCGS  SWIS.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  require  up  to  80,600  gpm  of  water  withdrawal  from  the  Delaware  River.  To  withdraw  the 
required  water  using  the  two  existing  empty  bays,  the  through-screen  velocity  would  exceed  the 
CWA  316(b)  requirement  of  0.5  fps.  It  may  be  feasible  to  expand  the  HCGS  SWIS,  but  the 
related  activities  may  interfere  with  operation  of  HCGS.  New  intake  piping  from  HCGS  SWIS 
would  need  to  be  routed  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  may  interfere  with  HCGS  facilities. 

Because  the  HCGS  SWIS  would  need  to  be  expanded  to  meet  the  CWA  316(b)  requirements, 
the  review  team  concluded  this  alternative  to  the  proposed  intake  structure  would  not  result  in 
substantial  reduction  of  impacts  from  construction  and,  therefore,  this  alternative  would  not  be 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  intake  system. 

9. 4. 2. 2  Discharge  Alternatives 

The  discharge  system  is  described  in  Chapter  3.  As  stated  in  Chapters  4  and  5,  the  impacts 
from  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  discharge  system  on  the  environment  would 
be  SMALL;  however,  the  review  team  considered  alternatives  to  the  proposed  discharge  system 
including  design  modifications  to  the  proposed  system  and  alternative  locations  for  the 
discharge  pipeline. 

Because  the  impacts  from  operation  of  the  proposed  discharge  system  on  the  environment 
would  be  SMALL  (see  Section  5.2),  design  modifications  such  as  multi-port  diffusors,  controlled 
velocity  of  discharge,  and  deeper  location  of  the  discharge  points  would  not  result  in  significant 
reduction  in  impacts  on  the  environment.  Therefore,  the  review  team  determined  the  alternative 
design  modifications  would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  design. 

Alternative  locations  for  the  discharge  pipeline  on  the  PSEG  Site  south  of  the  proposed  location 
of  the  discharge  pipeline  are  limited  because  of  built-up  areas  of  SGS  and  HCGS.  An 
alternative  location  is  possible  east  of  the  SGS  circulating  water  intake  structure  (CWIS). 
However,  the  discharge  pipeline  from  the  PSEG  Site  would  need  to  be  routed  to  this  location, 
increasing  land  use  and  potential  for  interference  with  the  SGS  and  HCGS  facilities.  The 
Delaware  River  is  shallow  at  this  location,  limiting  efficient  mixing  of  the  discharge  effluent  with 
the  waters  of  the  river.  The  discharge  pipeline  would  have  to  be  routed  into  the  deeper  portion 
of  the  Delaware  River.  For  these  reasons,  the  review  team  determined  an  alternative  discharge 
location  east  of  the  SGS  CWIS  would  not  result  in  significant  reduction  in  impacts  to  the 
environment  and,  therefore,  would  not  be  environmentally  preferable. 

Another  alternative  location  for  the  discharge  pipeline  would  be  north  of  the  proposed  location 
and  potentially  as  far  north  as  the  tip  of  Artificial  Island.  However,  because  the  pipeline  would 
need  to  be  longer  to  reach  the  shoreline  and  would  also  need  to  be  routed  out  in  the  Delaware 
River  to  deeper  waters  to  promote  efficient  mixing,  the  construction  impacts  would  be  greater 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


than  those  for  a  discharge  pipeline  at  the  proposed  location.  Therefore,  the  review  team 
determined  an  alternative  discharge  location  north  of  the  proposed  location  would  not  result  in 
significant  reduction  in  impacts  to  the  environment  and,  therefore,  would  not  be  environmentally 
preferable. 

9. 4. 2. 3  Water  Supplies 

The  proposed  source  of  makeup  water  to  the  PSEG  Site  CWS  and  SWS  is  the  Delaware  River. 
Makeup  water  would  be  withdrawn  using  a  new  shoreline  intake  structure.  Because  the 
Delaware  River  water  quality  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  influenced  by  tidal  action,  the  makeup  water 
withdrawn  would  be  brackish. 

The  makeup  water  withdrawal  for  the  proposed  heat  dissipation  system  would  be  an  average  of 
78,196  gpm,  with  a  maximum  of  80,600  gpm.  The  mean  annual  discharge  at  Trenton,  New 
Jersey,  is  12,004  cfs,  and  the  mean  tidal  discharge  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  estimated  to  be 
400,000  to  472,000  cfs  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  No  surface  water  would  be  used  during  building 
of  the  PSEG  Site,  and  therefore,  the  review  team  determined  there  would  be  no  impact  to  the 
surface-water  resource  from  building  activities  (see  Section  4.2).  The  review  team  also 
determined  that  the  surface-water  use  to  support  the  operations  of  the  PSEG  Site  would  not 
result  in  a  noticeable  impact  to  the  surface-water  resource  (see  Section  5.2). 

Even  though  the  impact  on  the  surface-water  resource  from  the  building  and  operation  of  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  SMALL  as  stated  in  Sections  4.2  and  5.2,  the  review  team  considered 
alternatives  to  the  makeup  water  supply  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River.  The  review 
team  considered  alternative  water  supplies  from  groundwater,  surface  waters  from  streams  and 
rivers  other  than  the  Delaware  River,  and  municipal  wastewater  from  nearby  communities.  The 
review  team’s  evaluation  of  these  alternative  water  supply  sources  is  described  below. 

Groundwater 

As  stated  above,  the  makeup  water  requirements  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  an  average  of 
78,196  gpm  and  a  maximum  of  80,600  gpm.  A  groundwater  source  would  need  to  support  a 
sustained  yield  of  78,196  gpm  and  a  short-term  maximum  yield  of  80,600  gpm  to  be  a  viable 
alternative  to  the  proposed  water  supply. 

The  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  is  designated  a  sole-source  aquifer  by  EPA  (2010- 
TN2385).  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  within  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain  aquifer  but  is  not 
subject  to  groundwater  withdrawal  limitations  of  the  two  Critical  Water  Supply  Management 
Areas  identified  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  Several  hydrogeologic  units  underlie  the  PSEG 
Site,  including  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel  Formation  and  the  PRM  aquifer  system.  During 
building  of  the  PSEG  Site,  groundwater  would  be  withdrawn  from  four  production  wells  finished 
in  the  PRM  aquifer  system,  with  two  backup  wells  finished  in  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel 
aquifer.  The  groundwater  withdrawal  during  building  activities  would  be  1 19  gpm.  Groundwater 
would  be  withdrawn  from  the  PRM  aquifer  system  to  support  demineralized  makeup  water  and 
sanitary  and  potable  water  uses  for  the  PSEG  Site  during  operations.  The  groundwater 
withdrawal  during  operations  would  average  210  gpm  with  a  short-term  maximum  of  953  gpm. 

The  total  combined  amount  of  water  required  during  operation  would  be  about  78,196  gpm. 
Groundwater  could  not  be  relied  upon  to  provide  this  quantity  of  water  on  a  sustained  basis

without  impacting  the  availability  and  quality  of  the  groundwater  resources  in  the  area.  For  the 
period  1978-2003.  the  reported  average  groundwater  pumping  from  the  Wenonah-Mount  Laurel 
aquifer  through  the  entire  PRM  aquifer  system  of  the  Coastal  Plain  within  the  southern  counties 
of  New  Jersey  ranged  from  106.1  to  161.7  Mgd  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948).  As  discussed  in 
Section  2.3.  current  groundwater  use  from  these  aquifers  has  been  restricted  by  the  State  due 
to  drawdown  of  water  levels  and  increases  in  salinity  caused  by  induced  flow  from  the  Delaware 
River  and  more  saline  portions  of  the  aquifers.  Obtaining  all  water  required  for  site  operations 
from  groundwater  would  nearly  double  the  total  water  use  from  these  aquifers  in  southern  New 
Jersey.  This  would  create  even  greater  issues  related  to  drawdown  and  reduction  of  water 
quality  and  is  very  unlikely  to  be  permitted  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 

Surface  Water  from  Streams  and  Rivers  Other  than  the  Delaware  River 

The  review  team  considered  streams  and  rivers  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  a  potential  source  of 
surface  water  for  makeup  water  needs  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  stated  above,  this  alternative 
water  supply  source  would  need  to  support  an  average  withdrawal  of  78.196  gpm  and  a 
short-term  maximum  withdrawal  of  80.600  gpm  to  be  viable. 

There  are  several  creeks  and  coastal  streams  near  the  PSEG  Site,  but  most  have  minor 
streamflows.  There  are  no  USGS  streamflow  gages  on  Mill  Creek.  Alloway  Creek.  Hope  Creek. 
Fishing  Creek,  and  Mad  Horse  Creek,  and  therefore,  no  quantitative  assessment  regarding  their 
suitability  can  be  made.  The  Salem  River,  located  northeast  of  the  PSEG  Site,  does  have  a 
streamflow  gage.  Streamflow  measurements  between  1943  and  201 1  at  the  Salem  River 
USGS  gage  at  Woodstown.  New  Jersey,  show  that  annual  streamflow  varies  from  5.7  to 
34.9  cfs  (2.558  to  1 5.664  gpm)  with  a  mean  annual  flow  of  20  cfs  (8.977  gpm).  Because  the 
makeup  water  requirement  of  the  PSEG  Site  far  exceeds  the  mean  annual  flow  of  Salem  River, 
the  review  team  concluded  that  surface  water  from  streams  and  rivers  other  than  the  Delaware 
River  would  not  be  a  viable  alternative. 

Municipal  Wastewater 

The  review  considered  municipal  wastewater  that  could  be  reused  to  provide  makeup  water  to 
the  CWS  and  SWS  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  stated  above,  this  alternative  water  supply  source 
would  need  to  support  an  average  withdrawal  of  78.196  gpm  and  a  short-term  maximum 
withdrawal  of  80.600  gpm  to  be  viable. 

According  to  USGS.  water  withdrawals  in  Salem  County.  New  Jersey,  in  2005  were  27.3  Mgd 
(18.951  gpm)  from  both  freshwater  and  groundwater  sources  (USGS  2013-TN2387).  Although 
the  USGS  assessment  is  titled  Estimated  Water  Use  in  the  United  States  in  2005.  the  report 
contains  estimated  water  withdrawals  by  category,  not  consumptive  water  use 
(Kenny  et  al.  2009-TN2386;  USGS  2013-TN2387).  The  corresponding  water  withdrawals  for 
neighboring  Gloucester  and  Cumberland  Counties  were  75  and  58.1  Mgd  (52.090  and 
40,333  gpm),  respectively.  Because  these  are  water  withdrawals,  significant  portions  of  these 
withdrawals  are  consumptively  used,  and  the  remaining  are  available  as  municipal  or  industrial 
wastewater  or  irrigation  return  flows.  The  combined  water  withdrawal  for  the  three  counties  in 
2005  was  about  1 1 1 ,374  gpm.  and  therefore,  nearly  70  percent  of  this  withdrawal  would  need  to 
be  available  as  wastewater  and  return  flows  to  make  water  reuse  viable  for  the  makeup  water 
requirements  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  the  consumptive  fraction  of  water  withdrawn  can  be 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives 


high  for  potable,  irrigation,  and  power-generation  use,  return  flows  from  these  uses  would  be 
relatively  small,  and  consequently  a  return  flow  fraction  of  70  percent  is  unlikely.  Therefore,  it  is 
reasonable  to  conclude  the  three  counties  combined  would  not  be  able  to  supply  adequate 
return  water  for  reuse  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Moreover,  the  location  of  these  wastewater  and  return 
flows  would  be  scattered  over  the  geographical  area  of  the  three  counties  and,  therefore,  would 
need  to  be  aggregated  and  conveyed  to  the  PSEG  Site,  which  would  result  in  additional  land- 
use  and  environmental  impacts.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concluded  that  municipal 
wastewater  is  not  a  viable  or  environmentally  preferable  alternative  to  the  proposed  makeup 
water  source  for  the  PSEG  Site. 

9. 4. 2. 4  Water  Treatment 

As  described  in  Section  3. 2. 1.2,  the  hard  and  brackish  surface  water  withdrawn  from  the 
Delaware  River  for  the  CWS  and  SWS  makeup  water  needs  of  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  treated. 
The  CWS  makeup  water  would  be  treated  with  sulfuric  acid  to  control  calcite  scale  formation 
and  would  be  chlorinated  to  control  microbial  growth.  The  SWS  makeup  water  would  be 
clarified  using  polyelectrolytes  and  treated  with  sulfuric  acid  and  sodium  hypochlorite  to  control 
scaling  and  biofouling,  respectively.  Before  discharge,  the  CWS  and  SWS  blowdown  would  be 
treated  with  sodium  bisulfite  or  equivalent  to  control  residual  chlorine.  Plant  makeup  water  for 
the  potable  and  sanitary  water  system,  demineralized  water  distribution  system,  fire  protection 
system,  and  other  miscellaneous  uses  would  be  withdrawn  from  the  aquifer  and  would  not  be 
treated  except  for  chlorination  for  the  potable  and  sanitary  water  system.  Makeup  water  for  the 
demineralized  water  distribution  system  would  use  a  demineralizer  system  such  as  reverse 
osmosis. 

The  review  team  did  not  identify  any  other  environmentally  preferable  alternative  to  the 
proposed  chemicals  to  be  used.  The  effluents  from  cooling  tower  blowdown  are  specifically 
regulated  by  EPA  under  40  CFR  Part  423  (TN253). 

9.4.3  Summary 

The  review  team  considered  alternative  system  designs  that  included  evaluation  of  four 
alternatives  to  the  proposed  heat  dissipation  system,  as  well  as  alternatives  to  the  proposed 
intake  system,  the  proposed  discharge  system,  the  proposed  water  supply,  and  the  proposed 
water  treatment  system.  As  described  above,  the  review  team  did  not  identify  any  alternatives 
to  the  proposed  plant  system  designs  that  would  be  environmentally  preferable.

10.0  CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 


This  chapter  provides  a  discussion  of  the  conclusions  reached  in  earlier  parts  of  this 
environmental  impact  statement  (EIS),  as  well  as  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC) 
staff  recommendations.  Section  10.1  summarizes  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 

Section  10.2  discusses  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and 
summarizes  those  impacts  in  accompanying  tables,  and  Section  10.3  discusses  the  relationship 
between  the  short-term  use  of  resources  and  the  long-term  productivity  of  the  human 
environment.  Section  10.4  summarizes  the  irretrievable  and  irreversible  use  of  resources,  and 
Section  10.5  summarizes  the  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action.  Section  10.6  discusses 
benefits  and  costs,  and  Section  10.7  presents  the  NRC  staff  recommendation. 

The  NRC  received  an  application  from  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear.  LLC  (PSEG), 
for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  for  a  site  to  be  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek 
Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  proposed  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern 
part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River,  about  1 5  mi  south  of  the 
Delaware  Memorial  Bridge;  18  mi  south  of  Wilmington,  Delaware;  30  mi  southwest  of 
Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania;  and  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey.  The  ESP  does  not 
authorize  construction  or  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  and  therefore  these  impacts  will  not 
occur  without  subsequent  authorization.  The  ESP  resolves  certain  issues  associated  with  siting 
a  nuclear  plant.  To  resolve  environmental  issues  at  the  ESP  stage,  the  NRC  analyzes  the 
impacts  as  if  a  nuclear  plant  were  to  be  built  and  operated. 

As  part  of  the  permitting  process  for  the  use  of  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  plans  to  submit 
an  application  to  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  Philadelphia  District  and  the  New 
Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  for  activities  associated  with  the 
alteration  of  any  floodplain,  waterway,  tidal  wetland,  or  nontidal  wetland  in  New  Jersey. 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1 )  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  (2)  the  USACE  issuance  of  a  permit  to  perform  certain  construction  activities 
on  the  site  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (also  referred  to 
as  the  Clean  Water  Act  [CWA])  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662),  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers 
and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660). 

If  issued,  the  Department  of  the  Army  (DA)  permit  would  authorize  the  impact  on  waters  of  the 
United  States,  including  wetlands,  from  various  regulated  activities  associated  with  the  project. 
The  permit  would  include  special  conditions  to  the  effect  that  PSEG  must  confirm  that  any 
wetland  compensation  efforts  have  achieved  their  established  goals  and  requirements  in 
accordance  with  “Compensatory  Mitigation  for  Losses  of  Aquatic  Resources;"  Final  Rule 
(73  FR  19594-TN1789];  Title  33  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  [CFR]  Parts  325  [TN425] 
and  332  [TN1472]). 

The  USACE  approach  is  that  compensation  may  only  be  used  after  all  appropriate  and  practical 
steps  to  avoid  and  minimize  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  resources,  including  wetlands  and

streams,  have  been  taken.  The  DA  permit  would  be  conditioned  upon  PSEG  completing  all 
necessary  mitigation  and  compensation  and  assuming  responsibility  for  continued  success. 

Section  102  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended  (NEPA,  42  USC 
4321  et  seq.  -TN661),  directs  that  an  EIS  is  required  for  major  Federal  actions  that  significantly 
affect  the  quality  of  the  human  environment.  Section  1 02(2)(C)  of  NEPA  requires  that  an  EIS 
include  information  about  the  following: 

•  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 

•  any  adverse  environmental  effects  that  cannot  be  avoided  should  the  proposal  be 
implemented, 

•  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action, 

•  the  relationship  between  local  short-term  uses  of  the  environment  and  the  maintenance  and 
enhancement  of  long-term  productivity,  and 

•  any  irreversible  and  irretrievable  commitments  of  resources  that  would  be  involved  if  the 
proposed  action  were  implemented. 

The  NRC  has  set  forth  regulations  for  implementing  NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  in 
10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250).  Subpart  A  of  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251)  contains  the  NRC  regulations 
related  to  ESPs.  As  set  forth  in  1 0  CFR  51.18  (TN250),  the  Commission  determined  that  the 
issuance  of  an  ESP  is  an  action  that  requires  an  EIS. 

The  environmental  review  described  in  this  EIS  was  conducted  by  a  joint  NRC-USACE  team. 
The  review  team  consisted  of  the  NRC  staff;  the  NRC  contractor  staff  at  Oak  Ridge  National 
Laboratory,  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  and  Pacific 
Northwest  National  Laboratory;  and  the  USACE  staff.  Included  in  this  EIS  are  (1)  the  results  of 
the  review  team  preliminary  analyses,  which  consider  and  weigh  the  environmental  effects  of 
the  proposed  actions;  (2)  the  mitigation  measures  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  effects; 

(3)  the  environmental  impacts  of  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action;  and  (4)  the  NRC  staff 
preliminary  recommendation  regarding  the  proposed  action  based  on  its  environmental  review. 

During  the  course  of  preparing  this  EIS,  the  review  team  reviewed  the  PSEG  Environmental 
Report  (ER;  PSEG  2015-TN4280),  the  PSEG  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283),  and  supplemental  documentation  from  PSEG  in  response  to  requests  from  the  NRC 
and  USACE  staffs  for  additional  information.  The  review  team  consulted  with  Federal,  State, 
Tribal,  and  local  agencies  and  followed  the  guidance  set  forth  in  Regulatory  Guide  4.2, 

Revision  2  (NRC  1976-TN89),  in  NUREG-1555,  Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan — 
Standard  Review  Plans  for  Environmental  Reviews  for  Nuclear  Power  Plants  (NRC  2000- 
TN614),  and  in  NUREG-0800,  Standard  Review  Plan  for  the  Review  of  Safety  Analysis  Reports 
for  Nuclear  Power  Plants  (NRC  2007-TN61 3).  The  review  team  also  followed  guidance 
provided  in  Interim  Staff  Guidance  on  Environmental  Issues  Associated  with  New  Reactors 
(NRC  2014-TN3767). 

The  NRC  staff  also  considered  the  public  comments  related  to  the  environmental  review 
received  during  the  scoping  process.  These  comments  are  provided  in  Appendix  D  of  this  EIS.

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


The  USACE  role  as  a  cooperating  agency  in  the  preparation  of  this  EIS  is  to  ensure  to  the 
maximum  extent  practicable  that  the  information  presented  is  adequate  to  fulfill  the 
requirements  of  the  USACE  regulations.  Section  404(b)(1)  of  the  CWA,  “Guidelines  for 
Specification  of  Disposal  Sites  for  Dredged  or  Fill  Material”  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427),  contains 
the  substantive  environmental  criteria  used  by  the  USACE  in  evaluating  discharges  of  dredged 
or  fill  material  into  waters  of  the  United  States.  Although  the  USACE,  as  part  of  the  review 
team,  concurs  with  the  designation  of  impact  levels  for  terrestrial  and  aquatic  resources,  insofar 
as  waters  of  the  United  States  are  concerned,  the  USACE  must  conduct  a  quantitative 
comparison  of  impacts  on  waters  of  the  United  States  as  part  of  the  404(b)(1)  evaluation.  In 
addition,  the  USACE  regulations  (33  CFR  320.4  [TN424])  direct  the  USACE  to  conduct  a  public 
interest  review  (PIR)  that  requires  consideration  of  a  number  of  factors  as  part  of  a  balanced 
evaluation  process.  The  USACE  PIR  and  404(b)(1)  evaluation  will  be  part  of  the  USACE  permit 
decision  document,  and  such  factors  may  not  be  fully  addressed  in  this  EIS.  The  USACE 
independent  regulatory  permit  decision  documentation  will  reference  relevant  analyses  from  the 
EIS  and,  as  necessary,  include  a  supplemental  PIR,  CWA  404(b)(1)  evaluation,  evaluation  of 
cumulative  impacts,  compensatory  mitigation  plan  that  is  in  accordance  with  33  CFR  Part  332 
(TNI 472),  “Compensatory  Mitigation  for  Losses  of  Aquatic  Resources,”  and  other  information 
and  evaluations  that  may  be  outside  the  NRC  scope  of  analysis  and  not  included  in  this  EIS  but 
are  required  by  the  USACE  to  support  the  USACE  permit  decision.  The  USACE  permit  decision 
will  be  made  following  issuance  of  the  final  EIS. 

Environmental  issues  are  evaluated  in  this  EIS  using  the  three-level  standard  of  significance — 
SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE — developed  by  the  NRC  using  guidelines  from  the  Council  on 
Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  (40  CFR  1508.27  [TN428]).  Table  B-1  of  10  CFR  Part  51, 

Subpart  A,  Appendix  B  (TN250),  provides  the  following  definitions  of  the  three  significance 
levels: 


SMALL  -  Environmental  effects  are  not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that  they  will 
neither  destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute  of  the  resource. 

MODERATE  -  Environmental  effects  are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  to 
destabilize,  important  attributes  of  the  resource. 

LARGE  -  Environmental  effects  are  clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to 
destabilize  important  attributes  of  the  resource. 

Mitigation  measures  were  considered  for  each  environmental  issue  and  are  discussed  in  the 
appropriate  sections.  During  the  environmental  review,  the  review  team  considered  planned 
activities  and  actions  that  PSEG  indicates  it  and  others  would  likely  take  should  PSEG  receive 
the  requested  ESP.  In  addition,  PSEG  provided  estimates  of  the  environmental  impacts 
resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG 
Site. 

10.1  Impacts  of  the  Proposed  Action 

In  a  final  rule  dated  October  9,  2007  (72  FR  57416-TN260),  the  Commission  limited  the 
definition  of  "construction”  to  those  activities  that  fall  within  its  regulatory  authority  in

NUREG-2168 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


10  CFR  51 .4  (TN250).  Many  of  the  activities  required  to  build  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  not  part 
of  the  NRC  action  to  license  the  plant.  Activities  associated  with  building  the  plant  that  are  not 
within  the  purview  of  the  NRC  action  are  grouped  under  the  term  “preconstruction.” 
Preconstruction  activities  include  clearing  and  grading,  excavating,  erection  of  support  buildings 
and  transmission  lines,  and  other  associated  activities.  Because  the  preconstruction  activities 
are  not  part  of  the  NRC  action,  their  impacts  are  not  reviewed  as  a  direct  effect  of  the  NRC 
action.  Rather,  the  impacts  of  the  preconstruction  activities  are  considered  in  the  context  of 
cumulative  impacts.  In  addition,  certain  activities  defined  as  preconstruction  by  the  NRC  require 
authorization  from  the  USACE  and  other  Federal,  State,  and  local  agencies. 

Chapter  4  of  this  EIS  describes  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  impacts  of  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities  associated  with  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and 
a  summary  of  those  impacts  is  given  in  Section  4.12,  Table  4-22.  Impacts  associated  with 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  discussed  in  Chapter  5,  and  are 
summarized  in  Section  5.13,  Table  5-33.  Chapter  6  describes  the  impacts  associated  with  the 
fuel  cycle,  transportation,  and  decommissioning.  Chapter  7  describes  the  cumulative  impacts 
associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  when  considered  along  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  projects  in  the  geographic  region  around  the  site.  Chapter  9  includes  the 
review  team  review  of  alternative  sites  and  alternative  power  generation  systems. 

10.2  Unavoidable  Adverse  Environmental  Impacts 

NEPA  Section  102(2)(C)(ii)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  requires  that  an  EIS  include 
information  on  any  adverse  environmental  effects  that  cannot  be  avoided  should  the  proposal 
be  implemented.  Unavoidable  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  those  potential  impacts  of 
the  NRC  action  and  the  USACE  action  that  cannot  be  avoided  and  for  which  no  practical  means 
of  mitigation  are  available. 

10.2.1  Unavoidable  Adverse  Impacts  during  Construction  and  Preconstruction 

Chapter  4  discusses  in  detail  the  potential  impacts  from  construction  and  preconstruction  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  presents  mitigation  and  controls  intended  to 
lessen  the  adverse  impacts.  Table  10-1  presents  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  associated 
with  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  to  each  of  the  resource  areas  evaluated  in  this 
EIS  and  the  mitigation  measures  that  would  reduce  the  impacts.  Those  impacts  remaining  after 
mitigation  is  applied  (e.g.,  avoidance  and  minimization,  but  not  compensatory  mitigation)  are 
identified  in  Table  10-1  as  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts.  Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  are 
the  result  of  both  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  unless  otherwise  noted.  The 
impact  determinations  in  Table  10-1  are  for  the  combined  impacts  of  construction  and 
preconstruction.

NUREG-2168 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


The  unavoidable  adverse  environmental  impacts  identified  in  Table  10-1  are  primarily 
attributable  to  preconstruction  activities  involving  the  initial  land  disturbance  from  clearing  the 
site;  excavation;  filling  areas  of  wetlands,  intermittent  streams,  and  waterways;  dredging;  adding 
impervious  surfaces;  and  building  the  proposed  causeway  and  pipeline  corridors. 

Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  result  in  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  land 
use  because  they  would  disturb  up  to  430  ac  on  and  adjacent  to  the  819-ac  PSEG  Site.  Of  this 
430-ac  total,  225  ac  would  be  permanently  disturbed  on  the  PSEG  Site  (including  70  ac  for  the 
power  block),  and  205  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  on  the  PSEG  Site  (160  ac)  and 
adjacent  to  the  PSEG  Site  (45  ac  in  the  Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility  [CDF]). 
Preconstruction  activities  would  disturb  up  to  69.0  ac  along  the  proposed  causeway  corridor  of 
which  45.5  ac  would  be  permanently  disturbed  and  23.5  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed. 

Unavoidable  adverse  surface-water-use  impacts  during  construction  and  preconstruction  would 
result  from  the  use  of  small  amounts  of  water  from  onsite  stormwater  retention  ponds  for  dust 
suppression.  Groundwater  would  be  obtained  under  the  existing  water-use  permit  for  HCGS 
and  SGS,  and  unavoidable  groundwater-use  impacts  would  result  from  the  use  of  small 
amounts  of  water  for  preconstruction  and  construction  support  (including  concrete  batch  plant 
supply  and  dust  suppression)  and  from  dewatering  for  power  block  construction. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  during  construction  and  preconstruction 
would  result  from  clearing  vegetation,  disturbing  the  land  surface,  inadvertent  release  of 
contaminants  associated  with  building  materials  and  equipment,  building  activities  in  the  tidal 
marsh  and  tidal  stream  areas,  and  dredging  activities  in  the  Delaware  River.  Temporary  and 
localized  groundwater-quality  impacts  would  result  from  dewatering  for  power  block  construction 
and  discharge  of  groundwater  to  adjacent  surface-water  bodies. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  terrestrial  ecology  during  construction  and  preconstruction 
would  result  from  the  disturbance  of  430  ac  on  and  adjacent  to  the  site  and  69  ac  along  the 
proposed  causeway.  Of  the  430-ac  total  disturbance,  225  ac  on  the  site  would  be  permanently 
disturbed  and  205  ac  on  and  adjacent  to  the  site  would  be  temporarily  disturbed.  The  225  ac 
of  permanent  disturbance  on  the  site  would  include  108  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily 
Phragmites- dominated  coastal  and  interior  wetlands)  and  9  ac  of  old  field  and  brush/shrubland 
habitat.  The  1 60  ac  of  temporary  disturbance  on  the  site  would  include  80  ac  of  old  field  and 
Phragmites-6om\naie6  old  field  habitat  and  32  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  interior  wetlands).  The  45  ac  of  temporary  disturbance  adjacent  to  the  site  would 
occur  in  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  and  include  30.2  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  interior  wetlands  and  disturbed  wetlands). 

Of  the  69.0  ac  of  total  disturbance  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway,  45.5  ac  would  be 
permanently  disturbed  and  23.5  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed.  The  45.5  ac  of  permanent 
disturbance  along  the  causeway  would  include  23  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  coastal  wetlands)  and  3.4  ac  of  old  field  habitat.  The  23.5  ac  of  temporary 
disturbance  along  the  causeway  would  include  19.6  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  coastal  wetlands  and  freshwater  tidal  marshes). 


NUREG-2168 


10-10 


November  2015 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  ecology  would  include  some  physical  alteration  of 
habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  dredging,  pile  driving)  including  temporary  or  permanent  removal  of 
associated  benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in  hydrological  regimes,  and  changes  in 
water  quality.  These  impacts  would  result  from  installing  the  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge 
structures,  building  the  barge  facility  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  shoreline,  preparing  the 
power  plant  site,  and  building  the  causeway.  Aquatic  habitats  affected  would  include  desilt 
basins  and  small  marsh  creeks,  habitats  associated  with  the  Delaware  River,  and  the 
interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks  primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

For  socioeconomic  resources,  unavoidable  adverse  physical  impacts  to  workers  and  the  local 
public  would  include  increased  noise,  air  pollution  emissions,  and  vehicle  traffic.  The  addition 
of  two  new  cooling  towers  and  two  new  reactor  domes  at  the  PSEG  Site,  and  an  elevated 
causeway  to  the  PSEG  Site,  would  noticeably  affect  the  aesthetic  qualities  from  sensitive 
viewpoints  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  and  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  This  impact  to 
visual  resources  would  be  moderate  and  not  amenable  to  mitigation. 

No  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  are  anticipated  on  Artificial 
Island.  An  adverse  visual  effect  to  historic  properties  in  New  Jersey  could  occur  if  natural  draft 
cooling  towers  are  constructed.  However,  consultation  between  the  USACE  and  the  New 
Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SHPO)  is  ongoing. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  air  quality  from  construction  and  preconstruction  would  include 
fugitive  dust  and  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  and  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  from  land- 
disturbing  and  building  activities  and  equipment  and  from  additional  vehicle  traffic. 

Unavoidable  nonradiological  health  impacts  to  the  public  and  construction  workers  at  the  site 
would  result  from  fugitive  dust,  occupational  injuries,  noise,  and  traffic  impacts  from  the 
transport  of  materials  and  personnel  to  the  site. 

Unavoidable  radiological  doses  to  the  public  would  be  below  annual  exposure  limits  set  by  the 
NRC  and  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  to  protect  the  general  public. 
Radiological  doses  to  construction  workers  at  the  PSEG  Site  from  the  adjacent  SGS  and  HCGS 
would  be  below  the  NRC  regulatory  limits. 

Solid,  liquid,  and  gaseous  wastes  would  be  generated  by  construction  and  preconstruction 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  wastes  would  be  managed  by  following  the  existing  practices 
currently  used  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  Solid  waste  would  be  recycled  or  disposed  of  in  existing, 
permitted  landfills.  Sanitary  wastes  would  be  treated  on  the  site  and  discharged  locally  after 
being  treated  to  the  levels  stipulated  in  the  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System 
(NJPDES)  permit. 

The  review  team  concludes  that  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  of  preconstruction  and 
construction  activities  at  and  near  the  PSEG  Site  would  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE, 
depending  on  the  affected  resource.  Similarly,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  incremental 
contribution  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  activities  to  these  unavoidable  adverse  impacts 
would  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE.

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


10.2.2  Unavoidable  Adverse  Impacts  during  Operation 

Chapter  5  provides  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  potential  impacts  from  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Table  10-2  lists  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  associated 
with  operating  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  each  of  the  resource  areas  evaluated  in  this  EIS 
and  the  mitigation  measures  that  would  reduce  the  impacts.  The  impacts  remaining  after 
mitigation  is  applied  (e.g.,  avoidance  and  minimization,  but  not  compensatory  mitigation)  are 
identified  in  Table  10-2  as  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts. 

Operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  result  in  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  land 
use  because  the  areas  of  permanent  disturbance  (225  ac  on  the  site  and  45.5  ac  along  the 
causeway  route)  would  be  unavailable  for  other  uses  for  the  operational  life  of  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant. 

Unavoidable  adverse  surface-water-use  impacts  during  operations  would  result  from 
surface-water  withdrawals  from  the  Delaware  River.  Consumptive  use  mitigation  requirements 
may  exceed  the  PSEG  current  storage  allocation  of  water  in  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir. 
Groundwater  would  be  obtained  from  new  wells  in  the  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  aquifer 
system,  and  unavoidable  groundwater-use  impacts  would  result  from  withdrawals  for  sanitary 
and  potable  water  systems  and  for  the  demineralized  water  distribution  system. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  during  operations 
would  result  from  thermal  discharges  and  discharges  of  nonradioactive  liquid  effluents  from  the 
cooling  water  system,  as  well  as  potable  and  sanitary  discharges  and  liquid  radioactive  wastes. 
PSEG  does  not  plan  routine  discharges  to  groundwater  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant,  but 
impacts  could  result  from  chemical  or  radiological  spills  that  could  migrate  to  shallow  water 
(brackish)  zones  or  saline  intrusion  to  deep  aquifers  due  to  groundwater  withdrawals. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  terrestrial  ecological  resources  during  operations  would  include 
the  permanent  disturbance  on  the  site  of  108  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily  Phragmites- 
dominated  coastal  and  interior  wetlands)  and  9  ac  of  old  field  and  brush/shrubland  habitat  and 
the  permanent  disturbance  along  the  causeway  of  23  ac  of  wetland  habitat  (primarily 
Phragmites-domlnaied  coastal  wetlands)  and  3.4  ac  of  old  field  habitat.  Other  unavoidable 
adverse  impacts  would  include  the  increased  risk  of  bird  collisions  with  structures,  wildlife 
avoidance  due  to  increased  noise  and  artificial  light,  and  potential  impacts  of  salt  deposition  on 
vegetation  near  the  cooling  towers. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  ecological  resources  during  operations  would  include 
impacts  to  aquatic  biota  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  from  impingement  and  entrainment  due 
to  cooling  system  operations,  heat  stress  due  to  the  thermal  discharge  plume,  and  chemicals  in 
the  discharged  blowdown  from  the  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  socioeconomic  and  environmental  justice  resources  would 
include  physical  aesthetic  impacts  from  the  increased  industrialization  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These 
aesthetic  impacts  would  also  contribute  to  the  adverse  impacts  on  recreational  resources  near 
the  PSEG  Site  and  cannot  be  reduced  by  mitigation.

and  DOT  regulations  from  transportation  of  fuel 
and  radioactive  waste. 

Small  impacts  from  decommissioning  as 
presented  in  NUREG-0586  (NRC  2002-TN665) 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


No  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  are  anticipated  on  Artificial 
Island  or  to  historic  properties  in  Delaware.  The  NRC  executed  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement 
(NRC  2015-TN4377)  to  resolve  any  effect  to  historic  properties  in  New  Jersey  from  construction 
and  operation  of  natural  draft  cooling  towers.  However,  consultation  is  ongoing  between  the 
USACE  and  the  New  Jersey  SHPO. 

Unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  air  quality  during  operations  would  include  emissions  of  criteria 
pollutants,  GHG  emissions,  and  cooling  system  emissions.  Operations  would  increase  gaseous 
and  particulate  emissions  by  a  small  amount,  primarily  from  equipment  associated  with  auxiliary 
systems  and  the  cooling  towers.  The  primary  sources  of  emissions  from  auxiliary  systems 
would  be  the  auxiliary  boilers,  standby  power  units  such  as  diesel  generators  and/or  gas 
turbines,  and  engine-driven  emergency  equipment.  The  cooling  towers  would  be  the  primary 
source  of  particulate  emissions. 

Unavoidable  nonradiological  health  impacts  to  the  public  and  operations  workers  at  the  site 
would  result  from  exposure  to  etiologic  microorganisms  through  cooling  systems,  noise 
generated  by  unit  operations,  and  transportation  of  operations  and  outage  workers  to  and  from 
the  site.  Health  risks  to  workers  would  be  dominated  by  occupational  injuries  and  would  likely 
occur  at  rates  below  the  average  U.S.  industrial  rates. 

Unavoidable  radiological  doses  to  the  public  would  be  below  the  NRC  and  EPA  limits  set  to 
protect  the  general  public.  Radiological  doses  to  operations  workers  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
also  be  below  the  NRC  limits  and  would  be  maintained  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable.  The 
radiation  protection  measures  designed  to  maintain  doses  to  members  of  the  public  below  the 
NRC  and  EPA  standards  would  also  ensure  that  doses  to  biota  other  than  humans  would  be 
well  below  the  guidelines  of  the  National  Council  on  Radiation  Protection  and  Measurements 
and  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency. 

Solid,  liquid,  and  gaseous  wastes  would  be  generated  by  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These 
wastes  would  be  managed  by  following  the  existing  practices  currently  used  at  HCGS  and  SGS. 
Solid  waste  would  be  recycled  or  disposed  of  in  existing,  permitted  landfills.  Sanitary  wastes 
would  be  treated  on  the  site  and  discharged  locally  after  being  treated  to  the  levels  stipulated 
in  the  NJPDES  permit. 

Operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  also  contribute  to 
unavoidable  adverse  impacts  related  to  the  uranium  fuel  cycle,  transportation  of  fuels  and 
wastes,  and  decommissioning.  Fuel  cycle  impacts  would  be  small,  as  presented  in  Table  S-3, 
10  CFR  Part  51  (TN250).  There  would  be  small  impacts  from  carbon  dioxide,  radon,  and 
technetium-99.  There  would  be  small  radiological  doses  from  transportation  of  fuel  and 
radioactive  waste  that  are  within  the  NRC  and  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  regulations. 
The  impacts  of  decommissioning  would  be  small,  as  presented  in  NUREG-0586  (NRC  2002- 
TN665). 

The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  of  operating  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE,  depending  on  the 
affected  resource.

NUREG-2168 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


10.3  Relationship  Between  Short-Term  Uses  and  Long-Term  Productivity  of  the 
Human  Environment 

NEPA  Section  102(2)(C)(iv)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 )  requires  that  an  EIS  include 
information  on  the  relationship  between  local  short-term  uses  of  the  environment  and  the 
maintenance  and  enhancement  of  long-term  productivity. 

The  local  use  of  the  human  environment  by  developing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  can  be  summarized  as  the  unavoidable  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  preconstruction, 
construction,  and  operations  along  with  the  irreversible  and  irretrievable  commitments  of 
resources.  With  the  exception  of  the  consumption  of  depletable  resources  as  a  result  of 
preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation,  these  uses  may  be  categorized  as  short-term. 

The  principal  short-term  benefit  of  developing  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  the 
production  of  electrical  energy.  The  economic  productivity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  when  used  for  the 
production  of  electrical  energy,  would  be  extremely  large  when  compared  to  the  current 
short-term  productive  use  of  the  undeveloped  site,  which  is  not  available  for  agricultural  or 
industrial  uses  until  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  units  are  decommissioned. 

The  maximum  long-term  impact  on  productivity  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  result  if  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  were  not  immediately  dismantled  at  the  end  of  its  period  of  operation,  and 
consequently  the  land  occupied  by  the  plant  structures  would  thus  be  unavailable  for  any  other 
use.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  enhancement  of  regional  productivity  resulting  from  the 
electrical  energy  produced  by  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  lead  to  a  correspondingly 
large  increase  in  regional  long-term  productivity  that  would  not  be  equaled  by  any  other 
long-term  use  of  the  site.  In  addition,  most  long-term  impacts  resulting  from  land-use 
preemption  by  plant  structures  could  be  eliminated  by  removing  these  structures  or  by 
converting  them  to  other  productive  uses  at  the  end  of  operations.  Once  operations  at  the  new 
nuclear  power  plant  cease  and  it  is  shut  down,  plant  structures  would  be  decommissioned 
according  to  the  NRC  regulations.  Once  decommissioning  was  completed  and  the  NRC  license 
was  terminated,  the  site  would  become  available  for  other  uses. 

The  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the  negative  impacts  of  plant  construction  and  operation  as  they 
affect  the  human  environment  would  be  outweighed  by  the  positive  long-term  enhancement  of 
regional  productivity  through  the  generation  of  electrical  energy. 

10.4  Irreversible  and  Irretrievable  Commitments  of  Resources 

NEPA  Section  102(2)(C)(v)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661)  requires  that  an  EIS  include 
information  on  any  irreversible  and  irretrievable  commitments  of  resources  that  would  occur  if 
the  proposed  actions  were  implemented.  The  term  “irreversible  commitments  of  resources” 
refers  to  environmental  resources  that  would  be  irreparably  changed  by  the  building  or 
operation  activities  authorized  by  the  NRC  licensing  decisions  or  the  USACE  permitting 
decisions  and  that  could  not  be  restored  at  some  later  time  to  the  resource  state  before  the 
relevant  activity  occurred.  “Irretrievable  commitments  of  resources”  refers  to  materials  that 
would  be  used  for  or  consumed  by  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  in  such  a  way  that  they  could 
not,  by  practical  means,  be  recycled  or  restored  for  other  uses.  The  environmental  resources 
summarized  in  this  section  are  discussed  in  Chapters  4,  5,  and  6  of  this  EIS.  The  irretrievable 


NUREG-2168 


10-18 


November  2015 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


commitments  of  resources  to  building  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  generally  would  be  similar  to 
those  of  any  major  construction  project  (see  Section  10.4.2).  The  following  sections  discuss  the 
irreversible  commitments  of  resources  to  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

10.4.1  Irreversible  Commitments  of  Resources 

The  irreversible  commitments  of  environmental  resources  resulting  from  preconstruction, 
construction,  and  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant,  in  addition  to  the  materials  used  for 
the  nuclear  fuel,  are  discussed  below. 

10.4.1.1  Land  Use 

Land  committed  to  the  disposal  of  radioactive  and  nonradioactive  wastes  is  committed  to  that 
use  and  cannot  be  used  for  other  purposes.  The  land  used  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  with  the  exception  of  any  permanently  filled  wetlands,  would  not  be  irreversibly 
committed  because  the  land  supporting  the  facilities  could  be  returned  to  other  industrial  or 
nonindustrial  uses  once  the  nuclear  power  plant  ceased  operations  and  was  decommissioned  in 
accordance  with  the  NRC  requirements.  Therefore,  the  review  team  considers  that  construction 
and  preconstruction  activities  would  result  in  the  permanent  loss,  through  infilling,  of  about 
108  ac  of  wetlands  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  23  ac  of  wetlands  along  the  causeway  route. 

10.4.1.2  Water  Use  and  Quality 

The  brackish  waters  of  the  Delaware  River  and  tidal  creeks  and  marshes  near  the  PSEG  Site 
are  not  desirable  for  use  during  building,  so  the  applicant  would  not  use  waters  from  these 
sources.  However,  small  amounts  of  water  from  onsite  stormwater  retention  ponds  would  be 
used  for  dust  suppression  during  building  activities.  Because  there  would  be  no  surface  water 
used  during  building  from  surface-water  bodies  near  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  use  of  some 
stormwater  collected  in  retention  ponds  is  expected  to  be  negligible  compared  to  the  surface- 
water  resource,  the  review  team  determined  that  there  would  be  no  irreversible  commitments  of 
surface-water  resources  during  preconstruction  and  construction. 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  expected  to  result  in  any 
irreversible  commitments  of  groundwater  resources.  Because  dewatering  for  power  block 
construction  would  be  temporary  and  not  from  aquifers  used  for  potable  purposes,  the  impact 
would  be  minor.  Also,  because  the  increased  groundwater  withdrawal  for  preconstruction  and 
construction  uses  would  be  temporary  and  within  the  limits  of  the  current  NJDEP  water 
allocation  permit,  the  impacts  would  be  minor. 

The  anticipated  consumptive  use  of  water  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  to  support 
operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  26,420  gpm  of  brackish  water  and 
an  equivalent  4,756  gpm  of  freshwater.  The  consumed  water  would  be  irreversibly  lost  from  the 
Delaware  River  Basin  and  would  not  be  available  to  downstream  users. 

Groundwater  would  be  used  during  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  supply  makeup 
to  the  demineralizer  system,  fire  protection  system,  and  sanitary  and  potable  systems  and  for 
other  miscellaneous  uses.  The  increased  use  of  groundwater  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant

would  be  210  gpm  with  a  maximum  rate  of  953  gpm.  The  portion  of  this  groundwater  that  is 
consumed  would  be  irreversibly  lost  and  would  not  be  available  to  other  groundwater  users. 

10.4.1.3  Terrestrial  and  Aquatic  Biota 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  permanently  convert  some  portions  of 
terrestrial  and  aquatic  habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site,  which  would  temporarily  adversely  affect  the 
abundance  and  distribution  of  local  terrestrial  and  aquatic  species.  Irreversible  commitments  of 
resources  would  include  the  permanent  loss  on  the  site  of  about  108  ac  of  wetland  habitat 
(primarily  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  and  interior  wetlands)  and  9  ac  of  old  field  and 
brush/shrubland  habitat.  Permanent  losses  along  the  causeway  route  would  include  23  ac  of 
wetland  habitat  (primarily  Pfrragm/tes-dominated  coastal  wetlands)  and  3.4  ac  of  old  field 
habitat.  Permanent  losses  of  onsite  aquatic  habitats  include  filling  of  approximately  40  ac  of 
desilt  basins  and  7,265  linear  ft  of  creek  channels,  and  isolation  of  2,320  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek 
channels.  Dredging  activities  for  the  installation  of  the  cooling  water  intake  structure  would 
permanently  remove  about  225,000  yd3  of  sediment;  installation  of  the  new  barge  storage  area 
and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  of  440,000  yd3  of  sediment,  and  up  to  5,800  yd3  of 
sediment  would  be  dredged  and  removed  for  improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip.  Benthic 
organisms  present  in  these  sediment  habitats  would  be  lost.  Additional  fill  impacts  to  the  river 
bottom  habitat  would  result  from  the  installation  of  seven  mooring  caissons  (0.05  ac),  a  new 
discharge  structure  (0.24  ac)  and  a  shoreline  bulkhead  (1.03  ac). 

10.4.1.4  Socioeconomic  Resources 

The  review  team  expects  that  no  irreversible  commitments  would  be  made  to  socioeconomic 
resources  because  they  would  be  reallocated  for  other  purposes  once  the  plant  was 
decommissioned. 

10.4.1.5  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

There  would  not  be  any  irreversible  commitments  of  historic  or  cultural  resources.  However, 
the  USACE  consultation  with  the  New  Jersey  SHPO  is  ongoing. 

10.4.1.6  Air  Quality 

Air  emission  releases  during  preconstruction/construction  activities  and  operations  would 
conform  to  applicable  Federal  and  State  regulations,  so  the  impact  on  public  health  and  the 
environment  would  be  limited.  The  review  team  expects  no  irreversible  impacts  on  air  quality 
because  all  releases  would  be  made  in  accordance  with  duly  issued  permits. 

10.4.2  Irretrievable  Commitments  of  Resources 

Irretrievable  commitments  of  resources  during  the  building  of  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power 
plant  generally  would  be  similar  to  those  of  any  major  construction  project.  The  actual 
commitment  of  construction  resources  (e.g.,  concrete,  steel,  and  other  building  materials)  would 
depend  on  the  reactor  design  selected  by  PSEG  at  the  construction  permit  (CP)/combined 
license  (COL)  stage.  Nevertheless,  a  study  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy 
(DOE  2004-TN2240)  on  new  reactor  construction  estimated  that  about  12,239  yd3  of  concrete; 


NUREG-2168 


10-20 


November  2015 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


3.107  tons  of  steel  reinforcement  (i.e.,  rebar);  13.000,000  ft  of  cable:  and  275.000  ft  of  piping 
would  be  required  for  the  reactor  building  of  a  typical  new  1 ,300-MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant. 
Historical  records  of  operating  reactors  suggest  a  total  of  about  182.900  yd3  of  concrete  and 
20.512  tons  of  structural  steel  would  be  required  to  construct  the  reactor  building,  major 
auxiliary  buildings,  turbine  generator  building,  and  turbine  generator  pedestal  (DOE  2005- 
TN2358). 

The  upper  limit  on  the  electrical  generating  capacity  of  the  types  of  reactor  units  under 
consideration  in  this  ESP  review  is  2.200  MW(e);  hence,  the  quantities  of  construction  materials 
required  for  such  a  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  about  twice  the  amounts  discussed  in  the 
preceding  paragraph. 

The  quantities  of  construction  materials  estimated  by  PSEG  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280) 
include  920.000  yd3  of  concrete,  92.000  tons  of  reinforcing  steel.  50.000  tons  of  structural  steel. 

1 ,380.000  ft  of  piping.  440.000  ft  of  cable  tray.  2.400.000  ft  of  conduit,  2.800,000  ft  of  power 
cable.  1 0.800.000  ft  of  control  wire,  and  1 .480.000  ft  of  process  and  instrument  tubing.  The 
actual  estimate  of  construction  materials  would  be  performed  at  the  CP/COL  stage  when  the 
reactor  design  is  selected. 

The  review  team  expects  that  the  use  of  construction  materials  in  the  quantities  associated  with 
those  expected  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  while  irretrievable,  would  be  of  small 
consequence  with  respect  to  the  availability  of  such  resources. 

The  main  resource  that  would  be  irretrievably  committed  during  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  uranium.  The  availability  of  uranium  ore  and  existing 
stockpiles  of  highly  enriched  uranium  in  the  United  States  and  Russia  that  could  be  processed 
into  fuel  are  sufficient  (WNA  2012-TN1498)  so  that  the  irreversible  and  irretrievable  commitment 
would  be  negligible. 

10.5  Alternatives  to  the  Proposed  Action 

Alternatives  to  the  proposed  actions  are  discussed  in  Chapter  9  of  this  EIS.  The  alternatives 
considered  are  the  no-action  alternative,  energy  production  alternatives,  system  design 
alternatives,  and  alternative  sites.  For  the  purposes  of  the  USACE  permit  evaluation,  onsite 
alternatives  will  be  addressed  as  part  of  the  USACE  least  environmentally  damaging  practicable 
alternative  (LEDPA)  determination. 

The  no-action  alternative,  as  described  in  Section  9.1,  refers  to  a  scenario  in  which  the  NRC 
would  deny  the  PSEG  ESP  request  and  the  USACE  would  either  take  no  action  or  deny  the 
Section  404  CWA  permit.  If  such  actions  were  to  occur,  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  52  (TN251)  process  referencing 
an  approved  ESP  would  not  occur,  and  the  environmental  impacts  predicted  in  this  EIS  would 
not  occur.  A  comparison  of  the  proposed  action  with  the  no-action  alternative  is  presented  in 
Section  9.1. 

Alternative  energy  sources  are  described  in  Section  9.2.  Alternatives  that  would  not  require 
additional  generating  capacity  are  described  in  Section  9.2.1.  Alternatives  that  require 


November  2015 


10-21 


NUREG-2168 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


additional  generating  capacity  are  discussed  in  Section  9.2.2.  Detailed  analyses  of  individual 
alternatives  that  could  meet  the  project  purpose  and  need  (coal-fired  and  natural-gas-fired 
alternatives)  are  provided  in  Section  9.2.3.  A  combination  of  energy  alternatives  is  discussed  in 
Section  9.2.4.  The  NRC  staff  concluded  that  none  of  the  alternative  energy  options  were  both 

(1 )  consistent  with  the  purpose  and  need  for  the  project,  as  defined  in  Section  1.3.1,  and 

(2)  environmentally  preferable  to  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant. 

Alternative  sites  are  discussed  in  Section  9.3.  The  cumulative  impacts  of  building  and  operating 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  each  of  the  four  alternative  sites  are  compared  in  Section  9.3.6  to 
the  impacts  of  such  facilities  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  Table  9-24  contains  the  review  team 
characterization  of  cumulative  impacts  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  and  the  four  alternative  sites. 
Based  on  this  review,  the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  while  there  are  differences  in  cumulative 
impacts  at  the  proposed  and  alternative  sites,  none  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be 
environmentally  preferable  or  obviously  superior  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  The  NRC  staff 
determination  is  independent  of  the  USACE  LEDPA  determination  pursuant  to  CWA 
Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427).  The  USACE  will  conclude  its  analysis 
of  both  offsite  and  onsite  alternatives  in  its  Record  of  Decision. 

In  Section  9.4,  the  NRC  staff  considered  alternative  system  designs  including  alternative  heat 
dissipation  systems  and  alternative  intake,  discharge,  and  water  supply  systems.  The  NRC 
staff  did  not  identify  any  alternative  that  was  environmentally  preferable  to  the  plant  systems 
design  currently  under  consideration  for  use  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

10.6  Benefit-Cost  Balance 

NEPA  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661])  requires  that  all  agencies  of  the  Federal  government 
prepare  detailed  EISs  on  proposed  major  Federal  actions  that  can  significantly  affect  the  quality 
of  the  human  environment.  A  principal  objective  of  NEPA  is  to  require  each  Federal  agency  to 
consider,  in  its  decision-making  process,  the  environmental  impacts  of  each  proposed  major 
action  and  the  available  alternative  actions.  In  particular,  NEPA  Section  102  (B)  requires  that  all 
Federal  agencies,  to  the  fullest  extent  possible,  “identify  and  develop  methods  and  procedures, 
in  consultation  with  the  CEQ  established  by  Title  II  of  this  Act,  which  will  ensure  that  presently 
unquantified  environmental  amenities  and  values  may  be  given  appropriate  consideration  in 
decision-making  along  with  economic  and  technical  considerations.”  However,  neither  NEPA 
nor  CEQ  requires  the  costs  and  benefits  of  a  proposed  action  to  be  quantified  in  dollars  or  any 
other  common  metric. 

10  CFR  51.50,  Section  (b)(2)  (TN250)  does  not  require  an  assessment  of  benefits  and  costs  for 
an  ESP  application.  However,  in  the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  included  a 
benefit-cost  assessment  as  a  part  of  its  ESP  application,  and  therefore  the  review  team  includes 
this  benefit-cost  balancing  section  in  this  EIS  and  will  reference  it  in  any  future  COL  application 
for  the  PSEG  Site. 

Although  the  analysis  in  this  section  is  conceptually  similar  to  a  purely  economic  benefit-cost 
analysis,  which  determines  the  net  present  dollar  value  of  a  given  project,  it  is  not  possible  to 
quantify  and  assign  a  value  to  all  internal  (i.e.,  private,  or  societal)  benefits  and  costs  of  the 
proposed  action.  This  section  focuses  primarily  on  the  monetized  values  of  only  those  activities 
closely  related  to  the  building  and  operational  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  does  not  provide 


NUREG-2168 


10-22

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


monetary  estimates  of  all  potential  societal  benefits  and  costs.  Instead,  the  review  team  offers 
quantified  assessments  for  external  benefits  and  costs  that  are  of  sufficient  magnitude  or 
importance  that  their  inclusion  in  this  analysis  can  inform  the  NRC  and  USACE  decision-making 
processes. 

In  this  section,  the  review  team  compiled  and  compared  the  pertinent  analytical  conclusions 
reached  in  previous  chapters  of  this  EIS.  All  of  the  expected  impacts  from  building  and 
operational  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  gathered  and  aggregated  into  two  final  categories: 
the  expected  social  costs  and  the  expected  social  benefits  to  be  derived  from  approval  of  the 
proposed  action.  The  intent  of  this  EIS  is  not  to  identify  potential  societal  benefits  of  proposed 
activities  and  compare  them  to  their  potential  internal  and  external  costs,  but  to  generally  inform 
the  ESP  application  process  by  gathering  and  reviewing  information  that  demonstrates  the 
likelihood  that  the  aggregate  benefits  of  the  proposed  activities  outweigh  the  aggregate  costs. 

General  issues  related  to  PSEG's  financial  viability  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  NRC  EIS 
process  and  are  thus  not  considered  in  this  EIS.  Issues  related  to  financial  qualifications  will  be 
addressed  in  the  NRC  safety  evaluation  report  for  the  COL  and  are  not  required  during  the  ESP 
review  per  10  CFR  52.16  (TN251). 

Section  10.6.1  discusses  the  benefits  associated  with  the  proposed  action.  Section  10.6.2 
discusses  the  costs  associated  with  the  proposed  action.  In  accordance  with  the  NRC  guidance 
in  NUREG-1555  (NRC  2000-TN614),  the  internal  costs  of  the  proposed  project  are  presented  in 
monetary  terms.  Internal  costs  include  all  of  the  costs  included  in  a  total  capital  cost 
assessment:  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  preconstruction  and  construction  plus  the  annual 
costs  of  operation  and  maintenance.  Section  10.6.3  provides  a  summary  of  the  impact 
assessments,  bringing  previous  sections  together  to  establish  a  general  impression  of  the 
relative  magnitude  of  the  proposed  project’s  costs  and  benefits. 

10.6.1  Benefits 

A  summary  of  the  benefits  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  the  following  subsections  is  shown  in 
Table  10-3.  The  most  obvious  benefit  from  building  and  operating  nuclear  power  plants  is  the 
power  generation — providing  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumers  with  electricity. 
The  social  and  economic  benefits  of  maintaining  an  adequate  supply  of  electricity  in  any  given 
region  could  be  great,  given  that  reliable  electricity  supplies  are  key  to  economic  stability  and 
growth  in  a  region.  Table  1 0-3  reports  the  upper  and  lower  bounds  of  the  electric  output  based 
on  a  single  or  dual  units  as  1 ,350  MW(e)  at  the  lower  end  for  a  single  unit  and  2,200  MW(e)  for 
the  dual  units  at  the  upper  end  of  the  range.  The  discussion  focuses  primarily  on  the  relative 
benefits  of  those  values  rather  than  the  broader,  more  generic  benefits  of  electricity  supply. 

10.6.1.1  Societal  Benefits 

For  the  production  of  electricity  to  be  beneficial  to  a  society,  there  must  be  a  corresponding 
demand  or  need  for  power  in  the  region.  Chapter  8  of  this  EIS  discusses  that  need  for  power  in 
more  detail.  From  a  societal  perspective,  the  power  itself  is  the  primary  benefit  because  it 
provides  energy  for  economic  growth  and  helps  maintain  the  nation's  standard  of  living. 
However,  price  stability  and  longevity,  energy  security,  and  fuel  diversity  are  also  key  benefits 
associated  with  nuclear  power  generation  relative  to  the  benefits  from  most  other  alternative 
generating  technologies.  These  benefits  are  described  in  this  section.

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


Price  Stability  and  Longevity 

Because  of  nuclear  power  s  relatively  low  and  nonvolatile  fuel  costs  and  a  projected  capacity 
utilization  rate  of  85  to  93  percent,  nuclear  energy  is  a  dependable  source  of  electricity  that  is 
provided  at  relatively  stable  prices.  Because  of  the  low  cost  of  uranium,  the  fuel  price  elasticity 
of  electricity  demand  (how  the  consumer’s  demand  for  electricity  changes  as  the  price  of 
uranium  causes  the  cost  of  producing  the  electricity  to  change)  is  very  low.  The  price  of 
uranium  fuel  is  between  3  and  5  percent  of  the  cost  of  a  kilowatt-hour  of  nuclear-generated 
electricity.  Doubling  the  price  of  uranium  increases  the  cost  of  electricity  by  about  9  percent.  In 
contrast,  doubling  the  price  of  natural  gas  adds  about  66  percent  to  the  price  of  electricity,  and 
doubling  the  cost  of  coal  adds  about  31  percent  to  the  price  of  electricity  (WNA  2013-TN2689). 

Unlike  some  other  energy  sources,  nuclear  energy  is  generally  not  subject  to  unreliable  weather 
or  climate  conditions,  unpredictable  cost  fluctuations,  or  dependence  on  foreign  suppliers.  The 
combination  of  low  fuel  prices,  the  relative  lack  of  volatility  in  fuel  prices  when  compared  to  the 
prices  of  other  alternative  fuels,  and  capacity  utilization  rates  of  85  to  93  percent  mean  that 
nuclear  energy  is  a  dependable  source  of  electricity  that  can  be  provided  to  the  consumer  at 
relatively  stable  prices  over  a  long  period  of  time. 

Energy  Security  and  Fuel  Diversity 

Currently  about  70  percent  of  the  electricity  generated  in  the  United  States  is  generated  using 
fossil-based  technologies.  Nuclear  power  adds  diversity  and  flexibility  to  the  U.S.  energy  mix, 
thereby  hedging  the  risk  of  shortages  and  price  fluctuations  that  would  result  from  an 
overdependence  on  any  one  power-generating  system  or  foreign-produced  fuels. 

A  diverse  fuel  mix  helps  protect  consumers  from  contingencies  such  as  fuel  shortages  or 
disruptions,  price  fluctuations,  and  changes  in  regulatory  practices.  The  PSEG  Site's  generating 
capacity  could  provide  additional  nuclear  power-generating  capacity  to  the  generation  mix  and 
thus  give  the  region  a  hedge  against  risks  of  future  shortages  and  price  fluctuations  associated 
with  alternative  generating  systems  and  power  importation. 

10.6.1.2  Regional  Benefits 

Regional  benefits  of  building  and  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  include  enhanced  tax  revenues  at 
the  State,  county,  and  local  levels;  opportunities  for  increased  regional  productivity  in  industry, 
manufacturing,  and  other  business  categories;  increased  employment  opportunities  within 
the  region;  and  improvements  in  local  infrastructure  and  services  derived  from  the  increased 
tax  base. 

Tax  Revenue  Benefits 

Tax  revenues  would  come  from  various  sources  during  preconstruction,  construction,  and 
operations  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  (1)  State  taxes  on  worker  incomes,  (2)  State  sales  taxes 
on  materials  and  supplies,  (3)  State  sales  taxes  on  worker  expenditures,  (4)  local  property  taxes 
or  payments  in  lieu  of  taxes,  and  (5)  corporate  income  tax  payments.  The  tax  structure  of  the 
region  is  discussed  in  Section  2. 5. 2. 2  of  this  EIS.

NUREG-2168 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


State  income  tax  revenue  during  the  peak  employment  period  of  building  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  about  $3.8  million  annually  for  in-migrating  workers  (about  $0.9  million  annually  for  the 
State  of  Delaware  and  about  $2.9  million  annually  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey — see 
Section  4. 4. 3. 2).  During  operations,  about  $1.29  million  in  annual  income  taxes  would  be 
received:  about  $0.2  million  would  be  received  by  the  State  of  Delaware,  and  about 
$1 .04  million  would  be  received  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  (see  Section  5. 4. 3. 2).  The  States  of 
Pennsylvania  and  New  Jersey  would  also  receive  sales  tax  revenue  on  expenditures  made  by 
the  new  workers  and  on  purchases  of  building  materials  and  supplies  in  the  local  area.  The 
review  team  estimated,  on  the  basis  of  information  provided  by  PSEG  and  the  review  team’s 
independent  analysis,  that  the  State  of  New  Jersey  would  receive  new  sales  tax  revenue  of 
about  $72.8  million  over  the  6-year  building  period  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  that  the  State  of 
Pennsylvania  would  receive  about  $29.9  million.  During  operations,  New  Jersey  would  receive 
$23.7  million  annually  and  Pennsylvania  would  receive  $9.7  million  annually  in  sales  tax 
revenue  from  purchases.  Delaware  does  not  impose  a  sales  tax. 

Salem  County  and  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  would  benefit  from  increased  property 
taxes  associated  with  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Neither  jurisdiction  imposes  property  taxes 
during  construction.  However,  assuming  a  $1 .207  per  hundred  dollars  of  assessed  value 
property  tax  on  all  improvements,  PSEG  would  pay  about  $77  million  for  the  first  year  of 
operation  and  $1 .6  billion  over  the  life  of  the  permit  for  an  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor 
(ABWR).  PSEG  would  pay  $125  million  in  property  taxes  during  the  first  year  of  operations  and 
about  $2.5  billion  in  property  taxes  over  the  40-year  lifetime  of  a  pair  of  Advanced  Passive  1 000 
(API 000)  reactors.  Therefore,  the  proposed  project  would  add  between  82  (ABWR)  and 
140  percent  (API 000)  to  the  current  Salem  County  budget  in  the  first  year. 

PSEG  would  also  pay  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  a  corporate  energy  receipts  tax  of  9  percent  of 
its  annual  revenue  each  year  during  operations.  PSEG  would  pay  about  $229  million  annually 
to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  in  corporate  income  taxes  for  the  API 000  design  and  about 
$140  million  per  year  for  an  ABWR  (based  on  an  average  14.68  cents  per  kilowatt-hour). 

Regional  Productivity  and  Community  Impacts 

Building  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  require  an  average  workforce  of  about  2,722  workers  per  year 
over  the  6-year  construction  period,  with  a  peak  building  employment  of  about  4,100  workers. 
The  building  workforce  would  produce,  on  average,  about  $142  million  in  income  each  year  over 
the  entire  preconstruction  and  construction  periods  and  $214  million  during  peak  building  (see 
Section  4.4.3. 1 ).  Stimulus  from  these  new  jobs  and  income  would  induce  a  multiplier  effect  that 
would  create  additional  indirect  jobs  in  the  economic  impact  area.  Because  it  is  anticipated  that 
the  majority  of  the  needed  workers  already  reside  in  the  economic  impact  area  and  region  and 
are  part  of  the  baseline  discussed  in  Section  2.5,  the  review  team  analyzed  the  indirect  effects 
from  the  estimated  617  in-migrating  workers  and  512  unemployed  workers  that  would  be  hired 
to  work  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  1,129  construction  workers  would  produce  about  928  new 
indirect  jobs  during  building  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Operations  would  create  600  direct  jobs  and 
$57.5  million  in  income  annually  that  would  be  maintained  throughout  the  life  of  the  plant  (see 
Section  5.4.3. 1).  Additional  annual  indirect  jobs  and  indirect  income  would  be  created  in  the 
economic  impact  area  by  the  198  in-migrating  and  22  recently  unemployed  local  workers  that 
would  be  employed  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  a  total  of  286  indirect  jobs  during  operations.  An

estimated  1 ,000  workers  would  also  be  employed  at  the  PSEG  Site  during  scheduled  refueling 
outages,  which  would  occur  every  18-24  months  and  require  outage  workers  for  a  period  of 
30  days,  producing  an  additional  $4.4  million. 

10.6.2  Costs 

Internal  costs  to  PSEG  as  well  as  external  costs  to  the  surrounding  region  and  environment 
would  be  incurred  during  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Internal  costs  would  include  the  costs  to  build  the  power  plant  (capital  costs);  operating  and 
maintenance  costs;  and  the  costs  of  fuel,  waste  disposal,  and  decommissioning.  External  costs 
would  include  all  costs  imposed  on  the  environment  and  region  surrounding  the  plant  and  could 
include  the  loss  of  regional  productivity,  environmental  degradation,  or  loss  of  wildlife  habitat. 
Internal  and  external  costs  of  building  and  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  presented  in

Air-quality  impacts 

During  the  construction  period,  potential  impacts 
associated  with  operations  of  equipment  and  vehicles 
on  ambient  air  quality  would  be  small.  During  the 
operation  period,  air  emissions  from  diesel  generators 
and/or  gas  turbines,  auxiliary  boilers,  engine-driven 
emergency  equipment,  and  vehicles  would  have  a  small 
impact  on  workers  and  local  residents.  Cooling  tower 
drift  would  deposit  some  salt  on  the  surrounding  vicinity, 
but  at  a  level  unlikely  to  result  in  any  measurable  impact 
on  plants  and  vegetation.  Cooling  towers  would 
produce  visible  plumes  for  some  distance  downwind  of 
the  plant  depending  on  the  meteorological  conditions 
(see  Sections  4.7  and  5.7) 

SMALL 

Water-related  impacts 

26,420  gpm  of  brackish  water  and  an  equivalent  4,756 
gpm  of  freshwater  would  be  withdrawn  from  the 

Delaware  River  and  would  not  be  available  to 
downstream  users.  The  increased  use  of  groundwater 
for  the  new  plant  would  be  210  gpm.  This  portion  would 
not  be  available  to  other  groundwater  users.  These 
amounts  are  within  permitted  limits,  are  a  small 
percentage  of  the  available  amounts,  and  are  not 
expected  to  impact  uses  or  users. 

SMALL 

Ecological  impacts 

Some  cost  to  wildlife  and  aquatic  biota  is  anticipated 
due  to  mortality  and  from  the  loss  or  alteration  of 
habitats  (including  wetlands)  during  preconstruction  and 
construction.  However,  these  costs  are  not  expected  to 
adversely  affect  regional  wildlife  and  aquatic  biota 
populations.  Mortality  to  wildlife  and  aquatic  biota 
during  operations  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  PSEG’s 
adherence  to  the  USACE  and  NJPDES  permit 
requirements  would  likely  result  in  minimal  effects  to 
aquatic  populations.  About  108  acres  of  wetland 
habitats  would  be  affected  by  building  a  nuclear  power 
plant  on  the  PSEG  Site.  The  impact  to  these  important 
resources  would  be  a  noticeable  effect  on  wildlife 
species  but  would  not  be  destabilizing.  No  Federally  or 
State-threatened  or  endangered  species  are  likely  to  be 
adversely  affected.  Minimal  adverse  effect  or  no

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


1 0. 6. 2. 1  Internal  Costs 

The  most  substantial  monetary  cost  associated  with  nuclear  energy  is  the  cost  of  capital. 
Nuclear  power  plants  typically  have  high  capital  costs  but  low  fuel  costs  relative  to  other 
alternative  power  generation  systems.  Because  of  the  high  capital  costs  for  nuclear  power 
and  because  of  the  relatively  long  construction  period  before  revenue  is  returned,  servicing 
the  capital  costs  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  the  economic 
competitiveness  of  nuclear  energy.  Because  a  power  plant  does  not  yield  profits  during 
construction,  longer  construction  times  can  add  significantly  to  the  cost  of  a  plant  through 
higher  interest  expenses  on  borrowed  construction  funds. 

Preconstruction  and  Construction  Costs 

In  evaluating  monetary  costs  related  to  building  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  review  team  relied  on  the 
analysis  presented  in  Section  4. 4. 3.1.  A  phrase  commonly  used  to  describe  the  monetary  cost 
of  constructing  a  nuclear  plant  is  “overnight  capital  cost.”  Capital  costs  are  those  incurred 
during  construction  and  include  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  costs  measured 
during  the  periods  when  the  actual  outlays  for  equipment,  construction,  and  engineering  are 
expended.  Overnight  costs  assume  that  the  plant  is  constructed  “overnight,”  with  no 
construction  loan  interest  included  in  the  capital  cost  estimate.  Studies  of  new  power  plant 
construction  indicate  that  the  estimated  overnight  capital  costs  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  average 
about  $4,000  per  kilowatt  of  electrical  generating  capacity  (MIT  2009-TN2481 ).  Assuming  2013 
dollars,  the  inflation  adjusted  amount  is  $4,490.61  per  megawatt  for  an  overnight  capital  cost  of 
$9,879  billion  for  two  API 000  reactor  units  and  $6,062  billion  for  an  ABWR. 

Operation  Costs 

Operation  costs  are  frequently  expressed  in  terms  of  the  levelized  cost  of  electricity,  which  is  the 
price  per  kilowatt-hour  of  producing  electricity,  including  the  cost  needed  to  cover  operating 
costs  and  annualized  capital  costs.  Overnight  capital  costs  account  for  a  third  of  the  levelized 
cost,  and  interest  costs  on  the  overnight  costs  account  for  another  25  percent  (University  of 
Chicago  2004-TN719).  PSEG  concluded  that  generation  costs  vary  between  7.5  and  8.1  cents 
per  kilowatt-hour  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Fuel  Costs 

From  the  outset,  the  basic  attraction  of  nuclear  energy  has  been  its  low  fuel  costs  when 
compared  to  those  of  coal-,  oil-,  and  gas-fired  plants.  Uranium,  however,  has  to  be  processed, 
enriched,  and  fabricated  into  fuel  elements,  and  about  half  of  the  cost  results  from  enrichment 
and  fabrication.  Allowances  must  also  be  made  for  the  management  of  low-  and  intermediate- 
level  nuclear  wastes  created  as  a  part  of  normal  operations,  management  of  radioactive  spent 
fuel,  and  cost  of  ultimate  disposal  of  this  spent  fuel  or  the  wastes  separated  from  it.  Even  with 
these  costs  included,  the  total  fuel  costs  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  typically  about  a  third  of 
those  for  a  coal-fired  plant  and  between  a  quarter  and  a  fifth  of  those  for  a  combined-cycle 
natural  gas  plant  (WNA  2013-TN2689). 


NUREG-2168 


10-30 


November  2015 


Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


Waste  Disposal 

The  backend  costs  of  nuclear  power  contribute  a  very  small  share  to  total  cost,  both  because  of 
the  long  lifetime  of  a  nuclear  reactor  and  the  fact  that  provisions  for  waste-related  costs  can  be 
accumulated  over  that  time.  It  should  also  be  recognized,  however,  that  radioactive  nuclear 
waste  poses  unique  disposal  challenges  for  long-term  management.  While  spent  fuel  and 
radioactive  nuclear  waste  are  being  stored  successfully  in  onsite  facilities,  the  United  States 
and  other  countries  have  yet  to  implement  final  disposition  of  spent  fuel  or  high-level  radioactive 
waste  streams  created  at  various  stages  of  the  nuclear  fuel  cycle. 

Decommissioning 

Issues  related  to  decommissioning  financial  assurance  will  be  addressed  in  the  NRC  safety 
evaluation  report  for  the  COL  and  are  not  required  during  the  ESP  review  per  10  CFR  52.16 
(TN251 ).  The  NRC  requirements  related  to  reasonable  assurance  that  funds  would  be  available 
for  the  decommissioning  process  are  discussed  in  10  CFR  50.75  (TN249). 

However,  for  the  purposes  of  this  analysis,  the  review  team  notes  that  because  of  the  effect  of 
discounting  the  decommissioning  cost  that  would  occur  as  much  as  40  years  in  the  future, 
decommissioning  costs  have  relatively  little  effect  on  the  levelized  cost  of  electricity  generated 
by  a  nuclear  power  plant  (WNA  2013-TN2689).  Therefore,  the  review  team  estimates  that 
decommissioning  costs  are  between  0.1  and  0.2  cents  per  kilowatt-hour,  which  is  no  more  than 
5  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  electricity  produced  (WNA  2013-TN2689). 

1 0. 6. 2. 2  External  Costs 

External  costs  are  adverse  social  and/or  environmental  effects  caused  by  the  proposed 
construction  and  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site.  This  EIS  includes  the  NRC  staff s  analysis 
that  weighs  the  environmental  impacts  of  construction  and  operations  at  the  PSEG  Site  and 
mitigation  measures  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  these  adverse  impacts. 

Environmental  and  Social  Costs 

Chapter  4  of  this  EIS  describes  the  impacts  on  the  environment  from  building  at  the  PSEG  Site 
with  respect  to  land  use,  air  quality,  water,  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecosystems,  socioeconomics, 
historic  and  cultural  resources,  environmental  justice,  and  nonradiological  and  radiological 
health  effects.  It  also  describes  measures  and  controls  to  limit  adverse  impacts  during  building 
at  the  PSEG  Site.  Chapter  5  examines  the  impacts  on  these  same  topic  areas  associated  with 
operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  40  years,  as  well  as  postulated 
accidents.  The  review  team  also  considered  applicable  measures  and  controls  that  would  limit 
the  adverse  impacts  of  station  operation  during  the  40-year  operating  period. 

Chapter  6  similarly  addresses  the  environmental  impacts  from  (1 )  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  and 
solid-waste  management,  (2)  transportation  of  radioactive  material,  and  (3)  decommissioning 
at  the  PSEG  Site.  Chapter  7  of  this  EIS  places  all  of  the  potential  impacts  of  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  in  the  context  of  all  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  in  the 
general  area.  Chapter  9  includes  the  review  team’s  assessment  of  alternative  sites,  alternative 
power  generation  systems,  and  alternative  cooling  system  designs.  In  Chapter  9.  impacts  were

also  compared  to  the  adverse  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites.  Section  10.2  identifies 
unavoidable  adverse  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  (i.e.,  impacts  after  consideration  of 
proposed  mitigation  actions),  and  Section  10.4  identifies  irretrievable  commitments  of 
resources. 

Unlike  the  situation  when  electricity  is  generated  from  coal  and  natural  gas,  the  normal 
operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  does  not  result  in  significant  emissions  of  criteria  air 
pollutants  (e.g.,  nitrogen  oxides  or  sulfur  dioxide),  methyl  mercury,  or  GHGs  associated  with 
global  warming  and  climate  change.  Chapter  9  of  this  EIS  analyzes  coal-  and  natural-gas-fired 
alternatives  to  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Air 
emissions  from  the  proposed  project  and  its  alternatives  are  summarized  in  Chapters  4  and  5, 
and  Chapter  9,  respectively. 

Table  10-4  summarizes  the  external  costs  associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  Table  4-22  summarizes  the  impacts  from  construction 
and  preconstruction.  The  adverse  impacts  to  surface-water  use  and  quality,  groundwater  use 
and  quality,  aquatic  ecology,  socioeconomics  (with  the  exception  of  road  quality,  aesthetics,  and 
traffic  during  building  activities  near  the  site),  air  quality,  nonradiological  health,  radiological 
health,  and  waste  management  would  all  be  SMALL.  There  could  be  an  indirect  adverse  effect 
to  historic  properties  in  New  Jersey  if  natural  draft  cooling  towers  are  are  selected;  therefore, 
impacts  could  range  from  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  There  would  be  no  construction-, 
preconstruction-,  or  operations-related  environmental  justice  impacts.  Economic  impacts  during 
building  would  all  be  beneficial  and  would  vary  by  county  between  SMALL  and  LARGE. 

Impacts  from  the  NRC  action  (i.e.,  construction  as  defined  in  10  CFR  51.4  [TN250])  and 
operation  of  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  also  be  SMALL.  The  impacts  to  land 
use  would  be  MODERATE  for  preconstruction  activities;  however,  impacts  to  these  resources 
from  the  NRC  portion  of  the  project  would  be  SMALL.  Aesthetic  and  road  impacts  (i.e.,  physical 
socioeconomic  impacts)  would  be  MODERATE  for  preconstruction  activities  as  well  as  for  the 
NRC  portion  of  the  project.  The  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  would  be  SMALL 
to  MODERATE.  The  MODERATE  impact  level  is  based  on  the  impacts  to  108  ac  of  important 
wetland  habitats.  For  traffic  near  the  PSEG  Site  (an  infrastructure  socioeconomic  impact),  the 
review  team  determined  that  the  combined  construction  and  preconstruction  impact  would  be 
MODERATE,  and  the  NRC  portion  of  the  project  would  also  have  a  MODERATE  impact  on 
traffic  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

10.6.3  Summary  of  Benefits  and  Costs 

PSEG’s  business  decision  to  pursue  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would 
be  an  economic  decision  based  on  private  financial  factors  subject  to  regulation  by  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  Board  of  Public  Utilities.  The  internal  costs  of  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  appear  to  be  substantial;  however,  PSEG’s  decision  to  pursue  this  expansion 
would  be  an  indication  that  the  company  had  concluded  that  the  private,  or  internal,  benefits  of 
the  proposed  facility  outweigh  the  internal  costs.  Although  the  identified  societal  benefits  were 
not  specifically  monetized,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  potential  societal  benefits  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  substantial.  In  comparison,  the  external 
socioeconomic  and  environmental  costs  that  would  be  imposed  on  the  region  appear  to  be 
relatively  small.

Conclusions  and  Recommendations 


Table  10-3  and  Table  10-4  include  summaries  of  benefits  and  costs  (internal  and  external)  of 
the  activities  related  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  tables  include 
references  to  other  sections  of  this  EIS  when  more  detailed  analyses  and  impact  assessments 
are  available  for  specific  topics.  The  external  costs  listed  in  Table  10-4  summarize 
environmental  impacts  to  resources  that  could  result  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Because  Table  10-4  includes  costs 
for  preconstruction  activities  and  for  the  NRC-authorized  construction  and  operation,  the  costs 
presented  for  an  individual  resource  may  be  greater  than  the  costs  solely  for  the 
NRC-authorized  portion  of  the  project. 

On  the  basis  of  the  assessments  in  this  EIS.  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site,  with  mitigation  measures  identified  by  the  review  team,  would  accrue  benefits 
that  most  likely  would  outweigh  the  economic,  environmental,  and  social  costs.  For  the 
NRC-proposed  action  (i.e.,  NRC-authorized  construction  and  operation),  the  accrued  benefits 
would  also  outweigh  the  costs  of  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

10.7  Staff  Conclusions  and  Recommendations 

The  NRC  staff  recommendation  to  the  Commission,  after  consideration  of  the  environmental 
impacts  described  in  this  EIS,  is  that  an  ESP  should  be  issued  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County.  New  Jersey.  The  NRC  staff 
evaluation  of  the  safety  and  emergency  preparedness  aspects  of  the  proposed  action  are 
addressed  in  the  NRC  staff  safety  evaluation  report  NRC  2015-TN4369. 

The  NRC  staff  recommendation  is  based  on  (1)the  PSEG  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280); 

(2)  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies;  (3)  the  review  team's 
independent  review;  (4)  the  NRC  staff  consideration  of  public  scoping  comments;  and  (5)  the 
assessments  summarized  in  this  EIS.  including  the  potential  mitigation  measures  identified  in 
the  ER  and  in  this  EIS.  In  addition,  in  making  its  recommendation,  the  NRC  staff  has  concluded 
that  none  of  the  alternative  sites  considered  is  obviously  superior  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site. 

The  NRC  determination  is  independent  of  the  USACE  determination  of  a  LEDPA  pursuant  to 
CWA  Section  404(b)(1)  Guidelines  (40  CFR  Part  230-TN427).  The  USACE  will  conclude  its 
analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite  alternatives  in  its  Record  of  Decision. 

A  comparative  summary  showing  the  environmental  impacts  of  constructing  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  or  at  any  of  the  alternative  sites  is  shown  in 
Section  9. 3. 6.1,  Table  9-24.  This  table  shows  that  the  significance  of  the  environmental  impacts 
of  the  proposed  action  ranges  from  SMALL  to  LARGE  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  at  each  of  the 
alternative  sites,  depending  on  the  resource  category  affected. 

The  range  of  impacts  estimated  by  the  NRC  staff  for  resolved  issues  is  predicated  on  certain 
assumptions  that  are  identified  in  each  section  and  summarized  in  Appendix  J.  If  the 
Commission  issues  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site,  and  if  that  ESP  is  referenced  in  an  application 
for  a  CP  or  COL,  the  NRC  staff  will  verify  that  the  assumptions  identified  in  the  final  EIS  remain 
applicable.  In  addition,  certain  issues  are  not  resolved  because  of  a  lack  of  information.  An

applicant  for  a  CP  or  COL  referencing  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  need  to  provide  the 
necessary  information  to  resolve  these  issues  if  the  proposed  action  ultimately  would  affect  the 
resources  associated  with  these  issues.
