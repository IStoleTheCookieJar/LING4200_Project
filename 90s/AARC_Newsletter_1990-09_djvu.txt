AARC BOARD MEETING 
AUGUST 8, 1990 


ATTENDEES: MIKE-NL7AB, LANCE-AL7BK,ROB-AL7KK, FRED-KL7HFM, 
BILL-AL7BB, RICK-KL7YF, LIL-NL7DL, DIANE-NL7KN, SUSAN-NL7NN, 
MARK-KL7HD, FRED-KL7HM, ED-WL7BOR, ERIC-AL7IM, and ED, SR- 
W6ROW visiting from San Diego, CA. 


The meeting was called to order at 1905 by WL7BOR. 
!!VOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED DESPERATELY FOR MANY CLUB FUNCTIONS!! 


There are volunteers needed for the September Hamfest. (It 
will be best to volunteer because our Chairwoman for the event 
is Susan - NL7NN and she'll get you if you don't look out!) 


A volunteer(s) is(are) also needed for a computerized field 
day. (Check out the next meeting and find out what that is 
about.) 


"James Moody" has been elected to set up a BUNNY HUNT. 
Suggestions were made to include more than one or two persons 
in this event, such as a get-to-gether for the whole family. 
This way it would be a social and bunny hunt combined with 
those not able to hunt for the "BUNNY" being able to join in 
the fun too. Hopefully we will have Mark giving some ideas 
on how to build a variety of antennas to catch the "BUNNY." 


SPEAKERS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CLUB. WHAT CAN YOU OFFER? YOU 
MUST HAVE SOME SPECIALTY THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN! WE'RE 
ALL FRIENDS SO THE SPEECH PART SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEM. ANY 
IDEAS YOU HAVE FOR THE PROGRAM ARE ALSO VERY WELCOME. SPEAK 
UP IT'S YOUR CLUB. 


The will be an upcoming CHINESE AUCTION. The rules will be 
put out in the newsletter. Those who attended the Motley 
Picnic know how interesting that can be. Also is a good way 
to get rid of those items you can't sell at the Flea Market 
in September. 


The HOFBRAU has been chosen again for the Flea Market Banquet. 
Susan, NL7NN and Mike, NL7AB will be selling tickets. Will 
let you know who else at the club meeting. Tickets will be 
$20.00. 


The club has heard from the Iditarod committee in regards to 
the letter from the FCC. A letter will be sent to Alascom in 
regards to our joint participation in that event. 


EQUIPMENT: Harvey, NL7DK is looking in to some equipment that 
might be available from the slope. Anyone going to Johnstone 
Island, if you can get new the dump, there is a lot of coax 
to be had. (Take no baggage, Bring back coax) 


AARC Sept 90/ Pg 3 


There will be an ARES Exercise in October, either the first 
oer second Thursday, per Lil, NL7DL. This one will be from the 
schools nearest your residence. More information can be had 
from her. 


As Diane, NL7NK is storing a lot of the club "goodies" it was 
voted on and passed that she be reimbursed for her expenses. 
Due to lack of room she is storing them away from her 
residence. 


Mark, KL7HD, says the link is working from Cantwell now and 
that the other sites should be ready soon. 


W17BOR, Ed, received a letter from Russia hoping to arrange 
an exchange of hams in 1992 to promote the Lend Lease 
relations between the two nations. KL7HFM Fred made a motion 
to appoint a committee to look into the possibilities. 


The meeting was adjourned at 2033.

Tokyo Rose Continued 


Finally, army investigators and legal advisors decided they no longer 
wished jurisdiction of the case. Although they determined the facts of the 
case technically fell within the definition of treason, another agency such 
as the Justice Department would have to decide whether the case should, as 
distinguished from could, be prosecuted. As its final recommendation, the 
army determined since there were no offenses against military law, there 
was no need for the military to hold Toguri d'Aquino and they recommended 
she be released immediately, however she remained in Sugamo Prison another 
6 months while the civilian bureauocracy made its own investigation. 

In October 1945, FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover, had assigned Special 
Agent Frederick G. Tillman to investigate the Toguri d'Aquino case for the 
Justrice Department. Early in 1946, Tillman arrived in Japan and reviewed 
the case the military had already collected. Toguri d'Aquino presented 
Tillman with a very detailed and unemotional statement in April 1946 
explaining her activities in Tokyo during the War. Tillman forwarded this 
statement to Washington where assistant Attorney General Theron L. Caudle 
passed it to Chief of the Internal Security Section Nathan T. Elliff who 
upon review determined prosecution for treason was unwarranted. Much to 
his credit, in his memorandum Elliff attempted to destroy the myth 
surrounding "Tokyo Rose." He noted the name 'Tokyo Rose' had never been 
used by Radio Tokyo or the Japanese but had been popularized by American 
soldiers in the Pacific. Subsequent investigation proved 10 english 
speaking broadcasters at Radio Tokyo, Manila, and Bangkok were all known as 
"Tokyo Rose." Elliff then went on to review the pecular circumstances 
which had trapped Toguri d'Aquino in Japan following Pearl Harbor and her 
need to find work. He also made note of script material used by Toguri 
d'Aquino which proved her simple role as disc jockey and news reader. 

Although Elliff recommended the case be dropped, he suggested final 
decision await a report by U.S. Attorney James Carter who was also 
considering the case for possible prosecution. Throughout the summer of 
1946 both Caudle and the military pressed Carter for a decision on the 
famous prisoner. Finally, on September 13, 1946 Carter notified the 
Justice Department that he and his staff recommended a treason prosecution 
be declined. Attorney General Tom Clark was notified on September 24 and 
concurred in the decision of his subordinates. On October 1, the War 
Department was advised to release Toguri d'Aquino, however bureaocratic red 
tape delayed her release until October 25. 

Although news of the decision not to prosecute was kept low key, 
Toguri d'Aquino, now pregnant and fearing a hostile reception, decided to 
delay her return to the United States. With apparent wishes to have her 


Tokyo Rose (Continued) AARC' Sept ‘901 / Pg, 7 
baby in the United States, Toguri d'Aquino applied for a passport and 
re-entry to the United States in the fall of 1947 which renewed hostile 
interest in her case. Although Assistant Attorney General T. Vincent Quinn 
offered no objection to the request, news of the request sparked a hostile 
response from veteran's organizations and west coast nativist groups. In 
November 1947, the National Commander of the American Legion demanded a 
prosecution for treason. The chairman of the Native Sons of the Golden 
West Americanism Committee protested to the Justice Department, J. Edgar 
Hoover, the Secretary of State, and others, charging Toguri d'Aquino with 
promoting vicious propaganda during the war. 

If the Justice Department had kept the American public adequately 
informed during Toguri d'Aquino's investigation of the circumstances of her 
broadcasts and the findings of the initial investigation, public pressure 
could have been easily repelled, however public accusations of indifference 
to war criminals caused timid bureaocrats to begin knuckling under. By 
Decemcer, 1947, Toguri d'Aquino's passport had been denied and Assistant 
Attorney General Peyton Ford conducted the reopened investigation and 
promised to submit the findings to a grand jury as soon as the required 2 
witnesses to the treasonous act could be secured. Subsequently, there was 
an appeal for persons who had witnessed the broadcasts or recognized Toguri 
d'Aquino's voice to contact the FBI. 

Although veteran's and patriotic groups continued to bombard the 
Justice Department, the foremost catalyst for prosecution soon became the 
columnist and personality Walter Winchell. Highly respectable, with power 
and influence, Winchell's reports mixed gossip and emotion which satiated 
public desire and promulgated a grass roots cynicisim towards government. 
Winchell's message was simple; if the American Government wished to allow 
Toguri d'Aquino to return to the United States to face prosecution for 
treason, that was all right, otherwise, she should remain in Japan. In 
both his columns and broadcasts, he reiterated this thought and rallied 
public protest against thfe Government's lack of action. In the long run, 
the need for political credibility on the part of Attorney General Tom 
Clark and the Administration made prosecution expedient and Toguri d'Aquino 
expendable. 

On March 20, 1948 investigators scouting Japan located a prospective 
wittness named Hiromi Yagi sho was then employed by the Japan Travel 
Bureau. Yagi also produced an anonymous friend who, although corroborating 
Yagi's story, refused to testify publicly against Toguri d'Aquino, however 
Yagi assured investigators he would convince his friend to testify in the 
ffuture. 

Investigators reinterviewed Toguri d'Aquino on March 26, 1948 and 
confronted her with notes taken by Clark Lee in 1945. Although she 
verified them to be the notes Lee had taken during the interview, she 
refused to sign a statement recognizing the story prepared from those notes 
was the truth. She was also unable to identify any scripts shown to her as 
those she had broadcast during the war, and, most important, she denied

RADIO WAVE _ INTERFERENCE 

Joycelyn Walls, the Public Affairs Specialist in 
the FCC's Baltimore, Maryland, field office has been 
writing a series of bulletins on radio interference aimed 
at the public. Among some of her tips: 


LOCATING ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE: 

Tune a battery operated portable AM radio to an AM 
station. Make sure you are receiving the interference. 
Take the radio with you to your breaker box and shut off 
the main switch. |f the interference remains, the interfer- 
ence is outside of your home and you should contact the 
operations department of your power company. If the 
interference disappears, the interference is in your home 
and you are responsible for correcting the problem. 


To determine where the problem is coming from in your 
home, turn the main breaker back on. Switch off the 
breakers one at a time that control different sections of 
the house while listening for the interference to switch off 
and on in the radio receiver. Once you have determined 
the area where the interference is located, go to each 
electric appliance in that section and unplug each, one 
at a time and listen for the interference to disappear from 
the radio. That will tell you which appliance is the culprit. 
Then have it repaired. 


HANDLING TELEPHONE INTERFERENCE: 
Telephone interference has been increasing now that 
AT&T is separate from the local Bell operating com- 
Panies and more customers are buying their own phone 
equipment. In order to cut costs and be more competi- 
tive, phone equipment companies began leaving out 
many seemingly unimportant devices that helped to at- 
tenuate interference from several different sources and 
the problem of audio rectification. Audio rectification is 
the detection of unwanted modulated AF signals. 


Cheap phones have less than adequate filtering and 
shielding and can transmit interference to other tele- 
phones being used in the home. Expensive program- 
mable phones used most often by businesses have 
many other functions resulting in extreme sensitivity. 
These added functions require extra electrical circuitry 
and are more difficult to filter. 


Disconnect the phone that receives the interference the 
worst, then listen to the other extensions to see if the 
interference is still present. Listen for the call letters of 
the broadcast station you are receiving the interference 
from. Then contact the station to solicit any technical as- 
sistance. Also request advice and filtering methods 
from the telephone company. 


If your residential phone has a modular hook-up, a 
Z100A (desk top) or Z101A (wall model) filter purchased 
from an AT&T phone store should help. (Also available 
by mail order from AT&T's Service Center in St. Louis, 
MO. Tel. 800-222-3111) Radio Shack also markets a 
(Archer #273-104) snap-on-choke filter. A.01 microfarad 
bypass capacitor connected across the microphone unit 


in the telephone handset may eliminate unwanted sig- 
nals. Toroid rings and ferrite beads are also very effec- 
tive filters. 


CB RADIO INTERFERENCE: 

It is necessary to determine which channels are being 
affected if you suspect CB radio operators are the cause 
of your TVI. The problem is typically CB harmonics if 
only TV channels 2 and/or 5 are affected and all other 
VHF channels are undisturbed. The problem is usually 
an overloaded tuner in the television if the inferference 
appears on all VHF channels. CB interference can also 
cause cordless telephones to ring. 


Install a high pass filter on TVs when CB interference is 
suspected, High pass filters reduce the fundamental 
signal strength to a level that the television can handle. 
Keep all cables and wires on electronic devices as 
short as possible. Use shielded grounded coaxial 
cable wherever possible and install .001 microfarad 
capacitors across speaker terminals to stop interfer- 
ence coming through stereo speakers. 


COMMERCIAL RADIO INTERFERENCE: 
Blanketing interference is the ability of an unwanted 
commercial broadcast station to overide the audio of 
radio, television or telephone service. Contact the sta- 
tion to lodge a complaint and solicit assistance. The 
broadcaster will usually be aware of the areas where he 
must provide interference solutions and can provide fil- 
ters free or at cost to take care of difficulties specific to 
his frequency. 


CABLE INTERFERENCE: 

Because the cable system is fed to the subscriber 
through a shielded and grounded cable system from 
another location, subscribers to the cable service 
should not get interference from any local source. How- 
ever, electrical interference, superimposed programing 
and amateur/CB caused voice and herringbone pat- 
terns can occur. 


The most likely reasons for the interference is a break in 
the shielding of the cable allowing stray signals to enter 
the cable system or the circuitry in the affected device 
picks up the signal by means other than the antenna. 


Check all cable connections for tightness. Contact the 
cable company for assistance. If they do not respond, 
contact your local FCC office and the FCC will notify the 
cable company of the leakage and request action to 
resolve the problem. 


COMPUTER INTERFERENCE: 

While minimal, it does exist. The timing mechanism in a 
computer is an oscillator which emits some RF signals. 
The FCC puts levels on these RF emissions. The inter- 
ference can take the form aa herringbone pattern 
through the video or static noise on a radio receiver. A 
label appears on given computer design that has been 
Commission approved for residential or business mar- 
keting.

Don C. Wallace, W6AM 


This book describes the history of amateur 
radio, as experienced by Don Wallace 


He was on the air in 1911, before the first 
radio regulations 


Don was the radio operator for President 
Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference 


He was the winner of the Hoover Cup, for 
the Best home-built Amateur Radio Station 


Don was a charter member of WAC in 1926 


He went on to install 16 rhombic antennas 
on 120 acres in Rolling Hills; at that time 
the largest and most powerful amateur radio 
station in the world. By 1957 W6AM 
achieved the top of the ARRL DXCC 
Honor roll, a spot he occupied most of the 
next 28 years.
