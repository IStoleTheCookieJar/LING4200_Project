1. The Basic Community Profile provides 32 tables containing key Family 
census characteristics of persons, families and dwellings for the following 
geographic levels: CD, SLA, LGA, CED, SED, Uc/L, SSD, SD, S. Dist., 
Postal Area, Suburb, Section of State, State, Australia. It is based 
on place of enumeration. 
Family income 
2. Information was collected from the 1996 Census of Population and 
Housing. 


3. Each table title in the Community Profile consists of two parts. [he 
first part lists the variables included in the table. The second part 
describes the table population. 


Household 


4. Aglossary of terms and concepts used in the Community Profiles 


appears below. 


5. For more information on classifications and Census 
concepts see the 1996 Census Dictionary (Cat No. 2901.0). 


Household income 


6. The 1996 Census was the first census to allow a person's origin to be 
recorded as both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; prior to thig only 
one or the other could be recorded. 


7. Some CEDs cross State and Territory boundaries. The implication of this 
is that State totals derived from CEDs will not equal the official State toNfd 
counts. Therefore State totals will not be provided for the BCP at CED level. 
Overseas visitor 
8. Employed ‘full-time’ means that the person worked 35 hours or}more 
in all jobs during the week prior to Census night. Employed 'part-time' 
means that the person worked less than 35 hours in all jobs during the 
week prior to Census night. 


9. For Census purposes, people who stated they were employed, but 


worked zero hours in the week prior to Census night have been coded Place of 
‘employed part-time’. enumeration

10. A family is defined as two or more persons, one of whom is at le 
15 years of age, who are related by blood, marriage (registered or d 
facto), adoption, step or fostering, and who are usually resident in tt 
same household. Family tables include same sex couples. 


11. Family income is the sum of the personal incomes of each resid 
family member aged 15 years and over. Family income is not 
applicable to non-family households such as group households or Ic 
person households; or to people in non-private dwellings. 


12. Ahousehold is defined as a group of two or more related or unr 
people who usually reside in the same dwelling, who regard themse 
as a household, and who make common provision for food or other 
essentials for living; or a person living in a dwelling who makes 
provision for his/her own food and other essentials for living, withot 
combining with any other person. 


13. For Census purposes, the total number of households is equal t« 
total number of occupied private dwellings. 


14. Household income is the sum of the personal incomes of each 
resident household member aged 15 years and over. If any househ 
member did not state their income, or was temporarily absent, 
household income is not calculated. These households fall into the 
‘Partial income stated’ category. 


15. Nfd means 'not further defined’. 


16. In the 1996 Census, overseas visitors were treated differently 
compared to previous censuses. In 1996, age, sex and registered 
marital status were the only person variables recorded for overseas 
whereas in previous censuses, information on all topics at the perso 
was recorded. For further information please contact the ABS and r 
a copy of Census Fact Sheet 15. 


17. The Census count, based on place of enumeration, is a count of 
person who spent Census night in Australia. People are counted wh 
they are on Census night, which may not be where they usually live.

18. A Postal Area of CD of Enumeration is formed by aggregating who DATA QUALITY (cont'd) 


collection districts (CDs) that fall within physical boundaries of a pdstcode 

ona best fit basis. As the name implies, the data are supplied Random 

on a place of enumeration basis. This series excludes non-mappable Adjustment 
Australia Post postcodes e.g. post office box postcodes, some 
postcodes which are delivery routes which are also covered by other 

postcodes (a situation which often occurs in rural areas) and some Respondent error 
postcodes which, because of the application of the ‘best fit' principle, do 

not get a CD allocated to them. A listing of alternative postal area 
allocations is available from ABS offices. 


Undercount 


19. Some Postal Areas cover CDs in more than one State or Territdry 

boundary. The implication of this is that State totals derived from Postal 

Areas will not equal the official State total counts. Therefore, Stata totals 

are not provided for the BCP at Postal Area level. Household Income 
(HIND) and Family 
20. Table population is a description of what the table is counting ForIncome(FINF) 
example, tables containing marital status usually have a table population 

of persons aged 15 years and over. It appears under the table title. 


21. In the 1996 Census, the number of categories has increased and now 
includes 'being purchased under a rent/buy scheme’, 'being occupjed 
rent free’ and 'being occupied under a life tenure scheme’. 


22. The Census is subject to a number of inaccuracies resulting fram 
errors by respondents or mistakes in collection or processing of thie data. 
Some of these are overcome or 'repaired' by careful processing 
procedures and quality management of the processing itself. The 
effect of those that remain is generally slight, although it may be 
important for small groups in the population. The main kinds 

of error to keep in mind are: 


ore 
Usual Residence 

23. In some cases where an answer was not provided to a questio 

an answer was imputed or derived (often from other information on 

the form). In other cases a 'not stated’ code was allocated. 

24. While such errors can occur in any processing system, quality 


management is used to continuously improve the quality of proce$sed 
data, and to identify and correct data of unacceptable quality. 


Page 8 


25. Cells containing small values are randomly adjusted to avoid 
releasing information about particular individuals, families or house 
The effect of random adjustment is statistically insignificant. 


26. Processing procedures cannot detect or repair all errors made k 
persons in completing the form, therefore some may remain in final 


27. Although the Census aims to count each person once, there are 
some people who are missed and others who are counted more tha 
once. A post enumeration survey is conducted soon after the Censu 
to measure the undercount. 


28. Due to operational limitations, the family/household income im| 
methodology may result in an undercount of the number of families 
households in the $1,500 - $1,999 range and a balancing overcount 
$2,000 range. No other income ranges are affected. This may also « 
the median income estimate if the median falls in either of these rar 


29. The calculation of median income is based on imputations made 
from the Survey of Income and Housing Costs, and as such is subjec 
sampling error. This is particularly evident if the median falls into tr 
highest income range, where the quoted median is a proxy only anc 
should be regarded with caution. 


30. For explanation of these issues and the technical imputation of 
dollar ranges, please contact the ABS and request a copy of Census 
Fact Sheet 7 - Income Imputation. 


31. Aminor processing error has been identified in the variables Us 
Residence Indicator 1 year ago (UAI1P) and Usual Residence Indicat« 
years ago (UAI5P). For further information on the nature and extent 
error, please contact the ABS and request a copy of Census Fact She
