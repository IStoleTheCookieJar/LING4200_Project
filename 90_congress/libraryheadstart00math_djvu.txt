A  Library  Head  Start  to  Literacy:  The  Resource  Notebook  for 
the  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership 


Virginia  H.  Mathews 


Susan  Roman 


Foreword 


The  Center  for  the  Book  in  the  Library  of  Congress  was  established  by  law  in  1977  to 
stimulate  public  interest  in  books,  reading,  and  libraries.  A  small  and  catalytic  office,  it  fulfills  its 
mission  primarily  through  a  network  of  36  affiliated  state  centers  (with  more  on  the  way)  and  a 
reading  promotion  partners  program  that  includes  more  than  50  national  educational  and  civic 
organizations.  For  information  about  the  Center  for  the  Book  and  its  activities,  visit  its  Web  site 
at  www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook. 

The  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  Project,  administered  by  the  center  from 
1992  to  1997,  has  been  one  of  the  centers  most  successful  endeavors.  Combining  the  resources 
and  talents  of  the  Head  Start  Bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  the 
Association  for  Library  Services  to  Children,  a  division  of  the  American  Library  Association,  and, 
after  1994,  the  Association  of  Youth  Museums,  the  project  demonstrated  across  the  country  how 
libraries  and  museums  that  serve  young  children  can  work  closely  with  Head  Start  grantees  and 
classroom  teachers. 

This  resource  notebook  helps  extend  the  partnerships  formed  during  the  project  at  both 
the  national  and  community  levels.  The  Center  for  the  Book  is  grateful  to  the  notebook's  two 
authors,  Virginia  H.  Mathews  and  Susan  Roman,  for  a  job  well  done.  Consultant  Virginia 
Mathews  served  as  coordinator  of  the  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Project.  Susan  Roman  is 
executive  director  of  the  Association  for  Library  Service  to  Children.  Thanks  also  go  to  Center 
for  the  Book  program  specialist  Anne  Boni  for  her  support  and  to  Barbara  Hart  and  the  staff  of 
Publications  Professionals,  Inc.  of  Annandale,  VA  for  help  in  preparing  the  notebook. 

As  the  authors  explain  in  greater  detail  in  their  preface,  "everything  in  this  resource 
notebook  may  be  used  to  the  fullest:  program  activity,  lists  of  materials,  tips  on  how  to  encourage 
family  literacy  and  to  help  a  child  enjoy  reading,  definitions,  research  cited-everything." 

Materials  may  be  copied  for  educational  use  and  for  use  by  non-profit  organizations  provided  that 
original  sources  are  cited  and  that  appropriate  credit  is  given  to  this  resource  notebook.  Materials 
may  not  be  copied  or  used  by  commercial  organizations  or  in  publications  intended  for  sale.

Preface 


Background  of  the  Partnership 

The  Library-Head  Start  Partnership  has  been  administered  from  1992  to  1997 
by  the  Center  for  the  Book  in  the  Library  of  Congress.  It  resulted  from  a  proposal 
requested  by  the  Head  Start  Bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services  following  a  symposium  that  addressed  the  potential  of  partnerships  be¬ 
tween  libraries  and  other  agencies  serving  young  children  and  families  and  was 
held  at  the  Library  of  Congress  in  November  1989.  Program  officers  who  had 
attended  this  symposium  returned  with  enthusiasm  for  the  possible  benefits  to 
Head  Start  children,  parents,  and  teachers  of  a  close  collaboration  with  children’s 
librarians  and  with  library  services  and  resources.  An  interagency  agreement 
between  the  Center  for  the  Book  and  the  Head  Start  Bureau  was  signed  and  ready 
to  be  implemented  in  May  1992. 

Collaboration  with  Association  for  Library  Service  to 
Children 

The  partnership  project  was  carried  out  from  the  beginning  with  the  collabo¬ 
ration  of  the  Association  for  Library  Service  to  Children,  a  division  of  the  58,000- 
member  American  Library  Association.  After  the  Association  of  Youth  Museums 
joined  the  collaboration  in  1994,  its  members  and  other  youth-serving  personnel 
from  museum  staffs  participated  in  the  workshops. 

The  project  was  designed  to  demonstrate  in  communities  across  the  country 
how  libraries  that  serve  young  children  can  plan  and  work  with  Head  Start  grant¬ 
ees  and  classroom  teachers  to  enhance  learning  and  to  involve  parents  and  other 
primary  caregivers  and  families  in  children’s  literacy  and  language  development. 

Planning 

A  planning  meeting  was  held  in  July  1992  with  40  participants  from  more 
than  30  states.  The  product  of  this  intensive  3-day  effort  was  a  set  of  guidelines 
for  producing  a  proposed  video  and  for  developing  state  or  regional  workshops, 
along  with  written  materials  such  as  this  resource  book  and  a  training  guide  for 
use  with  the  video.  Leaders  from  both  Head  Start  and  libraries  were  solidly  be¬ 
hind  the  concept  and  its  potentials.

The  multimedia  package  produced  to  support  the  development  and  operation 
of  the  partnership  encourages  Head  Start  teachers,  home  visitors,  aides,  volun¬ 
teers,  parents,  and  other  primary  caregivers  and  families  to  integrate  books  and 
other  library  resources  and  services  into  the  day-to-day  learning  experiences  of 
the  child  and  to  build  bridges  between  Head  Start  and  the  child’s  home.  A  major 
goal  has  been  to  develop  a  network  of  library — and  later  museum  and  other — 
learning  resources  that  are  based  in  the  community  and  are  geared  to  support 
Head  Start  staff  members  and  parents.  The  network  will  ensure  that  when 
preschoolers  reach  school  age,  they  are  well  prepared  and  have  the  basic  concepts 
and  skills  that  will  enable  them  to  succeed  in  school  and  to  build  a  strong 
foundation  for  lifelong  learning. 

Those  of  us  who  projected  this  vision  knew  from  the  start  that  we  were  not  in¬ 
venting  a  totally  new  relationship  between  Head  Start  and  libraries.  The  two  had 
interacted  since  Head  Start  began  in  1965.  Such  relationships  were  usually  be¬ 
tween  individual  classroom  teachers  who  happened  to  be  near  an  interested  li¬ 
brary  branch,  and  the  interactions  were  apt  to  be  sporadic  and  haphazard — a 
matter  of  chance  rather  than  routine.  Without  a  commitment  or  planning  from  the 
top  and  without  institutionalization,  these  collaborations  ceased  with  staff 
changes.  The  partnership  project’s  endeavor  has  been  to  strengthen  relationships 
where  they  existed,  multiply  them  throughout  Head  Start,  and  formalize  them. 
Raised  to  a  higher  level  on  the  joint  agenda  of  both  Head  Start  grantees  and 
libraries,  these  partnerships  can  and  have  become,  in  many  instances,  part  of  the 
expectations  of  parents,  children,  teachers,  and  other  staff  members  in  Head  Start, 
as  well  as  those  of  libraries  and  youth-serving  museums.  Before  the  partnership 
project,  there  had  been  no  instances — as  far  as  we  have  been  able  to  tell — in 
which  library  resources  and  services  had  been  related  specifically  to  Head  Start 
priorities  such  as  family  literacy;  parent  involvement  in  children’s  learning; 
training  to  help  parents  become  involved;  and  technical  assistance  to  teachers, 
aides,  and  volunteers — who  are  often  parents  of  children  in  the  classroom. 

The  Video 

Immediately  after  the  planning  meeting  of  July  1992,  Dr.  John  Y.  Cole, 

Center  for  the  Book  Director  and  Project  Director;  Virginia  H.  Mathews,  Project 
Coordinator;  and  Dr.  Susan  Roman,  Consultant  to  the  Project  and  Executive 
Director  of  the  Association  for  Library  Service  to  Children  (the  children’s  service 
division  of  the  American  Library  Association),  prepared  requirements  for  the 
video.  Using  our  criteria,  the  Library  of  Congress’s  contracts  and  logistics  office 
selected  the  producer:  Video  Software  Associates  of  Arlington,  Virginia.  Work 
began  in  the  fall  of  1992,  resulting  in  a  script  so  shooting  could  begin  before  the 
end  of  the  year.

Preface 


We  carefully  chose  sites  with  a  view  to  true  multiculturalism:  an  attractive  but 
typical  Head  Start  classroom,  and  an  excellent  urban  public  library.  All  on-site 
shooting  was  done  at  the  Viers  Mill  Elementary  School  in  Montgomery  County, 
Maryland,  and  at  the  Martin  Luther  King  main  library  of  the  Washington,  D.C., 
public  library  system.  We  sought  material  from  other  sites  and  used  it  by  permis¬ 
sion.  At  Viers  Mill  School,  the  overall  student  population  is  highly  diverse,  and 
more  than  half  the  children  are  below  the  poverty  line.  This  Head  Start  site  had 
both  a  morning  and  an  afternoon  shift  with  different  aides  and  had  a  set  of  parent 
volunteers  for  each  shift.  The  teacher  was  creative,  warm,  and  ebullient.  She  took 
naturally  to  her  library  partner,  the  attractive  and  competent  head  of  the  Martin 
Luther  King  library’s  children’s  services.  With  the  “rough  cut”  approved  by  the 
Head  Start  Bureau  staff  in  April  1993,  the  Head  Start  Bureau  was  able  to  ship 
copies  of  the  video  and  the  accompanying  guidebook  directly  to  Head  Start  grant¬ 
ees  and  delegate  agencies  by  the  end  of  September.  Viewing  the  video  is  key  to 
understanding  what  the  partnership  is  about. 

Because  not  everyone  who  has  and  uses  this  resource  book  will  have  a  copy  of 
the  video  or  the  guidebook  that  is  used  with  the  video,  we  will  include  portions 
within  this  book.  See  Appendix  B  for  the  script  plus  Chapter  5  for  additional  in¬ 
formation  about  using  the  video  with  workshops  and  Chapter  6  for  other  types  of 
groups.  Below  we  give  you  information  about  what  the  video  is  intended  to 
convey. 

The  video,  titled  “The  Library-Head  Start  Partnership,”  accomplishes  the 
following,  both  visually  and  in  words: 

•  Demonstrates  and  encourages  development  of  a  “print-rich”  classroom 

•  Highlights  what  libraries  who  serve  children  do,  and  how  they  do  it 

•  Shows  how  books  help  to  individualize  learning  experiences  and  stimulate 
inquiry 

•  Demonstrates  that  books,  plus  programming  with  books,  provide  a  means  for 
parents  to  become  more  closely  involved  in  children’s  imaginings,  fears,  and 
interests 

•  Indicates  how  exposure  to  and  familiarity  with  books  sets  the  stage  for  helping 
3-  to  5 -year-olds  get  ready  to  learn  to  read  for  themselves 

•  Shows  how  books,  carefully  fitted  to  individuals,  can  help  develop  emotional 
perspectives,  self-esteem,  confidence,  a  desire  to  share  ideas,  and  a  sense  of 
sequence  and  order 

•  Highlights  the  potential  for  family  literacy  and  shows  how  parents  can  easily 
become  involved  in  being  models  of  reading  enjoyment  and  also  in  bridging 
the  learning  process  from  home  to  classroom  and  back  again 

•  Shows  how  library  programs  can  spin  out  from  the  children  to  other  areas  and 
spill  over  to  become  resources  for  the  whole  family

•  Depicts  settings — real  and  imaginary — and  different  kinds  of  characters;  also 
shows  interactions  of  people  of  different  cultures,  genders,  and  ages  to  give 
children  a  sense  of  a  world  much  wider  than  the  one  they  live  in 

•  Relates  words,  concepts,  and  critical-thinking  skills  to  all  areas  of  the  cur¬ 
riculum  in  the  education  program  and  to  other  Head  Start  components 

•  Provides  ideas  about  how  librarians  and  Head  Start  staff  members,  parents, 
and  volunteers  can  use  books  and  other  media  to  reinforce  and  expand  every¬ 
day  activities  in  the  classroom  and  at  home 

•  Demonstrates  how  when  children  recognize  themselves  and  their  own  feelings 
and  experiences  within  books,  that  recognition  helps  them  overcome  a  sense 
of  isolation  and  become  more  articulate 

•  Shows  how  books  and  other  materials  can  help  children  examine  and  discuss 
opposing  viewpoints  and  compromises,  how  characters  made  choices,  and 
how  problems  were  solved 

•  Shows  how  the  library  books  and  other  provided  materials  lend  perspective  to 
the  child’s  place  in  history,  race,  ethnic  group,  and  family 

•  Shows  librarians  and  Head  Start  staff  members,  who  team  with  parents,  how 
books  help  children  to  make  choices,  to  compare  and  contrast,  and  to  predict 
and  analyze. 

•  Shows  books  and  stories  that  inspire  children  to  use  words  and  pictures  to 
create  stories  of  their  own 

The  Resource  Manual 

We  began  work  on  the  resource  manual  immediately  following  the  1992  plan¬ 
ning  meeting.  We  outlined  the  contents  and  began  to  prepare  materials  that  would 
be  needed  for  the  workshops.  At  the  same  time  the  video  was  being  created,  we 
developed  the  general  plan  for  the  workshops,  including  content,  location,  and 
means  of  selecting  the  participants.  The  resource  manual  became  a  work  in  prog¬ 
ress  and  was  added  to  with  each  workshop  that  took  place.  Not  only  have  we  in¬ 
cluded  material  that  was  prepared  by  the  project  leaders  and  by  workshop  speak¬ 
ers  and  panelists,  but  also  this  manual  contains  much  that  was  obtained  from  other 
sources.  Most  important,  the  manual’s  content  has  been  immensely  enriched  and 
expanded  by  hundreds  of  pieces  of  material  brought  to  the  workshops  by  hun¬ 
dreds  of  participants.  We  used  and  tried  out  a  wealth  of  material  at  the  various 
workshops  so  we  could  include  the  most  useful  pieces. 

The  Workshops 

Throughout  the  years  in  which  workshops  took  place  (1993-1996),  our  most 
absorbing  task  was  selecting  participants.  Our  goal  for  each  workshop  was  an 
equal,  or  as  close-to-equal  as  possible,  number  of  participants  from  each  of  the 
partner  agencies.  In  our  final  selection  of  participants,  we  used  lists  from  many 
sources,  as  well  as  many  criteria  such  as  geography,  urban  or  rural  mix,  and

Preface 


demographics.  Above  all,  our  process  sought  to  arrange  attendance  by  teams  from 
the  same  localities  so  they  could  work  together  later.  We  sent  invitations  to  the 
directors  of  Head  Start  grantee  agencies,  and  those  directors  often  elected  to  come 
to  the  workshop  themselves.  If  directors  could  not  attend,  education  coordinators, 
family  literacy  coordinators,  parent  involvement  coordinators,  and  sometimes  so¬ 
cial  service  and  health  coordinators  participated  most  often.  Head  Start  partici¬ 
pants  usually  had  leadership  responsibility  in  areas  of  supervision  and  training.  As 
a  rule,  we  sent  invitations  directly  to  children’s  librarians  and  they  arranged  for 
necessary  permissions  to  participate. 

The  first  multistate  workshop  was  held  in  Sacramento  in  December  1993.  The 
video  was  ready  to  be  used  at  the  opening  session,  as  it  was  in  all  subsequent 
workshops,  to  introduce  the  partnership  and  to  start  the  discussion.  The  44  partici¬ 
pants  came  from  the  states  of  Alaska,  California,  Idaho,  Montana,  Nevada, 
Oregon,  and  Washington.  One  or  two  came  from  Arizona  and  New  Mexico.  The 
second  multistate  regional  workshop  took  place  in  March  1994  in  Richmond, 
Virginia,  and  included  79  participants  from  21  eastern  states  and  the  District  of 
Columbia.  The  workshop  could  accommodate  only  three  or  four  persons  from 
each  state  because  we  had  so  many  states  to  cover.  However,  we  felt  that  these 
large  regional  meetings  were  good  introductions  to  the  concept  of  the  partnership 
and  helped  ensure  that  every  state  knew  about  it  from  the  beginning  and  had  some 
opportunity  to  take  part.  Also  these  early  meetings  stimulated  spin-off  workshops 
and  planning  as  the  word  spread  throughout  the  country.  In  May  1994,  the  third 
multistate  workshop  was  held  in  Topeka,  Kansas,  and  had  76  participants  from  19 
states  in  the  middle  of  the  country  and  the  Southwest. 

Joint  Partnership  with  Association  of  Youth  Museums 

In  the  spring  of  1994,  the  Center  for  the  Book  was  asked  to  include  members 
of  the  Association  of  Youth  Museums  in  the  training  workshops  so  museum  di¬ 
rectors  and  education  coordinators  could  join  with  the  team  of  Head  Start  and  li¬ 
brary  personnel  at  each  locality.  In  July  1994,  an  introductory  meeting  of  Center 
staff  and  Head  Start  staff  members,  along  with  several  leaders  of  the  Association 
of  Youth  Museums,  was  held  at  the  Library  of  Congress.  In  September,  a  much 
larger  planning  conference  was  held  in  Washington,  D.C.,  to  discuss  integrating 
the  museums  into  the  ongoing  project.  More  than  60  people  participated.  Plans 
were  made  to  include  museums  in  the  two  workshops  being  developed  for  1995 
and  in  all  subsequent  ones,  should  funding  be  available. 

Expanded  Partnership  Workshops 

The  first  workshop  of  the  expanded  partnership  was  unique  in  at  least  two  re¬ 
spects:  it  was  the  first  planned  for  a  single  state,  and  it  was  the  first  in  which  mu¬ 
seum  staff  members  would  be  included.  Held  in  Orlando,  Florida,  in  February,  the 


Preface

initial  workshop  for  1995  was  declared  an  immense  success  in  terms  of  scope, 
content,  presentation,  and  motivation.  Participating  were  29  Head  Start  leaders, 

31  library  leaders,  and  16  museum  leaders,  plus  representatives  from  the  Regional 
Office  of  Head  Start  (Region  IV),  the  partner  agency  personnel,  and  the  Florida 
Center  for  the  Book.  Head  Start  Indian  and  Migrant  programs  were  both  repre¬ 
sented,  as  were  a  number  of  complete  partnership  teams  (Head  Start,  museum, 
and  library)  from  city  and  rural  areas.  As  we  had  suspected,  the  single-state 
framework  was  by  far  the  most  productive  and  satisfactory  one  with  which  to 
work.  First,  participants  within  each  group  knew  each  other  (Head  Start  people 
knew  other  Head  Start  people,  and  so  on).  They  set  forth  to  get  acquainted  with 
the  goals  and  operations  of  the  other  groups  with  a  high  degree  of  eagerness. 
Museum  staff  people  seemed  as  delighted  to  find  commonalities  of  purpose  in  the 
librarians  and  Head  Start  people  as  we  had  previously  found  those  groups  to  be 
when  encountering  each  other!  A  second  outstanding  asset  for  the  single-state 
format  was  the  chance  to  have  as  panelists  and  group  discussion  facilitators  peo¬ 
ple  who  represented  the  related  statewide  leadership  from  the  state  education 
agency,  a  child  development  expert  from  the  university,  and  the  president  of  a 
state  organization  (Kiwanis).  Finally,  and  perhaps  most  significant  of  all,  was  that 
state  leadership  was  in  place  (the  head  of  youth  services  on  the  state  library  staff 
and  Head  Start  collaboration  people)  and  could  provide  continuing  guidance  and 
follow-up  opportunities. 

In  the  two  subsequent  workshops  during  1995,  youth  museum  personnel  par¬ 
ticipated  and  contributed  greatly  to  both  through  their  materials  prepared  for  dis¬ 
tribution,  ideas,  and  early  planning  with  members  of  the  other  two  groups  in  their 
locality.  The  second  1995  workshop  was  held  in  Minneapolis  in  April.  We  sought 
to  gauge  the  viability  of  a  workshop  that  included  all  the  states  of  a  federal  region: 
Region  V,  which  is  headquartered  in  Chicago.  The  workshop  included  librarians, 
Head  Start  staff  members,  and  youth  museum  staffs  from  Illinois,  Indiana, 
Michigan,  Minnesota,  and  Ohio.  The  Head  Start  administrator  for  Region  V  par¬ 
ticipated  fully  and  enthusiastically  on  both  days  and  provided  a  sense  of  frame¬ 
work  and  continuity  of  interest  on  a  regional  basis. 

It  is  of  interest  to  note  that  even  before  our  alliance  with  the  youth  museums, 
we  had  chosen  to  have  our  “festive  night  out”  at  the  end  of  the  workshop’s  first 
day  of  meeting  at  a  museum.  This  approach  began  with  our  Topeka  workshop  for 
the  central  midwest  states  in  1994  during  which  the  Western  History  Museum 
opened  its  doors  for  a  delightful  dinner  that  was  exclusively  for  the  partnership 
workshop  and  was  served  chuckwagon  style  to  our  participants.  This  pattern  pre¬ 
vailed  at  all  subsequent  workshops  and  provided  some  hands-on  museum  experi¬ 
ences  for  all  participants.  At  all  five  workshops  in  which  youth  museum  staff 
members  participated  (1995-1996),  participants  were  eager  and  were  delighted 
with  the  potentials  of  the  three-way  partnerships  with  Head  Start  and  libraries  and 
full  contributors  during  and  after  the  workshops.

Preface 


The  third  workshop  held  in  1995  was  in  Austin,  Texas,  in  December.  Again, 
this  workshop  sought  to  explore  the  extraordinary  potential  of  the  project.  This 
partnership  could  penetrate  even  in  a  single  state  the  size  of  Texas  and  could 
nearly  saturate  people’s  awareness  of  the  partnership  and  could  gain  concerted 
local  action.  During  this  workshop,  we  readily  found  many  a  three-way  match  in 
localities  among  librarians,  Head  Start  staff  members,  and  youth  museum  staff 
members.  Because  of  distances,  many  participants  elected  to  contact  each  other  in 
advance.  In  some  cases,  they  made  plans  before  the  workshop,  and  in  many  cases, 
they  arranged  to  carpool  to  Austin.  The  selection  process  broke  down  under  the 
eagerness  of  those  who  wanted  to  participate,  and  we  ended  up  with  about  100 
participants  instead  of  the  more  usual  80  or  so.  Again,  we  were  able  to  include 
many  related  leadership  people  from  within  the  state.  Our  belief  that  a  single 
statewide  workshop  was  the  most  productive  format  was  reaffirmed.  The  state 
group  of  75-100  was  large  enough  to  present  numerous  situations  and  possibili¬ 
ties,  each  structured  within  a  framework  that  was  familiar  to  all  participants  and 
yet  large  enough  to  offer  new  vistas. 

We  offered  two  more  workshops  in  1996.  Each  involved  pairs  of  states:  one  in 
the  Southwest,  and  the  other  in  the  plains  states.  The  Arizona-New  Mexico  work¬ 
shop  was  held  February  29-March  1,  1996,  in  Scottsdale,  Arizona.  The  Colorado- 
Wyoming  workshop  was  held  in  Denver  on  September  5  and  6,  1996.  Wyoming, 
sparsely  populated  as  it  is  and  with  relatively  few  Head  Starts,  museums,  or 
libraries,  had  some  20  persons  who  represented  all  three  components.  For  these 
last  two  workshops,  participation  again  edged  near  the  1 00  mark  because,  as  so 
many  invitees  told  us,  this  was  a  rare  and  wonderful  professional  opportunity  for 
them. 

From  the  first  of  the  1995  round  of  workshops,  it  seemed  that  word  about  the 
partnership  project  and  the  workshops  had  “gotten  around,”  and  that  participation 
was  highly  anticipated.  Participants  during  1995-1996  came  prepared  to  “show 
and  tell”  and  to  meet  their  new  partners  eagerly.  Participants  either  sent  ahead  or 
brought  with  them  cartons  full  of  material  to  be  shared;  much  of  this  material  has 
found  its  way  into  this  resource  notebook. 

Use  of  This  Notebook 

Everything  in  this  notebook  may  be  used  to  the  fullest:  program  activity  sug¬ 
gestions,  lists  of  materials,  tips  on  how  to  encourage  family  literacy  and  help  a 
child  enjoy  reading,  definitions,  research  cited — everything.  You  may  copy  and 
use  these  materials  as  long  as  you  give  original  sources.  One  of  the  most  magical 
and  meaningful  things  about  Head  Start  is  that  everybody  gets  in  the  act:  children, 
parents,  caregivers,  families,  teachers,  aides,  and  volunteers.  The  result  is  that 
everybody  wins.  Parents  and  other  family  members  are  given  the  opportunity  to 


Preface

link  what  goes  on  in  the  Head  Start  program  with  what  goes  on  at  home.  The  re¬ 
sult  is  that  other  siblings  are  enriched,  and  parents  feel  greatly  empowered. 

Nothing  in  this  notebook  is  set  in  concrete  or  stone.  It  has  been  designed  in 
loose-leaf  format  because  it  is  a  work  in  progress.  If  an  activity  doesn’t  work  for 
you,  please  disregard  it.  If  an  adaptation  fits  your  needs,  please  adapt  it.  You  can 
add  other  materials  as  you  come  across  them  and  can  keep  the  information  pool 
growing.  You  should  clip  things  from  newspapers  and  magazines  and  should 
write  down  useful  quotes  from  TV  or  things  you  see  on  the  Internet.  When  you  go 
to  meetings,  pick  up  materials  and  then  stash  things  you  can  use  in  the  back  of 
this  notebook.

Preface 


A  child  is  a  person  who  is  going  to 
carry  on  what  you  have  started.  He  is 
going  to  sit  where  you  are  sitting,  and 
when  you  are  gone,  attend  to  those 
things  which  you  think  are  important. 

You  may  adopt  all  the  policies  you 
please,  but  how  they  are  carried  out 
depends  on  him.  He  will  assume 
control  of  your  cities,  states,  and 
nation.  He  is  going  to  move  in  and 
take  over  your  churches,  schools, 
universities,  and  corporations. ... 
The  fate  of  humanity  is  in  his  hands.

Introduction 


Definition  of  Literacy 

The  definition  of  literacy  has  changed,  developed,  and  become  more  sophisti¬ 
cated  during  the  twentieth  century.  Even  at  the  beginning  of  this  century  and  for 
hundreds  of  years  before,  the  great  majority  of  people  had  little  need  for  high  lev¬ 
els  of  literacy.  If  they  could  sign  their  names  plus  read  signs  and  simple  messages, 
that  knowledge  was  often  sufficient.  Long  before  “sound  bites”  on  TV,  newspa¬ 
pers  with  mass  circulation  depended  on  what  might  be  called  “sound  bites  in 
print.”  Large  headlines  carried  important  news  to  many  low-level  readers;  news¬ 
boys  carried  handbills  to  give  out  and  shouted  headlines  on  street  comers.  At  a 
time  when  most  children  did  not  attend  school  beyond  the  sixth  grade,  a  sixth 
grade  level  of  literacy  was  considered  basic  literacy.  A  good  farmer  or  a  man  run¬ 
ning  a  small  business,  like  the  workers  he  hired,  did  not  need  the  literacy  required 
of  professionals  or  scholars. 

Yet,  there  was  always  a  core  of  people  who  loved  to  read.  As  with  everything 
else,  the  more  you  do  something  you  enjoy,  the  better  you  get  at  doing  it.  Librar¬ 
ies  were  founded  in  North  America  during  colonial  times.  The  Founding  Fathers 
were  readers — the  thinkers,  planners,  and  policymakers  like  Jefferson,  Madison, 
Franklin,  and  Adams — as  were  those  who  fanned  the  starting  flames  of  revolution 
like  Tom  Paine.  For  such  people,  reading  has  always  meant  more  than  merely  de¬ 
coding  (figuring  out  what  the  letters  spelled);  it  meant  being  able  to  put  into 
words  one’s  thoughts  and  ideas,  along  with  the  meaning  of  experience.  For  such 
people,  reading  means  the  opportunity  to  compare  their  feelings  and  problems 
with  those  of  others  and  to  leam  from  others’  decisions  and  solutions.  As  most 
men  became  engrossed  in  struggling  to  carve  a  country  out  of  a  mgged  wilder¬ 
ness,  reading  came  to  be  associated  more  with  women,  who  made  time  to  read  the 
Bible  and  other  works  and  who,  before  the  advent  of  formal  schooling,  cared  for 
educating  the  children.  Books  were  precious  possessions  to  many,  hallmarks  of 
civilization  that  occupied  the  limited  space  in  many  a  covered  wagon  going  west. 

It  is  estimated  that  from  20  percent  to  25  percent  of  today’s  population  has  not 
fully  mastered  basic  literacy  enough  to  show  competence  in  reading  materials  at  a 
sixth  grade  level.  A  portion  of  those  cannot  read  at  all,  and  a  large  proportion  of 
our  illiterate  and  semi-literate  population  is  in  correctional  institutions.  Further¬ 
more,  nearly  one-half  of  today’s  Americans  fall  short  of  what  may  be  called 
“leadership  literacy.”  They  do  not  read  well  enough  to  help  them  shape  their 
thoughts  in  writing  or  in  spoken  language.  Full  command  of  language  in  all  its 


11 


forms  bestows  self-confidence,  breadth  of  vision  and  perspective,  understanding 
of  cause  and  effect,  the  capacity  to  tolerate  ambiguity  and  delayed  gratification, 
and  many  other  life  skills.  Reading  broadens  the  sense  of  options;  it  makes  one 
alert  to  opportunities  and  the  existence  of  alternatives.  Being  only  partially  literate 
is  a  huge  strike  against  success  in  today’s  society.  The  lack  of  high-level  literacy 
and  related  thinking  skills — after  all  we  think  in  words — is  only  just  now  being 
recognized  as  a  serious  deficit. 

Adult  Basic  Literacy 

Adult  education  programs,  connected  mainly  with  schools,  offer  training  in 
adult  basic  literacy.  Many  companies  provide  remedial  training  for  adult  workers 
so  that  they  can  do  their  jobs.  Several  national  volunteers-for-literacy  groups  co¬ 
ordinate  and  train  teachers  who,  in  turn,  teach  individuals  to  read.  Incentive  and 
motivation  and,  therefore,  retention  seem  to  be  a  difficulty  in  many  of  these  pro¬ 
grams.  People  can  be  taught  to  read  and  still  not  become  readers.  Practice  is  es¬ 
sential  until  reading  becomes  a  habit;  unfortunately,  real  enjoyment  in  reading  is 
necessary  if  the  habit  is  to  become  ingrained.  These  programs  of  mastering  skills 
often  lack  the  element  of  learning  to  use  a  library.  Reading  for  its  own  sake  or 
even  for  the  sake  of  a  job  does  not  create  a  reader.  Readers  must  have  an  emo¬ 
tional  response  to  a  new  world  entered,  new  insights,  places  they  can  go  as  read¬ 
ers,  and  situations  and  people  they  can  better  understand. 

Family  Literacy 

Many  professionals  who  have  long  been  involved  in  the  struggle  to  promote 
literacy  and  its  primary  importance  to  the  social  and  economic  well-being  of  our 
society  have  now  seen  it  rise  quickly  to  the  top  of  the  national  agenda.  They  be¬ 
lieve  that  family  literacy  is  the  key  to  motivating  people  to  become  readers. 

Dr.  Carole  Talan,  Director  of  California’s  Statewide  Literacy  Resource  Cen¬ 
ter,  is  a  nationally  known  coordinator  of  family  literacy  programs  that  are  active 
throughout  the  state.  She  is  an  outstanding  proponent  of  library-based  programs, 
which  she  believes — and  has  demonstrated — can  be  more  flexible  in  terms  of 
hours,  techniques,  and  materials  than  other  types  of  more  rigidly  structured  pro¬ 
grams.  Library-based  programs  are  also  more  focused,  more  fun,  and  more  cost- 
effective.  Dr.  Talan  says: 

For  most  people,  the  definition  of  family  literacy  depends  upon 
the  context  in  which  they  seek  to  define  it.  Definitions  abound  and 
vary  considerably  from  brief  statements,  which  define  family 
literacy  as  any  model  providing  literacy  activities  within  a  family 
setting,  to  much  more  detailed  ones.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
manual,  a  concise,  abbreviated  version  of  the  definition  as  found  in

primary  child

Library-Based  Family  Literacy 

Public  libraries  were  engaged  in  family  literacy  programming  long  before  it 
was  called  that.  Libraries  took  on  the  cause  of  literacy  in  the  late  1800s  at  about 
the  same  time  they  began  programs  for  children,  and  they  have  been  immersed  in 
its  fundamental  concepts  ever  since.  We  should  note  that  the  1994  Head  Start 
legislation  recommends  that  Head  Start  staffs  should  partner  with  libraries  and 
should  use  their  resources  in  programs  of  family  literacy,  parent  education,  and 
teacher  technical  assistance. 

Children  and  adults  will  learn  to  read  and  are  more  likely  to  become  readers 
when  they  share  the  enjoyment  of  books.  Enjoyment  is  the  key  to  establishing  a 
lifelong  reading  habit.  It  is  important  to  demonstrate  that  reading  is  not  just  a 
solitary  activity,  although  it  may  be— and  most  delightfully  so — when  you  want 
to  retrench,  escape,  or  be  totally  by  yourself  with  your  own  thoughts.  Reading  by 
yourself  gives  both  time  to  ponder  and  much  needed  privacy.  Reading  can  also  be 
a  shared  and  social  activity.  The  reading  habit  cultivates  a  new  way  of  thinking 
about  possibilities,  what  one  might  be  called  the  “What  if . . .”  turn  of  mind. 

Another  important  benefit  of  family  literacy  programs  is  that  children  see 
adults  reading  and  enjoying  it.  Children  get  a  chance  to  be  read  to  and  to  read 
aloud  to  adults.  Research  shows  that  the  first  and  most  important  factor  in  devel¬ 
oping  readers  among  children  is  for  them  to  see  adults  whom  they  care  about 
reading.  Children  learn  this  behavior,  as  they  do  other  behaviors,  by  imitating. 
The  second  most  critical  factor  in  developing  a  reader  is  that  the  child  is  read  to 
often  and  regularly,  and  is  exposed  to  books  and  other  reading  materials 
constantly. 

Some  of  the  most  successful  family  literacy  programs  are  those  that  use  en¬ 
tirely  children’s  books,  which  are  carefully  selected  by  librarians  to  be  of  interest 
to  both  the  children  and  the  adults  who  are  sharing  them.  Dr.  Talan  is  an  ardent

and  successful  proponent  of  using  children’s  books  in  all  the  programs  under  her 
supervision;  more  than  50  programs  are  based  in  libraries,  plus  those  operating  in 
San  Quentin  and  other  high-security  prisons  in  the  state.  Why?  Because,  says 
Dr.  Talan: 

Children’s  books  are  funny  and  fun,  entertaining  and  colorful.  They  are 
informational,  especially  for  adults  and  children  with  limited  reading  skills.  The 
values  projected  are  universal;  they  are  culturally  diverse;  they  teach  and  rein¬ 
force  basic  reading  skills  (left  to  right,  prediction,  main  idea,  use  of  picture  clues, 
use  of  context,  and  more);  they  are  not  contrived  to  teach  anything;  they  are 
accessible  to  all  levels  of  reading  ability  from  wordless  to  quite  sophisticated; 
they  introduce  a  variety  of  places,  situations,  and  people;  they  introduce  very 
simply  a  variety  of  ideas  and  concepts;  and  they  build  self-esteem  and 
confidence.2 

Perhaps  the  reason  family  literacy  programs  work  so  well  is  that  most  illiterate 
or  semi-literate  people  want  to  leam  to  read  so  those  people  can  read  to  and  with 
their  kids,  can  help  them  leam,  and  can  earn  their  respect  as  the  children  go 
through  school. 

Developing  Learners  from  the  Start 

The  American  Library  Association  president’s  paper  from  1996,  “Kids  Can’t 
Wait,”  states: 

What  happens  or  does  not  happen  during  the  first  5  years  of  life  decides  in 
large  part  the  child’s  destiny  for  the  rest  of  life.  Although  many  children,  even 
adults,  can  benefit  from  later  intervention,  the  costs  of  reversing  the  effects  of  a 
poor  start  increase  as  the  child  grows  older,  and  the  chances  of  success  diminish. 
Neuroscientists,  studying  the  brain  in  greater  depth  than  ever  before,  find  that  if 
there  is  a  lack  of  development  that  should  have  taken  place  in  the  earliest  years, 
the  deficits  can  never  be  fully  made  up.  In  some  cases  the  damage  is  irreversible. 

In  essence,  use  it  or  lose  it. 

Brain  development,  with  all  that  implies  in  terms  of  mental  and  emotional 
well-being,  is  much  more  vulnerable  to  environmental  influences  than  previously 
suspected,  and  these  influences  are  longlasting.  The  environment  affects  not  only 
the  number  of  cells,  and  the  vitality  of  the  connections  among  them,  but  also  the 
way  in  which  these  connections  are  “wired.”  There  is  new  evidence  also  of  the 
negative  impact  of  early  stress  on  brain  function. 

The  quality  of  parent  and  family  interaction  with  the  child  is  a  major 
influence  on  the  difference  between  good  outcomes  and  poor  outcomes  for  the 
child.  Rhythm  and  rhyming  words  focus  a  baby’s  attention  as  people  and  objects 
are  given  names.  Baby  listens  and  takes  in  more  than  we  have  yet  been  able  to 
fathom,  but  we  are  learning  all  the  time  how  important  the  effects  are.  Infants 
thrive  on  one-to-one  interaction  with  parents.  Songs  and  “happy  talk”  evoke  trust 
and  a  sense  of  security,  which  builds  confidence  for  exploration.  This  sense  of

Introduction 


security  is  the  basis  for  a  sense  of  self-worth  and  for  forming  good  relationships 
with  other  children  and  adults. 

Infants’  and  young  children’s  early  experiences  are  the  building  blocks  for 
intellectual  competence,  language  comprehension,  good  emotional  balance,  and 
social  skills.  Feeling  liked  and  lovable  is  the  beginning  of  liking  and  being  able 
to  love,  and  [is]  the  foundation  of  self-esteem.  Touching,  holding,  talking,  and 
reading  to  young  children  seem  to  be  the  most  effective  spurs  to  later  develop¬ 
ment.  Such  stimulation  makes  it  possible  to  learn  how  to  learn,  to  want  to  reach 
out,  to  make  choices,  [and  to]  see  relationships  and  develop  higher  level  thinking 
skills.  It  creates  its  own  demand  for  language,  the  raw  material  for  thought. 

Words  are  tools  used  at  first  to  express  needs  and  wishes,  and  later  hopes  and 
ideas.  Without  a  good  command  of  language,  the  child  will  be  shut  out  from 
much  that  could  make  life  interesting  and  worthwhile.  The  child  grows  into  this 
basic  equipment,  skills  of  language,  most  successfully  when  [the  skills]  are 
modeled:  first  listening,  then  speaking,  then  reading,  and  writing.  Literacy  truly 
defined  means  acquiring,  along  with  language,  a  set  of  attitudes  toward  self  and 
others,  expectations  of  self  and  others,  [and]  an  ability  to  understand  and  link 
streams  of  thought.  All  this,  on  the  surface,  may  appear  to  be  quite  unrelated  to 
conventional  notions  of  reading  instruction. 

It  is  parents,  other  primary  caregivers — like  the  more  than  4  million  grand¬ 
mothers  who  are  now  shouldering  this  responsibility — and  other  family  members 
who  should  supply  this  developmental  foundation  for  children  from  birth.  Alas, 
this  is  not  a  reality  for  more  than  half  of  America’s  23.6  million  children  between 
birth  and  5  years  of  age  [because  of]  social  and  economic  conditions.  Stressful 
environments  and  violence  are  caused  by  many  factors  that  are  all  too  well 
known  to  Head  Start  teachers.  The  intolerable  conditions  in  which  such  a  large 
portion  of  our  nation’s  kids  are  facing  their  first  years  of  life  are  a  recipe  for 
disaster  for  the  whole  society.  If  something  is  not  done  and  very  soon,  not  only 
will  many  millions  of  young  lives  be  ruined,  but  the  stability  of  the  nation  will  be 
undermined.3 

In  their  book  Using  Children ’s  Books  in  Preschool  Settings ,  Steven  Herb  and 
Sara  Willoughby-Herb  have  words  about  developing  learners: 

There  is  ...  a  child  whose  ranks  are  growing  disastrously  in  our  society:  the 
child  whose  home  environment  provides  neither  the  security  nor  the  appropriate 
stimulation  necessary  for  becoming  a  confident,  self-assured  learner.. . .  A  child 
who  learns  to  fear  the  world  is  apt  to  lose  the  natural  proclivity  for  exploration, 
inquiry,  or  participation.  A  pervasive  sense  of  danger  or  insecurity  can  cause  a 
preschool  child  to  “go  into  hiding”  emotionally  and  psychologically.. . .  Any  hope 
we  can  deliver,  any  literacy  skills  we  can  foster,  may  help  lead  a  child  from  that 
“hiding”  place.. . .  Young  mothers,  many  of  them  unwed  teenagers  from  the 
culture  of  poverty,  need  to  be  taught — and  are  often  eager  to  learn — that  talking, 
playing,  and  reading  with  their  young  children  provide  a  bit  of  a  shield  and  an 
antidote  to  their  insecure  surroundings.. . .  This  issues  a  challenge  to  librarians 
and  teachers  who  work  with  preschool  children  and  caregivers/parents,  a 
challenge  to  work  directly  and  also  through  other  agencies  such  as  health

clinics.. . .  Remember  that  every  book  read,  every  story  told,  and  every 
conversation  held  makes  a  difference  in  a  child’s  life.4 

Research  programs  and  experimental  or  demonstration  programs  have  shown 
that  when  the  parent  or  primary  caregiver  reads  aloud  to  a  child,  this  positive 
interaction  with  a  caring  adult  can  provide  a  sort  of  immunization  against  some  of 
the  noise  and  crisis  in  the  child’s  environment.  Apparently,  the  attention,  the 
closeness,  and  the  routine  that  characterize  the  reading  will  induce  better  overall 
development  and  facilitate  emergent  literacy. 

Beating  the  Odds 

As  “Kids  Can’t  Wait”  (Mathews,  1996)  says: 

In  more  than  250  studies  of  children  growing  up  in  adverse  circumstances — 
war,  poverty,  dysfunctional  families — the  results  present  a  consistent  pattern  of 
certain  common  denominators  for  enabling  children  to  beat  the  odds  against 
them.  Longitudinal  research  on  the  “resilient  child,”  conducted  for  over  40  years 
by  Dr.  Emmy  Wemer  and  her  colleagues,  followed  the  same  group  of  700  multi¬ 
cultural  Hawaiian  children  from  birth  through  adolescence  and  well  into  their 
thirties.  A  portion  of  these  high-risk  children — exposed  to  poverty,  biological 
risks,  and  family  instability  and  reared  by  parents  with  little  education  and  often 
serious  mental  health  problems — remained  invincible.  They  developed  into 
competent  and  autonomous  young  adults  who  “worked  well,  played  well,  loved 
well,  and  expected  well.” 

What  enabled  a  significant  percentage  of  these  young  people  to  overcome 
multiple  deficits? 

A  major  buffer  turned  out  to  be  their  own  belief  that  they  would  be  able  to 
surmount  all  difficulties.  This  self-confidence  came  about  because  of  the  atten¬ 
tive  caring,  the  mentoring  of  a  special  adult — a  parent  or  a  parent  substitute, 
often  a  grandmother,  a  teacher,  or  an  older  sibling.  This  person  listened,  and  the 
children  felt  that  they  mattered  to  at  least  one  other  person,  an  adult  who  believed 
in  them.  Other  protective  factors  included  an  engaging  temperament  and  social 
skills  that  drew  people  to  them,  a  sense  of  humor,  outgoingness  and  curiosity, 
and  good  communication  skills.  It  was  found  to  be  very  important  to  intervene 
when  the  at-risk  children  were  having  reading  difficulties.  Reading  ability  turned 
out  to  be  one  of  the  best  predictors  of  later  success  both  at  work  and  in  marital 
and  parental  relationships. 

Other  researchers  exploring  resilience  factors  confirmed  those  cited  by 
Wemer  and  her  colleague  Ruth  Smith,  and  [researchers]  mention  [these  factors 
in]  addition:  ability  to  think  abstractly;  flexibility;  problem-solving  skills;  having 
a  strong  sense  of  identity,  of  purpose,  and  the  future;  and  awareness  of  how  to  be 
useful  to  others. 

All  of  the  resilience  characteristics  can  be  engendered  or  enhanced  by  full- 
fledged  literacy  and  with  the  help  of  librarians  and  library  resources — especially

the  people  resources.  It  is  well  to  remember  that  in  today’s  crowded,  confusingly 
technological,  too-busy-to-listen  society,  it  is  not  just  the  poor  children  or  those 
who  are  homeless  or  living  in  ghettoes  that  may  be  considered  to  be  “at-risk.”  A 
great  majority  of  the  children  growing  up  in  this  society  are  in  need  of  caring  and 
concerned  adults  who  will  help  them  to  develop  every  bit  of  resilience  they 
possibly  can. 

It  is  reasonably  certain  that  many  who  will  use  this  resource  manual  know  that 
the  Goals  2000:  Educate  America  Act  signed  by  President  Clinton  on  March  31, 
1994,  set  into  law  eight  national  goals  that  included  goal  #1,  “All  children  ready 
to  learn,”  and  goal  #8,  “Increased  parent  involvement.”5  Readers  should  also  be 
aware  that  a  recent  survey  funded  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  and  con¬ 
ducted  by  the  University  of  Minnesota  with  the  Gallup  organization  asked  ques¬ 
tions  about  how  Americans  perceive  the  role  of  the  public  library  in  their  lives. 
Among  those  surveyed,  a  great  majority  regarded  the  public  library  as  a  very  im¬ 
portant  source  of  support  for  learning.  This  opinion  was  especially  true  of  people 
belonging  to  minority  groups  and  of  people  with  limited  income  and  education 
who  regarded  the  public  library  as  a  major  source  of  support  for  their  educational 
aspirations.  Also,  the  lower  the  income  level  of  those  surveyed,  the  higher  their 
regard  for  the  library’s  role  as  a  discovery  and  learning  center  for  preschool  chil¬ 
dren.  John  W.  Gardner  wrote:  “Societies  are  renewed  by  people  who  believe  in 
something,  care  about  something,  stand  for  something.”6  Action  toward  this  re¬ 
newal  is  taken,  as  we  remind  participants  in  our  workshops,  by  leaders  with  pas¬ 
sion,  purity  of  purpose,  priorities,  expectations  of  producing  positive  change,  and 
persistence.  It  seems  that  the  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  is  a  con¬ 
cept  whose  time  is  now,  as  well  as  one  destined  for  a  productive  future. 

Rationale  for  Using  Quality  Children’s  Books 
with  Adult  Learners 

Many  adults  enter  literacy  programs  with  the  expressed  purpose  of  becoming 
better  able  to  read  to  their  children.  They  may  (or  may  not)  realize  that  reading  to 
their  children  is  the  best  way  to  help  those  children  grow  up  to  be  better  readers 
themselves.  According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  report  titled  What 
Works  (1986),  “The  single  most  important  activity  for  building  the  knowledge 
required  for  eventual  success  in  reading  is  reading  aloud  to  children.” 

Because  they  themselves  have  suffered  embarrassment  or  failure  caused  by 
their  lack  of  proficiency  with  reading,  those  adults  are  generally  very  passionate 
about  not  wanting  their  children  to  be  exposed  to  the  same  traumas  and  ego-

deflating  experiences.  Even  when  they  do  not  really  understand  why  they  should 
read  to  their  children,  they  often  do  realize  that  it  is  important. 

Generally,  one  is  very  cautious  about  using  children’s  materials  with  an  adult 
learner  because  those  materials  may  be  seen  as  insulting  or  demeaning.  However, 
the  attitude  with  which  material  of  any  kind  is  presented  to  the  learner  is  most 
likely  the  attitude  that  learner  will  adopt  toward  the  material.  In  other  words,  if 
you  as  the  tutor  or  teacher  like  the  material  and  present  it  as  fun  and  worthwhile  to 
use,  then  the  learner  will  most  likely  approach  the  material  with  that  attitude. 
There  will  always  be  exceptions,  however.  As  you  approach  the  adult,  you  should 
be  careful  of  resistance  to  the  materials. 

In  addition,  if  adults  want  to  read  to  a  child,  or  can  be  convinced  of  the  value 
in  reading  to  a  child  (their  own  child,  a  grandchild,  a  niece  or  nephew,  a  neighbor, 
a  Head  Start  or  daycare  child),  then  using  good  children’s  literature  in  the  adult’s 
learning  session  makes  sense. 

Learning  to  read  to  a  child  not  only  increases  the  adult’s  reading  skills  and 
understanding  of  basic  literacy  development  but  also  boosts  the  adult’s  self¬ 
esteem.  By  providing  a  youngster  with  the  experience  of  being  read  to,  the  adult 
moves  from  being  part  of  the  literacy  problem  to  being  a  part  of  the  solution. 

In  addition,  well-selected  children’s  books  are  visually  appealing  and  use  a 
colorful  but  simple  language  to  convey  their  meaning.  They  are  not  contrived 
(manufactured  to  give  reading  practice)  but  are  written  to  tell  a  meaningful  story 
or  to  convey  information  in  an  interesting  way.  As  children  grow  to  love  their 
storytimes,  their  demands  of  “read  to  me”  also  help  ensure  that  the  adult  will  con¬ 
tinue  to  practice  reading  between  tutoring  sessions  or  classes.  Plus,  books  are  just 
plain  fun  and  entertaining  for  all  concerned. 

Most  children’s  picture  books  contain  elements  of  predictability  that  are  of 
great  help  to  someone  just  learning  to  read,  whatever  the  age.  Lively  illustrations, 
repeated  phrases  or  word  patterns,  and  rhymes  all  help  the  reader  to  decode  the 
text.  Also  helpful  to  the  new  reader  are  concept  books  that  teach  concepts  familiar 
to  them  but  often  new  to  the  child,  such  as  counting,  colors,  days  of  the  week, 
animal  names,  etc.  For  the  English  as  a  Second  Language  (ESL)  or  Limited  in 
English  Proficiency  (LEP)  adult,  those  books  are  even  more  valuable  because 
they  help  the  adult  learn  the  basic  English  vocabulary  with  lots  of  clear,  interest¬ 
ing  pictures  for  support. 

Wordless  picture  books  can  be  used  effectively  by  any  adult,  even  if  they  do 
not  yet  speak  or  read  English.  Using  the  illustrations  as  predictors  of  the  story, 
adults  with  no  reading  skills  can  still  share  this  type  of  book  with  a  child  by  tell¬ 
ing  the  story  in  their  own  words.  The  ESL  or  LEP  adult  can  also  immediately 
share  this  book  in  their  own  language.

Children  in  Need  of  Motivation 

As  we  said  in  the  introduction,  more  than  half  of  America’s  children  between 
birth  and  5  years  of  age  lack  the  stimulation  they  require  at  home  for  full  brain 
development  and  for  growth  of  language  and  conceptual  skills.  By  no  means  are 
all  of  these  children  poor;  many  live  in  homes  with  two  working  parents  who  ap¬ 
pear  to  function  well  for  the  child’s  benefit.  Yet  the  parents  are  under  enormous 
pressures  and  are  not  always  aware  of  what  they  should  be  doing  as  the  child’s 
first  teacher.  Many  parents,  whether  one  of  a  pair  or  going  it  alone,  are  overex¬ 
tended  in  terms  of  money,  time,  and  energy.  Low  educational  levels  often  limit 
what  parents  think  they  can  do  to  help  their  kids,  or  parents  believe  that  kinder¬ 
garten  or  school  will  do  the  job  when  the  time  comes.  Relatively  few  children  will 
be  fortunate  enough  to  go  to  Head  Start  or  any  other  preschool  program  that  pro¬ 
vides  planned  motivation  for  emergent  literacy. 

Parent  Involvement 

Because  one  of  the  wonderful  things  about  Head  Start  is  that  its  supportive 
presence  in  a  family  affects  members  other  than  the  child  actually  in  Head  Start, 
we  wanted  to  place  in  this  resource  book  some  help  for  the  mother,  other  parent, 
or  family  member  who  is  assisting  with  the  growth  of  language  skills  all  the  way 
from  birth  through  5  years  of  age.  The  following  charts,  which  show  children’s 
developing  abilities  and  the  adult’s  supportive  techniques,  were  prepared  by  an 
expert  wife  and  husband  team.  She  is  a  child  development  professor  and  he  is  a 
children’s  librarian.  We  have  permission  to  use  excerpts  that  are  adapted  on  the 
following  pages  and  that  are  from  Using  Children ’s  Books  in  Preschool  Settings: 
A  How-to-Do-It  Manual  by  Steven  Herb  and  Sara  Willoughby-Herb.  Many  par¬ 
ents  find  it  hard  to  believe  that  the  simple  things  they  can  do  with  a  3-,  6-,  or  9- 
month-old  child  or  with  a  1-,  2-,  or  3-year-old  or  even  with  a  5-year-old  can  shape 
that  child’s  entire  life  and  lead  to  intellectual  competence  and  psychological  and 
emotional  stability.  There  are  no  guarantees,  of  course,  but  those  simple  things 
can  also  lead  to  success  in  school  and  in  later  life,  and  away  from  drifting, 
dropping  out,  seeking  gang  reassurance,  gaining  attention  and  power  in  the  wrong 
places,  doing  drugs,  and  doing  time.

What  Head  Start  Can  Do 


When  children  get  to  Head  Start  and  appear  to  need  help  in  “catching  up”  with 
opportunities  for  language  development  and  for  emerging  literacy  that  they  seem 
to  have  missed  out  on,  the  Head  Start  staff  members  can  do  many  things.  First, 
they  need  to  enlist  the  help  of  the  parent  or  primary  caregiver,  so  that  things  be¬ 
gun  in  the  classroom  can  immediately  carry  over  into  the  home  environment  and 
come  back  again.  This  involvement  is  probably  best  accomplished  in  a  one-to-one 
private  conference  between  the  parent  and  teacher.  The  two  can  exchange  their 
knowledge  and  observation  about  the  following:  the  child’s  interests,  listening 
and  speaking  habits,  books  that  may  have  been  read,  subjects  of  concern  to  the 
parent  such  as  behavior  problems,  comments  the  child  may  have  made  about 
school,  classmates  or  teacher,  and  so  forth.  Above  all,  staff  members  can  encour¬ 
age  the  parent  or  caregiver  to  make  a  start,  which  begins  with  listening  and  talk¬ 
ing  to  the  child.  Wordless  books  with  enticing  pictures  to  be  shared  with  a  child 
are  a  great  beginning  for  a  low-literacy  mother  who  can,  with  the  child’s  help, 
make  up  a  story  to  go  with  the  pictures. 

With  the  Help  of  the  Library 

It  is  important  to  introduce  the  parent  to  the  public  library  children’s  section 
and  to  the  librarian  who  is  in  charge  of  it.  If  possible,  Head  Start  staff  members 
can  take  a  group  of  two  or  three  mothers  to  the  library  or  can  ask  a  parent  who 
knows  about  the  library  to  introduce  another  parent  to  it.  A  personal  guide  and 
introduction  breaks  the  ice  wonderfully  well.  Handouts  such  as  those  that  are  in¬ 
cluded  on  the  next  few  pages  can  help:  “Leading  Your  Child  to  Reading,”  “Help¬ 
ing  Your  Children  Become  Readers,”  and  “Advantages  of  a  Library  as  a  Partner 
in  Family  Literacy.”  Head  Start  staff  members  who  have  a  library  partnership  can 
gain  great  help  from  library  staff  members  who  will  encourage  children  to  talk 
and  share  their  ideas  about  books  and  will  offer  demonstrations  of  parent  training 
and  of  joint  family  literacy  sessions  for  parents  with  their  children.  To  help  chil¬ 
dren  overcome  the  “hiding  out”  syndrome  or  a  sense  of  isolation,  librarians  can 
select  particular  books  for  those  reticent  children.  Curiosity  aroused  and  satisfied 
can  lead  to  interests. 

Older  siblings,  grandparents,  aunts,  and  other  family  members  can  have  im¬ 
portant  roles  in  helping  the  child  practice  at  home  some  of  the  activities  and  skills 
learned  at  Head  Start. 


Conversation 

As  we  have  said,  the  most  important  factor  in  creating  a  reader  is  having 
reading  enjoyment  modeled  by  a  parent  or  some  significant  older  person.  Being 
read  to  ranks  a  close  second  in  terms  of  influence.  Games  can  also  be  a  great

companion  to  reading  development.  S.  B.  Neuman  and  K.  Roskos,  quoted  in 
Using  Children ’s  Books  in  Preschool  Settings  by  the  Herbs,  state  that  “much  of 
the  benefit  of  storybook  reading  resides  in  the  collaborative  talk  that  actually  sur¬ 
rounds  the  book  reading  event.”  The  attitude  toward  a  child’s  early  efforts  at  lan¬ 
guage  is  important.  Thus  the  listener  should,  according  to  the  Herbs, 

. . .  show  caring  attentiveness  and  often  credit  the  child  with  greater 
understanding  or  ability  than  is  readily  observable  in  the  child’s  speech.  For 
example,  when  the  child  says,  “Ball  all  gone,”  the  adult  might  assume  that 
the  child  is  both  commenting  that  the  ball  is  missing  and  asking  for  help  in 
finding  it.  The  adult  assumes  that  the  child  means  to  communicate  more  than 
the  words  alone  say. 

The  Herbs  recommend  ways  of  starting  conversations  with  children.  They  ex¬ 
plain  six  techniques:  Self  Talk,  Parallel  Talk,  Leading  Statements,  Affirming  Re¬ 
sponses,  Modeling  Varied  Uses  of  Language,  and  Questioning.  These  techniques 
have  a  certain  game-like  quality  that  might  make  them  interesting  to  both  young 
and  old  people  who  desire  to  strike  up  a  conversation  with  a  preschooler  or  to  so¬ 
licit  a  response.  The  following  examples  are  paraphrased  from  the  Herbs: 

•  Self  Talk  involves  the  older  person  playing  near  the  child  and  talking  in  de¬ 
scriptive  ways  about  what  he  or  she  is  doing.  For  example,  in  putting  a  puzzle 
together,  the  adult  says,  “I’m  looking  for  the  comer  pieces.”  Often  the  child 
will  show  an  interest  in  helping  to  find  the  puzzle  piece.  Without  having  to 
speak,  the  child  has  responded  to  the  adult’s  conversation.  There  is  no  re¬ 
quirement  for  language,  and  the  adult  accepts  nonverbal  communication  as 
conversation  until  the  child  is  ready  for  more  commitment  to  a  verbal  inter¬ 
change. 

•  Parallel  Talk,  much  like  Self  Talk,  doesn’t  require  any  speaking  from  the 
child.  Adults  will  use  words  to  describe  the  child’s  activity.  With  young  in¬ 
fants,  the  adult  may  say  the  names  of  objects,  persons,  or  events  as  the  baby 
notices  them,  thus  supplying  verbal  labels.  With  a  toddler,  the  adult  describes 
objects  or  actions,  “You  picked  up  the  yellow  car.”  With  Head  Start  children 
who  are  3-5,  the  older  person  can  point  out  the  detail  of  what  the  child  is  do¬ 
ing,  “The  base  of  your  house  is  getting  longer,”  or  “That’s  a  lacy,  pointed 
snowflake  you  are  cutting.”  By  providing  words  that  stand  for  real  objects  and 
experiences,  adults  help  children  build  bridges  between  their  concrete  world 
and  their  mental  world.  As  with  Self  Talk,  Parallel  Talk  may  lead  into  an  ac¬ 
tual  exchange  of  words  with  the  child  and  the  older  person  taking  turns  with 
the  conversation,  but  this  two-way  result  is  not  a  necessary  outcome. 

•  Leading  Statements,  when  properly  drawn  out,  certain  expressions  (“I  won¬ 
der  . . .,  I  hope  . . .,  I  think  . . .,  I’m  afraid  . . .”)  invite  children  to  complete  the 
statement.  The  important  characteristic  of  these  statements  is  that  they  are

merely  “invitations”  and  not  “requests”  for  verbalizing.  Reading  a  version  of 
The  Gingerbread  Man,  the  adult  turns  the  page,  looks  at  the  picture,  and  says, 
“Now  I  wonder  who  is  going  to  be  chasing  him?”  The  child  points  to  the  pig 
and  says,  “Piggy.”  It  is  because  such  statements  do  not  pressure  children  that 
they  often  inspire  children  to  join  the  conversation. 

•  Affirming  Responses  are  used  when  the  child  has  begun  speaking  to  the 
adult.  A  regular  response  shows  that  the  adult  has  heard  what  the  child  has 
said  and  thinks  the  child’s  words  are  important.  For  example,  when  the  child 
points  to  the  pig  and  says,  “Piggy,”  the  adult  affirms  what  the  child  has  said, 
“Yes,  I  think  the  piggy  will  chase  the  Gingerbread  Man.”  This  response  also 
demonstrates  the  addition  of  a  verb  and  the  use  of  a  whole  sentence. 

•  Modeling  Varied  Uses  of  Language  means  that  as  an  adult  speaks  to  young 
children,  the  adult  should  continually  provide  models  for  their  speech.  In  ad¬ 
dition  to  acquiring  vocabulary,  children  leam  a  great  deal  from  older  people’s 
use  of  language  such  as  how  to  take  turns  in  conversation,  how  to  be  polite 
listeners,  how  to  greet  others,  how  to  make  people  laugh,  and  how  to  assert 
one’s  rights.  It  is  believed  that  language  develops  in  young  children  according 
to  its  usefulness  to  them,  and  children  develop  intentions  or  purposes  long  be¬ 
fore  they  have  the  words  to  express  themselves.  Unfortunately,  some  children 
are  exposed  to  very  limited  language  use  in  their  own  homes;  most  language 
they  hear  is  directed  toward  satisfying  one’s  own  needs  such  as  “I  want  my 
dinner  now”  or  is  controlling  language  such  as  “Stop  that.”  It  is  crucial  for 
children  who  seldom  hear  or  participate  in  good  conversation  at  home  to  be 
exposed  to  children’s  literature.  Those  books  show  children  that  there  is 
something  in  the  world  beyond  their  home  or  their  neighborhood  that  can 
open  them  up  to  dreams  and  ideas  not  grounded  in  their  immediate 
environment. 

•  Questioning  is  the  most  fragile  of  all  the  conversation-starting  techniques. 
Questions  are  really  not  necessary  for  making  conversation  with  children.  In 
fact,  some  questions  can  easily  shut  down  a  child’s  conversations.  Don’t  let 
questions  intrude  on  the  child  or  his  privacy.  Adults  should  not  ask  personal 
questions  about  children’s  families,  what  the  children  ate  for  breakfast,  or 
whether  they  like  their  sister  or  brother.  Some  well-meaning  adults  ask  ques¬ 
tion  after  question — often  unrelated  to  what  the  child  is  focusing  on  at  the 
time — and  the  child  who  tries  to  satisfy  the  questioner  is  likely  to  regard  this 
encounter  as  a  pretend  conversation  or  even  a  test  rather  than  an  opportunity 
to  share  ideas.  When  they  do  ask  questions,  adults  must  listen  with  respect  and 
be  prepared  to  facilitate  the  child’s  communication.  If  a  child  overhears  adults 
laugh  at  what  the  child  said,  that  youngster  can  become  timid  about  speaking. 
And  sometimes  children  will  decline  to  be  questioned,  will  typically  let  the 
questioner  know  it,  and  will  walk  away.

However,  thought-provoking  questions  may  encourage  children’s  thinking. 
There  are  recall  questions,  deductive-thinking  questions,  and,  perhaps  the  most 
interesting  of  all,  divergent-thinking  questions  that  encourage  complex  thinking 
but  that  have  no  one  correct  answer.  Most  answers  a  child  would  give  would  be 
acceptable.  Such  questions  are  sometimes  called  open-ended  questions. 
Divergent-thinking  questions  ask  children  to  make  judgments  (“Do  you  think  the 
old  lady  should  bake  another  Gingerbread  Man?”),  to  make  predictions  (“What  do 
you  think  will  happen  next?”),  or  to  imagine  (“If  you  were  the  Gingerbread  Man, 
how  would  you  get  away?”).  Interesting,  thoughtful  conversations  that  involve 
sharing  and  accepting  one  another’s  ideas  will  often  follow  divergent  questions. 
Thus,  we  should  weave  divergent-thinking  questions  into  discussions  of  books  as 
often  as  possible. 

Games 

A  child  often  greatly  enjoys  games  that  include  play  with  words,  sequences, 
contrasts,  comparisons,  and  counting,  especially  when  played  with  a  sibling. 

These  questions  can  lead  to  games:  Which  objects  are  alike?  What  do  they  have  in 
common?  Which  objects  are  alike  in  some  ways  and  not  in  others?  Can  you  de¬ 
scribe  how  things  feel,  putting  words  to  such  characteristics  as  rough  or  smooth, 
lumpy  or  flat?  Games  that  features  things  in  sequence  help  a  child  learn  that 
reading  in  English  and  many  other  languages  takes  place  from  left  to  right. 
Guessing  games  of  all  kinds  are  fun.  Tic-tac-toe  can  be  played  in  any  number  of 
ways,  and  likes  and  dislikes  can  be  graphed.  Games  can  be  made  of  what  things 
you  take  on  a  picnic  or  of  what  you  put  in  your  backpack  for  an  overnight  visit. 
The  game  we  used  to  call  “Concentration,”  in  which  52  cards  are  laid  face  down 
and  each  player  gets  a  turn  to  find  a  pair,  develops  memory,  and  develops  spatial 
visualization  (the  third  one  on  the  top  row  matches  the  fifth  one  on  the  second 
row.)  A  sibling  can  go  to  the  library  and  learn  in  a  craft  session  how  to  make  pup¬ 
pets  with  and  for  a  younger  brother  or  sister.  Picture  books  themselves  are  prime 
tools  for  helping  children  learn  concepts  such  as  small,  smaller,  and  smallest. 

Such  concepts  can  help  both  parents  and  children  share  the  feeling  that  they  are 
connected  with  a  world  far  beyond  the  one  they  live  in.  A  grandmother  who  likes 
music  might  choose  a  piece  of  music  that  goes  well  with  a  story  and  that  illus¬ 
trates  a  rabbit  hopping  or  an  insect  buzzing.  Grandparents  who  seem  to  have  an 
interest  and  talent  in  this  kind  of  participation  can  be  given  some  basic,  simple 
training  so  they  can  tell  stories  from  their  childhood,  as  well  as  tales  from  their 
homeland  if  they  grew  up  in  another  country  before  coming  to  the  United  States 
or  their  childhood  was  in  a  very  different  setting  in  this  country.  Older  people, 
whether  relatives  or  not,  will  often  enjoy  bringing  to  the  classroom  or  library 
some  beautiful,  unique,  and  interesting  objects  that  children  may  look  at  and 
perhaps  handle.

In  the  Library-Head  Start  video,  we  emphasized  that  while  it  is  important  to 
have  an  inviting  library  area  in  the  Head  Start  classroom,  literacy  and  book-re¬ 
lated  activities  should  take  place  throughout  the  room.  Many  stories  lend  them¬ 
selves  to  dramatic  play  and  to  the  use  of  costumes  and  props.  The  Gingerbread 
Man,  The  Three  Billy  Goats  Gruff,  Little  Red  Riding  Hood,  and  The  Very  Hungry 
Caterpillar  (Carle,  1981)  are  only  a  few  that  come  to  mind.  Children  should  be 
allowed  to  take  books  to  all  appropriate  areas  such  as  the  science  center  or  the 
housekeeping  area.  With  help  from  the  teacher,  aides,  or  parent  volunteers,  the 
children  can  engage  in  play  that  includes  reading  and  writing,  such  as  pretending 
to  be  a  postal  worker,  a  doctor,  or  a  dentist  (letters,  charts,  magazines,  prescrip¬ 
tions).  According  to  the  Herbs, 

Children  seem  to  leam  best,  to  remember  best,  when  their  learning 
experiences  are  integrated  . . .  and  literature  is  important  throughout  their 
lives  and  not  just  at  a  certain  place  or  time  of  day.  With  children’s  literature, 
we  think  of  integrated  learning  occurring  when 

1 .  Children  are  read  to  at  various  times  of  the  day — not  just  at  storytime  or 
bedtime. 

2.  Books  and  stories  are  incorporated  into  various  themes  that  we  study 
with  children  (seasons,  the  family,  etc.). 

3.  Books  and  stories  play  a  part  in  children’s  learning  about  nonliterary 
topics,  such  as  mathematics,  science,  history,  and  human  understanding. 

4.  Adults  encourage  children  toward  reading-related  play. 

5.  Children  develop  their  own  personal  literary  preferences:  favorite  books, 
authors,  and  illustrators;  favorite  times  and  places  for  reading. 


Understanding  Why  and  How 

It  is  important  not  only  that  parents  or  primary  caregivers  understand  how  es¬ 
sential  their  role  is  as  the  child’s  first  teacher,  but  also  that  they  know  what  to  do 
about  it.  Many  parents  of  Head  Start  children  did  not  have  in  their  own  childhood 
a  nurturing  model  upon  which  to  pattern  their  own  activities.  Some  training  can 
be  done  through  informal  conversation  between  the  Head  Start  teacher  and  parent, 
but  parents  may  leam  more  readily  through  exchanges  and  solutions  that  are 
brought  out  in  a  group  session  with  other  adults.  This  training  function  is  one  in 
which  the  librarian  partner  can  greatly  assist  the  Head  Start  staff  (as  discussed  in 
Chapter  5).

(e.g.,  when  baby  laughs  at  jack-in-the-box,  adult  or  parent 
says,  “You  like  that,  don’t  you?  ...  Again?”) 

When  baby  begins  to  babble,  notes  which  sounds  (“googa”) 
baby  enjoys,  so  adult  can  use  these  to  initiate  baby’s  babbling 

*Please  note  that  in  the  case  of  prematurity,  we  expect  children  to  behave  according  to  norms  adjusted  for  their  pre¬ 
maturity  (we  subtract  the  number  of  weeks  or  months  of  prematurity),  not  according  to  expectations  for  a  full-term 
baby.  In  most  cases,  premature  children  do  catch  up,  but  their  developmental  lag  is  more  noticeable  during  the  first  2 
years  of  life.

Tries  to  read  stories  through  to  the  end,  but  pauses  to  ask 
questions  to  keep  child’s  interest 

While  reading,  makes  sure  child  can  see  pictures  and  talks 
about  them  before  turning  the  page 

Encourages  child  to  join  in  as  adult  reads  familiar  or  repeated

to  memorize  them 

Provides  opportunities  to  follow  verbal  directions 

Encourages  child  to  try  simple  writing  tasks  (e.g.,  making  A”  s

why  (e.g.,  “This  card  will  really  cheer  up  Uncle  Paul”) 

When  printing  for  child  uses  large  clear  letters;  sometimes 
talks  about  them  (e.g.,  Letter  i  is  a  straight  line  with  a  dot  on 
top”  or  “7"  makes  the  sound  t-t-t-t.”) 

Continues  to  be  deliberate  in  the  language  the  adult  uses  with 
the  child,  so  the  adult  provides  opportunities  for  the  child  to 
leam  new  words

This  handout  is  designed  to  be  used  with  adult  new  readers.  It  is  not  necessarily  self-explanatory, 

however,  but  should  be  discussed  first  in  a  group  situation  to  allow  adults  an  opportunity  to  ex¬ 
plore  the  significance  of  each  step  to  their  child’s  language  and  literacy  development  and  to  be 

sure  they  understand  the  concept. 

1 .  Talk  to  and  with  your  child. 

2.  Listen  to  your  child  and  encourage  his  or  her  listening. 

3.  Share  at  least  one  book  every  day  with  your  child.  You  do  not  have  to  be  able  to  read  to 
share  a  book  with  your  child! 

4.  Select  a  quiet,  comfortable  place  to  share  a  book  with  your  child.  Before  bed  or  nap  is  a 
good  time. 

5.  Make  reading  times  fun — a  family  ritual.  Allow  for  the  age  and  needs  of  your  child.  If  it’s 
not  fun,  don’t  do  it! 

6.  Share  stories  from  your  life,  family,  work,  and  so  forth.  Then  have  your  child  share  stories 
of  her  or  her  daily  life  with  you. 

7.  Understand  that  your  child  is  never  too  young  to  be  read  to!  Start  when  your  child  is  still  an 
infant.  Even  better,  start  when  you  are  pregnant.  Before  they  are  bom,  babies  respond  to 
sound  and  language. 

8.  Know  that  it’s  OK,  even  good,  to  read  the  same  book  or  story  over  and  over  to  a  child. 
Children  love  to  hear  books  repeated  many  times.  Do  not  be  upset  if  your  child  tries  to  turn 
the  pages  or  talks  while  you  are  reading.  This  activity  is  not  bad.  Children,  especially 
young  ones,  often  need  to  touch  the  book,  even  to  put  it  in  their  mouths,  and  to  be  active 
while  being  read  to.  It  may  take  time  for  your  child  to  leam  to  sit  still  and  enjoy  being  read 
to.  Please  be  patient. 

9.  Read  aloud  regularly,  even  if  only  a  few  pages.  You  don’t  have  to  read  every  word  in  a 
book  to  share  it  with  your  child. 

10.  Remember  that  your  job  is  to  make  reading  fun.  Children  need  to  see  reading  as  a  fun  thing 
to  do  if  they  are  to  become  good  readers,  and  the  school  doesn’t  always  make  reading  fun. 

1 1 .  Use  every  reading  opportunity  that  you  can  with  your  child.  Point  out  at  least  one  beautiful 
(interesting,  unusual)  thing  every  day  and  help  your  child  to  use  his  or  her  imagination. 

12.  As  you  go  about  your  daily  life,  think  and  talk  about  the  story  or  stories  that  you  read.

Motivation  to  Read 


13.  Even  when  your  children  can  read,  remember  that  they  still  need  to  be  read  to!  Even  adults 
enjoy  being  read  to. 

14.  Encourage  your  child  to  remember,  image,  and  fantasize;  share  imaginative  ideas  with  your 
child. 

15.  Remember  that  young  children  need  to  hear  language.  It  can  be  spoken,  read,  or  sung.  They 
need  to  play  with  words  and  rhymes  and  songs.  Music  is  wonderful,  and  your  child  will 
love  to  listen  and  sing  with  you. 

16.  Plan  to  use  both  languages  at  home  if  English  is  your  second  language.  To  learn  a  second 
language,  children  must  hear  that  language.  Babies  learn  by  listening.  You  should  be  proud 
of  your  first  language,  but  should  help  your  child  to  hear  English  so  that  he  or  she  will 
learn  to  speak  and  read  it. 

17.  Remember  that  a  child’s  work  is  his  or  her  play.  Therefore,  play  is  an  essential  part  of  a 
child’s  life,  and  children  need  to  play  every  day.  Children  learn  much  about  their  life  and 
their  world  through  their  play. 

18.  Take  your  child  to  the  library.  Have  the  librarian  help  you  pick  out  books  your  child  will 
enjoy.  Remember,  all  the  books  in  the  library  are  free.  But,  you  must  remember  to  return 
them  too!

Helping  Your  Children  Become  Readers 

When  you  open  a  book  with  your  children,  you  are  opening  the  world  for  them. 

You  are  making  them  think,  wonder,  and  want  to  know  more.  You  are  helping  them  to  do  well  in 
school  and  to  someday  find  a  good  job.  Best  of  all,  you  are  enjoying  time  together  as  a  family. 

Here  are  ways  to  interest  your  little  ones  in  books  and  to  help  them  learn  skills  that  will  lead  to 
reading: 

1 .  Talk  with  your  children  as  you  play,  go  shopping,  or  work  around  the  house.  Listen  to 
what  they  say.  Ask  questions.  When  you  talk  to  your  children,  you  are  helping  them  learn 
to  use  words. 

2.  Read  to  your  children.  Try  to  read  to  them  at  the  same  time  every  day.  Bedtime  or  before 
a  nap  is  a  good  time.  Let  them  choose  the  story. 

3.  Let  your  children  see  you  read.  That  is  the  best  way  to  show  them  that  you  think  reading 
is  important  and  that  you  enjoy  it  too. 

4.  Ask  older  children  to  read  to  younger  ones.  The  older  children  will  be  proud  of  their 
skills.  The  younger  children  will  want  to  read  like  their  older  brothers,  sisters,  or  friends. 

5.  Go  to  the  library  together.  Ask  a  librarian  for  help  in  finding  books  your  children  will 
enjoy.  If  you  don’t  have  a  library  card,  ask  for  one.  With  a  card,  your  family  can  borrow 
books. 

6.  Give  your  children  books  about  their  special  interests.  Do  they  like  animals,  sports,  or 
magic?  Surprise  them  with  books  or  magazines  about  their  favorite  interests  or  activities. 

7.  Keep  books,  magazines,  and  newspapers  around  your  home  so  you  and  your  children 
will  always  have  something  to  read.  Read  aloud  other  things  you  see  during  the  day  such  as 
street  signs,  milk  cartons,  cereal  boxes,  and  signs  in  store  windows. 

8.  Plan  outings  for  your  children.  Children  leam  from  what  they  see  and  do.  Take  them  to  a 
park,  a  parade,  or  just  out  for  a  walk.  Church  and  community  groups  also  plan  trips  that 
your  family  might  want  to  go  on. 

9.  Sing  songs  and  say  rhymes,  raps,  and  poetry.  Rhymes  and  songs  are  easy  for  kids  to  re¬ 
member,  so  they  can  say  them  and  sing  them  along  with  the  rest  of  the  family.  Rhymes  also 
help  children  leam  letter  sounds. 

10.  Tell  stories  about  your  family  as  well  as  stories  you  enjoyed  hearing  when  you  were  a 
child.  Ask  grandparents  and  other  family  members  to  tell  stories  too.  Write  down  some  of 
these  stories,  plus  ones  your  children  tell.  Save  the  stories  to  read  aloud  at  another  time. 

Reading  Is  Fundamental — RIF — is  a  national  nonprofit  organization  that  gets  children  to  read. 
Founded  in  1966,  RIF  works  through  local  programs  in  thousands  of  communities  throughout  the 
U.S.  RIF’s  series  of  Parent  Guide  brochures  is  designed  to  help  parents  encourage  reading  in  the 
home.  For  more  information,  write  to  RIF,  P.O.  Box  23444,  Washington,  DC  20026.

Reading  Aloud 

Reading  aloud  is  the  single  most  important  thing  you  can  do  to  help  your  children  succeed  in 
school. 

1 .  Read  aloud  to  children  of  all  ages,  even  babies. 

2.  Read  books  that  are  easy  for  you  and  that  you  like,  so  you  have  fun  reading. 

3.  Teach  your  child  by  showing  how  to  sit  and  hold  the  book,  how  to  take  care  of  it,  and  how 
to  enjoy  it. 

4.  Do  not  force  your  child  to  sit  and  read  with  you.  Be  patient  and  remember  you  want  to  help 
your  child  to  feel  good  about  books  and  reading. 

5 .  Remember  these  things : 

•  Make  the  book  personal.  Ask  questions  such  as  these:  In  the  book,  what  is  the  same  as 
in  your  life?  How  are  the  people  or  animals  in  the  book  like  you? 

•  Use  your  imagination  to  talk  about  things  that  the  pictures  and  the  story  make  you  think 
of. 

•  Guess  what  happens  next  in  the  book. 

•  Use  the  pictures  to  find  out  what  is  happening  in  the  book. 

•  By  asking  questions,  help  your  child  remember  the  order  of  what  happens  in  the  story. 

6.  Know  that  it  is  good  to  read  the  same  book  over  and  over — if  the  child  wants  to. 

7.  Use  the  book  to  talk  about  things  in  your  life  that  are  important  to  both  you  and  your  child. 

8.  Help  your  child  tell  you  what  he  or  she  thinks  about  the  book.

Advantages  of  a  Library  as  a  Partner  in  Family  Literacy 


•  That’s  where  the  books  are! 

•  That’s  where  people  who  are  crusaders  for  reading  are! 

•  The  public  library  is  a  safe  haven  and  is  nonthreatening  to  parents  and  to  children. 

•  Librarians  love  books  and  reading,  and  they  avidly  promote  the  joy  of  reading  to  others 
(teachers  often  just  teach  the  skills  of  reading  and  promote  it  as  an  informational  tool). 

•  Other  wonderful  materials  are  found  at  the  library,  and  families  who  go  there  can  access 
items  such  as  videos,  books  on  tape,  large  print  books,  and  dictionaries. 

•  The  public  library  is  the  “life-long  learning  institution”  that  will  never  graduate  or  promote 
you;  you  can  always  use  its  services  no  matter  how  old  you  are,  how  educated,  or  how 
uneducated. 

•  Children  who  discover  the  world  of  reading  at  the  library  will  continue  to  access  it  for  the 
rest  of  their  lives. 

•  Public  libraries  are  free  and  in  nearly  every  community! 

•  Most  public  libraries  provide  entertaining,  informative,  and  fun  programs  for  children  and 
even  for  the  entire  family. 

•  Children  and  adults  can  correlate  their  books  with  each  other  by  subject  or  genre,  thus 
encouraging  family  discussions  and  experiences. 

•  Public  libraries  are  nondiscriminatory.  They  have  something  for  everyone!

Competencies  for  Librarians  Serving  Children 
in  Public  Libraries 

[Under  revision  in  early  1999  to  strengthen  competencies  in  information  technology] 

Effective  library  service  for  children  entails  a  broad  range  of  expertise  and  professional  skills. 
The  librarian  serving  children  is  first  of  all  fully  knowledgeable  in  the  theories,  practices,  and 
emerging  trends  of  librarianship  and  has,  as  well,  specialized  knowledge  of  the  particular  needs 
of  children  as  library  users. 

In  developing  the  following  list  of  recommended  competencies,  definitions  have  been  drawn 
from  numerous  sets  of  standards  for  children’s  services  and  lists  of  competencies  developed  by 
state  agencies  and  library  associations.  The  intent  of  this  document  is  to  define  the  role  of  the 
librarian  serving  children  in  the  public  library.  The  competencies  will  apply  in  varying  degrees 
according  to  the  professional  responsibilities  of  the  librarian  serving  children.  The  assignment  of 
responsibilities  for  planning,  managing,  and  delivering  library  services  to  children  will  vary  in 
relation  to  the  size  and  staffing  pattern  of  the  public  library.  In  many  libraries  there  is  only  one 
professional  children’s  librarian,  who  serves  as  both  manager  and  principal  provider  of  services. 
In  larger  libraries,  there  may  be  a  coordinator  of  children’s  services  who  oversees  the  delivery  of 
services. 

The  philosophical  basis  for  children’s  services  in  public  libraries  is  full  access  for  children  to 
library  materials  and  services.  Other  philosophical  underpinnings  for  these  competencies  are  the 
American  Library  Association’s  (ALA)  Library  Bill  of  Rights  and  the  ALA-endorsed  Freedom 
to  View  Statement  adopted  by  the  Educational  Film  Library  Association  (now  the  American 
Film  and  Video  Association).  Related  ALA  statements  also  include  the  Library  Education  and 
Personnel  Utilization  Policy  and  the  policy  that  the  master’s  degree  from  a  program  accredited 
by  the  ALA  is  the  appropriate  professional  degree  for  librarians.  It  is  recommended  that  the  pol¬ 
icy  manuals  of  local  libraries  include  copies  of  these  statements  in  conjunction  with  relevant 
state  standards  or  guidelines. 

The  competencies  that  follow  represent  a  systematic  process.  To  plan  and  administer  an  effective 
program,  one  must  first  have  knowledge  of  the  community  and  client  group.  Planning  and  man¬ 
agement  are  then  based  on  valid  data.  Communication  is  essential  to  articulate  goals  and  objec¬ 
tives.  Collection  development  provides  the  resources  for  services  and  programming.  The  future 
of  children’s  services  depends  on  advocacy  and  professional  development. 

Competencies  are  not  static  but  evolve  throughout  one’s  professional  career.  Librarians  must  be 
alert  to  the  changes  in  society  that  may  necessitate  changes  in  library  services  and  the  acquisition 
of  additional  competencies.  Thus,  it  is  understood  that  professional  growth  and  development  is  a 
lifelong  process.

Getting  Your  Children  Ready  to  Read 

Play  with  your  children  to  help  them  get  ready  to  read. 

1 .  Sing  songs,  say  rhymes,  and  play  hand  and  finger  games  to  help  children  hear  the  same 
words  over  and  over  so  they  can  learn  them. 

2.  Because  a  good  memory  helps  children  get  ready  to  read,  play  these  memory  games  with 
your  children: 

•  Sort  the  same  or  different  colors,  shapes,  and  sizes.  Use  things  in  your  home:  socks, 
T-shirts,  bowls,  or  cups. 

•  Make  a  pattern  of  things,  words,  sounds,  and  movements.  Start  with  two  or  three  things 
repeated  over  and  over. 

•  Copy  the  pattern  by  helping  your  child  make  the  same  pattern.  Be  sure  to  say  the  names 
of  things  that  are  in  your  pattern. 

•  Put  things  in  order  by  giving  directions  or  telling  a  story.  Ask  your  child  to  give  or 
bring  you  two  or  three  things  and  then  to  tell  you  what  was  first  and  what  came  next. 

3.  Play  three  different  kinds  of  games: 

•  Doing.  Draw  a  shape  on  the  child’s  body  or  on  paper. 

•  Listening.  Say  back  in  full  sentences  what  your  child  has  said. 

•  Seeing.  Name  things.  Find  colors,  shapes,  and  “hidden5 

4.  Make  your  own  books. 

•  Draw  a  picture.  Then  write  a  story. 

•  Write  a  word  the  child  wants.  Then  draw  the  picture. 

•  Cut  and  paste  a  book  of  all  the  same  things  (circles,  cai 

5.  Make  a  family  photo  album.  Write  who  is  in  each  picture  and  what  that  person  is  doing. 

6.  Have  fun!

How  to  Play  Shoe  Box 


1.  Put  10  household  objects  in  a  shoe  box. 

2.  Show  the  objects  in  the  shoe  box  to  your  child  or  children  for  15-30  seconds. 

3.  Now  put  the  lid  on  the  shoe  box. 

4.  Ask  your  child  or  children  to  name  all  10  objects  without  seeing  them. 

5.  Repeat  the  game  and  ask,  “What’s  different?”  For  example,  remove  one  or  two  objects, 
move  objects  around,  or  make  patterns  with  the  objects. 

6.  Change  roles  and  ask  your  child  to  move  around  or  to  remove  some  objects  in  the  shoe 
box.  Then  you  guess  what’s  different.

How  to  Play  Telephone 

1 .  Make  up  a  sentence  using  words  that  start  with  the  same  sound,  for  example,  “Silly  Sally 
saw  seven  seals”  or  “Crabby  Cathy  can  creep.” 

2.  Whisper  the  sentence  in  your  child’s  ear. 

3.  If  you  are  playing  with  only  one  child,  ask  him  or  her  to  repeat  the  sentence  to  you. 

4.  If  you  are  playing  with  two  or  more  children,  ask  the  first  child  to  whisper  what  he  or  she 
hears  to  the  next  child,  and  so  on  around  the  circle.  When  the  last  child  has  heard  the  sen¬ 
tence,  ask  that  child  to  say  the  sentence  out  loud.  See  how  much  it  has  changed  from  the 
first  sentence. 

5.  Repeat  the  game.  Use  words  that  rhyme  or  tell  a  joke  or  ask  a  riddle.  Be  creative.  Allow 
each  child  to  make  up  a  sentence.  See  if  what  has  been  said  comes  back  the  way  it  was  first 
said.

Materials  Selection  and  Acquisition 

Criteria  for  Choosing 

There  are  many  places  to  find  out  which  materials  are  the  best  among  the 
flood  in  the  marketplace.  As  the  person  deciding  on  reading  material  for  children, 
you  can  consult  reviews  for  new  books  and  use  standard  reference  books  for  older 
titles.  Parents  can  be  a  wonderful  source  for  books  from  their  culture — books  that 
may  not  have  come  through  the  mainstream  of  reviewing  sources.  Teachers  will 
know  the  types  or  kinds  of  materials  that  are  needed  to  fill  out  an  existing  class¬ 
room  collection.  In  the  end,  you  will  be  the  best  judge  of  any  particular  book,  be¬ 
cause  you  will  keep  in  mind  the  children  who  use  the  collection,  the  materials 
already  in  the  collection,  and  the  curriculum  needs  in  your  classroom. 

The  ability  to  make  judgments  of  books  is  a  developed  skill.  The  more  expo¬ 
sure  you  have  to  books  and  materials,  the  more  accurate  your  judgment  will  be¬ 
come.  Generally,  you  should  look  at  the  composition  of  the  various  books.  For 
example,  Zena  Sutherland  (1997)  gives  some  traditional  literary  elements  to 
consider: 

•  Setting.  Where  and  when  did  the  story  take  place? 

•  Point  of  view.  Who  tells  the  story? 

•  Characters.  Who  are  the  characters?  How  are  they  revealed?  Did  they  grow 
and  change? 

•  Plot.  What  happens  in  the  story?  Does  it  flow?  Does  it  have  a  logical 
sequence? 

•  Theme.  What  is  the  main  idea  of  the  story? 

•  Style.  How  is  the  story  written?  How  are  the  ideas  expressed?  Is  it  told  in  the 
first  person?  Is  a  narrator  telling  the  story?

Types  of  Materials 

Over  the  past  5  years,  the  number  of  books  published  each  year  for  children 
has  practically  doubled.  This  increase  does  not  mean,  however,  that  all  new  books 
for  children  represent  titles  of  high  quality.  In  some  ways,  such  growth  makes  the 
task  of  finding  good  books  for  children  more  difficult  because  there  are  many 
more  from  which  to  choose. 

Likewise,  there  has  been  a  tremendous  increase  in  the  number  of  computer 
software  programs  for  children.  In  addition,  publishers  today  emphasize  the  of¬ 
ferings  of  books  and  materials  for  use  by  very  young  children  because  of  the  new 
research  about  brain  development  in  infants. 

In  fact,  the  variety  of  materials  for  children,  both  in  print  and  in  other  formats, 
is  vast.  There  are  cloth  books,  board  books,  and  pop-up  books  for  the  youngest 
children.  Picture  books,  wordless  books,  easy-to-read  books,  and  factual  books 
are  published  for  toddlers  and  preschoolers.  Other  materials  include  magazines, 
videos,  films,  records,  software,  Web  sites,  book  and  cassette  sets,  puzzles, 
games,  puppets,  and  toys.  All  of  these  materials  are  designed  to  be  used  by  chil¬ 
dren  and  their  families  for  getting  ready  to  read,  as  well  as  for  reading. 

Beyond  the  sheer  number  of  materials  being  published,  the  breadth  of  subject 
matter  has  also  markedly  increased.  Beginning  in  the  1960s,  fiction  for  children 
portrayed  realistic  situations — the  sad  along  with  the  happy.  For  the  first  time, 
books  for  children  reflected  life  as  we  know  it.  In  so  doing,  authors  covered  a 
broad  spectrum  of  themes,  hitherto  unknown  in  books  for  children.  Those  themes 
included  divorce;  substance  abuse;  child  abuse;  death  of  a  parent,  grandparent, 
friend,  or  pet;  illness;  alternative  lifestyles;  the  various  families  from  different 
cultures  and  their  adjustments  to  life  in  the  United  States;  and  respect  for  the  dif¬ 
fusion  of  cultural  influences  on  everyday  life  at  home,  at  play,  at  school,  in  the 
heart  of  the  suburbs,  in  big  cities,  and  down  the  country  road. 

Many  of  these  subjects  were  considered  taboo  before  the  1960s,  but  the  ad¬ 
vent  of  “realistic”  fiction  was  a  great  boon  for  many  children,  who  could  read 
about  someone  else  going  through  a  difficult  time  and  could  learn  how  that  person 
handled  the  problem.  Some  children  were  actually  relieved  to  realize  that  they 
were  not  alone,  that  others  had  gone  through  similar  situations  and  that,  generally, 
they  survived — often  better  off  and  definitely  more  mature. 

While  some  parents,  teachers,  and  librarians  were  skittish  about  such  books, 
they  had  their  eyes  opened  to  the  real  need  that  children  had  for  the  books.  Those 
adults  soon  had  to  acknowledge  that  life  was  not  always  easy  for  children  either: 
childhood  is  not  always  a  time  for  joy.

Selection 

What,  then,  should  we  look  for  when  we  select  books  and  materials  for  chil¬ 
dren?  How  can  we  choose  from  the  vast  array  that  is  available? 

Foremost  as  we  select  materials  is  that  books  should  produce  joy  and  wonder 
in  the  child,  should  satisfy  curiosity,  should  bring  a  sense  of  comfort  and  recogni¬ 
tion,  should  expand  thinking,  should  respect  the  child  reader,  and  should  be 
within  the  scope  of  the  child’s  ability  to  understand.  We  need  to  remember  that 
these  early,  joyful  experiences  with  books  will  be  the  foundation  for  lifelong 
learning  and  for  understanding  the  importance  of  the  printed  word.  Readers  have 
the  ability  to  succeed  in  school  and  beyond.  Readers  can  be  leaders.  Readers  are 
never  without  friends.  Readers  are  never  alone  because  reading  and  sharing  of 
books  and  ideas  becomes  a  socializing  experience,  sparks  discussion,  and  stimu¬ 
lates  new  ways  of  thinking. 

From  small  thoughts  to  big  ideas.  From  ordinary  life  to  extraordinary 
adventures.  From  around  the  block  to  around  the  world.  From  what 
is  to  what  could  be.  Books  are  the  best  bridges  I  have  crossed. 

Books  change  lives.  I  know  because  Fm  a  reader 

and  a  writer  of  books. 

— Nancy  White  Carlstrom 

As  we  select  books,  we  must  respect  children,  which  includes  a  strong  recog¬ 
nition  of  the  various  backgrounds  and  cultures  from  which  they  come  and  the  va¬ 
riety  of  experiences  they  will  face  as  they  grow  older.  Therefore,  all  materials 
available  to  children  should  reflect  the  wide  diversity  of  interests  among  our  chil¬ 
dren,  as  well  as  their  multicultural,  multiethnic,  and  multilingual  backgrounds. 

Knowledge  of  the  Individual  Child 

Selection  of  books  and  materials  also  requires  knowledge  of  the  individual 
child.  Knowing  the  developmental  stages  of  children,  the  differences  in  learning 
styles  among  children,  and  the  needs  of  children  at  any  particular  time  in  their 
lives  will  come  into  play  as  we  choose  materials. 

We  are  thinking  not  only  of  physical  development,  but  also  of  the  develop¬ 
mental  stages  of  maturation.  By  getting  to  know  the  individual  child,  we  have  a 
much  better  chance  of  recommending  the  right  book  for  the  child  at  the  right  time. 
As  has  been  said  many  times,  no  force — no  matter  how  strong — can  make  a  child 
read  a  book.

A  book  may  be  judged  a  juvenile  classic  by  experts  in  children ’s 
literature,  but  if  it  is  beyond  children ’s  understanding  or  too 
subtle  or  sophisticated  for  their  level  of  appreciation,  they 
can  turn  it  down  with  a  stoney  (sic)  indifference  which 
leaves  adults  baffled  and  grieved.  They  need  not 
mourn.  Two  years  later  a  child  may  accept 
that  book  with  enthusiasm.

Who  Selects  the  Books 

Many  Head  Start  classrooms  already  have  books  that  were  carefully  selected 
by  teachers  or  books  that  were  donated  by  parents  and  others.  However,  you 
should  consider  adding  another  person  to  the  book  selection  team,  which  already 
includes  the  teacher,  aide,  and  parent  or  caregiver. 

Virtually  every  community  has  a  librarian,  and  librarians  have  the  experience 
and  knowledge  that  should  be  added  to  your  materials  selection  team. 

A  librarian’s  expertise  is  knowing  about  both  materials  and  selection  tech¬ 
niques.  Librarians  are  skilled  at  developing  lists  of  materials  to  support  the  cur¬ 
riculum  or  a  theme  being  presented.  In  addition,  the  librarian  is  interested  in 
making  children  aware  that  reading  is  a  pleasurable  experience  (i.e.,  children 
should  read  for  joy  as  well  as  for  information  needed  for  a  classroom  assignment). 
Librarians  are  in  a  unique  position  in  the  community  because  they  work  with  and 
serve  the  entire  community;  they  serve  people  from  every  level  of  the  socio¬ 
economic  sphere  and  from  all  different  cultures. 

Each  member  of  the  team  brings  special  knowledge.  A  parent,  the  child’s  first 
teacher  and  the  strongest  influence  in  his  or  her  attitude  toward  education,  brings 
the  richness  of  family  and  cultural  background,  plus  the  deepest  knowledge  of  an 
individual  child.  Especially  when  a  child  is  very  young,  the  parent  knows  what  is 
best  suited  and  within  the  grasp  of  that  child. 

Teachers  and  teacher  aides  know  themes  that  are  age-appropriate  and  related 
to  the  curriculum.  In  planning  the  day’s  lesson,  a  teacher  knows  which  themes 
and  concepts  to  teach.

There  are  many  forces  in  our  life  today  which  tend  to  separate 
the  child  and  the  book.  Yet  does  not  this  make  it  only  more 
desirable  and  more  necessary  that  the  best  efforts 
be  made  to  bring  them  together? 

— Lillian  Smith,  1991 

A  variety  of  sources  provide  good  lists  of  books  and  materials.  Many  of  those 
lists  are  available  through  your  local  children’s  librarian.  It  may  be  possible  in 
your  community  to  borrow  a  bag  of  books  for  your  classroom.  If  not,  you  can 
certainly  borrow  books  using  your  own  library  card.  Encourage  individual  chil¬ 
dren  and  the  rest  of  their  family  members  to  get  and  use  a  library  card. 

Books 

Begin  at  the  Beginning 

It  is  never  too  soon  to  read  to  a  child.  Babies  need  books.  In  fact,  one  of  the 
most  innovative  programs,  “Begin  at  the  Beginning  with  Books,”  was  developed 
at  the  Los  Angeles  County  Library  System.  Librarians  conducted  classes  at  clinics 
for  expectant  mothers  and  explained  the  importance  of  their  reading  to  their  in¬ 
fants.  The  librarians  also  covered  materials  important  to  new  mothers.  The  pam¬ 
phlet  for  mothers  has  been  written  in  English  and  Spanish,  and  it  stresses  the  point 
that  babies  are  bom  ready  to  leam  and  that  parents  can  nurture  both  their  child’s 
mind  and  body.  Libraries  provide  a  wealth  of  books,  computers,  and  other  re¬ 
sources  that  no  parent  could  possibly  afford. 

From  the  very  beginning,  we  can  find  books  to  share.  Parents  and  teachers  are 
concerned  with  how  to  use  books,  especially  with  the  youngest  children.  Talking, 
singing  lullabies,  and  chanting  nursery  rhymes  are  considered  “reading”  to  chil¬ 
dren.  The  reader  should  not  worry  about  the  words;  it  is  the  sound  of  the  voice — 
the  warmth  conveyed  in  sharing  a  book  or  story — that  is  important. 

Books  can  play  a  significant  role  in  the  life  of  the  young  child,  but 
the  extent  to  which  they  do  depends  entirely  upon  adults. ... 
Adults  must  sing  the  songs,  say  the  rhymes,  tell  the  tales, 
and  read  the  stories  to  children  to  make  literature 
and  all  its  benefits  central  to  children ’s  lives.

Toddlers 

As  babies  become  toddlers,  they  begin  to  enjoy  fingerplay  stories  and  rhymes. 
They  are  also  aware  of  themselves  and  are  beginning  to  separate  the  self  from  the 
outside  world.  Such  favorites  as  “Pat-a-Cake”  and  “This  Little  Pig  Went  to 
Market”  can  be  found  in  these  books: 

•  Montgomery,  Norah.  This  Little  Pig  Went  to  Market:  Play  Rhymes  for  Infants

Of  course,  these  books  should  not  preclude  teacher’s  and  parent’s  choices  that 
come  from  the  adult’s  multicultural  background  or  that  of  the  child.  Children  will 
love  the  music  that  transcends  and  bridges  any  existing  cultural  differences  that 
exist. 

Cloth  Books 

Cloth  books  are  generally  made  from  soft  materials  so  that  babies  cannot  hurt 
themselves.  They  are  flimsy  but  cannot  easily  tear  with  use.  Cloth  books  can  be 
bought,  but  many  are  made  by  parents  and  caregivers. 

Board  Books 

Board  books  are  generally  sturdy  paperboard  books  that  are  laminated.  These 
can  be  baby’s  first  books  since  they  retain  their  book  shape,  have  thick  pages  suit¬ 
able  for  baby’s  chubby  fingers,  and  do  not  tear  like  a  single  sheet  of  paper.  Paper- 
board  books  have  changed  in  the  past  10  years.  They  cover  a  wide  variety  of 
concepts,  themes,  and  stories.  They  generally  have  colorful,  simple  drawings; 
however,  some  contain  long  storylines  and  are  complex.  Although  some  contain 
stories,  other  board  books  contain  a  single  picture  and  one  word  per  page.  There¬ 
fore,  a  child  can  open  the  book  to  any  page  and  enjoy  it.  A  book  becomes  a  fa¬ 
miliar  object  and  part  of  the  very  young  child’s  life  through  holding  board  books. 

A  few  samples  of  board  books  include  these: 

•  Ormerod,  Jan.  Reading.  Lothrop,  Lee  &  Shepard  Books,  1985. 

•  Oxenbury,  Helen.  Clap  Hands.  Macmillan,  1987.

Pop-Up  Books 

Pop-up  books  have  been  around  for  a  very  long  time  and  many  children  love 
the  pop-up  books.  The  element  of  surprise  and  discovery  makes  books  fun.  An 
example  of  this  format  is  in  the  following: 

•  Hill,  Eric.  Where’s  Spot?  Putnam,  1987. 

Folktales 

Reflecting  the  multicultural  and  diverse  nature  among  our  children,  folktales 
are  wonderful  stories  to  tell  and  read.  Children  should  grow  up  hearing  stories 
about  their  own  heritage,  but  it  is  up  to  us  to  share  stories  from  other  cultures.  We 
must  begin  early  to  develop  an  understanding  and  appreciation  of  many  types  of 
experiences.  Peace  comes  from  understanding  and  sharing  stories;  the  earlier  we 
begin  the  process,  the  better.  Folktales  show  that  many  cultures  share  common 
experiences,  and  yet  there  are  different  explanations  for  such  common  experi¬ 
ences.  We  must  ensure  that  our  stories  and  books  reflect  the  pluralistic  nature  of 
our  country.  Here  are  a  few  folktales  that  show  this  diversity: 

•  McDermott,  Gerald.  Anansi  the  Spider:  A  Tale  from  the  Ashanti.  Holt,  1972. 

•  Zemach,  Margot.  It  Could  Always  Be  Worse:  A  Yiddish  Folktale.  Farrar,  1976.

1986. 

•  Aardema,  Verna.  Why  Mosquitoes  Buzz  in  People ’s  Ears:  A  West  African 
Tale.  Dial,  1975. 

Concept  and  Identification  Books 

As  young  children  mature,  they  need  concept  books  and  identification  books. 
While  those  books  generally  lack  a  storyline,  most  children  love  to  pick  up  a 
book,  point  to  an  illustration,  and  “read”  as  they  name  the  color,  the  animal,  the 


50 


Materials  Selection  and  Acquisition 


piece  of  clothing,  and  so  forth.  These  books  help  children  identify  objects  and 
things  in  their  everyday  world.  Early  concept  books  include  alphabet  and  counting 
books.  Good  books  with  simple  letters  or  numbers  and  with  uncluttered  illustra¬ 
tions  of  the  concept  are  essential.  Children  look  for  clarity,  not  confusion.  For  ex¬ 
ample,  number  books  should  clearly  show  what  is  to  be  counted.  Such  books  help 
children  to  build  a  vocabulary  by  realizing  that  a  word  or  number  is  identified 
with  a  picture — definitely  a  precursor  to  reading. 

Some  fine  examples  include  these: 

•  Ahlberg,  Janet,  and  Allan  Ahlberg.  Baby’s  Catalog.  Little,  Brown,  1982.

•  Serfozo,  Mary.  Who  Said  Red?  Atheneum,  1988. 

•  Tafuri,  Nancy.  Who ’s  Counting?  Greenwillow,  1986. 

Picture  Books 

Picture  books  are  generally  storybooks  that  are  illustrated.  There  is  no  attempt 
to  control  vocabulary,  such  as  in  an  easy  reader.  In  fact,  picture  books  are  to  be 
read  to  the  child  either  in  a  one-on-one  sharing  or  in  a  group,  or  as  a  child  gets 
older,  he  may  read  the  book  on  his  own.  Some  picture  books  can  be  shared  in  a 
group  at  a  library  storyhour  or  at  a  storytime  in  the  Head  Start  classroom  or  in  the 
Head  Start  Home  Learning  Center.  Some  picture  books  have  a  brief  story  line  and 
others  have  longer  stories.  Some  illustrations  are  simple  line  drawings  and  others 
resemble  fine  art  paintings.  It  follows,  that  the  older  the  child,  the  longer  time  he 
or  she  can  spend  listening  to  a  story.

Selecting  Books  for  the  Very  Young  Child 

According  to  Dorothy  Butler  (1980),  books  for  infants,  toddlers,  and  3-year- 

olds  should  do  the  following: 

1 .  Contain  appropriate  themes  or  subject  matter.  Content  should  cover  issues 
facing  the  youngest  child,  such  as  building  a  sense  of  trust  and  expressing 
autonomy. 

2.  Use  language  effectively  and  imaginatively.  The  words  in  picture  books 
should  be  precise,  eloquent,  creative,  and  evocative. 

3.  Include  straightforward  plots.  Not  all  books  for  the  very  young  are  story¬ 
books,  but  each  story  written  for  the  very  young  should  be  direct  and 
should  avoid  tangents. 

4.  Build  to  a  satisfying  conclusion.  A  quality  picture  storybook  comes  to  a 
swift  resolution  and  ends  on  a  positive  note.  The  fact  that  the  story  has 
ended  should  be  apparent,  even  to  a  child  who  is  just  learning  how  a  book 
“works.”

Selecting  a  Picture  Book 

Barbara  Elleman  (1986)  has  devised  a  four-step  system  to  select  a  picture 
book: 

Step  1 .  Quickly  look  over  the  book  to  get  a  feel  for  the  tone  and  approach. 
Step  2.  Read  just  the  text,  mentally  block  out  the  art. 

Step  3.  Read  the  story  carefully  while  focusing  on  the  harmony  of  words  and 
pictures,  backtracking  and  pausing  whenever  you  feel  like  it. 

Step  4.  Carefully  look  at  other  details  such  as  book  design,  paper  type, 
endpapers,  dedication,  etc.

Poetry 

Children  love  to  hear  rhyming  words,  and  they  will  finish  a  line  of  poetry  after 
hearing  the  rhymes  a  couple  of  times.  Stories  in  rhyme  and  poetry  can  be  fun  for 
reader  and  listener.  A  very  select  group  of  poetry  books  includes  these:

Books  for  Children  with  Special  Needs  or  to  Help  Children  Cope 

For  books  that  deal  with  specialized  themes  such  as  divorce,  death,  nature, 
science,  and  so  forth,  a  variety  of  indexes  can  help  guide  you.  Most  of  these  books

Evaluation  Questions  for  Selecting  Picture  Books  in  Early 
Childhood  Education 

According  to  Charlotte  Huck  (1979),  the  following  questions  are  important 
when  choosing  picture  books  to  use  as  part  of  early  childhood  education. 

General  Evaluation  Questions 

1 .  Does  the  book  compare  favorably  with  other  picture  books  of  its  type? 

2.  Has  the  picture  book  received  the  endorsements  of  professionals? 

3.  Are  the  literary  elements  of  plot,  theme,  character,  style,  and  setting  used 
effectively? 


54 


Materials  Selection  and  Acquisition 


4.  Do  the  pictures  complement  the  story? 

5.  Is  the  story  free  from  ethnic,  racial,  or  sex-role  stereotypes? 

6.  Is  the  picture  book  developmentally  appropriate  for  the  child? 

7.  Do  preschoolers  respond  enthusiastically  to  the  book? 

8.  Is  the  topic  (and  the  book’s  treatment  of  it)  suitable  for  the  young  child? 

9.  Does  the  picture  book  appeal  to  the  parent  or  teacher? 


Additional  Evaluation  Questions  for  Illustrations 

1 .  Are  the  illustrations  and  text  synchronized? 

2.  Does  the  mood  conveyed  by  the  artwork  (humorous  or  serious,  rollicking 
or  quiet)  complement  that  of  the  story? 

3.  Are  the  illustrative  details  consistent  with  the  text? 

4.  Could  a  child  get  a  sense  of  the  basic  concepts  or  the  story  sequence  by 
looking  at  the  pictures? 

5.  Are  the  illustrations  or  photographs  aesthetically  pleasing? 

6.  Is  the  printing  (clarity,  form,  line,  color)  of  good  quality? 

7.  Can  children  view  and  re-view  the  illustrations,  each  time  getting  more 
from  them? 

8.  Are  the  illustrative  style  and  complexity  suited  to  the  age  level  of  the 
intended  audience? 

Materials  Beyond  Books 

In  addition  to  books,  other  materials  that  are  part  of  a  child’s  everyday  life  can 
stimulate  the  love  of  words  and  can  contribute  to  a  child’s  getting  ready  to  read. 
Among  these  materials  are  sound  recordings  and  cassettes,  book  and  cassette  sets, 
puzzles,  games  and  toys,  videos  and  film,  puppets  and  story  dolls,  and  computer 
software. 

You  might  place  these  materials  near  the  reading  area  or  alcove  or  elsewhere. 
Some  classrooms  have  a  quiet  area  for  books  where  children  might  share  a  story 
or  look  at  the  pictures  on  their  own.  To  separate  quiet  from  sound,  you  should 
place  the  record  and  cassette  players  in  another  area  where  children  can  sing  and 


Materials  Selection  and  Acquisition 


55 


dance  to  the  music.  In  any  event,  you  should  create  a  print-rich  environment, 
clearly  labeling  areas  so  children  will  understand  that  words  have  meanings. 

As  we  know,  children  learn  in  different  ways:  some  learn  visually  through 
print  and  pictures  while  others  learn  auditorially  through  song,  speech,  and  lis¬ 
tening.  We  must  remember  to  respect  these  learning  preferences  and  to  use  each 
of  the  materials  in  whatever  format  to  enhance  the  emergent  literacy  of  individual 
children.  Surrounding  children  with  sounds  and  visuals  creates  the  proper  atmos¬ 
phere  for  learning  to  read.  Remember  how  important  it  is  to  read  to  children — 
even  after  they  have  learned  to  read  on  their  own. 

In  fact,  reading  aloud  to  children  from  literature  that  is  meaningful  to 
them  has  come  to  be  widely  acknowledged  among  experts  to  be  the 
most  effective,  as  well  as  the  simplest  and  least  expensive,  way  to 
foster  in  children  a  lifelong  love  of  books  and  reading.  Seeing 
adults  reading  with  enjoyment  increases  the  chances  that 
children  will  become  lifelong  readers. 

— Margaret  Mary  Kimmel  and  Elizabeth  Segel,  1988 

Especially  important  in  building  an  audiovisual  collection  is  recognizing  that 
these  materials,  too,  must  reflect  the  music  and  stories  of  diverse  cultures.  Parents 
are  excellent  sources  for  helping  to  select  authentic  materials. 

Each  year,  members  of  the  Association  for  Library  Service  to  Children  from 
across  the  country  select  notable  audiovisual  materials  from  the  many  that  were 
produced  in  the  previous  year.  These  lists  are  generally  available  in  the  early 
spring  and  include  the  names  of  distributors  of  award-winning  materials.  Com¬ 
mittee  members  have  a  broad  range  of  experience  along  with  the  geographic  and 
ethnic  representation  necessary  to  select  outstanding  materials.  One  way  to  use 
these  annual  lists  is  to  see  what  new  recordings,  videos,  film,  and  computer  soft¬ 
ware  are  available  and  how  they  can  enhance  your  collections. 

Viewing  and  listening  are  rewarding  activities  in  themselves,  but  they  can 
have  an  added  advantage  of  leading  children  to  read  for  pleasure  or  for  learning 
something  new.  The  purpose  of  these  notable  lists  and  awards  is  to  encourage 
producers  and  publishers  to  strive  for  excellence  in  materials  for  children. 

Only  the  rarest  and  best  kind  of  anything 
can  be  good  enough  for  the  young.

Through  exposure  to  the  best  there  is,  children  expand  their  vision  and 
broaden  their  experiences.  They  find  answers  to  problems,  satisfy  their  curiosity, 
learn  to  appreciate  the  richness  of  life,  and  learn  to  reach  for  goals.

if  you  wish  to  purchase  videos  for  Head  Start  classrooms,  librarians  can  help  you 
find  the  distributors.  For  example,  Children ’s  Media  Market  Place ,  3d  ed.  (New

Magazines 

Magazines  are  colorful,  contain  timely  information,  are  generally  fast-paced, 
and  are  fun  for  children  to  peruse.  It  is  especially  wonderful  if  a  child  receives  a 
subscription  to  a  magazine  from  a  caring  adult.  Children  love  getting  mail  when 
the  magazine  is  sent  directly  to  each  child.

Toys,  Games,  and  Realia 

Play  is  a  child’s  work.  Toys  and  games  that  stimulate  the  mind  and  help  de¬ 
velop  cognitive  skills  are  very  important  to  develop  reading  ability.  For  example, 
large-piece  puzzles  can  help  children  develop  hand  and  eye  coordination,  and 
educational  games  can  reinforce  concepts  such  as  numbers  and  colors.  Puzzles 
that  have  large  pieces  with  handles  can  be  used  by  very  young  children.  Maps  and 
globes  give  the  child  a  sense  of  place  in  the  neighborhood  and  in  the  world  at 
large. 

Dramatic  play  allows  children  to  act  out  a  story.  Children  learn  to  verbalize 
and  to  sequence  events.  All  of  these  skills  are  necessary  when  learning  to  read. 
Educational  games  and  toys  are  used  most  successfully  with  children  when  an 
adult  is  involved. 

Role  playing,  story  theater,  oral  interpretation,  and  creative  dramatics  are  ad¬ 
ditional  ways  to  help  a  child  get  ready  to  read. 

Wordless  picture  books  are  also  important  for  sequencing  events,  for  making 
up  a  story,  and  for  fostering  individual  study.  Puppetry  is  a  well-known  and  well- 
used  vehicle  for  storytelling. 

Even  very  young  children  can  get  connected  to  the  Information  Superhighway 
and  can  check  out  World  Wide  Web  sites  that  have  been  designed  especially  for 
them.  There  is  so  much  available  on  the  Internet  that  you  will  want  a  guide  to 
good  sites  for  children  and  their  families.  Web  sites  change  so  quickly  that  you 
are  better  off  checking  the  potential  sites  when  you  are  ready  to  visit  them.  You 
can  find  recommended  sites  at  <http://www.ssdesign.com/parentspage 
/greatsites/50.html>.  These  sites  are  recommended  by  librarians  from  across  the 
country,  and  the  lists  are  kept  up  to  date.  Because  this  is  such  a  new  field  for  chil¬ 
dren’s  use,  you  will  want  to  consult  books  such  as  The  Parents '  Guide  to  the 
Information  Superhighway  by  the  Children’s  Partnership,  because  it  contains 
commonsense  rules  and  tools  for  going  online. 

Children  who  aren  ’t  logged  on  and  literate 
will  be  lost  in  the  next  century.

Sources  and  Resources 

Your  local  public  library  offers  materials,  services,  and  programs  for  children, 
for  parents  and  caregivers,  for  teachers,  and  for  other  adults  who  work  with  or 
care  about  children  and  children’s  literature.  Get  a  library  card  for  you  and  your 
special  child.  Museums,  especially  children’s  museums,  offer  services  and  exhib¬ 
its  as  well  as  programs  for  children,  their  parents,  and  caregivers.  Be  sure  to  con¬ 
tact  your  local  museum  for  hours,  fees,  and  programs. 

Libraries  connect  children  to  a  world  far  bigger  than  their  own. 

— -Virginia  Mathews 

Librarians  can  help  you  locate  information  necessary  for  ordering  books  and 
other  materials.  Frequently,  you  can  obtain  supplementary  material  to  expand  on  a 
particular  topic  or  theme.  You  can  purchase  books  from  a  bookstore.  If  you  are 
fortunate  to  have  a  children’s  bookstore  (or  a  bookstore  with  good  children’s 
books)  in  your  area,  you  can  discuss  the  possibility  of  receiving  a  teacher’s  dis¬ 
count.  You  can  also  purchase  books  directly  from  some  publishers.  You  can  even 
purchase  them  through  a  jobber.  Librarians  are  a  good  source  for  a  list  of  publish¬ 
ers’  and  jobbers’  addresses  and  phone  numbers.  You  may  even  be  able  to  pool 
your  order  with  the  librarians  so  you  can  receive  a  discount.

Activities  in  the  Classroom 

Overall  Goals 

It  is  important  to  remind  people  that  the  overall  goal  of  the  Head  Start  pro¬ 
gram  is  to  bring  about  a  greater  degree  of  social  competence  in  children  from  low- 
income  families.  Social  competence  means  the  child’s  everyday  effectiveness  in 
dealing  both  with  present  environment  and  with  later  responsibilities  in  school 
and  life.  Social  competence  takes  into  account  the  interrelatedness  of  cognitive 
and  intellectual  development,  physical  and  mental  health,  nutritional  needs,  and 
other  factors  that  enable  a  developmental  approach  to  helping  children  achieve 
social  competence.  To  accomplish  this  goal,  Head  Start  spells  out  very  clear  ob¬ 
jectives  and  performance  standards  that  provide  the  following: 

•  An  improvement  of  the  child’s  health  and  physical  abilities,  including  appro¬ 
priate  steps  to  correct  any  physical  and  mental  problems  and  to  enhance  every 
child’s  access  to  an  adequate  diet. 

•  An  improvement  of  the  family’s  attitude  toward  future  health  care  and 
physical  abilities. 

•  The  encouragement  of  self-confidence,  spontaneity,  curiosity,  and  self- 
discipline  that  will  assist  in  developing  the  child’s  social  and  emotional  health. 

•  The  enhancement  of  the  child’s  mental  processes  and  skills  with  particular 
attention  to  conceptual  and  communications  skills. 

•  The  establishment  of  patterns  and  of  expectations  for  success  by  the  child, 
which  will  create  a  climate  of  confidence  for  present  and  future  learning 
efforts  and  for  overall  development. 

•  An  increase  in  the  ability  of  the  child  and  the  family  to  relate  to  each  other  and 
to  others. 

•  An  enhancement  of  the  sense  of  dignity  and  self-worth  within  the  child  and 
his  family. 

Head  Start  has  recognized  the  parent  as  the  earliest  and  strongest  influence  on 
a  child’s  attitude  toward  education.  Therefore,  a  major  strength  of  the  Head  Start 


71 


program  is  the  parent  involvement  component.  The  goals  and  objectives  of  parent 
involvement  according  to  a  Head  Start  green  paper  (1990)  are  to  do  the  following: 

•  Provide  a  planned  program  of  experiences  and  activities  that  will  support  and 
enhance  the  parental  role  as  the  principal  influence  in  their  child’s  education 
and  development. 

•  Provide  a  program  that  recognizes  parents  as 

-  Responsible  guardians  of  their  children’s  well-being. 

-  Contributors  to  the  Head  Start  program  and  to  their  communities. 

•  Provide  the  following  kinds  of  opportunities  for  parents’  participation: 

-  Direct  involvement  in  decision  making  about  program  plans  and  operations. 

-  Participation  in  classrooms  and  other  program  activities  as  paid 
employees,  volunteers,  or  observers. 

-  Activities  for  parents  that  they  have  helped  to  develop. 

-  Work  with  their  own  children  in  cooperation  with  Head  Start  staff  members. 

-  Participation  in  activities  that  will  lead  to  self-sufficiency. 

No  parent  is  too  poor  to  give  his  child 
the  key  to  success — a  library  card.

Challenges  for  Libraries  and  Museums 

The  challenge  is  to  use  both  the  library’s  resources  and  techniques  and  the 
museum’s  experiences  to  achieve  Head  Start  objectives  for  implementing  social 
competence.  To  take  up  this  challenge,  you  need  to  understand  that  library  and 
museum  materials  and  programs  are  built  to  address  the  developmental  needs  of 
an  individual  child.  Therefore,  it  is  helpful  to  review  developmental  stages  along 
with  a  child’s  related  interests.  Further,  we  will  look  at  activities  that  support  the 
stages  of  development.  Before  we  examine  those  stages,  however,  you  should  re¬ 
member  that  the  library  overall  is  a  wonderful  resource  for  you  and  for  parents. 
Children’s  librarians  are  trained  in  child  development  as  well  as  in  literature  and 
in  various  materials  and  resources.  Librarians  can  provide  a  positive  introduction 
to  a  whole  new  world  of  information.  Libraries  are  publicly  funded  and  free  to

everyone.  Museums  satisfy  curiosity  and  keep  alive  the  child’s  sense  of  wonder 
and  joy. 

To  review  the  chart  of  “The  Child’s  Developmental  Needs,”  see  Chapter  1.  In 
addition,  most  children  have  certain  basic  needs,  and  those  needs  do  not  change, 
even  with  social  change.  According  to  Sutherland  (1997),  the  needs  that  seem  to 
be  common  to  most  people  and  most  times  are  the  need  for  security,  the  need  to 
love  and  be  loved,  the  need  to  belong,  the  need  to  achieve,  the  need  for  change, 
the  need  to  know,  and  the  need  for  beauty  and  order.

Involving  Parents  in  Materials  Selection 

It  is  important  to  include  parents  in  selecting  materials  and  activities  for  use  in 
the  classroom  so  parents  can  help  you  in  the  genuine  integration  of  multicultural, 
multilingual,  and  multiethnic  concepts  and  images  in  all  classroom  activities. 
Thus,  you  can  avoid  the  “multicultural  tourist  syndrome.”

CAUTION! 


WARNING:  TOURIST  CURRICULUM  IS  HAZARDOUS 
TO  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  YOUR  CHILDREN. 

Watch  out  for  these  signs  of  tourist  curriculum: 

•  Trivializing.  Organizing  activities  only  around  holidays  or  only  around  food. 
Involving  parents  only  for  holidays  and  cooking  activities. 

•  Using  Tokenism.  Having  one  black  doll  amid  many  white  dolls;  a  bulletin 
board  of  “ethnic”  images,  which  are  the  only  diversity  in  the  room;  and  only 
one  book  about  any  cultural  group. 

•  Disconnecting  Cultural  Diversity  from  Daily  Classroom  Life.  Reading 
books  about  children  of  color  only  on  special  occasions.  Teaching  a  unit  on  a 
different  culture  and  then  never  seeing  that  culture  again. 

•  Stereotyping.  Using  images  of  Native  Americans  that  are  all  from  the  past; 
always  showing  people  of  color  as  poor;  and  showing  people  from  cultures 
outside  the  United  States  only  in  “traditional”  dress  and  in  rural  settings. 

•  Misrepresenting  American  Ethnic  Groups.  Using  pictures  and  books  about 
Mexico  to  teach  about  Mexican- Americans,  of  Japan  to  teach  about  Japanese- 
Americans,  and  of  Africa  to  teach  about  black  Americans.

Classroom  Activities  to  Be  Carried  Over  into  the  Home 

Activities  that  promote  literacy  are  broad  and  can  meet  the  literacy  develop¬ 
mental  needs  of  children  when  the  opportunities  are  book-related  experiences. 

The  following  ideas  will  help  you  get  started: 

Dramatic  Play 

Keep  a  box  full  of  hats,  old  jewelry,  and  discarded  clothes  so  a  child  can  play 
dress-up  and  can  assume  dramatic  roles.  Puppets,  stuffed  animals,  and  paper  gro¬ 
cery  bags  with  holes  cut  for  eyes  can  also  be  useful  for  dramatic  play.  Look  for 
props  related  to  a  child’s  favorite  books  and  keep  them  together  with  these  books. 
You  will  notice  as  each  child  grows  that  more  and  more  “book  language”  is  used 
as  he  or  she  plays  (e.g.,  “Once  upon  a  time  . . .”  “Run,  run  as  fast  as  you  can  ...” 
“Then,  quick  as  a  flash  . . .”).  As  they  take  turns  in  playing  different  dramatic 
roles,  children  begin  to  understand  the  roles  of  characters  in  the  stories  they  read 
(Willoughby-Herb,  1990). 

Play  with  Blocks 

Ensure  that  the  children  have  ready  access  to  a  collection  of  wooden  blocks  or 
other  materials  from  which  to  construct  things.  Blocks  provide  one  of  the  best  op¬ 
portunities  for  symbolic  representation.  The  mental  exercise  of  imagining  that  a 
stack  of  blocks  can  represent  a  house  will  enable  a  child  to  later  understand  that 
groups  of  letters  are  symbols  for  people  or  objects  (Willoughby-Herb,  1990). 

Artistic  Representation 

Use  drawing  and  modeling  in  clay  as  activities  to  exercise  the  imagination  and 
provide  a  basis  for  later  skills  with  print.  Keep  drawing  materials  such  as  paper, 
crayons,  paints,  and  clay  handy  so  a  child  can  regularly  benefit  from  these  experi¬ 
ences  (Willoughby-Herb,  1990). 

Music  and  Movement 

Provide  children  with  collections  of  records,  CDs,  or  cassette  tapes,  which  can 
vary  from  those  that  tell  stories  so  the  child  can  follow  the  words  in  books,  to 
rhymes  and  songs  by  favorite  children’s  artists.  These  recordings  activate  the 
imagination,  making  it  easier  for  children  to  create  mental  images  of  times  and 
places  far  removed  from  present  reality  (Willoughby-Herb,  1990).

Writing 

Children  need  lots  of  opportunities  to  explore  with  a  pencil  or  crayon  and  to 
experiment  with  making  marks  on  paper  in  their  own  way,  unrestricted  by  con¬ 
cerns  for  staying  in  the  lines  or  by  adult  standards  of  neatness  or  legibility 
(Willoughby-Herb,  1990). 

Experiences  Enriched  by  Print 

Trips,  outings,  holidays  and  other  special  events  take  on  added  meaning  when 
accompanied  by  appropriate  books.  Making  books  available  that  correspond  to 
these  events  will  help  a  child  to  understand  that  literature  is  indeed  quite  relevant 
to  everyday  themes.  In  addition,  be  sure  that  you  create  a  print-rich  classroom  and 
environment.  By  clearly  labeling  areas,  activities,  and  so  forth,  children  begin  to 
understand  that  printed  words  have  a  meaning  (Willoughby-Herb,  1990). 

Role-Playing 

In  role-playing,  a  problem  situation  is  set  up  for  children  to  come  to  terms 
with.  The  situation  allows  children  to  take  on  a  role  and  to  play  it  through  in  order 
to  come  up  with  solutions  to  the  problem.  Often,  the  goal  is  to  promote  social  val¬ 
ues,  and  the  emphasis  is  on  decision  making.  Children  play  the  role  of  a  character 
from  a  book.  Children  must  be  able  to  identify  with  the  character’s  problem;  that 
is,  it  should  be  a  problem  within  their  experience  to  understand.  In  addition,  the 
problem  should  be  one  that  will  help  to  develop  a  personal  value  system.  Ac¬ 
cording  to  Role-Playing  for  Social  Values  by  Fannie  and  George  Shaftel  (1967), 
some  of  the  best  problem  stories  for  preschoolers  involve  situations  dealing  with 
having  integrity,  being  responsible  for  others,  being  fair,  accepting  others,  and 
wishing  you  were  bigger  or  better.  For  instance, 

•  Accepting  others:  Crazy  Lady  by  Jane  Conly. 

•  Being  fair:  A  Bargain  for  Frances  by  Russell  Hoban. 

•  Wishing  you  were  bigger  or  better:  Maybe  Yes,  Maybe  No,  Maybe  Maybe  by 
Susan  Patron. 

You  should  begin  by  reading  the  “problem”  story.  Once  you  finish  reading  the 
story,  you  should  select  the  role-players.  While  the  role-players  are  getting  ready, 
you  should  prepare  the  audience  to  observe.  Once  the  stage  is  set,  the  role-players 
will  enact  the  situation.  Following  certain  key  playing,  you  may  want  to  stop  to 
discuss  and  evaluate  what  is  happening.  Then  there  may  be  further  enactment  and 
discussion.  If  possible,  you  should  try  to  generalize  from  the  specific  role-playing 
to  a  general  solution  to  the  particular  problem.  Role-playing  can  be  a  wonderful

expression  for  children  who  may  not  be  able  to  verbally  respond  very 
comfortably. 

Story  Theater 

Another  form  of  dramatization  is  story  theater  in  which  you  will  read  or  tell 
the  story  while  the  actors  pantomime  the  action.  Because  the  roles  do  not  require 
the  children  to  speak  but  to  pantomime,  some  of  the  demands  and  complexity  are 
removed  from  the  creative  dramatics.  Steps  to  follow  in  story  theater  include 
reading  the  story  aloud  or  telling  it;  helping  children  assume  the  roles  of  the  char¬ 
acters,  while  guiding  the  group  in  pantomiming;  reviewing  the  story  plot  to  re¬ 
mind  children  to  be  able  to  participate;  allowing  time  for  children  to  practice  their 
parts;  arranging  the  area  or  stage  for  the  dramatization;  and  then  reading  or  telling 
the  story  as  the  actors  pantomime. 

Some  stories  that  lend  themselves  to  story  theater  include  these: 

•  The  Three  Billy  Goats  Gruff 

•  The  Three  Little  Pigs 

•  McDermott,  Gerald.  Anansi  the  Spider:  A  Tales  from  the  Ashanti.  Holt,  1972. 

•  The  Three  Little  Bears 

•  Aardema,  Verna.  Why  Mosquitoes  Buzz  in  People ’s  Ears:  A  West  African 
Tale.  Dial,  1975. 

Storytelling 

Storytelling  is  a  wonderful  way  to  get  parents  involved  in  your  program.  Even 
for  parents  who  do  not  have  a  strong  reading  ability,  the  art  of  storytelling  may 
have  been  handed  down  through  their  family.  Many  cultures  have  a  strong  oral 
tradition;  in  fact  it  may  be  one  in  which  the  beginnings  of  that  culture  originated. 
Most  cultures  have  stories  that  explain  how  the  world  began,  how  the  sun  and 
moon  came  into  the  heavens,  and  other  natural  phenomena.  Those  myths  and 
folktales  can  bring  untold  enrichment  into  your  classroom  as  people  from  that 
culture  tell  the  stories  directly  to  your  children.  This  activity  is  wonderful  for 
Head  Start  children,  because  they  can  identify  with  the  stories  and  the  adults  who 
are  telling  the  stories.  There  is  also  a  sense  of  pride  in  the  traditions  of  the  culture 
from  which  the  children  and  their  parents  come.  Children  need  to  see  themselves 
in  a  story.  There  is  an  added  bonus  if  the  parents  can  tell  the  story  bilingually. 
Children  learn  language  best  during  these  early  preschool  years.

You,  too,  can  become  a  storyteller.  According  to  many  professional 
storytellers,  you  should  follow  these  steps: 

1.  Choose  a  story  that  you  like.  You  are  more  likely  to  convey  enthusiasm 
about  the  story  if  you  enjoy  it. 

2.  Read  and  re-read  the  story  so  you  become  comfortable  and  know  the  story 
well  enough  that  you  will  not  worry  about  forgetting  parts  of  it.  Most  sto¬ 
rytellers  suggest  that  you  not  try  to  memorize  an  entire  story. 

3.  Draw  your  audience  in  as  you  tell  the  story  so  they  will  share  the  mood  of 
the  story  with  you. 

The  wonderful  thing  about  storytelling  is  that  you  can  tell  a  story  in  just  about 
any  situation,  even  if  you  do  not  have  books  with  you.  For  instance,  while  your 
class  is  waiting  for  a  guest  to  arrive  when  the  guest  is  late,  you  can  tell  a  story  to 
pass  the  time.  With  experience,  you  will  become  a  successful  storyteller  as  you 
learn  to  keep  the  attention  of  your  audience.  You  will  begin  to  observe  the  signs 
of  waning  interest  when  the  children  begin  to  wiggle  or  their  heads  begin  to  turn. 
You  will  then  begin  to  emphasize  parts  of  the  story  that  will  hold  the  attention  of 
the  children.  Just  as  with  any  new  skill,  practice  in  storytelling  will  give  you  con¬ 
fidence  and  that  confidence  will  be  conveyed  to  your  young  listeners. 

For  most  beginners,  the  easiest  tales  to  learn  are  the  folktales.  Folktales,  as  we 
have  said  earlier,  are  usually  passed  down  through  the  oral  tradition,  which  makes 
them  perfect  for  retelling.  Generally,  an  introduction  sets  the  stage  for  the  story, 
followed  by  the  problem.  Then  the  story  develops  with  increased  action  or  sus¬ 
pense,  followed  by  the  climax  when  the  story  turns  and  the  hero  is  successful. 
Generally,  the  most  beloved  stories  are  those  that  end  with  all  the  conflicts  re¬ 
solved  and  the  villains  suitably  taken  care  of.  Here  are  some  resources  for 
successful  storytelling:

Magic,  and  More.  Rev.  ed.  Chicago:  American  Library  Association,  1993.

Reading  Aloud 

The  surest  predictor  of  creating  a  lifetime  reader  is  reading  aloud  to  a  child.  It 
is  never  too  early  to  begin  to  “read”  (sing,  chant  nursery  rhymes,  talk)  to  a  child, 
and  you  cannot  read  often  enough.  Studies  have  shown  that  simple  reading  aloud 
on  a  daily  basis  will  improve  children’s  independent  reading  skills  and 
motivation. 

The  single  most  important  activity  for  building  the  knowledge 
required  for  eventual  success  in  reading 
is  reading  aloud  to  children. 

— U.S.  Department  of  Education,  What  Works,  1986 

Good  picture  books  feed  the  heart  and  mind  as  well  as  the  eyes,  for  they 
invite  children  to  live  for  a  moment  in  another  world,  to  feel  someone  else’s  joy 
and  sorrow,  to  see  the  familiar  in  a  new  way.  It  is  this  vitality  in  good  picture 
books  that  makes  them  an  important  part  of  a  full  childhood.  It  is  this  same 
vitality  that  makes  them  invaluable  as  a  child’s  first  experience  with  literature 
and  art. 

Source:  The  Lively  Art  of  Picture  Books  (film  now  unavailable). 

The  importance  of  reading  aloud  cannot  be  stressed  enough.  Reading  aloud  is 
important  even  when  children  begin  to  read  on  their  own.  The  pleasure  that  is 
conveyed  in  hearing  a  story  read,  the  bond  that  forms  between  the  child  and  the 
reader  of  a  story,  and  the  impact  on  the  child  of  hearing  a  wonderful  story  are  im¬ 
portant  ingredients  for  creating  a  lifetime  reader  and  learner.  When  the  reading  is 
done  on  a  daily  basis,  children  begin  to  realize  that  reading  is  part  of  everyday 
life,  that  learning  takes  place  every  day,  and  that  their  lives  are  enriched  by  hear¬ 
ing  good  stories.  Reading  aloud  to  children  allows  them  to  expand  their  experi¬ 
ences  beyond  the  classroom  and  home  and  to  recognize  their  own  feelings  and 
similarities  to  others.  Curiosity,  the  basis  for  learning,  is  satisfied  through  a  good 
story.  And  good  stories  stimulate  the  imagination  and  keep  curiosity  alive  in  chil¬ 
dren.  It  is  up  to  every  one  of  us,  caring  adults,  to  give  children  all  they  need  to 
reach  their  full  potential  and  to  achieve  their  dreams. 

If  you  are  new  at  reading  aloud  to  children,  one  way  you  could  start  is  to  visit 
the  library  and  attend  a  storyhour  given  perhaps  in  the  evening  or  on  the  weekend. 
You  will  have  the  opportunity  to  observe  an  experienced  librarian  conducting  the 
storytime  and  will  observe  how  the  librarian  reads  the  story.  Another  approach  is 
to  invite  the  children’s  librarian  to  visit  your  Head  Start  program  to  read  stories  to 
the  children  or  to  conduct  a  storytime  at  your  site.  Either  way,  you  can  learn  a  lot 
from  observation  and  from  asking  the  librarian  questions  about  good  titles  to  read 
and  techniques  that  you  can  use.

Here  are  some  suggestions  for  reading  aloud  to  children: 

•  Select  books  that  you  like. 

•  Select  books  that  are  well  written. 

•  Select  characters  who  will  be  interesting  to  your  listeners. 

•  Choose  a  story  with  a  plot  that  moves  at  a  pace  fast  enough  to  keep  a  child’s 
interest. 

•  Be  sure  to  read  the  book  yourself  before  you  read  it  out  loud  to  young 
children. 

•  Allow  your  listeners  to  get  settled  down  before  the  story  begins;  some  librari¬ 
ans  use  a  fingerplay  exercise  to  settle  the  children. 

•  If  the  illustrations  are  important  to  the  story,  be  sure  that  the  children  are  close 
enough  to  be  able  to  see  the  pictures. 

•  Hold  the  book  so  the  children  can  see  the  pictures  while  you  read,  or  pause  at 
the  end  of  the  page,  taking  time  to  show  illustrations  to  the  children. 

•  Use  your  voice  to  create  a  mood;  your  tone  of  voice,  level  of  pitch,  and  pace 
of  reading  all  contribute  to  the  mood. 

•  Read  aloud  to  generate  many  different  responses;  you  may  want  to  encourage 
responses  by  asking  open-ended  questions  (questions  that  can’t  be  answered 
by  “yes”  or  “no”). 

•  Display  the  books  you  read. 

•  Thank  the  children  for  being  good  listeners;  let  them  leave  the  experience 
feeling  great. 

•  Encourage  the  children  to  visit  the  library  for  books  and  special  programs;  if 
they  do  not  have  a  library  card,  encourage  them  or  their  families  to  get  a  card. 

Good  stories  can  be  extended  through  classroom  activities  and  fingerplays. 

For  follow-up  to  good  stories,  the  District  of  Columbia  Public  Library  has  sug¬ 
gestions  called  “Reach  Out  and  Read  Follow-up  Activities.”  They  are  generally 

theme  related  and  can  certainly  extend  concepts  in  the  Head  Start  program.  For 

instance,  for  “It’s  a  Beach  Day!”  use  these  Reach  Out  and  Read  Activities:

And  a  Fingerplay 
“Touch” 

I’ll  touch  my  hair,  my  lips,  my  chin. 

I’ll  sit  up  straight  and  rise  again. 

I’ll  touch  my  ears,  my  nose,  my  chin. 

Then  quietly  sit  down  again.

Games  and  Songs 

Music  is  a  part  of  almost  all  cultures,  from  the  reciting  of  prayers  to  having 
fun  and  playing  games.  Music  sets  a  mood.  Singing  to  young  children — especially 
a  lullaby — can  establish  a  relationship  between  the  adult  and  the  child,  can  create 
an  atmosphere  of  love,  and  can  provide  a  feeling  of  a  safe  environment.  Nursery 
rhymes  can  be  sung  or  chanted,  and  the  child  begins  to  understand  cadence  and 
rhyme.  Singing  can  be  a  child’s  first  introduction  to  stories  and  to  reading.  Songs 
make  language  fun  to  listen  to  and  to  say,  and  they  provide  early,  playful  experi¬ 
ences  that  lay  the  foundation  for  reading. 

And  here  is  another  place  that  parents  can  be  involved.  They  may  have  songs 
from  their  tradition  that  will  expand  a  child’s  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the 
world  around  her  or  him.  For  a  selection  of  good  songs  for  preschool  children, 
you  can  review  some  of  the  books  mentioned  at  the  end  of  the  section  on  Reading 
Aloud  (page  72).  In  addition,  you  can  borrow  songbooks  and  cassette  tapes  from 
the  library.  Call  your  librarian  to  make  arrangements  for  particular  tapes  that  will 
support  your  curriculum.  Here  are  some  songbooks:

Puppets  and  Dolls 

Puppetry  allows  children  to  plan  a  dramatization,  create  dialogue,  and  use 
their  voices  effectively.  Of  all  the  dramatic  activities  around  a  story,  puppetry  is 
the  least  threatening  because  the  child  is  generally  not  visible  to  the  audience.  In 
helping  children  select  a  story  as  the  basis  of  a  puppet  show,  you  might  look  for  a 
book  that  has  a  simple  plot  but  is  filled  with  conflict.  Folktales  are  good  for  be¬ 
ginners  as  well  as  for  experienced  puppeteers  because  they  usually  have  repetitive 


Activities  in  the  Classroom 


85 


plot  structures.  Dolls  can  be  used  just  as  effectively  as  puppets.  In  fact,  some  sto¬ 
rytime  dolls  can  become  four  different  characters  by  simply  turning  the  costume 
over  or  by  turning  the  doll  upside  down  or  backwards. 

However,  you  do  not  need  to  have  expensive  stages  or  expensive  puppets  and 
dolls.  Part  of  the  fun  of  telling  a  story  through  the  use  of  puppets  or  dolls  is  cre¬ 
ating  the  puppet.  There  are  many  kinds  of  puppets:  finger  puppets,  hand  puppets, 
string  puppets,  stick  puppets,  and  shadow  puppets.  And  there  are  a  variety  of 
ways  to  create  each  kind  of  puppet.  For  instance,  finger  puppets  can  be  made  of 
paper  or  can  be  knitted.  They  must  fit  snugly  on  the  finger  so  they  can  move 
without  falling  off.  Some  finger  puppets  are  made  from  a  glove.  Each  finger  has  a 
different  face  portraying  a  different  character. 

Similarly,  the  puppet  stage  can  be  an  old  refrigerator  carton  with  a  space  cut 
in  front  for  the  stage,  a  table  turned  on  its  side  so  the  children  can  get  behind  and 
hold  the  puppets  over  their  heads,  or  a  cut-out  carton  that  is  placed  on  a  table. 
However,  among  the  children’s  parents  you  may  find  a  talented  carpenter  who 
can  help  you  with  a  more  permanent  stage.  You  need  not  worry  even  if  you  do  not 
have  a  stage,  because  when  you  or  a  child  hold  up  a  puppet  or  doll  that  “speaks,” 
the  audience  gets  caught  up  with  the  character  and  doesn’t  really  see  the  person 
who  is  manipulating  the  puppet. 

According  to  Caroline  Feller  Bauer  (1997),  leading  kids  to  books  through 
puppets  works  if  you 

•  Think  simple. 

•  Think  lively. 

•  Think  fun. 

•  And  always  . . .  think  books. 

You  probably  receive  department  store  or  other  catalogs  that  you  throw  away. 
Before  you  toss,  think  “puppets.”  You  or  the  children  can  cut  out  a  variety  of 
pictures  of  people  and  can  paste  or  tape  those  pictures  to  the  top  of  Popsicle™ 
sticks  or  tongue  depressors  for  instant  puppets.  This  is  just  one  of  the  many  ideas 
found  in  the  following  books:

American  Library  Association,  1997.

Flannel  Board  Stories 

Another  way  to  tell  stories  is  through  the  use  of  a  flannel  board  or  a  felt  board. 
You  can  easily  make  these  boards  using  foamboard,  heavy  cardboard,  or  a  rectan¬ 
gle  of  plywood.  The  board  should  be  covered  with  flannel  or  felt. 

You  can  make  the  story  figures,  as  well,  using  felt.  If  you  or  one  of  your  par¬ 
ents  is  talented,  then  figures  can  be  cut  out  of  felt  directly.  Another  way  is  to 
photocopy  the  story  figures  and  trace  them  onto  the  felt.  Different  color  felt 
should  be  used  for  various  parts  of  the  story  figure.  Clothes  can  be  glued  to  the 
figure.  Eyes  and  other  features  can  be  made  of  beads,  paper,  or  other  materials, 
and  can  be  glued  in  place.  A  black  felt-tip  pen  can  be  used  for  details.  The  story 
figures  can  be  as  simple  or  ornate  as  you  or  the  child  want  them  to  be. 

Keep  in  mind  that  the  story  should  be  simple  and  lively.  Again,  some  folktales 
and  nursery  rhymes  can  be  done  quite  effectively  using  a  flannel  board.  The  Three 
Billy  Goats  Gruff  or  The  Three  Bears  would  be  excellent  for  beginner  flannel 
board  stories. 

Flannel  boards  can  be  placed  on  an  easel  or  propped  up  against  a  wall.  Some 
storytellers  like  to  hold  the  board  on  their  lap  or  to  hold  it  up  on  a  table  next  to 
where  the  storyteller  is  sitting.  The  figures  can  be  placed  flat  on  the  table  or  in  the 
storyteller’s  lap,  generally  in  the  order  in  which  the  figures  appear  in  the  story. 
With  a  little  practice,  you  can  decide  which  is  the  easiest  for  you  to  manage  when 
you  are  the  storyteller. 

You  can  read  the  story  through  to  the  children  in  your  audience  and  then  let 
them  tell  the  story  back  to  you,  using  the  flannel  figures  on  the  board.  You  could 
read  through  the  story  a  second  time  while  the  children  work  the  figures. 


Activities  in  the  Classroom

However,  if  you  are  telling  the  story  using  a  flannel  board,  you  will  want  to  have 
read  the  story  through  several  times  so  you  can  concentrate  on  working  the 
figures  on  the  flannel  or  felt  board. 


Multimedia 

Book  and  cassette  sets  allow  children  to  listen  to  a  story  and  to  follow  along 
with  the  book.  A  value  to  this  introduction  to  books  is  that  this  activity  can  be 
done  on  an  individual  basis.  Many  libraries  have  book  and  cassette  sets  that  can 
be  borrowed  or  used  either  in  the  classroom  or  at  home.  These  sets  are  also  very 
good  for  parents  who  may  be  learning  English  as  a  second  language.  Parents  and 
children  can  hear  the  story  and  follow  the  text. 

Videotapes  of  stories  can  also  lead  children  to  books.  The  wonderful  thing 
about  videotapes  is  the  viewer’s  control  over  the  time  for  viewing.  Tapes  can  be 
played  over  and  over  again  at  any  time  that  is  convenient.  You  should  follow  up 
good  tapes  with  the  book  or  with  other  books  that  relate  to  the  video. 

Television  can  be  used  effectively  if  there  is  adult  intervention  when  the  child 
views  the  television  program.  You  or  a  volunteer  parent  can  reinforce  the  lesson 
to  be  learned  by  talking  with  the  child  during  or  immediately  after  viewing  the 
program.  For  instance,  a  nature  series  can  be  followed  up  with  classroom  activi¬ 
ties  related  to  the  subject  of  the  television  program.  Another  example  is  a  program 
about  dinosaurs.  One  classroom  activity  could  be  molding  a  dinosaur  out  of  clay. 
Another  activity  would  be  to  have  a  number  of  dinosaur  books  available  in  the 
classroom  once  the  television  program  is  over.  Almost  all  children  are  fascinated 
by  dinosaurs  and  like  to  stretch  their  imaginations  while  painting  or  coloring  a 
picture  of  a  dinosaur  or  making  one  out  of  papier-mache. 

Being  able  to  read  is  the  most  basic  survival  skill  in  an  information 
society,  but  it  isn ’t  enough .  Our  children  must  know  how 
to  navigate  the  information  superhighway.

Interactive  computer  programs  are  now  available  for  very  young  children.  If 
you  have  a  computer  in  your  classroom,  you  will  want  to  have  available  some 
programs  designed  for  preschoolers.  Each  year  the  Association  for  Library  Serv¬ 
ice  to  Children  selects  notable  children’s  software  and  notable  children’s  Web 
sites.  For  a  complete  listing  of  these  materials,  you  can  send  a  self-addressed, 
postage-paid  envelope  to  Notable  Children’s  Audio  Visual  Materials,  Association 
for  Library  Service  to  Children,  50  E.  Huron,  Chicago,  IL  60611.  These  lists  are 
updated  annually  and  contain  the  best  in  recordings,  CDs,  films,  videos,  and  com-

puter  software  programs.  The  list  is  also  available  at  <  http://www.ala.org/alsc/ 
awards.html>  on  the  Web.  Your  local  librarian  should  be  able  to  provide  you  with 
the  list  or  with  some  of  the  materials  as  well. 

What  we  fail  to  provide  for  in  the  emerging  literacy  needs  of  our 
children,  we  pay  for  tenfold  in  the  resulting  myriad  social  and 
educational  problems  directly  resulting  from, 
or  related  to,  the  school  failures  of  youth.

Museums 

Museums  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  individuals.  Children’s  museums  are 
especially  geared  for  young  people  along  with  their  families  and  caregivers. 
Children’s  museums  have  at  their  core  the  mission  to  engage  children  in  the  ex¬ 
hibits  and  to  keep  alive  the  curiosity  that  all  children  have.  Successful  museum 
exhibits  for  children  should  have  accompanying  books  and  materials  that  enhance 
the  exhibit  experience.  Many  of  the  exhibits  in  children’s  museums  involve 
hands-on  activities — the  museum  allows  the  children  to  touch  and  manipulate, 
smell,  see,  and  so  forth.  An  excellent  follow-up  to  a  museum  visit  is  reading  a 
story  related  to  the  museum  visit.  For  instance,  if  the  visit  is  to  a  zoo,  then  the  ex¬ 
perience  can  be  extended  by  reading  stories  about  zoos  or  about  some  of  the  ani¬ 
mals  seen  in  the  zoo.  If  the  visit  is  to  a  botanical  garden,  then  the  Children  could 
hear  a  story  about  growing  plants  from  seed  (e.g.,  The  Carrot  Seed).  Then  they 
could  actually  plant  seeds  in  a  clay  pot.  Follow-up  activities  extend  the  museum 
experience  both  in  the  classroom  and  at  home. 

This  sample  mission  statement  from  the  Grand  Rapids  Children’s  Museum 
shows  how  committed  museums  are  to  quality  services  for  children:  “We  cele¬ 
brate  childhood  and  the  joy  of  learning  by  providing  an  exciting,  hands-on  envi¬ 
ronment  that  inspires  learning  and  encourages  self-directed  exploration.” 

Children’s  museums  have  begun  to  have  book-based  exhibits.  An  exhibit  at 
the  Please  Touch  Museum  in  Philadelphia  focuses  on  the  books  by  Maurice 
Sendak,  the  Caldecott- winning  author.  Based  on  Where  the  Wild  Things  Are  and 
In  the  Night  Kitchen,  the  exhibit  has  costumes  so  children  can  dress  up  and  act  out 
the  wild  rumpus  described  in  the  book.  Next  to  the  exhibit  are  tables  with  copies 
of  the  books  for  reading  right  in  the  museum.  This  is  a  wonderful  example  of 
bringing  more  than  one  medium  to  the  child. 

At  the  Wadsworth  Atheneum  in  Connecticut,  the  educational  staff  members 
have  prepared  a  series  of  treasure  hunts  for  children  and  their  families  who  visit

this  fine  arts  museum  (see  the  examples  in  English  and  Spanish).  For  instance, 
one  treasure  hunt  titled  “Best  Foot  Forward”  encourages  youngsters  to  search  for 
certain  kinds  of  shoes  that  are  seen  in  the  paintings.  Another  treasure  hunt  is 
“Find  the  Felines.”  Using  the  guidelines  for  playing,  children  are  encouraged  to 
look  for  cats  in  the  pictures  hanging  in  the  museum.  Games  such  as  these  encour¬ 
age  children  to  look  closely  at  the  artwork  and  engage  them  in  the  museum  expe¬ 
rience.  Some  examples  of  treasure  hunts  are  provided  at  the  end  of  this  chapter. 

Talented  people  are  in  every  community.  Some  are  found  right  in  your 
classroom:  the  children’s  parents.  Other  talented  people  can  be  found  in  the  li¬ 
brary  or  the  museum.  Local  volunteer  pools  provide  another  source  for  storytell¬ 
ers,  puppeteers,  and  others.  Your  library,  the  information  place,  may  have  a  list  of 
community  resource  people.  At  the  very  least,  the  librarian  should  be  able  to  tell 
you  where  you  can  get  a  list  of  resource  people. 

Read  Aloud  Training  for  Volunteers 

Children’s  librarians  can  generally  train  volunteers  who  will  read  stories  in 
your  classrooms.  The  following  example  of  information  for  read  aloud  training  is 
adapted  from  the  program  at  Denver  Public  Library. 


Read  Aloud  Training 

(presented  by  the  Children’s  Library  of  the 
Denver  Public  Library) 

Welcome  to  training  for  the  Read  Aloud  Program!  Thank  you  for  your  interest 
in  reading  to  children.  We  hope  you  will  find  it  wonderfully  rewarding. 

Story  reading  styles  are  as  individual  and  varied  as  the  people  who  perform 
them.  The  following  are  suggestions  for  successful  and  enjoyable  storytimes. 

Planning  Before  Your  Storytime 

•  Practice  reading  the  books  aloud.  Sense  the  rhythm  and  pace  of  the  text, 
planning  for  changes  or  for  emphasis  in  voice  patterns. 

•  Note  the  pictures  at  which  you  wish  to  pause  before  turning  pages. 

•  Younger  children  need  stretch  and  movement  breaks.  Rehearse  any  songs  or 
fmgerplays  if  you  plan  to  use  them. 


90 


Activities  in  the  Classroom 


Starting  Your  Storytime 

•  Greet  the  children.  Tell  them  who  you  are,  what  you  will  be  doing,  and  what 
you  need  from  them.  Specifically,  tell  them  you  will  be  reading  the  stories  all 
the  way  through  without  interruption  or  discussion.  Assure  them  that  there 
will  be  time  to  talk  after  the  storytime. 

•  Have  the  children  make  themselves  comfortable  in  such  a  way  that  they  can 
all  see  the  books. 

•  Make  yourself  comfortable. 

•  Start  and  end  the  storytime  in  the  same  way  each  week,  thereby  setting  a 
pattern  the  children  become  familiar  with. 

•  Having  a  song,  poem,  or  special  fmgerplay  helps  to  settle  the  children  into  the 
“magic  time  of  story  hour.” 

Reading  Successfully 

•  When  introducing  each  book,  hold  the  book  to  display  the  cover.  Give  the 
title,  author,  and  illustrator. 

•  Hold  the  book  open  on  one  side  of  your  body  so  that  the  children  can  see  the 
illustrations  clearly.  Try  to  keep  the  book  steady  and  motionless.  Do  not  move 
the  book  back  and  forth  in  front  of  the  audience.  Such  movement  can  be  dis¬ 
tracting.  We  recommend  that  you  maintain  a  steady  posture  throughout  the 
story,  even  while  turning  the  pages. 

•  Introducing  the  first  book  is  very  important.  Have  your  tone  of  voice  and 
choice  of  books  build  the  mood  you  want  to  set  for  storytime. 

•  Use  your  own  voice;  steady,  but  with  natural  expression  and  animation.  Keep 
it  simple.  Read  slowly.  Enunciate. 

•  At  natural  pauses,  turn  to  the  children  to  draw  them  into  the  story. 

•  Try  to  maintain  the  children’s  attention  in  a  positive  manner. 

•  Remember  that  well-written  picture  books  blend  language  and  illustration  in  a 
way  that  involves  children  on  many  different  levels.  It  is  very  important  to 
read  the  text  as  it  is  written  and  not  adapt  or  paraphrase. 

•  Allow  the  children  to  absorb  the  text  at  their  own  pace,  which  means  you 
should  read  slowly  and  pause  before  turning  each  page. 


Activities  in  the  Classroom 


91 


•  Encourage  the  children  to  have  the  fun  of  participating  when  the  story  in¬ 
cludes  a  repeating  refrain  or  chant.  But  please  don’t  interrupt  the  story  by 
adding  comments  or  asking  questions.  It  is  best  to  ignore  spontaneous  inter¬ 
ruptions  from  the  children. 

Making  Transitions  Between  Books 

•  A  transition  between  books  may  be  as  simple  as  saying,  “The  next  book  I  will 
be  reading  for  you  is  called  ( Title  of  Book)." 

•  As  you  become  more  comfortable,  you  may  wish  to 

1 .  Point  out  a  similarity  between  the  books. 

2.  Share  information  about  the  author,  illustrator,  or  illustrations  (1-2 
sentences  is  enough). 

•  You  should  build  your  repertoire  of  fun  songs  and  fingerplays  for  those  times 
when  the  children  need  to  move. 

Ending  the  Reading  Session 

•  Display  the  books  you  read,  give  a  cheer  for  the  books,  or  have  a  closing  song 
or  chant — anything  that  leaves  the  children  feeling  great! 

•  Thank  the  children  for  being  such  good  listeners. 

•  Tell  them  when  you  or  another  reader  will  be  reading  again. 

•  Encourage  them  to  visit  the  library  for  books  and  special  programs. 

•  Finally,  give  yourself  a  treat  for  doing  a  wonderful  thing!  You  are  exciting 
children  with  a  vital  experience — the  joyous  adventure  of  reading  and 
literature. 

Thank  you!

Ideas  from  Volunteer  Readers 
(from  the  Denver  Public  Library) 

Ideas  for  Beginning  and  Ending  Storytime 

•  I  use  the  same  routine  each  time.  After  2-3  sessions,  the  children  know  the 
routine  and  participate. 

•  I  greet  children  with  a  cheerful  smile  and  tell  them  how  happy  I  am  to  see 
them. 

•  I  introduce  myself  and  ask  their  names.  Afterwards,  I  allow  all  the  kids  to  look 
at  or  read  the  books. 

•  I  have  a  magic  wand  and  a  cute  music  box  to  play,  which  draws  their  interest. 

•  At  the  end,  we  clap  for  each  author  and  illustrator.  The  children  pat  them¬ 
selves  on  the  back  for  listening  so  well. 

•  I  end  by  thanking  the  children  for  being  such  good  listeners  and  tell  them 
when  I  will  be  back  again. 

Ways  of  Building  Rapport  with  the  Children 

•  I  wear  a  name  tag,  and  I  bring  name  tags  for  the  children  so  I  can  leam  their 
names  quickly. 

•  I  smile  and  remember  their  names. 

•  I  use  eye  contact  and  a  consistent  routine.  I  thank  them  for  inviting  me  to 
come. 

•  We  chat  for  a  few  minutes  before  I  formally  begin  storytime. 

•  I  tell  the  children  how  pleased  I  am  to  see  them,  and  I  praise  the  good 
listeners. 

•  To  shake  off  their  restlessness,  I  usually  engage  children  in  some  activity 
related  to  one  book. 

•  The  children  love  to  pet  Clifford  (puppet)  so  that  is  a  treat  at  the  end  of 
storytime.  Those  who  want  a  hug  get  one,  and  most  of  the  children  do.

Introducing  and  Talking  About  the  Library 

•  I  tell  the  children  that  the  library  is  a  place  where  they  can  borrow  books  for 
free. 

•  Usually  the  children  ask  if  I  can  leave  the  books.  I  tell  them  they  can  get  all 
these  books  at  the  library. 

•  I  have  my  library  card  taped  to  the  bookpack  and  mention  every  time,  “When 
you  go  to  the  library,  be  sure  to  look  for  these  books.”  I  give  out  library  cards 
ASAP  so  the  others  will  follow  through. 

•  I  introduce  myself  as  being  from  the  library  and  tell  the  kids  why  I  like  to 
read. 

•  The  children  call  me  the  “Library  Girl.” 

Ideas  for  Reading  Successfully 

•  I  prepare  my  stories  ahead  of  time  by  reading  to  get  the  feel  of  the  plot.  I  read 
aloud  to  hear  how  it  sounds,  making  my  voice  sound  like  the  various  charac¬ 
ters  and  creating  an  atmosphere  of  the  story. 

•  I  try  to  arrange  the  books  I  will  read  for  a  natural  transition  from  one  book  to 
another.  I  read  3-4  books,  then  have  a  break  for  children  by  using  poems, 
actions  songs,  and  so  forth. 

•  When  I  prepare,  I  figure  out  how  to  have  the  children  participate.  Then  I  stay 
around  to  let  the  children  look  at  the  books  and  feel  them. 

•  I  try  to  make  the  words  work  to  my  advantage  and  use  my  voice  to  tell  the 
story. 

•  When  there  is  much  repetition,  children  can  repeat  with  me.  If  it  is  a  song,  I 
sing  it  and,  if  possible,  have  them  sing  with  me. 

•  I  begin  with  a  short,  visually  “catchy”  book  or  one  that  the  may  participate  in. 
I  put  longer  books  in  the  middle  and  end  with  a  pop-up  or  other  “fun”  book. 

•  I  always  save  the  pop-up  book  for  the  last  so  we  can  read  it  two  times. 

Giving  Out  Library  Cards  and  Gift  Books 

•  I  make  a  big  deal  out  of  the  library  cards.  Each  child  comes  up,  and  I  shake 
his  or  her  hand  and  we  all  clap  for  each  one. 


94 


Activities  in  the  Classroom 


•  It  is  important  to  give  the  children  a  chance  to  look  through  their  gift  books.  I 
read  the  book,  and  they  follow  along  with  their  copy. 

•  I  let  the  teacher  know  that  I  will  be  giving  out  books  that  day.  I  hand  out  a 
book  to  each  child  and  then  to  the  teacher,  and  I  write  names  in  the  books. 

•  I  use  the  last  session  just  to  give  away  books.  I  have  each  child  come  up  one  at 
a  time.  When  I  write  each  name  in  the  books,  the  children  get  so  excited. 

Connecting  with  the  Teacher 

•  I  thank  the  teacher  for  inviting  me  to  come  every  time. 

•  I  try  to  speak  to  the  teacher  for  a  few  minutes  each  week. 

•  I  try  to  be  pleasant  and  nonthreatening. 

•  I  explain  the  purpose  of  the  Read  Aloud  Program  and  let  the  teachers  know 
how  much  their  help  and  cooperation  are  appreciated.

The  America  Reads  Challenge  was  initiated  to  help  more  children  read  well 
and  independently  by  the  end  of  third  grade.  The  Ready* Set*Read  Early  Child¬ 
hood  Learning  Kit  was  designed  for  all  children  from  birth  through  age  5.  The  kit 
includes  an  “Activity  Guide  for  Families  and  Caregivers,”  an  “Early  Childhood 
Activity  Calendar,”  and  an  “Early  Childhood  Growth  Chart.”  The  kit  was  devel¬

How  to  Play 

Use  your  detective  skills  to  search  out  members  of  the  cat  family  lurking  in  our  galleries. 

S  Using  the  clues,  check  off  each  cat  as  you  find  it  in  a  painting  or  sculpture. 

What  stories  would  you  tell  about  each  of  these  cats? 

_ “King  of  the  Jungle”  and  a  young  lady 

_ Two  large  lions  standing  guard 

_ Egyptian  lioness  goddess  named  Sakhmet 

_ Blue-headed  lion 

_ Small  lion-shaped  bottle 

_ Limestone  lion  that  once  lived  on  a  building 

Sly  cat  sneaking  a  snack 

_ Lion  decorating  a  flag 

_ Alert  cat  with  a  beetle  on  its  head 

The  beetle  amulet  on  this  cat ’s  head  is  called  a  scarab.  To  the  Egyptians,  scarabs 
symbolize  creation,  the  sun,  and  life  after  death. 

Cat  Fact:  The  ancient  Egyptians  considered  cats  to  be  sacred  animals.  When  a  cat  died,  the 
Egyptians  mummified  it  by  wrapping  the  pet  in  linen  bandages.  They  then  painted  on  a  face  and 
buried  the  cat  in  a  special  cat-shaped  coffin.

El  amuleto  de  un  escarabajo  en  la  cabeza  de  este  gato  se  llama  escarabajo.  Para  los 
egipcios,  los  escarabajos  simbolizan  creacion,  el  sol  y  la  vida  despues  de  la  muerte. 

Hecho  de  Gatos:  Los  antiguos  Egipcios  consideraban  los  gatos,  animales  sagrados.  Cuando  un 
gato  moria,  los  Egipcios  lo  momificaban  en  volviendolo  en  vendajes  de  lino,  luego  le  pintaban 
una  cara  y  lo  sepultaban  en  un  ataud  especial  en  forma  de  gato.

Chapter  4 

Family  Literacy:  Building  Bridges  from  Head  Start 
to  Home  and  Community 

Two  Generational  Programming 

Head  Start’s  strong  commitment  to  parents  has  long  been  recognized  as  a  cor¬ 
nerstone  of  the  program’s  success.  In  fact,  as  Head  Start  prepares  for  the  twenty- 
first  century,  there  has  been  a  call  for  the  program  to  recommit  itself  to  providing 
“two  generational  programming”  that  focuses  on  parents  as  well  as  on  children. 

The  Head  Start  Improvement  Act  includes  a  requirement  that  every  Head  Start 
agency  must  provide  child  development  and  literacy  skill  training  for  parents  of 
children  who  are  in  the  program  so  they  can  help  their  children  reach  each  child’s 
full  potential.  The  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  Project  was  designed 
to  do  just  that.  Thus,  it  provides  additional  resources,  materials,  training  and  tech¬ 
nical  assistance,  and  demonstration  support  to  promote  literacy  and  parenting 
skills.  It  also  recognizes  that  literacy  should  be  promoted  in  an  atmosphere  that 
encourages  developing  skills  across  generations  (Head  Start,  1993).  (Head  Start. 
Creating  a  21st  Century  Head  Start,  Final  Report  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on 
Head  Start  Quality  and  Expansion,  1993.) 

The  bottom  line  is  that  the  greater  the  involvement  and  effort  expended  by  the 
parent,  the  greater  the  gain  for  the  child.  This  involvement  covers  a  range  of  ac¬ 
tivities:  from  the  parent  and  other  family  members  spending  time  with  the  pre¬ 
school  child  in  the  classroom,  library,  or  some  other  site  where  partnership  activi¬ 
ties  may  be  taking  place,  to  learning  specific  techniques  for  fostering  the  child’s 
development.  Regular  communication  with  the  home  is  an  important  sustaining 
aspect  of  the  reinforcement  and  linkage  between  home  and  classroom.  It  must  be 
made  clear  to  parents  that  the  Head  Start  teachers  and  other  staff  members  rely  on 
learning  from  parents  also — the  learning  process  is  a  two-way  street.  The  Head 
Start  staff  and  partnering  resource  persons  such  as  librarians  may  know  about  re¬ 
sources  and  techniques  that  parents  can  use,  but  the  parent  knows  the  most  about 
the  child  and  what  he  or  she  brings  to  learning.  Steven  Herb  and  Sara  Willoughby 
Herb  suggest  sending  home  the  words  to  favorite  songs  or  rhymes  that  are  apt  to 
be  repeated  at  home;  then  members  of  the  family  can  join  in.  The  Herbs  also  sug¬ 
gest  sending  home  a  note  with  a  paper  butterfly  attached  and  explaining  that  it 
was  a  follow-up  result  of  reading  a  book  titled  The  Very  Hungry  Caterpillar.  As  a 


127 


special  event,  they  suggest  a  family  storytelling  meeting  at  which  parents  tell 
about  “when  I  was  a  preschooler  like  you.” 

Parent  in  the  Classroom 

When  the  parent  has  the  opportunity  to  work  in  the  classroom  with  a  group  of 
children,  she  or  he  begins  to  see  how  many  chances  there  are  to  build  language 
comprehension  and  use:  playing  with  words,  naming  objects,  observing  feelings 
and  reactions,  and  associating  concepts  with  words.  Parents  can  be  enlisted  and 
trained  to  read  and  tell  stories  to  children  in  some  of  the  children’s  native  lan¬ 
guages  that  no  one  on  the  Head  Start  staff  or  the  library  staff  can  speak.  The 
Library-Head  Start  Partnership  in  Oakland,  California,  trained  some  20  volun¬ 
teers  to  work  with  children  on  reading  and  storytelling  in  a  dozen  or  so  Asian 
languages.  Parents  can  also  be  successfully  involved  in  summer  programs  offered 
by  the  library  in  collaboration  with  museums,  parks  and  recreation  units,  and 
zoos. 

With  the  assistance  of  the  library  partner,  parents  can  be  shown  how  to  select 
a  good  book  for  a  child.  (See  Chapter  2  on  “Materials  Selection  and  Acquisition,” 
and  also  see  Appendix  B  for  the  script  from  Part  III  of  the  Library  Head  Start 
video  outlining  the  characteristics  of  a  good  book.)  Parents  of  Head  Start  children 
who  have  younger  siblings  can  be  shown  how  to  bring  an  infant  for  a  story¬ 
time — often  referred  to  in  “librarianese”  as  a  “lapsit”  program.  This  involvement 
provides  an  opportunity  for  the  youngest  baby  to  listen,  move  to  music,  and  imi¬ 
tate  sounds  while  the  mother  learns  by  watching  how  to  stimulate  mental  devel¬ 
opment  in  her  very  youngest  child.  Much  valuable  information  about  parenting 
skills  can  be  woven  into  the  information  about  emergent  literacy  and  language 
development. 


Home  Visits  by  Head  Start  Teacher 

The  Head  Start  policy  regarding  parents  states  that  each  grantee  is  required  to 
make  home  visits  a  part  of  its  program — when  parents  permit  such  visits.  Teach¬ 
ers  should  visit  parents  of  summer  children  a  minimum  of  once;  in  full-year  pro¬ 
grams,  they  should  make  at  least  three  visits,  if  the  parents  have  consented  to  such 
home  visits.  Policy  further  states  that  Head  Start  staff  members  should  develop 
activities  that  can  be  used  at  home  by  other  family  members  and  that  will  rein¬ 
force  and  support  the  child’s  total  Head  Start  experience.  This  policy  supports  the 
fact  that  all  parents  want  to  ensure  that  their  children  have  every  advantage  in  life, 
but  many  parents  need  help  in  creating  the  opportunities  for  learning  experiences.

Family  Literacy 


Contrary  to  the  belief  that  raising  children  “comes  naturally,  ” 
there  is  growing  recognition  that  being  a  parent  is  an 
extremely  demanding  job.  This  job  requires 
skills  which  can  be  learned.

With  development  skills  in  mind,  for  many  Head  Start  programs,  the  home 
visit  provides  a  good  opportunity  to  demonstrate  and  support  parent-child  literacy 
interactions.  Further,  home  visitors  must  establish  literacy  promotion  as  a  priority; 
must  plan  literacy  activities,  which  involve  the  parent  and  child  for  some  portion 
of  their  visit;  and  must  take  time  to  demonstrate  and  reinforce  parent  practices 
that  promote  literacy.  (Promoting  Family  Literacy  Through  Head  Start.)

Literacy  Begins  at  Home 


25  Ways  to  Make  Sure  Reading  Runs  in  the  Family 

In  recent  years,  we’ve  seen  no  shortage  of  institutes  and  initiatives  that  en¬ 
courage  librarians  to  develop  partnerships  with  childcare  providers.  But,  there’s 
one  key  constituency  that  has  gotten  far  less  attention:  families. 

Important  programs  like  the  Library  of  Congress’s  Library-Head  Start 
Partnership  have  spread  the  word  about  cooperative  planning  from  coast  to  coast 
via  regional  workshops  and  conference  programs.  And  ALA  recently  published  a 
book,  Achieving  School  Readiness:  Public  Libraries  and  National  Education 
Goal  No.  1  (Chicago,  1995),  that  contains  a  prototype  for  outreach  to  caregivers. 

We  need  to  realize,  however,  that  reading  to  children  in  library  or  daycare 
settings  is  not  enough.  Reading,  writing,  and  other  literacy  activities  must  be  rein¬ 
forced  at  home.  When  parents  or  guardians  take  this  kind  of  active  role,  children 
have  a  better  chance  to  become  avid  readers  and  are  likely  to  do  better  in  school. 

The  Daycare  Connection 

Many  librarians  already  present  programs  at  daycare,  preschool,  and  Head 
Start  centers  so  they  can  reach  a  greater  number  of  children.  But  they  may  not  be 
aware  that  these  sites  also  offer  an  excellent  opportunity  to  talk  directly  to  parents. 
Ask  caregivers  if  you  can  speak  to  groups  at  parent  meetings  and  family  nights. 
You’ll  only  need  a  few  moments  to  convey  the  importance  of  reading  aloud  to 
children  and  sharing  language,  songs,  and  literacy  activities.  You  can  also  use 
these  meetings  to  model  story-sharing  techniques  and  preview  books  that  parents 
can  use  to  support  literacy  activities  at  home. 

Besides  parent  meetings,  there  are  other  ways  you  can  collaborate  with  day¬ 
care  providers  to  help  families. 

Resource  Sharing.  Share  your  professional  resources  and  expertise  with  day¬ 
care  providers  on  a  variety  of  topics:  fmgerplays,  songs,  open-ended  art  projects, 
and  math  and  science  activities.  You  should  consider  keeping  a  deposit  collection 
of  these  resources  at  childcare  sites  or  a  county  education  office,  or  allow  caregiv¬ 
ers  a  longer  loan  period  for  materials  they  check  out  from  your  collection.  Besides 
creating  activities  for  their  own  centers,  they  can  suggest  to  parents  activities  to 
do  at  home. 

Adult  Literacy  Referrals.  Some  parents  lack  the  necessary  literacy  skills  to 
help  their  children.  Fortunately,  daycare  providers  are  often  alert  to  these  situa- 


130 


Family  Literacy 


tions.  Make  sure  they  know  to  direct  parents  to  library  or  community  literacy  pro¬ 
grams.  And,  be  prepared  to  suggest  materials  appropriate  for  new  adult  readers. 

Publications.  You  can  create  a  simple  newsletter  that  lists  new  books,  pro¬ 
grams,  and  literacy  activities.  Give  a  master  copy  to  each  center  so  they  can 
photocopy  and  distribute  them  to  families.  This  way,  your  newsletter  will  reach 
those  who  don’t  use  the  library  regularly. 

Booklists  and  bookmarks  are  another  way  caregivers  can  recommend  helpful 
library  materials  to  families.  It’s  also  a  quick  way  for  you  to  let  parents  know 
about  upcoming  library  programs  created  especially  for  young  children. 

Communication.  This  is  one  of  the  most  vital  elements  in  any  partnership. 
You  should  meet  with  daycare  providers  on  a  regular,  scheduled  basis  several 
times  a  year.  At  minimum,  you  should  contact  providers  in  August  before  most 
centers  open  for  the  school  year  and  when  year-round  sites  are  gearing  up  for  the 
new  season.  This  will  give  you  the  chance  to  share  new  books,  get  the  schedule  of 
upcoming  parent  meetings,  and  learn  well  in  advance  of  any  special  subject  re¬ 
quests  that  caregivers  will  make. 

Bright  Ideas  for  Family  Programs 

When  forging  partnerships  with  childcare  providers,  don’t  forget  about  par¬ 
ents.  Here  are  25  ideas  for  family  programs,  many  of  which  reinforce  the  impor¬ 
tance  of  the  family  unit,  different  types  of  families,  and  different  cultures.  These 
literacy-building  programs  can  be  held  in  any  library  or  daycare  center,  and  many 
include  home  activities,  too.  Several  are  craft  projects  that  allow  children  to  share 
their  family  history  and  traditions  with  other  children.  You  may  want  to  adapt  this 
list  of  programs  and  their  related  resources  to  create  your  own  handout  for 
providers. 

1.  Writing  Centers.  To  provide  opportunities  for  literacy  activities,  daycare 
centers  and  libraries  can  set  up  writing  and  drawing  centers — and  encourage 
families  to  create  their  own  center  at  home.  Different  kinds  of  paper,  cray¬ 
ons,  markers,  letters  to  trace,  and  an  old  typewriter  are  just  a  few  of  the 
items  to  include.  You’ll  want  to  avoid  worksheets  because  they  don’t  give 
children  much  room  for  creative  expression.  The  goal  of  any  writing  center 
should  be  to  provide  materials  that  support  a  print-rich  environment,  not  rote 
learning. 

2.  Children  as  Authors.  Children  love  to  make  up  their  own  stories.  Encour¬ 
age  families  to  write  down  their  children’s  stories  and  have  the  children  il¬ 
lustrate  them.  For  a  joint  library-daycare  project,  ask  children  to  dictate  a 
family  story,  trip,  or  event  at  their  center  or  to  their  parents  at  home.  Once 


Family  Literacy 


131 


the  stories  are  illustrated,  display  them  at  the  public  library  for  everyone  to 
see.  You  can  present  a  small  prize  or  ribbon  to  each  child  who  creates  a 
story. 

3.  Family  Bookmaking.  Show  caregivers  how  to  help  children  create  home¬ 
made  books  or  host  a  program  at  your  library  to  let  families  make  their  own 
books  there.  For  the  youngest  children,  families  can  make  tactile  books. 
Using  sturdy  poster  board  pages  with  rounded  comers,  attach  a  different 
type  of  material  (corduroy,  satin,  felt,  foil,  velvet,  sandpaper,  etc.)  to  each 
page.  For  preschool  and  early  primary  children,  consider  pop-up  books  or 
other  type  of  movable  book,  such  as  accordion  books  or  tab  books,  which 
fascinate  young  children.

4.  Open-Ended  Art  Projects.  You  can  provide  “recipes”  for  different  art 
media  and  let  families  experiment  with  these  media  at  the  library  before 
planning  their  own  special  projects  at  home.  Display  finished  projects  at  the 
library  or  daycare  center.  To  connect  art  with  literature,  share  picture  books 
with  especially  striking  illustrations,  such  as  those  by  Denise  Fleming,  Lois 
Ehlert,  or  Eric  Carle,  and  have  families  imitate  their  techniques.

5.  Library  Card  Sign-up  Month.  Pick  a  month  and  make  an  extra  effort  to 
get  families  with  children  in  daycare  to  sign  up  for  library  cards.  (You  may 
want  to  choose  September,  ALA’s  designated  “Library  Card  Sign-up 
Month.”)  If  possible,  hold  this  event  at  the  center  and  have  families  make  a 
follow-up  visit  to  the  library.  If  you  can  get  financial  support,  give  each 
family  a  coupon  for  a  free  paperback  picture  book  or  ticket  to  a  special  pro¬ 
gram  when  they  first  come  to  the  library. 

6.  Family  Book  Bingo.  I  adapted  this  idea  from  a  program  by  Carol  Carmack 
at  Stark  County  (Ohio)  District  Library.  You  can  make  book  bingo  cards 
and  have  caregivers  distribute  them  to  each  family.  Make  a  grid  of  25  boxes 
(five  across  and  five  down),  and  write  a  different  task  in  each  box  (e.g., 
“Read  an  Alphabet  Book,”  “Attend  a  Library  Storytime,”  “Read  a  Family 
Story,”  etc.).  Once  families  have  completed  “bingo,”  invite  them  to  a  special 
performance  at  the  library  like  a  puppet  show  or  movie. 

7.  Family  Puppet  Shows.  After  staging  a  puppet  show,  hold  a  “make-it/take- 
it”  puppet  session  for  families  and  caregivers.  You  can  create  puppets  out  of 
simple  household  items  such  as  paper  bags,  paper  plates,  cardboard  tubes, 
envelopes,  spoons,  egg  cartons,  socks,  mittens,  etc.,  which  families  can  help 
supply.  You  may  want  to  provide  simple  puppet  scripts  or  encourage  fami¬ 
lies  to  write  their  own.  Parents  can  take  these  easy  puppets  home  for  family 
puppet  shows  or  donate  them  to  their  daycare  center  for  children  to  use 
there.

stories  and  share  fingerplays,  songs,  and  other  language  activities  with

young  children.  Volunteers  can  then  take  these  programs  to  daycare  centers 
and  expand  your  library’s  outreach  efforts. 

9.  “Invite  Your  Grandparents.”  Have  children  invite  a  grandparent  or  older 
friend  to  a  special  library  program.  Early  childhood  centers  can  host  a  spe¬ 
cial  day  for  grandparents,  or  they  may  wish  to  have  the  child  invite  a  grand¬ 
parent  to  celebrate  his  or  her  birthday  at  the  center.  The  friend  may  read  a 
book  or  share  a  personal  story.  (You  can  provide  caregivers  with  suggested 
books  for  these  older  friends  to  read.)  Make  sure  you  advertise  that  this  is  a 
program  for  a  grandparent  or  an  older  friend,  so  that  children  whose  grand¬ 
parents  are  dead  or  live  far  away  will  not  feel  excluded. 

10.  Creative  Dramatics.  Numerous  picture  book  stories  and  folktales  (e.g., 
Goldilocks  and  the  Three  Bears,  Little  Red  Hen,  etc.)  lend  themselves  well 
to  creative  dramatics.  Actions  or  movement  in  the  stories  can  easily  be  acted 
out  even  by  preschoolers.  You  can  add  simple  props  or  costumes,  but 
they’re  not  necessary.  Children  enjoy  dramatizing  stories  over  and  over 
again  and  will  want  to  perform  them  for  family  members,  which  can  be 
done  either  at  the  library  or  daycare  center. 

1 1 .  Poetry,  Rhyme,  and  Rap.  Parents  should  introduce  poetry  and  rhyme  to 
children  as  early  as  possible  and  continue  throughout  the  early  years.  Many 
picture  books  are  written  in  rhyme,  and  some  books  just  beg  to  be  rapped! 
There  are  also  excellent  poetry  books  for  young  children.  Introduce  caregiv¬ 
ers  and  families  to  some  of  these  fine  choices  for  read-alouds.  Children  love 
to  chime  in  along  with  familiar  books  or  rap  some  of  their  favorite  stories. 
You  may  even  want  to  hold  a  rap  contest  for  families.

own  centers.  Giving  families  song  sheets/lyrics  of  favorite  songs  heard  at 
the  library  or  center  encourages  families  to  sing  songs  at  home.  You  can 
also  make  simple  musical  instruments  with  children  or  share  resources  with 
parents  so  families  can  make  them  at  home.

donate  to  libraries  or  centers.  You’ll  find  simple  patterns  in  copyright- free 
books.

14.  Sign  Language.  Families  can  benefit  from  learning  simple  sign  language  at 
classes  held  in  the  library.  (Be  sensitive  to  those  attending  who  are  hearing- 
impaired — they  may  not  be  able  to  hear  the  instructor  and  will  need  a  differ¬ 
ent  type  of  assistance.)  For  story  programs  in  libraries  or  daycare  settings, 
teach  children  the  sign  or  signs  for  one  or  two  simple  words  that  repeat  often 
in  a  story  or  song  and  have  them  sign  those  words  with  you  when  you  say 
them.  Children  will  love  to  teach  these  signs  to  other  family  members. 

15.  Stories  about  Families.  Introduce  picture  books  or  stories  emphasizing  dif¬ 
ferent  types  of  families  at  library  and  daycare  storyhours.  Make  sure  that 


136 


Family  Literacy 


caregivers  know  about  the  wide  range  of  books  that  are  available  in  this 
area. 

16.  Multicultural  Literature.  In  story  programs,  use  multicultural  literature  or 
picture  books  that  depict  children  from  a  variety  of  ethnic  groups  whenever 
possible.  Have  families  share  with  their  children  folktales  from  their  country 
of  origin.  You  can  provide  lists  of  folktale  titles  organized  by  country.  Day¬ 
care  providers  should  encourage  children  to  act  out  some  of  these  folk  takes 
through  creative  dramatics. 

17.  Fun  Family  Folklore.  I’ve  adapted  this  suggestion  from  a  program  by 
Stephanie  Gildone  at  Conneaut  (Ohio)  Carnegie  Public  Library.  Ask  parents 
to  share  a  story  or  bit  of  family  folklore  from  their  past  with  their  child. 

Have  them  record  the  story  so  their  child  can  share  it  with  other  children  in 
the  group.  If  possible,  make  a  booklet  with  all  the  children’s  stories,  includ¬ 
ing  a  family  photo  with  each  one. 

18.  Meet  My  Family.  Have  each  family  create  a  book  by  answering  a  set  of 
questions  (e.g.,  How  many  people  are  in  your  family?  What  are  their  names? 
Do  you  have  any  pets?  What  is  a  favorite  family  activity?  etc.).  They  can 
illustrate  their  book  or  paste  in  family  photos. 

19.  Family  Favorites.  Have  each  family  make  a  poster  of  their  favorite  things: 
food,  movies,  TV  shows,  books,  etc.  Libraries  and  centers  can  create  dis¬ 
plays  with  photos  or  drawings  of  family  members  enjoying  these  favorite 
things. 

20.  Family  Calendars.  This  is  a  good  project  for  December.  Staple  together 
calendar  pages  for  the  next  year,  leaving  the  top  part  of  each  page  blank. 
(You  may  want  to  include  the  name  of  a  few  good  books  to  read  during  each 
month.)  Have  families  draw  pictures  or  attach  photos  of  family  activities 
done  during  each  month.  They  can  also  mark  important  dates. 

21 .  Growing  a  Family  Tree.  Have  each  child  make  a  family  tree.  Provide  a 
small  flower  pot  or  coffee  can  for  each  child,  and  add  soil  and  a  twig,  stick, 
ruler,  pencil  or  other  object  to  hold  photos  or  drawings  of  each  family  mem¬ 
ber.  Invite  children  to  share  their  family  tree  with  other  children  by  telling 
something  about  each  family  member. 

22.  “Getting  To  Know  Me.”  This  idea  comes  from  Jan  Smuda  at  Project 
LEAP,  Cuyahoga  County  (Ohio)  Public  Library.  Cover  and  decorate  a  shoe- 
box.  Send  it  home  with  a  different  child  each  day  (or  week)  with  a  note 
asking  parents  to  fill  it  with  pictures  or  special  objects  that  tell  something 
about  the  family.

23.  Favorite  Food  Festival.  Invite  families  to  a  special  program,  and  ask  them 
to  bring  their  favorite  food,  cookie,  or  healthy  treat  to  share  with  other  fami¬ 
lies.  Encourage  them  to  have  their  young  children  help  make  the  food.  Make 
sure  they  bring  copies  of  recipes  to  share! 

24.  Family  Celebrations.  Each  family  has  special  holidays  they  celebrate.  Pick 
any  time  of  the  year  and  ask  children  to  share  how  their  family  celebrates 
their  favorite  holiday  or  event.  They  may  wish  to  bring  along  a  related 
show-and-tell  item  or  ask  a  family  member  to  come  and  share  information. 

25.  Family/Center  Storytimes.  Host  an  exclusive  storytime  program  for  each 
daycare  center  at  the  library,  inviting  only  caregivers  and  families  from  that 
center.  The  center  receives  its  own  special  library  day,  and  families  from 
that  center  are  honored  guests. 

Bringing  Families  into  Focus 

By  trying  one  or  several  of  these  ideas,  you  can  establish  a  vital  partnership 
with  leaders  of  the  childcare  and  education  community  in  your  area.  Through  in¬ 
formation  sharing  and  collaborative  programming,  you  can  enhance  the  emergent 
literacy  skills  of  young  children  when  you  remember  to  focus  on  the  family!

Now  that  you  have  a  solid  understanding  of  the  uses  of  literature  to  help  chil¬ 
dren  attain  social  competence,  you  will  want  to  work  with  parents  because  they 
are  the  children’s  first  teachers.  For  instance,  you  may  want  to  make  and  distrib¬ 
ute  a  simple  list  of  tips  for  parents,  along  with  a  short  list  of  books  for  parents. 
Following  are  some  sample  tip  sheets  adapted  from  the  ALSC/ALA  (1996)  pam¬ 
phlet  that  you  can  copy  and  distribute  to  parents  at  different  times:

•  Choose  books  appropriate  for  the  age  of  your  child. 

•  Choose  only  the  stories  that  you  like. 

•  Look  for  interesting,  unusual  stories. 

•  Choose  books  with  large,  attractive  illustrations;  with  bright,  bold,  clear 
colors;  and  with  appealing  format  of  print,  design  and  composition. 

•  Start  with  short  books  and  move  to  longer  stories  as  the  children’s  attention 
span  increases. 

•  Use  your  local  library  for  materials. 

•  Ask  the  Children’s  Librarian  for  help  in  selecting  books  and  stories. 

•  Prepare  more  stories  than  you  think  you  will  use. 

•  Remember  that  nothing  but  the  best  is  good  enough  for  a  child. 

•  Use  a  variety  of  books  including  fairy  tales,  folk  tales,  Mother  Goose,  word¬ 
less  books,  alphabet  and  counting  books,  poetry,  and  true  books.

Many  things  can  conspire  against  parents  as  they  try  to  provide 
children  with  the  attention  and  stimulation  they  need 
to  develop.  Parents  are  often  stretched  for 
time  and  resources,  and  can  use 
all  the  help  they  can  get. 

As  I’ve  been  saying  for  years,  it  does  take  a  village  to  raise  a  child. 

That ’s  why  we  can  all  work  together  to  make  sure  parents  have  the 
tools  they  need  to  raise  their  children — whether  it  is  providing 
information  about  the  importance  of  reading  and  talking 
to  children  in  the  early  years,  strengthening  prenatal 
care,  expanding  Head  Start,  or  ensuring  access 
to  affordable,  high-quality  child  care. 

Our  children  have  so  much  potential  to  grow  and  thrive  throughout 

their  childhood.  Wherever  there  is  patience,  love,  and  commitment, 
the  window  of  opportunity  for  raising  a  healthy,  happy  and 
well-adjusted  child  never  closes.

Family  Literacy  Programs 

We  have  talked  about  and  described  family  literacy  programming  in  several 
parts  of  this  manual.  Here  we  want  to  focus  on  the  family  literacy  sessions  that  are 
actually  a  part  of  parent  training  rather  than  on  events  to  be  enjoyed  through  inter¬ 
action  with  the  children.  Some  elements  of  parent  training  may  have  a  wider 
scope  in  family  literacy  programming,  which  will  make  those  elements  very 
similar  to  the  parenting  programs  described  earlier. 

Incentive  is  a  major  component  when  recruiting  and  retaining  families  for 
family  literacy.  A  great  proportion  of  illiterate  persons  who  want  to  improve  their 
skills  are  parents  who  want  to  learn  to  read  so  that  they  can  read  to  and  with  their 
children  and  can  help  the  children  get  ahead  in  school.  Through  participating  in 
such  programs  as  library-based  family  literacy,  adults  with  children  in  their  care 
find  that  literacy  helps  their  parenting  and  that  parenting  skill  provides  more  and 
more  reasons  for  those  parents  to  be  literate.  Library-based  family  literacy  pro¬ 
grams  tend  to  be  more  flexible  and  more  fun  than  the  adult-only,  technique-based, 
and  highly  structured  workbooks  common  to  other  programs.  Library-based  pro¬ 
grams  affirm  that  there  is  no  single  way  to  become  a  reader. 


Family  Literacy

One  of  the  most  successful  demonstrations  of  the  library-based,  children’s 
literature-based  family  literature  programs  has  been  carried  on  for  many  years  by 
Dr.  Carole  Talan.  She  pioneered  the  program  for  the  California  State  Library,  and 
it  is  now  operated  with  the  collaboration  of  several  other  state  departments, 
including  the  Department  of  Corrections.  In  San  Quentin  and  other  high  security 
institutions,  mothers  and  fathers  with  limited  reading  ability  learn  by  reading  to 
and  with  their  children  when  family  visits  take  place.  Tutoring  and  training  take 
place  in  individual  and  group  sessions,  which  are  a  combination  of  parenting 
training  and  family  literacy  training.  The  parents  practice  with  picture  books  that 
they  and  their  children  can  enjoy  together.  These  picture  books  have  proved  to  be 
valuable  springboards  for  discussion  of  values,  problems,  customs,  cultural  differ¬ 
ences,  feelings,  and  family  relationships. 

In  preparing  to  practice  the  role  of  the  child’s  first  teacher  and  model  of 
learning  and  of  literacy  behavior  and  benefits,  the  parent  or  other  adult  role  model 
must  first  examine  his  or  her  own  attitude  toward  learning,  toward  school,  toward 
rules,  and  toward  books  and  reading.  If  these  things  are  valued  by  the  model,  the 
child  is  likely  to  value  them.  The  parent  or  caregiver  must  also  try  to  think  and 
talk  positively  about  the  child’s  efforts  and  chances  for  success.  High  expectations 
by  the  parent  often  lead  to  high  performance;  and  conversely,  low  expectations 
can  be  a  self-fulfilling  prophecy  and  can  lead  to  failure.  A  low  sense  of  self-worth 
is  devastating  and  destructive  baggage  for  a  young  child  to  be  saddled  with.  Adult 
despair  and  a  sense  of  hopelessness  quickly  infect  the  child,  and  the  attitude  of 
“What’s  the  use”  is  a  quick  route  to  a  lack  of  confidence,  an  unwillingness  to  try, 
and  a  failure  in  reading  and  in  most  other  worthwhile  efforts.  Positive,  as  opposed 
to  defeated  and  negative,  thinking  by  the  adult  is  extremely  important.  Raised 
voices  and  violence  likewise  are  the  enemies  of  good  development  and  growth. 

Above  all,  it  is  vital  that  parents  or  caregivers  try  to  instill  in  the  child  that 
most  good  things  in  life  require  patience  and  time.  We  give  time  to  those  things 
we  value.  Attentive  listening  by  the  adult  takes  time,  and  parents  must  try  to  be  a 
model  of  this  first  one  of  the  language  skills:  attentive  listening. 

It  is  important  for  librarians,  Head  Start  staff  members,  and  other  tutors  or  in¬ 
structors  or  leaders  in  family  literacy  to  listen  carefully  to  the  parents’  feelings 
about  their  child’s  literacy,  to  learn  why  literacy  is  important  to  them,  and  to  an¬ 
swer  the  spoken  and  unspoken  questions  about  how  parents  can  support  the  effort. 
You  should  encourage  discussion  and  help  parents  to  act  positively  on  sugges¬ 
tions  and  insights.  Parents  need  to  understand  that  a  child’s  opinions  and  concerns 
should  be  respected  and  that  answering  a  child’s  questions  is  important.  During  a 
family  literacy  session  at  the  library,  or  even  in  a  classroom  site,  you  should  try  to 
show  parents  how  to  use  a  dictionary  and  a  first-rate  children’s  encyclopedia.

Different  Books  for  Different  Ages 

Birth  to  1  year — Sing  lullabies  and  songs: 

•  Have  picture  books  that  are  clear,  bright,  simple. 

•  Use  books  with  one  or  two  pictures  per  page  so  it  is  easy  for  baby  to  focus. 

•  Use  board  or  plastic  books  with  easy-to-tum  pages.

Linking  Head  Start  to  Home 

Stress  in  all  family  literacy  programs  that  having  books  around  at  home 

(1)  makes  for  an  environment  in  which  ideas  and  creativity  are  always  at  hand  and 

(2)  helps  to  create  readers.  This  goal  is  very  doable  when  the  Library-Head  Start 
Partnership  is  established.  Once  a  child  comes  to  know  and  to  like  certain  authors 
and  illustrators,  those  people  and  their  creations  become  a  part  of  the  child’s  life. 

A  book  in  which  children  can  recognize  some  of  their  own  characteristics,  feel¬ 
ings,  and  experiences  makes  them  feel  that  they  are  truly  part  of  a  large  human 
family,  as  well  as  their  own  personal  family. 

It  is  very  empowering  to  parents  to  know  that  they  can  have  such  a  major  and 
positive  affect  on  their  child’s  development  and  future.  Such  empowerment  builds 
their  own  expectations  of  self  and  the  sense  of  a  brighter  future  for  their  children. 

Everything  possible  should  be  done  by  Head  Start  staff  members  and  by  their 
library  and  museum  partners  to  ensure  that  linkages  are  built  between  the  Head 
Start  classroom  and  the  home,  as  well  as  other  community  sites.  This  linkage 
seems  to  come  about  most  surely  when  parents  and  primary  caregivers  are 
warmly  welcomed  at  all  times  into  the  Head  Start  classroom  and  are  involved 
with  their  own  children  and  classmates.  The  Library-Head  Start  video  gives  a  fine 
example  of  how  a  4-year-old’s  volunteer  father  followed  up  at  home  some  of  the 
interests  his  son  had  developed  in  the  classroom:  a  craft  featuring  a  sculptured 
stegosaurus,  plus  a  picture  cookbook  that  the  boy  took  home  to  his  mother.  The 
son  and  his  father  watched  a  video  on  TV  about  a  dinosaur;  then  the  boy  and  his 
mother  prepared  a  nutritious  lunch  from  the  cookbook.  Seeing  his  mother  reading 
a  Spanish-language  magazine  of  her  own,  the  boy  interrupted  her  to  read  his  book 
to  him — a  dinosaur  book.  Projects  initiated  at  home  by  a  family  visit  or  a  vacation 
trip  can  go  the  other  direction  and  can  be  followed  up  in  the  classroom  with  the 
addition  of  some  library  and  museum  materials.

Family  Literacy 


Intergenerational  Programs 

It  is  helpful  and  important  for  the  Head  Start  staff  to  become  familiar  with  the 
significant  people  and  events  in  a  child’s  life — grandparents,  siblings,  neighbors, 
and  other  caregivers  and  friends.  It  is  also  helpful  for  children  to  see  parents  act¬ 
ing  upon  what  they  have  read  and  being  aware  that  books  change  attitudes  and 
opinions.  Children  need  to  become  aware  that  habit  and  routine  play  a  part  in 
emergent  literacy.  The  child  notices  that  mother  slips  a  paperback  book  or  maga¬ 
zine  into  her  tote  bag  when  going  for  a  visit  to  the  clinic  or  some  other  place 
where  she  will  have  to  wait.  The  child  notices  that  father  brings  home  a  book  to 
study  for  license  requirements.  Newly  arrived  from  another  country,  a  grand¬ 
mother  or  an  uncle  talk  about  the  importance  of  their  learning  to  speak  and  read 
the  mainstream  language  of  the  country,  while  at  the  same  time  sharing  books, 
newspapers,  and  stories  in  the  home  country’s  language  with  small  children  to 
help  them  maintain  a  bilingual,  bicultural  view  of  life  and  their  identity. 

Programs  for  parent  and  child  centers  can  be  delightfully  intergenerational. 
Parent  and  child  centers  and  family  resource  centers  are  more  and  more  being 
found  in  libraries,  and  such  centers  make  great  sites  for  family  literacy  and  other 
types  of  parenting  programs.  Again,  it  is  vital  to  keep  in  mind  the  tremendous 
potential  that  library  programs  related  to  Head  Start  have  for  beneficial  overflow 
into  the  lives  of  a  Head  Start  child’s  family.  This  influence  on  family  life  is  very 
much  in  keeping  with  the  Head  Start  idea.  All  types  of  parenting  programs,  in¬ 
cluding  those  focused  on  family  literacy  interactions  and  tutoring,  can  help  par¬ 
ents  and  primary  caregivers  with  older  as  well  as  younger  children. 

Tips  for  Parents  and  Caregivers  (collected  from  a  variety  of  sources) 

These  additional  tips  have  been  gathered  from  a  variety  of  sources: 

•  Your  child  is  never  too  young  to  be  read  to!  Start  when  your  child  is  still  an 
infant. 

•  Stuff  a  few  books  in  the  diaper  bag  so  that  they  are  handy  at  all  times. 

•  Remember,  even  when  your  children  can  read,  they  still  need  to  be  read  to. 

•  Once  your  child  knows  how  to  read,  encourage  him  or  her  to  read  to  others. 

•  Read  more  about  people,  places,  and  things  you  see  on  television. 

•  Keep  plenty  of  reading  materials  around  the  house.  Put  children’s  books  on 
low  shelves. 

•  Give  books  as  gifts.  Let  children  know  you  think  books  are  special. 

•  Read  more  about  exhibits  in  museums. 


Family  Literacy

•  Read  to  your  child  anytime  and  any  place:  at  the  bus  stop  or  while  waiting  at 
the  doctor’s  office. 

•  Read  the  title  and  the  author’s  and  illustrator’s  names. 

•  Point  out  pictures,  shapes,  colors,  and  page  numbers. 

•  Let  your  child  turn  the  pages. 

•  Follow  the  words  with  your  finger. 

•  “Read”  wordless  books  to  your  child,  and  have  your  child  “read”  them  to  you. 

•  Get  involved  in  your  child’s  school.  If  you  show  an  interest,  your  child  will 
know  the  home-school  connection  is  important  and  will  appreciate  your 
support. 

Research  shows  that  children  who  have  been  exposed  to  reading 
before  they  begin  school  are  more  likely  to  do  well  in  school 

— U.S.  Department  of  Education 


National  Governors’  Association  compiled  these  figures  about  students  who 
participated  in  good  preschool  programs  that  involved  parents: 

3 1  %  Reduction  in  juvenile  correction  rates 

35%  Greater  high  school  graduation  rate 

36%  Higher  employment  levels 

45%  Lower  adolescent  pregnancy  rates 

90%  Fewer  special  education  placements

A  recent  study  showed  that  the  most  important  predictor  of  later 
success  in  children  is  the  amount  of  language  spoken  in  the 
home.  The  more  words  and  language  a  child  can  acquire 
from  the  time  he  is  born  to  the  age  of  three,  the  more 
likely  that  child  will  be  successful  in  school  and 
adulthood.  That ’s  why  you  are  trying  to  make 
reading  such  a  part  of  a  child ’s  life  from 
the  very  beginning.  It ’s  not  just  nice; 

it ’s  critical.

Parenting  Events  and  Programs 

In  addition  to  home  visits  by  you  when  possible,  you  should  consider  work¬ 
shops  and  programs  for  parents.  These  events  can  be  held  at  your  Head  Start  site, 
at  the  library,  or  at  the  museum.  They  need  to  be  offered  at  times  that  are  con¬ 
venient  for  parents  to  attend,  which  may  be  in  the  evening  or  on  the  weekends. 
There  are  some  advantages  to  taking  the  parent  workshops  outside  the  Head  Start 
site.  One  is  that  meeting  room  space  may  be  available  at  the  library  or  museum. 
Parents  will  also  get  the  idea  that  the  Head  Start  program  and  all  it  stands  for  can 
take  place  both  outside  and  inside  the  four  walls  of  a  classroom.  They  will  begin 
to  understand  that  the  entire  community  is  there  to  support  them  and  their 
children.  The  change  of  location  gives  the  librarian  and  the  museum  educator  an 
opportunity  to  promote  some  of  the  services  they  offer  in  their  institutions.  For 
instance,  the  librarian  may  talk  about  other  family  programs  the  parents  can 
attend,  may  introduce  other  services  such  as  literacy  programs,  and  may  distribute 
information  about  careers  and  educational  opportunities  for  parents.  Museum 
educators  can  discuss  “free”  days  for  families,  introduce  games  that  can  be  played 
in  the  museum,  and  demonstrate  some  lessons  that  can  be  learned  from  the 
exhibits. 

Giving  the  parents  an  opportunity  to  go  on  a  tour  and  later  to  find  their  way 
around  the  library  and  the  museum  is  an  added  bonus.  Often  these  institutions  can 
be  daunting,  and  a  guided  tour  can  be  a  fine  introduction  to  another  community 
resource.  The  advance  preview  for  parents  allows  them  to  ask  questions  so  they 
can  feel  comfortable  on  a  next  visit  that  may  be  on  their  own  or  with  their  family. 
Learning  to  ask  questions  at  the  information  desks  in  the  library  and  museum  is  a 
giant  step  forward  for  many  families. 

In  preparing  a  parent  workshop,  you  may  want  to  heed  the  advice  of  Dr. 
Carole  Talan.  She  has  a  list  of  “F”  words  that  she  uses  in  her  family  literacy 
workshops:  Free,  Fun,  Food,  Focused,  Flexible,  and  Fast-moving.  These  same  F 
words  can  be  used  in  planning  any  kind  of  workshop  for  Head  Start  families,  be¬ 
cause  they  recognize  that  parents  have  time  constraints,  that  the  topic  to  be  cov¬ 
ered  should  be  targeted  to  one  specific  point,  and  that  a  warm  sense  of  humor  can 
be  used  to  make  a  serious  point.  Head  Start  parents  who  attend  your  workshops 
are  already  committed  to  helping  their  children  succeed.  We  do  not  want  to  add  a 
layer  of  guilt  to  an  already  dedicated  parent.  Remember  that  it’s  not  what  we  say, 
but  how  we  say  it  that  will  make  the  difference  to  parents  in  a  successful  work¬ 
shop. 

“I  Am  Your  Child”  is  a  national  public  awareness  and  engagement  campaign 
to  make  early  childhood  development  a  top  priority  for  our  nation.  It  began  in 
1997,  and  we  hope  it  will  continue  to  be  recognized  because  it  involves  a  broad 
range  of  experts  from  the  early  childhood  fields  and  a  number  of  national  organi-

zations  that  are  participating  in  the  campaign.  The  Families  and  Work  Institute  is 
coordinating  the  outreach  activities  for  the  effort.  Free  brochures  on  what  parents 
and  caregivers  can  do  to  promote  young  children’s  healthy  development  can  be 
found  on  the  I  Am  Your  Child  Web  site  at  <www.iamyourchild.org>  or  by  writ¬ 
ing  to  I  Am  Your  Child,  1010  Wisconsin  Avenue,  NW,  Washington,  DC  20007. 
Among  the  materials  available  for  parents  are  “Ten  Tips  for  Raising  Happier, 
Healthier  Children,”  which  is  included  at  the  end  of  this  chapter. 

Home  and  Community  Roles  for  Siblings  and  Other  Family  Members 

The  following  research  findings  are  adapted  from  Parent/Child  Interaction  and 
the  Pursuit  of  Literacy  (1992): 

•  Family  relations  are  a  better  predictor  of  a  child’s  attitude  toward  school  than 
socioeconomic  status. 

•  The  single,  most  important  factor  in  parental  influence  and  academic  success 
is  the  expectation  held  by  parents  for  the  educational  attainment  of  their  child. 
Parental  influence  on  educational  aspirations  exceeds  peer  influence  by  a  ratio 
ranging  from  2:1  to  8:1. 

•  Positive  family  relations  are  more  likely  in  the  case  of  achieving  than  under¬ 
achieving  children.  Communication,  understanding,  and  mutual  acceptance 
among  family  members  are  significantly  poorer  for  dropouts  than  for  high 
school  graduates.

In  helping  family  members  understand  their  roles,  you  will  want  to  stress  the 
importance  of  positive  and  healthy  family  traits  as  they  relate  to  the  Head  Start 
program.  These  traits  are  adapted  from  Traits  of  Healthy  Families  by  Dolores 
Curran  and  include  some  titles  of  children’s  books  that  support  the  traits.  The 
following  list  was  adapted  from  a  1993  conference  titled  “Promoting  Family 
Strengths  Through  Children’s  Literature”  at  Northern  Illinois  University:

Fathers  Are  Important,  Too 

Fathers  have  an  integral  role  in  helping  children  develop  to  their  full  potential. 
Programs  such  as  the  Responsible  Fatherhood  Initiative  at  the  University  of 
Medicine  and  Dentistry  of  the  New  Jersey  Medical  School  are  geared  for  young 
fathers  and  promote  the  importance  of  each  father’s  role  in  the  family.  The  mis¬ 
sion  of  the  initiative  is  to  assist  fathers  in  their  ability  to  meet  the  financial,  social, 
and  emotional  demands  of  fatherhood.  The  program  offers  education,  employ¬ 
ment,  and  training  opportunities  for  participants  and  families.  These  opportunities 


150 


Family  Literacy 


include  positive  parenting,  family  planning,  and  relationship  and  personal  coun¬ 
seling;  networking,  mentoring,  and  information  sharing;  and  improving  parenting 
skills  to  strengthen  families.  The  importance  of  fathers  can  be  seen  in  the  follow¬ 
ing  statistics  distributed  by  the  initiative: 

•  More  than  19  million  children  live  without  fathers.  As  of  1994,  24  percent  of 
American  women  were  single  heads  of  households. 

•  Children  growing  up  fatherless  are  five  times  more  likely  to  be  poor  and  two 
times  as  likely  to  drop  out  of  high  school.  They  are  significantly  more  likely 
to  end  up  in  foster  homes,  group  homes,  and  juvenile  justice  facilities. 

•  In  1993,  nearly  half  of  all  black  and  Latino  men  aged  25  to  34  earned  so  little 
they  could  not  lift  a  family  of  four  out  of  poverty. 

In  explaining  the  role  of  all  family  members,  you  must  remember  to  stress  that 
fathers  are  much  more  than  “breadwinners,  gift-givers,  or  disciplinarians.  We 
must  start  to  view  them  as  having  greater  Human  worth  ...  and  not  just  as  pay- 
checks.”  In  addition,  you  must  stress  that  fathers  are  absolutely  essential  in  the 
healthy  development  of  their  children’s  lives. 

Children’s  books  have  been  used  very  successfully  in  teaching  parenting  skills 
to  fathers,  even  in  prison  settings.  In  1993,  a  2-year  project  bringing  family  liter¬ 
acy  into  San  Quentin  Prison  was  undertaken  by  the  creation  of  the  F.A.T.H.E.R.S. 
(Fathers  As  Teachers:  Helping,  Encouraging,  Reading,  Supporting)  program.  Es¬ 
tablished  under  the  California  Families  for  Literacy  Program  in  cooperation  with 
several  other  agencies,  including  the  State  Department  of  Corrections, 
F.A.T.H.E.R.S.’  goals  are  to  break  the  cycle  of  incarceration  and  low  literacy,  to 
promote  conscious  and  positive  role  modeling  as  fathers  and  father  figures,  to 
educate  fathers  to  become  their  child’s  first  teachers,  to  empower  children  with 
literacy  skills  and  with  self-esteem  to  negotiate  on  their  own  behalf,  and  to  in¬ 
struct  fathers  to  use  children’s  books  to  teach  their  children  and  to  make  a 
personal  connection  with  them.  According  to  Carole  Talan,  children’s  books  were 
used  at  San  Quentin  because  they  are 

•  Fun 

•  Funny 

•  Entertaining 

•  Colorful 

•  Informational  (especially  for  adults  who  have  limited  reading  skills  but  need 
to  gain  basic  information) 

•  Not  contrived

Role  of  Caregivers 

Caregivers  take  charge  of  the  Head  Start  child  before  and  after  the  child 
leaves  your  program.  Recognizing  that  children  are  with  caregivers  for  a  signifi¬ 
cant  part  of  the  child’s  day  will  help  you  as  you  try  to  extend  the  Head  Start  pro¬ 
gram  outside  your  classroom.  All  of  the  tips  you  give  to  parents  about  child  de¬ 
velopment,  books  to  read,  selection  of  books  to  continue  lessons  learned  in  the 
Head  Start  classroom,  activities  to  extend  the  theme  covered  in  the  classroom, 
etc.,  can  be  adapted  for  the  caregiver.  In  some  cases,  kits  have  been  developed 
that  caregivers  can  check  out  at  the  library  and  that  are  based  on  Head  Start 
themes.  For  instance,  at  the  Cuyahoga  County  Public  Library,  storytime  kits  are 
available  to  check  out.  They  cover  such  topics  as  birds,  bugs,  gardening,  nature, 
rain  and  rainbows,  seasons  (spring  or  summer),  senses,  water,  and  yellow.  The 
kits  include  books  and  activity  ideas.

Another  program  titled  “Bookstart”  was  developed  by  the  Chicago  Public 
Library  for  young  children  in  daycare  or  school  settings.  Bookstart  kits  can  be 
checked  out  by  daycare  centers,  school  programs,  and  home  daycare  providers. 
The  kits  are  available  for  1  month  and  can  be  reserved  by  phoning  a  neighborhood 
branch  of  the  library.  Portable  flannel  boards  are  also  available  in  this  program. 
Some  kits  cover  family  life,  feelings,  friendship,  nursery  rhymes,  pets  and  farm 
animals,  seasons,  and  transportation. 

At  the  Prince  George’s  County  Library,  Nell  Colburn,  the  Children’s  Librar¬ 
ian,  conducts  a  program  called  “Books  Alive!  Sharing  Books  with  Young  Chil¬ 
dren.”  The  program  is  intended  for  family  caregivers — people  who  provide  child 
care  in  a  home  environment.  It  is  offered  (1)  to  convince  family  caregivers  of  the 
importance  of  making  books  a  part  of  young  children’s  daily  lives  and  (2)  to  pres¬ 
ent  the  public  library  as  a  valuable  and  user-friendly  community  resource.  In  the 
program,  Ms.  Colburn  discusses 

•  The  importance  of  introducing  children  to  books  at  an  early  age 

•  The  underlying  need  for  an  adult  to  bring  children  and  books  together 

•  Song  books  as  first  books  for  babies 

•  Mother  Goose  books  and  nursery  rhyme  collections 

•  First  picture  books 

•  Board  books 

She  adds  many  more  steps  as  she  introduces  books  for  use  at  every  develop¬ 
mental  stage  of  the  child  from  newborn  through  age  5. 

This  kind  of  workshop  and  others  are  outlined  in  First  Steps  to  Literacy: 
Library  Programs  for  Parents,  Teachers,  and  Caregivers  (ALA  1990),  and  will 
be  a  benefit  for  you  in  working  not  only  with  childcare  givers,  but  also  with  other 
teachers  and  parents.  The  book  contains  methods  for  presentation,  hints  for  pres¬ 
entations,  dates  and  times,  site  and  planning,  materials,  important  details,  promo¬ 
tion,  and  evaluation  of  workshops.  There  are  good  examples  of  evaluation  forms 
that  are  for  participants  to  fill  out  after  programs  and  that  should  prove  helpful  as 
you  plan  other  workshops.  The  book  shows  excellent  lists  of  books  for  each  of  the 
workshops  that  were  based  on  themes  and  on  developmental  needs. 

Check  with  your  local  library  or  museum,  which  may  have  kits  that  are  similar 
to  those  described  above  and  that  can  be  checked  out  by  caregivers.  If  no  kits 
have  already  been  developed,  the  staff  members  may  be  able  to  pull  together 
theme-related  materials.  Often  a  caregiver  is  a  grandparent  or  other  member  of  the 
child’s  family  who  can  use  these  tips  and  many  others.

Using  Library  Materials  and  Services  at  Home 

Librarians  across  the  country  realize  that  it  is  important  to  reach  out  to  parents 
and  children  and  to  provide  materials  and  services  outside  of  the  library  building 
as  well  as  inside.  Because  librarians,  Head  Start  teachers,  and  museum  educators 
share  the  same  children  and  families,  it  is  important  for  these  professionals  to 
work  together  to  reach  this  audience.  The  Head  Start  program  already  has  the 
children  and  families  as  participants.  It  is  up  to  librarians  and  museum  staff  mem¬ 
bers  to  work  with  Head  Start  to  identify  the  families  and  target  them  for  library 
and  museum  services. 

The  Hartford  Public  Library  in  Connecticut  has  established  a  program  titled 
“Brighter  Futures,”  which  has  these  objectives: 

•  Create  a  welcoming  and  safe  environment  for  parents  and  children  together. 
Staff  members  have  designated  a  portion  of  the  Children’s  Services  depart¬ 
ment  as  a  family  place,  which  includes  special  furniture,  games  and  toys  for 
preschoolers,  and  collections  of  parenting  books  and  picture  books  for 
children. 

•  Help  parents  share  books  and  stories  in  such  a  way  as  to  provide  a  bond  of 
communication  and  understanding,  thereby  building  mutual  trust  and  respect. 
The  library  has  trained  staff  members  to  read  and  share  stories  on  a  one-on- 
one,  impromptu  basis  and  to  model  behavior  for  parents  and  caregivers.  Li¬ 
brary  staff  members  go  to  health  centers,  hospital  waiting  rooms,  and  other 
agencies,  such  as  Head  Start,  that  serve  parents  and  children  in  order  to  read 
and  share  stories,  loan  books,  and  give  information  about  library  programs. 

•  Help  parents  meet  these  basic  needs  of  children:  the  need  for  physical  well¬ 
being,  to  be  loved,  to  belong,  to  be  competent,  to  know  (satisfy  curiosity),  and 
to  satisfy  a  longing  for  beauty  and  order.  The  library  has  trained  staff  mem¬ 
bers  to  model  behavior  that  shows  love,  caring,  and  inclusion  to  children. 

•  Help  parents  understand  the  stages  of  child  development  and  children’s 
changing  characteristics  and  abilities.  The  library  has  developed  parent  work¬ 
shops  and  training  programs  about  basic  needs  and  child  development  with 
groups  of  parents  at  the  library  and  in  collaboration  with  agencies  serving 
parents. 

•  Leverage  library  resources,  especially  staff  expertise,  to  increase  the  effec¬ 
tiveness  of  child  and  family  service  providers  with  parents  in  the  community. 
By  using  trained  library  staff  members  to  model  both  technique  and  behavior, 
the  library  demonstrates  working  with  children  in  book-  and  reading-related 
activities  on  site  at  agencies  serving  children  and  parents.

Family  Literacy 


The  main  purpose  of  programs  such  as  Hartford  Public  Library’s  Brighter 
Futures  initiative  is  to  work  within  the  community  with  other  agencies  to  serve 
children  and  their  parents.  This  includes  service  to  families  at  home. 

The  Arlington  Heights  Public  Library  in  Illinois  has  sick  children’s  kits  for 
use  with  children  who  are  homebound  because  of  illness.  The  kits  include  books, 
easy  craft  ideas,  activity  sheets,  and  perhaps  a  puzzle.  The  kits  can  be  theme  re¬ 
lated  or  age  appropriate.  In  some  cases,  the  Friends  of  the  Library  deliver  the  kits 
to  homebound  children. 

At  the  Provo  City  Library  in  Utah,  kits  are  distributed  to  parents  through  the 
Bom  to  Read  Program,  which  is  a  cooperative  effort  between  the  Provo  City 
Library,  Provo  Parent  Education  Resource  Center,  and  Provo  City/County  Health 
Department.  It  is  designed  to  reach  expectant  and  new  parents  about  the  impor¬ 
tance  of  having  a  healthy  baby  who  is  developmentally  ready  to  leam  to  read.  Kits 
include  information  about  calming  down  a  fussy  baby,  books  to  read  to  very 
young  children,  a  paperboard  book,  information  about  services  provided  by  the 
library  and  the  health  care  provider,  a  coloring  book  for  very  young  children,  and 
a  yellow  card.  The  card  is  punched  each  time  the  parent  attends  one  of  the  classes 
offered  by  the  library,  the  health  department,  or  the  Parent  Education  Resource 
Center,  or  each  time  the  baby  receives  shots  at  the  Health  Department  or  the  doc¬ 
tor’s  office.  When  all  places  on  the  yellow  card  are  punched,  the  parent  receives  a 
gift.  Local  businesses  have  joined  in  this  special  effort  to  reach  families  of  new¬ 
borns,  especially  those  families  most  at  risk  economically.  These  are  undoubtedly 
the  same  families  that  participate  in  Head  Start  programs.  Find  out  if  your  library 
has  a  Bom  to  Read  project  that  your  families  can  participate  in.  For  more  infor¬ 
mation,  write  to  the  American  Library  Association,  50  East  Huron,  Chicago,  IL 
60611,  or  call  Bom  to  Read  at  1-800-545-2433,  ext.  1398. 

A  library  card  allows  children  and  their  families  to  check  out  materials  for 
home  use.  The  variety  and  richness  of  library  collections  depends  on  the  particu¬ 
lar  library  near  the  Head  Start  families.  However,  through  the  use  of  interlibrary 
loans,  virtually  all  materials  are  available  through  a  local  library.  First  you  will 
need  to  encourage  your  families  to  get  a  library  card.  Generally,  all  that  is  needed 
is  proof  of  residency  within  that  library’s  area  of  service.  Some  libraries  accept 
letters  or  bills  that  are  addressed  to  the  individual  as  proof  of  residency.  Call  your 
local  library  and  get  applications  for  library  cards  that  can  be  distributed  to  par¬ 
ents  in  your  Head  Start  program.  A  library  card  can  be  the  best  present  a  parent 
can  give  to  a  child — and  it’s  free.

Follow-Up  Activities  in  Many  Settings 

Activities  that  support  and  extend  the  Head  Start  curriculum  can  be  carried  out 
in  many  places  in  the  community.  We  have  discussed  the  library,  the  health-care 
facility,  and  prenatal  clinics.  In  addition,  programs  and  activities  can  be  carried 
out  in  youth  museums.  The  mission  of  youth  museums  is  to  stimulate  curiosity 
and  motivate  learning.  According  to  the  Association  of  Youth  Museums,  muse¬ 
ums  enrich  the  lives  and  education  of  children  by  complementing  and  supple¬ 
menting  efforts  in  homes,  childcare  centers  and  communities.  “Youth  Museums 
Affecting  the  Lives  and  Education  of  Young  Children”  is  a  position  paper  devel¬ 
oped  to  define  the  museum  field  and  explain  to  other  early  childhood  educators 
how  youth  museums  can  and  do  play  a  role  in  nurturing  the  development  of 
young  children.  The  following  is  taken  from  that  paper: 

Youth  Museums 

•  Create  experiences  for  young  children  through  exhibits  and  programs  that  are 
based  on  developmental  needs  of  children. 

•  Use  interactive  exhibits  to  simulate  physical  environments,  as  well  as  informal 
educational  methods  to  facilitate  learning. 

•  Reach  young  children  by  presenting  quality  objects  as  tools  to  motivate 
learning. 

•  Provide  safe,  welcoming  environments  where  children  learn  through  play  and 
inquiry  at  their  own  pace. 

•  Feature  learning  opportunities  for  families,  schools,  groups  with  special  needs, 
and  individual  children. 

•  Encourage  and  support  parents  to  be  active  in  the  growth  and  education  of 
children  and  to  value  self-directed  learning. 

•  Support  cross-cultural  understanding  through  programs  and  exhibits  and 
through  bringing  people  from  different  cultures  together. 

•  Assist  educators  of  young  children  with  enrichment  of  curricula  through 
developmentally  appropriate  activities  and  educator  training. 

•  Go  beyond  their  own  walls  to  provide  programs  to  children  and  families  in 
childcare  centers,  schools,  hospitals,  social  service  agencies,  and  parks  and 
through  community  initiatives.  These  programs  bring  together  families  and 
community  on  behalf  of  young  children. 


156 


Family  Literacy 


•  Seek  to  collaborate  with  other  community  groups  to  create  and  strengthen 
opportunities  for  young  children  to  learn. 

Because  learning  takes  place  in  every  setting,  there  is  no  end  to  the  list  of 
places  where  activities  can  take  place.  Intergenerational  learning  can  happen  in 
senior  centers  or  in  churches.  Other  activities  can  occur  in  the  park.  Nature 
themes  are  especially  popular  for  parks.  Let  your  imagination  be  your  guide  for 
where  activities  should  take  place. 


Everyday  Chances  to  Reinforce  Head  Start  Learning 

Some  of  the  most  important  lessons  in  the  Head  Start  program  can  fit  into 
what  Dr.  Dorothy  Rich  terms  MegaSkills.  The  ten  MegaSkills  are  as  follows: 

•  Confidence:  feeling  able  to  do  it 

•  Motivation:  wanting  to  do  it 

•  Effort:  being  willing  to  work  hard 

•  Responsibility:  doing  what’s  right 

•  Initiative:  moving  into  action 

•  Perseverance:  completing  what  you  start 

•  Caring:  showing  concern  for  others 

•  Teamwork:  working  with  others 

•  Common  sense:  using  good  judgment 

•  Problem  solving:  putting  what  you  know  and  what  you  can  do  into  action 

Even  better  than  defining  the  MegaSkills  that  are  essential  for  success  in 
school  and  in  life,  Dr.  Rich  gives  excellent  activities  using  everyday  events  that 
develop  these  skills. 


Parents  who  have  helped  their  children  gain  a  love  of  reading  have 
(1)  given  their  children  trips  to  the  farthest  reaches  of  the  earth 
and  to  the  sun  and  the  moon  and  the  stars;  (2)  opened  the 
doors  to  knowing  their  own  heart  and  the  hearts 
of  others;  and  (3)  given  their  children  maps 
for  their  voyage  through  life. 

— Dorothy  Rich,  MegaSkills ,  Houghton  Mifflin  Company,  1997 


Family  Literacy

Some  reading  activities  outlined  in  MegaSkills  include  everyday  events  such 
as  cooking.  For  preschoolers,  it  is  suggested  that  you  or  the  parent  read  directions 
for  cooking  a  dish  or  heating  a  can  of  soup.  Make  a  “to  do”  list  for  the  day  with 
the  children.  Establish  a  reading  comer  in  the  home  by  providing  children  with 
their  own  bookshelf  and  reading  light.  This  comer  need  not  be  expensive  or 
elaborate.  A  bookshelf  can  be  a  painted  crate  or  cardboard  box.  Try  to  encourage 
parents  to  make  going  to  the  library  a  weekly  event.  Library  books  can  be  kept  on 
the  child’s  bookshelf  or  special  book  place. 

Math  concepts  can  be  seen  in  everyday  events.  Have  children  do  the 
following:  (1)  set  the  table  and  count  the  settings;  (2)  measure  ingredients  and 
read  simple  recipes;  (3)  count  the  number  of  stop  signs  to  and  from  school;  or 
(4)  look  for  numbers  at  the  grocery  store,  at  the  Laundromat,  at  church,  and  so 
forth.  MegaSkills  outlines  many  activities,  and  you  can  think  up  many  more. 


Here  are  five  essential  truths  from  Dr.  Rich  (1997): 

1 .  Children  are  ea^er  to  leam,  and  their  abilities  can  be  built. 

2.  Parents  and  caregivers  are  capable  of  being  great  teachers. 

3.  Every  home — every  home — is  a  learning  place. 

4.  Teachers  need  and  want  families  as  partners  in  children’s  education. 

5.  It  helps  to  have  a  sense  about  what  to  say  and  what  to  do  ...  when  those  inevitable 
everyday  school  problems  come  home. 

Dr.  Dorothy  Rich,  What  Do  We  Say?  What  Do  We  Do?  1997. 


A  parent  is  a  child’s  first  tutor  in  unraveling  the  fascinating  puzzle 
of  written  language.  A  parent  is  a  child’s  one  enduring  source 
of  faith  that  somehow,  sooner  or  later,  he  or  she 
will  become  a  good  reader.

Because  of  this  intergenerational  effect  of  the  parents  ’  education  on 
the  child ' s ,  it  is  unlikely  that  we  will  be  able  to  make  a  major 
difference  for  the  child  unless  we  place  equal  priority  on 
education  and  academic  remediation  for  the  parent. 

— Berlin  and  Sum,  Toward  a  More  Perfect  Union,  1988 

Another  source  for  activities  that  can  be  done  in  the  home  is  booklets  1,  2,  and 
3  of  All  Parents  Teach  Ideas.  Parents  have  submitted  ideas  that  have  been  used 
successfully  in  their  families,  and  those  ideas  have  been  published  for  distribution 
by  All  Parents  Teach,  Education  Ventures,  Inc.,  Honeywell  Plaza,  MN1 2-5259, 
Minneapolis,  MN  55408-9608.  Parents  can  even  call  an  idea  hotline  (612-951- 
2689)  and  leave  their  idea.  Ideas  are  selected  from  those  submitted  if  they 

•  Are  low  cost 

•  Are  easy  to  do  and  don’t  take  much  time 

•  Appeal  to  kids  and  parents 

•  Can  be  used  over  and  over 

•  Are  fun 

In  addition  to  the  ideas,  spread  throughout  the  booklet  is  a  listing  of  101  ways 
to  praise  a  child. 


Parents  Using  Libraries  for  Themselves 

As  they  become  accustomed  to  children’s  books  and  the  library  in  connection 
with  their  children,  parents  can  become  comfortable  with  using  the  library  for 
their  own  purposes.  As  we  demonstrate  in  the  Library-Head  Start  video,  libraries 
can  provide  adults  with  information  and  referrals  to  other  agencies  and  to  pro¬ 
grams  that  can  assist  them.  Most  public  libraries  maintain  updated  files  with  the 
names  of  resources  that  many  families  need:  health  services,  social  services,  edu¬ 
cational  services,  jobs,  legal  assistance,  crisis  management,  housing,  and  much 
more.  Those  resource  files  generally  contain  the  names  of  people  to  see,  ad¬ 
dresses,  phone  numbers,  and  much  else.  Many  libraries,  and  more  all  the  time, 
have  community  information  and  referral  specialists  who  assist  clients  in  setting 
up  appointments  with  the  right  person.  Government  information  is  also  available. 
Many  libraries  now  offer  the  use  of  computers  and  computer  databases,  and  even 
train  people  to  use  them. 

All  of  this  information  is  in  addition  to  the  library’s  other  roles  such  as  adult 
learning  programs  that  have  literacy  prominent  among  them  and  its  recreational 
materials  such  as  popular  magazines  and,  of  course,  books.  Popular  fiction, 


Family  Literacy

romance  fiction,  biography,  poetry — all  of  these  are  ready  to  make  life  richer  for 
those  who  have  learned  to  read  for  pleasure  and  relaxation.  Most  libraries  have 
collections  of  videotapes,  recordings,  and  audiotapes  so  library  users  can  choose 
what  they  watch  and  listen  to  while  not  being  tied  to  what  TV  offers  them  and 
their  children.  To  become  a  reader  and  a  library  user  is,  in  fact,  to  have  a  better 
command  of  your  world  and  how  you  wish  to  shape  it.

The  Underlying  Assumptions  That  Guide  Work  in  Family  Literacy 


These  basic  assumptions  serve  as  guiding  principles: 

•  All  families  have  strengths. 

•  Parents  can,  and  should,  set  goals  and  make  decisions  about  their  lives  and  the  lives  of  their  families. 

•  Families  are  culturally  and  individually  diverse.  This  diversity  is  healthy  and  natural,  and  it  enriches 
the  community. 

•  The  family  is  a  system  of  influence,  and  the  transmission  of  values  happens  within  it. 

•  The  family  unit  is  the  appropriate  focus  if  we  aim  to  influence  the  attitudes,  values,  and  expectations 
communicated  in  the  home. 

•  If  families  are  to  thrive,  the  needs  of  individual  family  members  must  be  met. 

•  Families  struggle  with  multiple  problems,  concerns,  and  issues  and  may  require  regular  support  and 
assistance  with  these  non-educational  needs. 

•  Literacy  is  an  ongoing  process;  it  exists  on  a  continuum. 

•  Learning  and  teaching  should  be  relevant  and  student  centered. 

•  The  teaching  and  learning  process  is  reciprocal  for  parents  and  children. 

•  Change  takes  time;  it  is  a  gradual  process.

One  thing  to  remember  from  the  beginning  is  that  there  is  no  single  right  way  to  do  recruitment  and  that 
what  works  for  some  programs,  libraries,  or  communities  does  not  necessarily  work  for  others  and  vice 
versa.  California  had  35  different  family  literacy  programs  funded  in  1993-1994,  and  each  one  found  that 
although  they  shared  many  similarities,  they  also  had  many  differences.  The  bottom  line  is  to  find  out 
what  works  best  for  you! 

Suggestions  for  Recruitment  into  Family  Literacy  Programs: 

1 .  Target  your  audience.  Know  whom  you  want  to  reach.  The  more  specific  you  can  be,  the  easier 
will  be  your  recruitment,  that  is,  low  income  parents,  teen  parents,  new  moms,  parents  with  children 
of  specific  ages  (California’s  FFL  program  targets  low-literacy  parents  with  a  preschool  age  child). 

2.  Collaborate  with  other  community  agencies  that  serve  your  target  group.  Often  these  agencies 
will  be  low-income  daycare  providers,  elementary  schools,  social  services,  a  local  hospital,  a 
battered  women’s  shelter,  Head  Start,  Even  Start,  or  similar  agencies. 

3.  Get  the  buy-in  of  your  library  staff  members.  For  these  programs  to  succeed,  the  entire  library 
must  work  together  to  recruit  and  support  the  families  and  their  enriching  use  of  the  library. 

4.  Give  families  something  that  appeals  to  them.  For  most  of  these  target  families,  books  and 
libraries  are  not  something  that  “turns  them  on.”  Many  of  these  parents  never  had  fun  with  books  or 
stories  and  have  no  reason  to  believe  that  their  children  will  enjoy  such  activities,  let  alone  that 
children  will  enjoy  the  activities  themselves.  Plan  family  activities  that  you  know  your  target 
audience  enjoys.  If  you  don’t  know  what  these  are — ask  them! 

5.  Go  to  where  the  people  are.  Take  your  first  programs  into  the  community  to  an  area  where  your 
audience  congregates  or  lives.  Begin  initial  programs  at  one  of  those  sites.  When  parents  are 
“hooked  on  your  books”  and  “stimulated  by  your  stories,”  bring  them  into  the  library  at  times  that 
are  convenient  to  them. 

6.  Involve  your  target  audience  in  your  planning.  Invite  some  people  from  your  target  audience  to 
help  you  plan  your  programs.  Listen  to  what  they  want  and  to  when  and  where  they  want  it.  Too 
many  literacy  programs  develop  materials  and  programs  without  ever  asking  what  the  learner, 
client,  or  patron  wants  and  needs. 

7.  Convince  the  key  people  in  the  target  audience.  If  you  can  reach  and  recruit  the  people  with 
influence  (influence  brokers)  in  the  target  community  first,  they  will  be  your  best  recruitment  tool. 

It  may  take  time  to  win  their  confidence  but  it  will  be  well  worth  any  time  you  spend  with  these 
important  people.

8.  Do  not  rely  on  print  to  recruit.  Because  you  are  trying  to  reach  a  population  that  is  not  a  reading 
population,  print,  flyers,  posters,  and  other  traditional  tools  of  promoting  library  programs  will 
seldom  work.  Use  a  multimedia  approach  and  rely  on  personal  contacts. 

When  you  do  use  print,  use  plain,  straightforward  English  with  as  few  words  as  possible  and  with 
most  of  the  words  having  only  one  or  two  syllables. 

Emphasize  FREE,  FUN,  FOOD! 

9.  Tutors — if  you  have  them,  use  them.  Include  your  tutors  in  your  planning  and  involve  them  and 
their  children  in  your  programs.  The  tutor  can  be  a  key  element  in  the  success  of  any  family  literacy 
program.  However,  tutors  may  not  always  understand  the  importance  of  family  literacy  themselves 
and  may  need  to  be  convinced  as  well  as  trained.  Involve  your  tutors  in  recruiting  their  learners  and 
their  families. 

10.  Get  the  names  and  addresses  of  the  children,  and  send  invitations  directly  to  each  child. 

Suggestions  for  Retention  in  Family  Literacy  Programs: 

1 .  Make  your  programs  so  much  fun  and  so  exciting  that  the  children  will  insist  on  coming  back. 

The  whole  family  will  fall  in  love  with  books,  even  the  older  siblings,  when  wonderful  children’s 
books  and  stories  are  presented  by  dedicated  and  skilled  readers  and  storytellers.  Not  only  will  the 
families  come  back,  but  also  if  the  programs  are  appealing  enough,  those  families  will  bring  their 
neighbors  and  other  relatives. 

2.  Provide  culturally  diverse  materials.  Have  your  stories  and  books  mirror  the  experiences  of  your 
audience,  as  well  as  the  experiences  of  those  from  other  cultures. 

3.  Involve  your  parents  in  the  planning  and  programming  so  that  they  have  ownership  of  the 
program.  Give  parents  group  support  time  separate  from  the  children  so  that  the  adults  can  discuss 
parenting  issues  of  concern  to  them,  but  keep  these  times  short  and  the  parents  involved.  You  do 
not  have  to  teach  lessons  on  parenting  skills!  Let  the  parents  discuss  these  issues  as  they  evolve 
from  the  stories  read.  Emphasize  the  importance  of  family  interaction — the  parent  as  the  child’s 
first  teacher.  Validate  the  parents’  own  experiences. 

4.  Use  incentives.  These  are  aids  both  to  retention  and  to  recruitment.  Give  the  families  something 
they  can  take  with  them  and  use  at  home.  Among  the  popular  incentives  are  free  books  (quality 
used  ones  or  ones  donated  by  local  service  groups);  craft  materials  (crayons,  paper,  scissors, 
pencils,  etc.);  ideas  for  using  materials  found  at  home;  certificates  of  achievement  or  attendance; 
and  prizes  donated  from  local  restaurants  and  merchants.  Taking  photos  of  your  families  working 
and  reading  together  at  your  programs  and  giving  those  photos  to  the  family  to  take  home  is  also  a 
good  incentive.  Make  meals  a  part  of  your  programs  whenever  possible.

5.  Make  sure  that  your  center  is  a  warm,  welcoming  place.  Many  parents  may  never  have  been  in  a 
library,  to  an  adult  school,  or  to  a  community  college.  They  will  be  unsure  what  to  expect  or  will 
have  unrealistic  expectations  of  how  their  children  should  act. 

Sell  your  own  staff  members  on  the  program  and  keep  them  informed.  Make  sure  that  they  don’t 
view  this  program  as  just  an  additional  burden.  Sensitize  your  staff  members  to  the  needs  of  your 
target  audience,  and  make  them  aware  of  this  neglected  and  at-risk  group.  Integrate  family  literacy 
into  your  regular  services. 

6.  Train  your  parents  in  how  to  use  the  public  library.  Teach  them  how  to  select  books  for  their 
kids.  Use  color-coded  stickers  to  make  it  easier  for  parents.  If  you  make  this  parent  and  child  a 
library  user — that  family  will  be  around  for  life,  not  just  for  the  life  of  your  program. 

7.  Do  follow  up.  If  a  family  who  has  attended  misses,  call  and  find  out  why.  Can  you  help?  Let  the 
family  members  know  that  you  care  and  that  you  missed  them. 

8.  Make  each  program  as  inclusive  as  possible.  Thus,  if  a  family  does  not  return,  the  members 
still  have  a  valuable  experience  to  carry  away  from  even  just  one  meeting. 

Emphasize  FREE,  FUN,  FOOD,  FOCUSED,  FELXIBLE,  AND  FAST-MOVING. 

Literacy  service  at  its  best  is  that  which  addresses 
the  whole  person — including  the  family  behind  the  new  reader. 

Family  literacy  is  the  best  model  of  literacy  and  library  service  working  together.

Family  Storytimes 


The  Family  Storytime  element  of  the  P.A.R.E.N.T.S.  Curriculum  brings  adults  and  children  together 
to  share  activities  around  books  and  reading.  Because  many  adult  learners  and  their  families  are  not 
regular  library  users,  Family  Storytimes  are  an  introduction  to  one  of  the  services  traditionally  provided 
by  local  public  libraries. 

Family  Storytimes  serve  several  purposes.  First,  they  provide  adult  learners  who  are  receiving 
instruction  in  the  P.A.R.E.N.T.S.  Curriculum  with  “real  life”  experience  involving  actual  children. 
Storytimes  give  adults  an  opportunity  to  practice  what  they  are  learning  and  to  see  child  development 
information  in  action. 

Second,  these  storytimes  expose  children  to  language  and  learning  experiences  to  which  they  might 
otherwise  have  not  access.  Adult  learners  will  choose  books  that  they  can  share  easily  with  their  children, 
but  librarians  will  offer  a  variety  of  both  easy  and  difficult  books  during  storytimes.  Storytimes  may 
involve  puppets  and  other  activities  that  help  make  the  books  come  alive  for  the  children.  Music,  too,  is 
often  used  by  librarians  to  draw  the  children  into  the  magic  of  books  and  language.  These  techniques  can 
inspire  parents  (often  at  the  request  of  their  children)  to  dramatize  their  own  readings  at  home. 

Third,  storytimes  may  serve  as  an  opportunity  for  adults  to  observe  children  other  than  their  own 
reacting  to  books,  and  these  observations  can  help  them  to  understand  their  own  children  better.  An  initial 
lack  of  attention  may  be  typical  for  certain  ages  or  in  certain  settings,  and  adults  need  to  see  that  all 
children  react  in  a  variety  of  ways.  For  example,  the  coordinator  of  one  of  California’s  Families  for 
Literacy  (FLL)  programs  always  took  her  own  children  to  the  Family  Storytimes.  The  learners  in  her 
program  could  see  that  even  though  she  was  a  literacy  expert,  her  children  were  not  perfectly  behaved  at 
all  times  either. 

Finally,  storytimes  introduce  the  child  at  a  very  early  age  to  the  public  library  as  a  free  resource  for 
lifelong  learning.  Children  who  become  library  users  at  a  young  age  will  be  comfortable  accessing  the 
valuable  resources  found  in  the  library  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  For  programs  that  are  not  library-based, 
storytimes  are  an  excellent  opportunity  for  collaboration  with  the  local  library. 

If  your  storytimes  are  held  at  locations  other  than  the  library,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  a 
storytime  collection  of  children’s  books  be  available  for  learners  and  their  families  to  use  before  and  after 
presentations.  This  collection  will  reinforce  and  expand  learning  and  family  interactions.

Ten  Tips  for  Raising  Happier,  Healthier  Children 


What  you  do  in  the  first  3  years  of  your  baby’s  life  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  adult  your  child  will 
become.  New  breakthrough  research  tells  us  that  the  first  3  years  of  a  child’s  life  are  more  important  for 
emotional  and  intellectual  growth  than  we  ever  thought  before.  Experiences  that  fill  babies’  first  days, 
months,  and  years  have  a  decisive  impact  on  the  structure  of  a  child’s  brain  and,  in  turn,  on  every  aspect 
of  a  child’s  life  throughout  adulthood. 

So  remember,  when  you  cuddle,  coo,  and  sing  lullabies  to  your  baby,  you  re  not  just  expressing  love;  you 
are  providing  vital  nourishment  for  his  or  her  healthy  development. 

Quite  simply,  the  first  years  last  forever. 

1 .  Be  warm,  loving,  and  responsive.  When  children  receive  warm,  responsive  care,  they  are  more 
likely  to  feel  safe  and  secure  with  the  adults  who  take  care  of  them. 

2.  Respond  to  the  child’s  cues  and  clues.  Recognize  and  respond  to  the  sounds,  movements,  and 
expressions  that  your  child  makes.  This  response  will  help  you  build  secure  attachments. 

3.  Talk,  sing,  and  read  to  your  child.  All  of  these  interactions  help  your  child’s  brain  make  the 
connections  it  needs  for  growth  and  later  learning. 

4.  Establish  rituals  and  routines.  Teach  your  child  to  know  when  it  is  time  for  bed  by  developing 
routines  such  as  singing  a  song  and  pulling  the  curtains,  daily  routines  and  rituals  associated  with 
pleasurable  feelings  are  reassuring  for  children. 

5.  Encourage  safe  exploration  and  play.  As  infants  grow,  they  begin  to  explore  the  world  beyond 
their  caregivers.  Parents  should  encourage  this  exploration.  While  many  of  us  think  of  learning  as 
simply  acquiring  facts,  children  actually  learn  through  playing. 

6.  Make  television  watching  selective.  Watch  television  with  your  child,  and  talk  about  what  you  are 
viewing.  Don’t  use  TV  as  a  babysitter. 

7.  Use  discipline  as  an  opportunity  to  teach.  In  addition  to  consistent  and  loving  adult  supervision, 
teach  your  child  limits.  Never  hit  or  shake  a  child. 

8.  Recognize  that  each  child  is  unique.  Children  grow  at  different  rates.  Their  ideas  and  feelings 
about  themselves  reflect,  in  large  measure,  parents’  and  caregivers’  attitude  toward  them. 

9.  Choose  quality  child  care  and  stay  involved.  Frequently  visit  your  child  care  provider,  and  seek 
someone  who  responds  warmly  and  responsively  to  your  baby’s  needs. 

10.  Take  care  of  yourself.  Parents  need  care  too.  When  you  are  exhausted,  irritable,  depressed,  or 
overwhelmed,  you  may  have  a  harder  time  meeting  the  needs  of  young  children. 

The  first  years  last  forever.

Chapter  5 
Training/Education  for  Parents, 

Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 

Parents/Caregiver  Workshop 

Library-based  or  library-partnered  parenting  workshops  can,  in  fact,  help 
families  with  other  aspects  of  dealing  with  a  preschooler.  Such  concerns  may  ap¬ 
pear  on  the  surface  to  have  little  to  do  with  language  and  emergent  literacy  until 
one  realizes  how  much  the  preschooler  is  learning  all  at  once  and  how  much  each 
aspect  must  seem  related  to  every  other  learning  challenge.  Toilet  training,  disci¬ 
pline,  and  practical  tips  about  childcare  can  all  be  covered  in  sessions  that  are 
primarily  concerned  with  learning  and  literacy  development.  Young  mothers  with 
several  children  are  often  beset  with  the  conflicts  of  sibling  rivalry.  Other  prob¬ 
lems,  too,  can  be  addressed  and  related  to  books  and  other  materials.  Of  para¬ 
mount  importance  is  the  basic  information  about  a  child’s  mental  development 
and  about  the  relatively  short  time  in  which  so  much  learning  is  accomplished. 

The  parent  workshop  or  group  meeting  can  be  held  in  the  Head  Start  space,  in 
the  library,  or  in  some  other  site  convenient  to  the  parents.  It  is  essential  that  a  day 
and  time  of  day  be  picked  that  is  most  convenient  for  parents  or  primary  care¬ 
giver.  Transportation  and  childcare  assistance  may  be  required.  Serving  some 
good  but  simple  food  will  make  the  meeting  a  social  occasion,  and  many  mothers 
will  return  another  time  because  they  enjoyed  the  social  aspect  of  sharing  experi¬ 
ences  with  the  other  mothers.  The  meeting  should  have  fast-moving  content,  and 
the  parent  should  leave  feeling  empowered — “more  on  top  of  things”  than  when 
she  or  he  came.  An  hour  for  the  workshop  plus  a  half  hour  for  socializing  and 
choosing  a  book  will  probably  be  the  maximum  length.  Selecting  a  period  imme¬ 
diately  before  the  time  to  pick  up  children  from  the  classroom  may  work  well. 
Providing  handouts  and  perhaps  a  small,  useful  gift  to  take  home  will  serve  as  a 
reminder  of  the  workshop  content. 

The  instructional  site  or  parent  resource  center  should  be  set  up  so  the  partici¬ 
pants  are  fairly  surrounded  with  children’s  books  and  with  parent  resource  books. 
Learners  will  be  exposed  to  titles  this  way  and  encouraged  to  pick  up  titles  and 
examine  them.  Books  should  be  displayed  face  out.  A  table  will  be  needed  for 
handouts  and  for  the  collection  of  parenting  materials,  as  well  as  a  VCR  and 
monitor  for  showing  videos.  An  easel  with  newsprint  pad  and  magic  marker  can 
be  very  useful. 


171 


According  to  several  experts,  the  maximum  number  of  participants  should  be 
15  if  the  sessions  are  to  be  effective  learning  experiences  for  the  parents.  This  size 
group  allows  each  person  to  add  perspectives  and  opinions,  and  it  provides  time 
for  in-depth  discussion  and  individual  problem  solving. 

Carole  Talan  emphasizes  that  having  the  participants  sit  in  a  circle  “deepens 
the  level  of  trust  and  sharing  among  learners  of  varied  ages.  Confidentiality  is  im¬ 
portant,  so  be  sure  to  get  agreement  from  everyone  first.  The  ability  to  see  every¬ 
one’s  face,  not  just  the  teacher’s,  changes  the  dynamics  of  group  discussion. 
However,  you  may  want  to  wait  until  some  of  the  lessons  are  completed  before 
opening  the  discussion  up  to  participants’  sharing  their  personal  situations  and 
problems  with  the  group.” 

Reading  Aloud 

Reading  aloud  from  children’s  picture  books  should  be  a  part  of  each  parent¬ 
ing  session.  Each  participant  can  read  one  page  or  more  if  the  text  is  very  short.  In 
one-to-one  tutoring  sessions,  the  learner  and  the  tutor  can  take  turns,  each  reading 
a  page  or  two.  Be  careful  not  to  correct  the  reader  unless  the  meaning  becomes 
confused.  One-to-one  tutoring  allows  for  the  learner  to  absorb  information  at  his 
or  her  own  pace,  to  stop,  to  question,  and  to  discuss  whenever  desired.  Although 
very  valuable  for  many  learners,  the  one-to-one  session  does  not  allow  the  learner 
to  benefit  from  the  various  viewpoints  and  insights  shared  in  a  large  or  small 
group  discussion.  In  a  group  session,  remind  the  participants  not  to  correct  each 
other,  and  explain  that  this  is  the  best  approach  to  use  with  any  new  reader.  Some 
learners  will  “pass”  if  they  feel  they  do  not  read  well  enough  if  at  all,  and  their  not 
participating  should  be  allowed  without  comment. 

Gift  Books 

In  the  budget  for  the  parenting  workshops,  it  is  very  desirable  to  include 
money  to  provide  some  gift  books  that  can  be  personally  selected  by  parents  for 
their  children.  Depending  on  the  number  of  sessions  for  each  group  of  parents, 
these  books  may  already  have  been  ordered  and  made  available  for  parent  selec¬ 
tion,  or  there  will  be  time  to  special  order  the  choices  of  each  parent.  Allowing 
participants  to  choose  one  gift  book  per  session  to  keep  for  their  child  would  be 
very  appropriate.  Participants  in  the  workshops  will  be  especially  interested  in 
criteria  for  choosing  a  good  book.

Lesson  Plans 

The  P.A.R.E.N.T.S.  (Parental  Adults  Reading,  Encouraging,  Nurturing, 
Teaching,  and  Supporting)  curriculum  from  the  splendid  guide  developed  by  Jane 
Curtis  with  Carole  Talan  (for  use  in  the  California  statewide  literacy  program)  has 
13  sessions.  On  the  following  pages,  you  will  find  an  outline  of  all  13,  along  with 
the  full  particulars  from  Lessons  2  and  4.  Most  parent  education  programs  will 
consist  of  three  to  six  sessions;  therefore,  much  of  what  is  suggested  here  will 
have  to  be  condensed  or  omitted.  A  page  of  ideas  for  parent  meetings  is  also  in¬ 
cluded  from  Essentials,  the  training  manual  used  for  the  Child  Development 
Certification  Program. 

About  the  Lessons 

The  P.A.R.E.N.T.S.  curriculum  was  designed  to  give  adult  learners  the  infor¬ 
mational  context  in  which  to  function  as  effective  teachers  of  the  children  in  their 
lives.  It  instructs  them  on  how  to  use  children’s  picture  books  as  basic  tools  to  do 
that  teaching.  Before  beginning  to  use  the  curriculum  guide,  you  will  need  to  read 
all  the  books  you  have  chosen  for  your  collection.  It  is  critical  that  you  are  famil¬ 
iar  with  book  topics,  as  well  as  language  and  illustrations,  so  that  you  can  use  the 
materials  effectively  or  can  support  your  teachers  and  tutors  as  they  implement 
lessons. 

The  instructional  component  of  the  P.A.R.E.N.T.S.  curriculum  has  13  one- 
hour  lessons.  They  are  arranged  to  follow  a  child  developmentally  from  birth  to 
12  years  of  age  and  can  be  taught  singly  or  in  pairs  (i.e.,  Lessons  1  and  2,  Lessons 
3  and  4,  etc.),  with  a  break  in  between. 

Lesson  1 :  Setting  Goals  for  Our  Children  helps  learners  recognize  the 

kind  of  adults  they  want  their  children  to  become.  The  remaining 
lessons  will  introduce  learners  to  the  tools  and  information  to  help 
reach  those  goals. 

Lesson  2:  What  Do  Children  Need?  introduces  learners  to  the  child’s  point 
of  view  and  to  the  scope  of  the  adults’  commitment  as  caregivers. 

Lesson  3 :  How  Children  Learn  familiarizes  the  parent  or  parent  figure 
with  children  as  students,  so  that  the  adult  can  be  an  effective 
teacher. 

Lesson  4:  Language  Acquisition:  Reasons  for  Rhyme  focuses  on  the  im¬ 
portance  of  language  and  literacy,  and  on  how  adults  can  support 
their  development.

Lesson  5:  Images  of  Mother/Images  of  Father  demonstrates  role  modeling 
and  how  books  can  help  fashion  parental  images. 

Lesson  6:  Communication:  Discipline  vs.  Punishment  offers  the  STEP 

method  of  negotiating  with  children  rather  than  dictating  to  them. 
Lessons  5  and  6  together  are  the  most  intense  in  the  curriculum 
because  they  cover  extremely  sensitive  topics. 

Lesson  7:  Activities  and  Games:  Parent  as  Teacher  offers  learners  an 

opportunity  to  practice  teaching  and  playing  with  children  (using 
role  play). 

Lesson  8:  Siblings:  Love  and  War/Identify  and  Compete  focuses  on  the 
contradictory  feelings  siblings  have  for  each  other. 

Lesson  9:  Parent  as  Advocate:  School  and  Authority  addresses  the 

changing  role  that  parents  and  parent  figures  play  as  their  children 
enter  and  progress  through  school. 

Lesson  10:  Peer  Groups  takes  learners  into  pre-puberty  and  the  dynamics 
of  peer  pressure. 

Lesson  1 1 :  Family  History  focuses  on  the  changing  configuration  of  the 
American  family. 

Lesson  12:  Reading  Aloud  directs  learners  to  some  specific  skills  they  can 
help  their  children  develop  by  reading  aloud  to  them. 

Lesson  13:  Graduation  provides  closure  and  feedback  on  the  curriculum’s 
effectiveness. 

Lesson  2:  What  Do  Children  Need? 

1 .  Refer  to  the  goals  listed  in  Lesson  1  as  the  direction  in  which  the  curricu¬ 
lum  is  going.  Human  babies  have  the  longest  dependency  period  of  any 
animal.  Baby  whales,  dolphins,  and  primates  (apes,  chimpanzees)  also  re¬ 
quire  a  long  time  before  they  can  care  for  themselves.  These  are  the  most 
intelligent  of  all  animals.  The  more  intelligent  the  species,  the  longer  the 
young  are  dependent  on  adults.  We  have  a  great  responsibility  to  teach  our 
young.

2.  By  age  4,  50  percent  of  intelligence  is  formed,  with  80  percent  by  age  8.* 

Put  this  fact  on  the  board  or  write  it  in  the  notebook.  Refer  to  the  “windows 
of  opportunity”  from  the  video  “Your  Child’s  Brain.”  Talk  about  the  phe¬ 
nomenon  of  language  learning  that  is  completed,  except  for  the  expansion  of 
vocabulary,  by  age  2.  Describe  how  much  children  expand  their  abilities 
from  newborn  to  age  4  in  intellectual  comprehension,  physical  competence, 
and  social  skills. 

Ask  the  learners  to  talk  about  their  experiences  with  children  under  the  age 
of  4.  How  does  language  begin?  What  things  need  to  happen  in  the  child’s 
environment  to  encourage  language  development? 

3.  Define  primary,  secondary,  and  social  needs.  Primary  needs  are  for  sur¬ 
vival.  Ask  learners  to  tell  what  these  are  (food,  clothing,  shelter,  love). 

Secondary  needs  are  for  growth  and  development.  This  list  is  much  bigger 
and  broader  and  should  also  be  generated  by  the  learners  (affection,  under¬ 
standing,  guidance,  spirituality,  language,  communication,  education,  safe 
and  stable  environment,  books,  toys,  family,  etc.). 

Social  needs  are  what  humans  require  from  their  group.  Some  adult  learners 
may  have  had  difficulty  in  meeting  those  needs  (approval,  acceptance,  be¬ 
longing,  recognition,  validation)  because  their  literacy  skills  are  not  well  de¬ 
veloped.  Discuss  how  it  feels  to  be  unable  to  do  things  (like  read  well)  that 
others  take  for  granted. 

4.  Introduce  the  importance  of  the  empowerment  of  children.  It  is  impor¬ 
tant  for  learners  to  realize  that  children  need  to  develop  skills  for  handling 
power  in  the  world.  To  do  this,  they  must  be  entrusted  with  power  them¬ 
selves.  Children  need  to  be  listened  to,  understood,  and  allowed  to  partici¬ 
pate  in  making  decisions  that  affect  them.  This  may  be  a  difficult  concept 
for  some  learners  to  accept.  It  will  be  more  fully  developed  in  Lesson  6. 

5.  Describe  the  ideal  environment  in  which  children’s  needs  can  be  met. 

Write  this  description  on  the  board  or  in  the  notebook  as  it  is  generated  by 
the  participants. 

6.  Read  aloud  together  A  Mother  for  Choco.  If  you  are  doing  the  lessons  in 
pairs,  begin  with  the  person  who  left  off  from  Lesson  1.  Talk  about  Choco’s 
need  to  belong  to  a  family  or  group  with  which  he  or  she  can  identify.  Is  this 
a  universal  human  need?  Why  do  they  think  so?

7.  Read  aloud  together  Why  Do  You  Love  Me?  Use  the  book  to  emphasize 
how  much  trust  children  place  in  their  caretakers  and  how  much  influence 
these  caretakers  have  in  shaping  children’s  lives.  Explain  that  the  power  of 
role  modeling  exists  because  children  give  what  they  receive.  They  adhere 
to  the  old  adage  that  says  they  do  as  you  do,  not  as  you  say. 

8.  Show  books  that  focus  on  the  security,  predictability,  and  reassurance  all 
children  need:  I  Promise  I’ll  Find  You,  Owl  Babies ,  You  ’re  My  Nikki, 
Mommy  Doesn  ’t  Know  My  Name,  and  Mama,  Do  You  Love  Me? 

9.  Check  off  from  the  home  environment  list  all  the  criteria  that  reading 
aloud  satisfies.  For  example,  if  adult  learners  (a)  list  quality  time  spent  with 
children,  (b)  people  communicating  with  each  other,  and  (c)  an  educational 
environment,  these  can  all  be  checked  off  as  being  addressed  by  the  activity 
of  reading  aloud  to  their  children. 

Not  only  is  reading  together  a  successful  way  of  spending  quality  time  but 
also  it  increases  communication  and  educates  simultaneously.  Additionally, 
it  provides  the  opportunity  for  adults  to  model  that  learning  and  reading  are 
fun. 

10.  Demonstrate  how  reading  aloud  from  children’s  picture  books  will  meet 
many  of  the  needs  listed  by  the  learners.  Such  books  are  personal,  stimulate 
conversation,  increase  communication,  help  develop  problem-solving 
strategies,  educate  children  in  basic  concepts  like  counting  and  colors,  and 
offer  an  opportunity  for  quality  time  between  parent  and  child. 

Remind  your  learners  that  books  are  free  from  their  public  library  and  that  a 
children’s  librarian  is  available  there  as  a  resource  for  specific  titles  and 
topics.  As  the  instructor  or  trainer,  familiarize  yourself  with  the  available 
book  collection  so  you  can  pick  out  books  that  will  be  particularly  engaging 
for  your  specific  learner  or  group  of  learners. 

Use  books  like  the  pop-ups  The  Birthday  Cake  or  Road  Hog.  Find  the  hid¬ 
den  objects  in  books  like  I  Spy  Mystery,  Andy ’s  Pirate  Ship,  or  Look  Again! 
The  Second  Ultimate  Spot-the-Difference  Book.  Show  counting  books  like 
My  First  Look  at  Numbers  or  From  1  to  100.  Demonstrate  books  that  help 
develop  imagination  and  self-esteem  like  I  Like  Me,  Koala  Lou,  or  All  the 
Magic  in  the  World.

Lesson  4:  Language  Acquisition:  Reasons  for  Rhyme 

1 .  The  importance  of  language.  Discuss  with  learners  why  language  is  im¬ 
portant — communication,  self-expression,  literacy,  and  information.  With¬ 
out  language,  an  individual’s  world  is  limited.  The  deaf  develop  a  language 
of  their  own  (i.e.,  sign  language).  To  interact  with  others,  we  all  develop 
language. 

2.  Language  acquisition  continuum.  Language  is  not  learned  all  at  once;  it  is 
acquired  over  time.  Listening,  speaking,  reading,  and  writing  proceed 
developmentally. 

Our  listening  vocabulary  is  much  greater  than  our  speaking  vocabulary, 
especially  when  young.  It  is  good  and  important  to  read  books  to  children  in 
which  the  language  is  more  advanced  than  what  they  are  able  to  say.  This  is 
one  way  to  build  vocabulary.  Point  out  that  both  listening  and  reading  are 
receptive,  while  speaking  and  writing  are  active  and  generative. 

For  many  of  us,  writing  is  the  most  difficult,  even  more  difficult  than  read¬ 
ing.  Writing  is  one  aspect  of  language  that  adults  continue  to  develop  be¬ 
cause  it  is  the  most  challenging. 

3.  What  parents  can  do  to  promote  language  development  in  children.  For 

each  aspect  on  the  continuum,  ask  learners  to  respond  with  specific 
behaviors. 

To  develop  listening  skills,  talk  to  children;  read  to  them  (the  same  book 
over  and  over,  if  they  want);  name  objects;  and  describe  in  full  sentences 
what  you  are  doing,  what  they  are  doing,  and  what  is  going  on  in  the 
environment. 

To  develop  speaking  skills,  ask  children  to  tell  you  about  their  day,  listen  to 
how  they  feel  and  what  they  think,  and  read  to  them  and  ask  them  to  answer 
questions  about  the  story  and  the  pictures. 

To  develop  reading  skills,  read  to  children  and  with  them;  listen  to  them 
read;  ask  them  to  read  notes,  messages,  and  signs;  and  help  them  with  read¬ 
ing  homework.  Make  games  of  reading  signs,  billboards,  posters,  and  other 
items  they  see  in  their  environment. 

To  develop  writing  skills,  encourage  drawing,  scribbling,  and  copying;  write 
down  the  words  they  use  to  describe  the  pictures  they  are  drawing;  write 
lists  and  messages;  and  ask  them  to  write  their  names,  to  leave  you  notes, 
and  to  write  letters.  Keep  a  family  journal  to  which  both  adult  and  child  can 
contribute.

4.  Learning  to  read  in  your  first  language.  It  is  difficult  to  first  learn  to  read 
a  language  that  one  does  not  hear  spoken  at  home.  There  are,  however, 
English/Spanish  books  for  Latino  children  learning  to  read  English  as  their 
second  language,  such  as  My  First  100  Words  in  Spanish  and  English ,  My 
Day /Mi  Dai ,  ox  Margaret  and  Margarita.  Bilingual  books  in  other  lan¬ 
guages  are  available  but  not  with  as  much  variety  as  those  in  Spanish. 

Help  learners  who  speak  a  language  other  than  English  in  their  home  to 
value  their  first  language.  Encourage  them  to  help  their  children  read  and 
write  in  both  English  and  their  first  language.  It  is  a  tremendous  asset  in  the 
job  market  to  be  truly  bilingual. 

In  some  families,  children  may  be  more  proficient  at  reading  English  than 
parents.  They  can  share  a  book  by  taking  turns,  with  the  parent  supplying 
the  native  vocabulary  while  the  child  reads  the  English  words. 

Remind  learners  that  the  best  learning  environment  is  often  one  in  which 
both  adult  and  child,  teacher  and  student,  are  learning  together.  With  this  in 
mind,  the  parent  can  develop  the  respect  of  the  more  English-proficient 
child  by  valuing  the  adult’s  commitment  to  continue  learning.  They  can  also 
discuss  the  kind  of  encouragement  and  support  from  teachers  and  family 
members  each  likes  to  have  in  order  to  be  successful  learners. 

5.  Read  to  learners  Is  Your  Mama  a  Llama?  Allow  learners  to  listen  and  ex¬ 
perience  the  effects  of  rhyme  before  you  ask  them  to  understand  its  impor¬ 
tance.  Get  into  the  rhythm  and  expressiveness  of  the  book.  Stop  in  strategic 
places  and  allow  learners  to  call  out  the  next  word,  the  “answer.”  Show  how 
easy  it  is  to  be  right.  We  all  like  to  know  the  right  answer,  but  you  should 
emphasize  how  important  it  is  for  children  to  have  many  opportunities  to  be 
right  in  order  to  build  their  self-esteem. 

6.  The  importance  of  rhyme.  Ask  learners  to  generate  a  list  of  why  so  many 
books  for  young  children  contain  rhymes.  Be  sure  to  include  that  rhyme  is 
predictable ,  so  it  helps  build  success  and  thereby  increases  self-esteem  in 
children. 

Rhyme  is  repetitive,  rhythmic,  and  fun,  and  it  invites  participation,  thereby 
using  the  kinesthetic  learning  channel.  Because  it  is  fun  and  easy  to  be  suc¬ 
cessful,  rhyme  helps  children  remember  new  words  and  their  meanings,  so  it 
is  excellent  for  memory  development. 

Ask  learners  to  recite  rhymes  remembered  from  childhood.  Take  this  op¬ 
portunity  to  share  cross-culturally.  Childhood  rhymes  are  usually  still  re¬ 
membered  because  they  came  in  through  a  window  of  opportunity  (from 


178 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


video  “ Your  Child’s  Brain")  when  language  was  first  learned  and  repetition 
was  extremely  effective. 

7.  Read  aloud  together  Goodnight  Moon.  Introduce  the  book  as  a  classic  first 
published  in  1947.  Demonstrate  the  many  ways  to  use  the  book  for  language 
development  (e.g.,  point  out  object  names;  repeat  the  “goodnight”  phrase 
while  naming  other  objects;  find  the  mouse  in  each  color  picture;  or  describe 
changes  in  the  light,  the  moon,  or  the  clocks). 

8.  Show  other  rhyming  books  such  as:  The  Alphabet  Tale ;  Mother  Hubbard’s 
Cupboard ;  Big  Owl  Little  Towel,  Where ’s  My  Teddy?;  Ten,  Nine,  Eight;  A 
Fox  Got  My  Sox;  or  Pink,  Red,  Blue,  What  Are  You?  Read  as  many  as  you 
have  time  for,  encouraging  learners  to  contribute  the  next  word. 

9.  Read  aloud  together  Leo  the  Late  Bloomer.  Children  develop  at  different 
rates,  and  it  is  important  to  be  supportive  and  encouraging  of  children  while 
trusting  the  process  of  growth. 

Discuss  how  this  book  can  be  used  to  open  a  conversation  about  feeling 
slow  or  different.  Also  discuss  how  it  offers  the  opportunity  to  explain  fig¬ 
ures  of  speech  and  common  sayings  (late  bloomer,  a  watched  pot  never 
boils).  Other  books  with  a  playful  approach  to  language  are  The  King  Who 
Rained ,  A  Little  Pigeon  Toad ,  or  Rib  Ticklers.

What  information  did  the  parent  You  hold  parent  meetings 
share? 

Many  larger  programs  have  regular  or  special 
parent  meetings.  These  can  serve  a  variety  of 
purposes:  to  share  information,  to  build  parenting 
skills,  and  to  do  specific  activities  together. 


A  number  of  parents  have  had  unpleasant  experi¬ 
ences  with  schools,  and  they  may  be  reluctant  to 
join  in  these  groups.  Some  have  complications  with 
time,  language,  travel  arrangements,  or  childcare.

Resource  Centers 

More  and  more  libraries  are  developing  family  and  child  resource  centers  that 
are  used  not  only  by  parents  and  others  concerned  with  their  own  child,  but  also 
by  all  of  the  many  types  of  agencies  that  serve  children  and  families  across  the 
community.  One  of  the  outstanding  models  for  this  kind  of  center  is  found  in  the 
Middle  Country  Library  in  Suffolk  County  on  Long  Island,  New  York.  Such  a 
center  contains  materials  of  all  types:  books,  articles,  videos,  and  computerized 
databases  on  every  imaginable  aspect  of  a  child’s  and  a  family’s  well-being  such 
as  health,  mental  health,  family  relations,  legal  rights,  discipline,  normal  devel¬ 
opment,  and  disabilities.  Everything  can  be  found  here  in  one  place.  So  successful 
has  the  library  been  and  so  complete  is  its  collection  that  most  agencies  in  the 
county  have  given  up  trying  to  keep  up  with  the  flow  of  information  in  this  area 
and  have  given  full  support  and  collaboration  to  the  library’s  centered  effort.  As 
this  book  is  being  written,  a  foundation-funded  project  is  helping  libraries  in  three 
urban  and  one  rural  setting  to  emulate  the  center  and  its  constant  program  of  dis¬ 
cussions  groups,  training,  and  assistance  for  professional  caregivers  such  as  Head 
Start  staff  members  and  parents. 


Technical  Assistance 

As  a  part  of  your  Library-Head  Start  Partnership,  most  libraries,  whether  they 
have  such  a  highly  developed  center  or  not,  can  show  Head  Start  staffers  how  to 
do  a  number  of  useful  things  such  as  set  up  a  classroom  so  that  it  is  “print-rich”; 
how  to  repair  and  maintain  the  collection  of  books  the  Head  Start  classroom  owns 
itself;  how  to  prepare  pictures  for  use  in  enlarging,  laminating,  or  other  changes; 
how  to  organize  resource  files  of  pictures  or  articles  for  parents  and  teachers;  and 
how  to  identify  those  aspects  of  the  reading-related  program  that  can  be  effec¬ 
tively  performed  by  volunteer  parents  and  aides.  Many  libraries  are  able  to  pro¬ 
vide  the  Head  Start  classroom  with  books  or  other  materials  on  long-term  loan.  As 
we  indicate  in  the  video — the  script  of  which  is  found  in  the  appendix — your 
library  partnership  may  enable  you  to  buy  books  for  far  less  than  you  have  been 
accustomed  to  paying  for  them.  The  library  can  order  those  books  at  discount 
prices  along  with  its  order.  An  entire  workshop  session  could  be  built  around  ex¬ 
amining  material  for  a  given  curricular  segment  such  as  how  flowers  and  plants 
grow  or  what  the  building  blocks  for  nutrition  are.  One  of  the  popular  workshops 
for  Head  Start  staff  members  is  about  how  to  know  if  a  book  is  a  good  book  and  if 
children  will  like  it,  as  well  as  how  to  match  particular  books  to  particular  chil¬ 
dren.  Librarians  can  give  workshops  to  both  parents  and  staff  members  on  creat¬ 
ing  craft  projects,  making  puppets  of  various  kinds,  planning  for  dramatic  play, 
and  more.  Children  love  to  make  a  book  themselves,  among  the  many  possible 
craft  projects.  Planning  a  listening,  reading,  and  writing  comer  is  one  of  the  first

On  the  following  pages,  we  have  included  information  from  an  excellent  book 
by  Sue  McCleaf  Nesbeca  titled  Library  Programming  for  Families  with  Young 
Children.  The  pages  were  in  Figure  7.2,  “Sample  Topics  to  Be  Included  in  a 
Workshop  for  Early  Childhood  Educators.” 

After  those  pages  of  topics,  we  have  included  information  from  the  booklet 
that  accompanies  our  Head  Start  video,  plus  four  pages  from  the  manual  for  the 
Child  Development  Associates  (CD A)  Professional  Preparation  Program  called 
Essentials.  The  latter  contains  the  basic  curriculum  for  people  seeking  certifica¬ 
tion  from  institutions  throughout  the  country  that  coordinate  this  training  in  the 
CDA  Professional  Preparation  Program.  This  guide  was  published  in  1991  by  the 
Council  for  Early  Childhood  Professional  Recognition  and  was  edited  by  Carol 
Brunson  Phillips.  Minor  revisions  and  additions  are  made  from  time  to  time,  but 
the  guide  is  still  the  official  one  for  CDA  training  and  the  portions  relating  to 
reading  and  library  use  remain  the  same. 

This  chapter  has  explained  that  libraries  can  serve  Head  Start  children  and 
their  needs  in  two  distinctly  different  ways:  (1)  through  materials  and  programs 
directly  addressed  to  them  and  through  programs  directed  to  the  adults  who  sup¬ 
port  the  learning  and  emergent  literacy  of  Head  Start  children.

Using  the  Video 


Suggestions  for  Using  the  Video  in  a  Workshop  for 
Staff  Awareness  and  Development 

In  doing  a  workshop,  you  want  maximum 
participation,  so  it  is  suggested  that  there  be  full 
discussion  after  the  showing  of  each  segment. 

Here  are  possible  questions: 

SEGMENT  I 

•  If  the  librarian  does  not  contact  you,  what  - 

can  you  do  to  begin  to  establish  the 

partnership?  - 

•  Why  is  it  important  for  you  to  visit  the 
library  right  at  the  beginning  and  not  just 
have  the  librarian  come  to  see  you  in  your 
classroom? 

•  Does  any  Head  Start  person  here  have  an  - 

on-going  relationship  with  the  library?  How 

did  it  start  and  what  happens?  - 

•  Any  relationship  to  be  successful  should  be 
mutually  beneficial.  What  do  you  think  the 

library  and  the  librarians  get  out  of  working  _ 

with  Head  Start? 

•  Why  is  it  important  for  the  library  staff  - 

members  to  know  as  much  as  possible  about 

the  children  in  your  classroom,  their  - 

families,  and  the  curriculum? 

SEGMENT  II 

•  Why  do  we  tell  stories  in  so  many  ways?  _ 

•  Why  is  it  important  that  some  of  the  parent, 
family,  and  children  events  be  held  in  the 
library  and  not  just  in  the  Head  Start 
classroom? 

•  In  addition  to  good  storytellers,  what  other  _ 

kinds  of  people  resources  could  the 

librarians  help  you  to  find  out  about?  - 

•  Let’s  talk  about  the  role  of  books  in  building 
resilience,  self-esteem,  and  self-confidence 
and  perspectives  in  children  of  Head  Start 
age.  What  do  these  things  have  to  do  with 


186 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


developing  language  and  pre-reading  skills, 
including  imagination  and  the  willingness  to 
ask  questions  and  to  share  observations  and 
feelings? 

•  What  are  some  of  the  basics  you  believe  are 
important  to  making  a  good  presentation? 

SEGMENT  in 

•  Why  is  it  so  important  to  expose  children  to 
books  and  other  materials  of  the  highest 
quality?  What  book  do  you  like  best  to  read 
or  tell  from? 

•  In  the  video  some  of  the  qualities  that  make 
a  good  book  were  outlined.  Which  are  the 
ones  you  would  look  for  first  because  you 
believe  they  are  more  important  than  some 
of  the  others? 

•  Have  a  group  of  books  available.  Examine 
them  and  talk  about  them.  What  would  a 
child  or  several  children  in  your  class  enjoy 
most  about  one  or  more  of  them?  How  do 
you  believe  one  of  those  books  might  raise  a 
child’s  sense  of  self-esteem  or  lend  a  sense 
of  perspective? 

•  Can  you  think  of  ways  to  use  some  of  the 
books  shown  in  the  video  or  some  of  those 
you  have  at  hand  in  the  workshop  in 
connection  with  your  curriculum? 

•  What  kinds  of  lists  would  you  like  to  have 
to  help  you  select  books?  How  would  you 
like  the  librarians  to  help  you? 

•  Can  you  think  of  some  other  kinds  of 
extenders  or  enhancers  (perhaps  objects  of 
various  kinds)  to  use  with  books — either  to 
lead  up  to  them  or  to  help  children  to 
remember  those  books  along  with 
something  important  to  the  child?  What  will 
help  children  remember  the  books  long  after 
they  have  been  read?  What  enhancers  from 
the  video  did  you  like  best?

187 


SEGMENT  IV 


•  What  are  some  of  the  ways  you  can  help 
parents  learn  to  reinforce  or  lead  into  books? 
Discuss  some  ways  to  talk  to  children  or  to 
take  advantage  of  everyday  events  that  lead 
to  reading. 

•  What  help  do  you  think  you  could  give  to 
parents  who  would  like  to  read  better  so  that 
they  can  model  reading  for  their  children 
and  share  books  with  them?  How  could  the 
librarian  help  with  this? 

•  Could  you  do  a  parent  workshop  about 
books  and  learning  that  would  be  different 
from  the  one  shown  in  the  video?  What 
would  you  do? 

•  What  are  some  of  the  ways  that  parents  or 
families  of  your  children  could  benefit  from 
getting  to  know  more  about  available  library 
services? 

•  How  do  you  think  librarians  can  be  of 
greater  help  to  those  parents  in  the  home- 
based  option  and  to  the  Head  Start  staff 
members  who  provide  for  them? 

•  What  kinds  of  technical  assistance  would 
you  most  like  to  have  from  the  librarians?

Prompts  to  Reading  Awareness 

Child  Development  Associates  Professional  Preparation  Program 

Remember  (and  remind  parents  too)  that  the  library  is  a  wonderful  resource. 
Children’s  librarians  are  trained  in  child  development  as  well  as  literature  and 
other  resources.  They  can  provide  children  and  families  with  a  positive  introduc¬ 
tion  to  a  whole  new  world  of  information — through  toys,  books,  audio,  and  video 
materials.  Libraries  are  publicly  funded  and  free  to  everyone! 

Games.  One  often  overlooked  aspect  of  culture  is  children’s  games.  Every 
culture  has  its  own  games.  Many  games  can  be  made  with  household  objects  or 
common  items  such  as  rocks.  Some  require  no  props  at  all,  just  a  willingness  to 
play.  Preschool  children  enjoy  games  when  the  rules  are  tailored  to  their  devel¬ 
opmental  abilities  and  the  emphasis  is  on  having  fun,  not  on  competition.  Perhaps 
a  parent  or  an  elderly  person  in  the  neighborhood  would  be  delighted  to  play  some 
favorites  with  the  children. 

Vehicles.  Most  young  children  are  very  interested  in  various  modes  of  trans¬ 
portation  and  construction.  Select  vehicles  and  tools  from  several  cultures  and 
time  periods:  sleds,  boats,  wagons,  trains,  rockets,  shovels,  and  road  graders. 

If  you  are  not  sure  where  to  locate  books  and  other  materials  or  to  find  some 
resource  people  to  assist  you,  remember  to  check  with  your  local  library.  A  li¬ 
brarian’s  job  is  to  keep  records  of  various  community  resources  as  well  as  to  col¬ 
lect  and  arrange  many  print  and  nonprint  materials. 

What  kinds  of  objects  can  you  add  to  provide  a  better  balance  of  multicultural 
experiences  for  young  children? 


Share  your  ideas  with  your  Field  Advisor  and  the  other  CD  A  candidates  in 
your  seminar. 

Music.  Music  from  many  cultures  is  marvelous  for  developing  an  appreciation 
for  different  types  of  instruments,  rhythms,  expressions,  themes,  and  languages. 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


189 


While  recordings  are  useful,  it  is  hard  for  children  to  visualize  who  is  playing 
the  music  and  what  the  instruments  look  like.  Try  to  obtain  real  instruments,  such 
as  drums,  different  types  of  bells,  stringed  instruments,  or  shakers,  from  several 
cultures. 

Print.  Provide  children  with  good  models  of  print.  Print  neatly  yourself.  Use 
capital  letters  for  the  first  letters  of  names  and  lowercase  letters  when  they  are  ap¬ 
propriate.  As  you  write,  and  if  the  child  seems  interested,  talk  about  the  sounds 
some  of  the  letters  make.  Make  your  own  writing  accurate — check  your  spellings 
if  you  are  unsure. 

Encourage  children  to  use  invented  spelling — children  write  down  the  letters 
they  hear  in  the  word.  You’ll  be  amazed  how  easy  it  is  to  read,  and  rest  assured 
that  they  will  learn  to  spell  properly  when  they  are  older.  Just  enjoy  what  the  chil¬ 
dren  write.  As  their  muscles  and  minds  mature,  they  will  be  able  to  write  in  ways 
that  are  more  legible.  For  now,  you  want  to  keep  children’s  interest  and  self- 
confidence  at  a  peak. 

Fill  children  s  lives  with  print.  When  children  are  surrounded  by  language  and 
print,  they  see  how  it  is  used  and  it  begins  to  become  familiar.  You  don’t  expect 
young  children  to  learn  to  read,  but  you  do  expect  them  to  feel  comfortable  with 
words — ideas  and  feelings — both  spoken  and  written,  in  one  or  more  languages. 

One  important  factor  in  nurturing  eager  readers  is  for  them  to  see  others 
reading.  Encourage  parents  to  read  to  their  children  and  to  read  to  themselves  for 
pleasure.  Let  children  see  them  reading  books,  magazines,  cereal  boxes,  recipes, 
instruction  manuals,  grocery  lists,  and  coupons. 

Print  should  be  a  real,  everyday  feature  in  your  program,  not  just  ABC  letters 
on  children’s  plates  or  sneakers!  Instead,  look  for  real  uses  of  print: 

•  Labels  on  boxes  and  cans 

•  Directions  for  how  to  put  something  together 

•  A  chart  or  simple  schedule 

•  Play  the  piano  or  autoharp  with  music  in  front  of  you 

•  Use  the  telephone  book  or  the  parent  list  to  look  up  a  number 

•  Make  a  list  of  children  who  want  to  use  an  activity  area  that  is  temporarily  full 

•  Write  a  grocery  or  other  list  of  supplies  you  need 

•  Write  children’s  names  on  their  artwork. 


190 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


You  can  help  children  see  how  print  is  used  in  everything  they  do. 

Remember  to  expose  children  to  print  in  various  languages.  Empty  food  con¬ 
tainers  with  labels  in  different  languages  can  be  one  way.  Books,  magazines,  and 
newspapers  are  another.  When  you  label  things — artwork,  areas  of  the  room,  or 
materials — use  two  languages  with  a  different  color  for  each.  The  children  will 
eventually  ask  questions  and  begin  to  see  how  words  are  written  in  different 
languages. 

Take  a  look  at  the  kinds  of  print  that  children  encounter  every  day  in  your 
program.  Make  a  list  of  the  opportunities  you  see. 


Can  you  think  of  new  materials  or  activities  to  add?  List  some  ideas  here. 


Keep  the  activities  appropriate.  You  may  have  noticed  that  we  haven’t  used 
the  terms  reading  readiness  or  pre-reading  skills.  Why?  Because  reading  is  not 
something  children  do  all  of  a  sudden.  There  is  no  magical  moment  when  they  are 
“ready”  to  read  or  write. 

All  real  experiences  contribute  to  children’s  speaking,  reading,  and  writing 
skills  because  children  build  a  foundation  of  things  to  talk,  read,  and  write  about. 
Children  learn  about  language  and  reading  gradually.  (Recently,  the  term  “emer¬ 
gent  literacy”  has  been  used.) 

Therefore,  early  childhood  professionals  describe  everything  we  have  just 
talked  about  as  children ' s  early  reading  skills.  You  are  not  teaching  children  to 
read.  You  are  giving  them  the  foundation  of  experiences — and  the  inspiration — to 
want  to  learn  to  read. 

We  have  failed  to  mention  items  such  as  the  following: 

•  Alphabet  blocks 

•  Rubber  stamp  letters 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


191 


•  Magnetic  letters 

•  Charts  of  letters 

•  Alphabet  lotto  games 

•  The  ABC  song 

•  Other  so-called  readiness  materials  and  activities 

Why  did  we  neglect  such  things?  Because  they  make  sense  only  after  children 
have  had  lots  of  experiences  with  real  things  and  with  words  in  the  context  of  the 
things  they  do  every  day.  You  may  want  to  include  just  a  few  of  these  items  for 
more  mature  preschoolers,  but  none  are  necessary  for  children  to  be  well  prepared 
for  later  reading  or  for  writing. 

Infants,  toddlers,  and  young  preschool  children  benefit  even  less  from  such 
abstract  materials,  so  think  carefully  before  purchasing  such  items. 

We  hope  that  by  now  it  is  also  clear  that  we  think  the  activities  listed  below 
are  unnecessary  and  inappropriate  for  young  children: 

•  Flashcards 

•  Worksheets 

•  Workbooks 

•  Phonics  lessons 

•  Drills 

These  things  won’t  help  children  reach  any  of  our  long-term  goals  and,  in  fact, 
can  easily  turn  children  off,  rather  than  on,  to  reading.  Don’t  take  the  risk!  Make 
reading  really  fun  and  useful. 

Parents  may  ask  you  about  teaching  their  child  to  read  or  may  even  pressure 
you  to  begin  teaching  formal  phonics.  Be  prepared  to  respond  with  a  professional 
answer  about  the  values  of  a  print-rich  environment.  Parents  can  best  help  their 
children  learn  to  read  by  providing  listening  and  word  experiences.  Singing,  talk¬ 
ing,  reciting  rhymes,  and  reading  aloud  provide  the  foundation  a  child  needs  to 
learn  to  read  when  he  or  she  is  ready. 

Think  about  these  points.  Does  your  program  share  this  view?  Discuss  this  is¬ 
sue  with  the  other  staff  members  in  your  classroom.  If  they  have  a  different  view 
of  reading  readiness,  describe  some  developmentally  appropriate  ways  you  are 


192 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


learning  to  invite  children  to  become  readers.  Tell  your  advisor  about  your 
progress! 

Let’s  now  see  how  children’s  music  and  art  can  be  used  to  build  even  further 
upon  their  ability  to  communicate. 

Children  enjoy  the  sound  of  music. 

Spontaneous.  Talking  with  children  is  best  when  it  is  a  spontaneous  and  a 
natural  part  of  the  day.  And  so  is  music.  Don’t  wait  until  10:15  on  Wednesday  to 
sing  “The  Itsy  Bitsy  Spider.”  If  it’s  raining,  sing!  If  a  child  brings  in  some  new 
maracas  sent  by  a  relative  in  Mexico,  don’t  put  off  playing  them  until  music  time. 
Or  if  a  child  brings  in  a  Michael  Jackson  record,  put  it  on  and  dance! 

What  is  the  best  part  about  music  with  young  children?  They  love  it.  And  they 
couldn’t  care  less  whether  you  can  carry  a  tune,  play  an  instrument,  read  music,  or 
even  keep  on  time  with  the  beat.  Just  enjoy  yourselves. 

Sing  and  sing  and  sing.  Sing  a  lullaby  to  babies  as  they  fall  asleep.  When 
something  great  happens — a  child  has  just  become  a  new  sister  or  brother — break 
out  in  a  joyous  version  of  “If  You’re  Happy....”  When  you  have  spaghetti  for 
lunch,  start  or  finish  with  “On  Top  of  Spaghetti.” 

Don’t  be  shy!  Stand  up,  move  around,  and  sing!

Evaluation:  Two  Models 

Head  Start  has  many  ways  of  evaluating  its  program  and  the  program’s  effec¬ 
tiveness.  What  we  are  proposing  in  this  section  on  evaluation  is  guidelines  for 
evaluating  cooperative  and  collaborative  projects  such  as  the 
Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership.  In  fact,  the  examples  we  are  using  are 
based  on  the  presentations  at  the  workshops  we  conducted  across  the  country  for 
this  partnership  project. 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


193 


Keith  Curry  Lance,  Colorado  State  Library  researcher,  outlines  the  evaluation 
process  through  “Tell  It!  Like  It  Is.”  This  basic  introduction  to  evaluation  is 
captured  in  the  following: 

Talk  about  the  vision. 

•  Brainstorm  with  stakeholder  groups. 

•  Complete  sentences  such  as  “A  good  cooperative  program  involving  Head 
Start  programs,  libraries,  and  museums  will ...” 

•  Set  priorities  among  multiple  visions. 

Explore  alternatives  and  design  the  approach. 

•  List  alternative  approaches. 

•  Consider  what  worked  before  and  why. 

•  Weigh  tradeoffs. 

•  Identify  barriers. 

•  Set  priorities  among  alternative  approaches. 

•  Think  of  criteria  that  different  stakeholders  might  use  to  evaluate  them. 

Learn  from  what’s  happening. 

•  Schedule  times  to  assess  progress. 

•  Collect  appropriate  data. 

•  Listen  to  what  it’s  telling  you. 

•  Talk  about  it  with  those  who  can  best  tell  you  what’s  happening. 

•  Embrace  change,  if  needed. 

•  “Cheerlead”  those  on  the  front  lines,  as  needed. 

Let  people  know  what  happened. 

•  What  will  be  evidence  of  work  toward  the  vision? 

•  Collect  such  evidence. 

•  List  those  who  need  to  learn  what  happened. 

•  Think  about  how  to  inform  stakeholders  (newsletter,  report,  meetings,  e-mail). 


194 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


Integrate  results  with  ongoing  services. 

•  Plan  to  integrate,  if  successful. 

•  Identify  who  needs  to  be  involved  to  make  this  occur. 

•  Decide  where  and  how  the  project  fits  with  ongoing  services. 

•  Raise  awareness  internally  and  externally. 

•  Rotate  regular  and  project  staff  members. 

•  “Weed”  unneeded  projects  or  services. 

•  Add  to  goals,  plan,  budget. 

Think  about  how  it  all  worked. 

•  Reflect  on  what  success  means. 

•  List  things  to  remember  for  next  project. 

•  Decide  if  you  will  do  it  differently  on  an  ongoing  basis. 

•  Review  materials  used. 

•  Identify  future  projects  that  branch  off  from  this  one. 

Dr.  Lance  also  outlines  methods  for  collecting  data.  He  suggests  that  you  use 
available  data,  surveys  such  as  questionnaires  and  interviews,  focus  groups,  ob¬ 
servations,  and  narrative  analysis.  A  fuller  explanation  of  the  points  outlined 
above  are  found  in  Tell  It!  Like  It  Is ,  a  book  available  from  the  American  Library 
Association,  50  E.  Huron,  Chicago,  IL  60611. 

At  another  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  Workshop,  Dr.  Richard 
A.  Chase  of  the  Wilder  Research  Center  in  Minnesota  outlined  his  remarks  by 
giving  a  dozen  pointers  and  challenges  about  evaluation  and  collaboration.  The 
following  is  based  on  his  presentation: 

1 .  There  are  two  main  reasons  to  evaluate.  Evaluation  should  be  useful  for  im¬ 
proving  processes  (decision  making,  service  delivery,  outreach,  collabora¬ 
tion)  and  for  providing  evidence  of  results  (for  supporting  claims  about 
effectiveness,  for  future  support).  Evaluation  should  facilitate  your  process 
and  flow  out  of  what  you  are  doing. 

2.  Being  good  people  who  do  good  work  and  having  a  strong  mission  are  not 
enough.  Are  you  making  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  people?  That’s  the  stuff 
of  evaluation.

3.  Evaluation  and  common  sense  are  not  mutually  exclusive.  Some  people 
make  evaluation  more  complicated  than  it  has  to  be.  Keep  it  simple.  If  the 
evaluation  does  not  make  sense  to  you,  that’s  a  clue  that  you  may  have  the 
wrong  evaluator.  Get  another  one. 

4.  Evaluation  should  be  inclusive  and  participatory.  Evaluation  cannot  be  done 
without  your  help  and  your  doing  part  of  it. 

5.  Find  practical  sources  of  information.  Start  with  existing  information,  pro¬ 
gram  records,  or  meeting  minutes.  Make  them  more  structured  and  standard 
to  serve  two  purposes.  Use  other  people’s  data  (the  library  can  conduct  a 
search  of  existing  data  that  may  be  relevant). 

6.  Seek  the  highest  level  of  evidence  for  your  level  and  intensity  of  interven¬ 
tion.  Articulate  your  goals  at  your  level  of  intervention.  For  instance,  plan  an 
art  and  story  day  for  Head  Start  kids  who  do  not  have  grandparents  but  who 
have  been  matched  with  a  volunteer  grandparent.  The  kids  and  surrogate 
grandparents  will  meet  every  other  Saturday  for  a  year  at  either  the  library 
or  the  museum.  They  will  have  art  and  stories  at  both  places. 

-  What  can  you  realistically  evaluate? 

-  How  many  kids  show  up?  How  many  like  it? 

-  How  many  parents  like  it  because  they  get  the  morning  off? 

-  Can  you  realistically  improve  appreciation  for  art  and  stories  and 
intergenerational  relationships  (attitudes)? 

-  Can  you  improve  reading  levels  (skills)? 

-  Can  you  increase  the  number  of  times  the  kids  and  their  parents  go  to  the 
library  and  museum  on  their  own  when  the  program  isn’t  the  reason 
(behaviors)? 

These  changes  in  attitudes,  skills,  and  behavior  would  be  just  for  those  who 
used  the  library  and  museum  program.  However,  these  goals  are 
measurable. 

7.  For  coalition-building  and  collaboration,  the  number  one  advice  is  to  give  it 
time.  Collaboration  is  hard.  In  fact,  it  adds  work  at  first.  Give  it  time.  Trust 
and  relationships  do  not  come  automatically,  and  they  don’t  spring  up  fully 
developed.  There  is  process  involved  in  collaboration  and  the  sharing  of  the 
credit. 


196 


Training/Education  for  Parents,  Other  Caregivers,  and  Teachers 


8.  Collaboration  is  not  the  goal;  it’s  the  means  to  your  goals.  The  place  to  look 
for  signs  of  reaching  the  goal  of  improved  family  literacy  is  with  the  fami¬ 
lies  and  children  you  are  trying  to  reach. 

9.  A  challenge  of  collaboration  is  transferring  to  clients  or  families  the  knowl¬ 
edge  and  power  gained  through  collaboration.  Empowering  staff  profession¬ 
als  is  a  step  toward  this  challenge. 

10.  Leadership  is  necessary  in  coalition-building.  Coalition  requires  shared 
commitment,  strong  shared  mission,  teamwork,  trust,  and  strong  effective 
leadership. 

1 1 .  External  communication  is  important  so  you  can  keep  the  outside  world  in¬ 
formed  about  what  you  are  doing.  Without  external  communication  you  will 
lose  perspective,  lose  allies,  and  lose  your  basis  for  ongoing  support. 

12.  Retention  without  burnout  is  important  so  that  small  numbers  of  people  do 
not  end  up  doing  all  the  work.  Having  people  who  bum  out  will  lead  to 
turnover  and  lack  of  continuity.  You  will  have  to  start  all  over  again.  Prac¬ 
tice  universal  participation  and  mutual  accountability  for  results.  Keeping 
everyone  involved  is  the  key  to  successful  collaboration. 

Parents  should  be  involved  in  the  evaluation  of  the  Library-Museum  Partner¬ 
ship  project,  just  as  they  are  in  all  of  the  Head  Start  program.  The  following  ex¬ 
ample  of  a  Family  Literacy  Parent  Survey  from  Dr.  Carole  Talan’s  Family 
Literacy:  A  Start-Up  Manual  and  Guide  can  be  adapted  for  use  with  your  parents.

Children  Learn  What  They  Live 

By  Dorothy  Law  Nolle 


If  a  child  lives  with  criticism, 

He  learns  to  condemn. 

If  a  child  lives  with  hostility, 

He  learns  to  fight. 

If  a  child  lives  with  ridicule, 

He  learns  to  be  shy. 

If  a  child  lives  with  shame, 

He  learns  to  feel  guilty. 

If  a  child  lives  with  tolerance, 

He  learns  to  be  patient. 

If  a  child  lives  with  encouragement, 

He  learns  confidence. 

If  a  child  lives  with  praise, 

He  learns  justice. 

If  a  child  lives  with  security, 

He  learns  to  have  faith. 

If  a  child  lives  with  approval, 

He  learns  to  like  himself. 

If  a  child  lives  with  acceptance  and  friendship 
He  learns  to  find  love  in  the  world.

Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


First  Steps  in  Collaboration 

As  Dr.  Richard  Chase  outlined  in  the  previous  chapter,  collaborative  efforts 
like  the  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  project  take  extra  work  at  the 
beginning.  And  that  means  that  you  have  not  only  your  job  to  perform,  but  also 
the  added  work  of  establishing  a  collaboration.  Why  then  would  you  take  on  the 
collaborative  project?  One  very  important  reason  is  that  you  need  help  in  extend¬ 
ing  the  Head  Start  program  into  the  home  and  the  community  so  that  lessons 
learned  in  your  classroom  can  be  integrated  into  the  life  of  your  Head  Start  chil¬ 
dren  beyond  the  classroom  door.  The  lessons  learned  in  your  classroom  are  not 
only  skills  that  ensure  success  in  school  but  also  skills  that  are  necessary  for 
success  in  life. 

Recently,  “Kids  Can’t  Wait:  A  Summit  on  Library  Services  for  Children”  was 
held  in  Flint,  Michigan,  and  covered  guidelines  for  team  planning.  You  may  want 
to  ask  yourself  some  of  the  questions  the  participants  were  asked. 

How  are  we  doing? 

•  How  well  are  we  connected  with  other  agencies  that  offer  services  to  children 
in  our  community? 

•  How  could  relationships  with  other  agencies  help  me  improve  outcomes  for 
the  children  and  the  families  we  serve? 

How  can  we  improve  interagency  relationships? 

•  Do  the  agencies  serving  children  and  families  in  our  community  have  a 
common  vision  of  what  they  are  trying  to  accomplish? 

•  Do  we  have  close  working  relationships  with  other  agencies  that  deliver 
services  to  children  and  their  families? 

•  How  can  I  improve  relationships  with  other  service  providers? 

If  you  take  stock  of  your  position  in  the  community  by  answering  those  ques¬ 
tions  on  behalf  of  Head  Start  and  of  the  children  and  families  in  the  program,  you 


201 


will  begin  to  see  why  a  collaboration  among  Head  Start,  libraries,  and  museums 
will  benefit  those  most  in  need — the  children  and  their  families.  You  may  want  to 
take  the  lead  in  developing  the  partnership  with  libraries  and  museums.  Invite 
staff  members  from  both  to  a  meeting  to  discuss  possibilities  for  collaboration. 
You  may  want  to  think  about  the  following  guidelines  for  new  partners. 

•  Involve  all  key  players. 

•  Establish  a  shared  vision. 

•  Choose  a  realistic  strategy. 

•  Agree  to  disagree  in  the  process. 

•  Make  promises  you  can  keep. 

•  Keep  your  eye  on  the  prize. 

•  Build  ownership  at  all  levels. 

•  Avoid  red  herrings. 

•  Institutionalize  change. 

•  Publicize  your  success. 

These  guidelines  were  distributed  to  participants  at  the  Kids  Can’t  Wait 
Summit.  Other  essential  elements  for  making  a  partnership  work  were  discussed 
by  Bev  Propes,  Executive  Director,  Community  University  Partnership, 
University  of  Minnesota.  The  essential  elements  include  these: 

•  Communication 

•  Cooperation 

•  Coordination 

•  Authority  and  accountability 

•  Resources

Collaboration  Planning 

Besides  these  essentials,  you  can  concentrate  on  implementing  your  plan  by 
following  these  recommended  steps: 

•  Decide  the  content  and  format  of  your  program. 

•  Develop  a  timeline. 

•  Establish  who  will  be  responsible  for  expenses. 

•  Designate  who  will  conduct  the  program. 

•  Determine  the  staff  involvement. 

•  Resolve  the  need  for  volunteers  and  the  training  required. 

•  Plan  publicity  and  its  implementation. 

•  Develop  an  evaluation  of  the  partnership  program. 

During  one  of  the  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  workshops  held 
around  the  country,  Gwen  Chance,  Director  of  Texas  Head  Start  State  Collabora¬ 
tion,  gave  the  following  elements  of  a  successful  collaboration  process: 

•  Mutual  respect  for  skills  and  knowledge 

•  Professional  appearance  and  etiquette 

•  Honest  and  clear  communication 

•  Understanding  of  each  other’s  roles,  responsibilities,  and  mandates 

•  Shared  planning  and  decision  making 

•  Open  and  two-way  sharing  of  information 

•  Accessibility,  accountability,  and  responsiveness  of  responsible  parties 

•  Joint  evaluation  of  progress 

•  Absence  of  labeling  and  blaming  in  the  face  of  problems 

•  Ability  to  negotiate  through  presenting  problems  and  compromise 

•  Mutual  focus  on  the  common  goal 

•  Ongoing  commitment  to  the  collaboration  process 


Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


203 


The  Texas  Head  Start  Collaboration  Project  explains  that  collaboration  is  the 
process  by  which  agencies  formally  commit  themselves  on  a  long-term  basis  to 
work  together  to  accomplish  a  common  mission.  Collaboration  brings  previously 
separate  organizations  into  a  new  working  structure  that  requires  joint  compre¬ 
hensive  planning,  implementation,  and  assessment.  This  structure  necessitates  a 
sharing  of  resources,  power,  and  authority.  It  also  requires  organizations  to  blend 
their  strengths  as  well  as  negotiate  their  differences  with  an  underlying  attitude  of 
trust.  The  goal  of  collaboration  is  the  provision  of  comprehensive  services  for 
families  that  will  improve  family  outcomes. 

The  Community  Collaborations  for  Family  Literacy  by  S.  Quezada  and  R. 
Nickse  spells  out  indicators  for  successful  participation  in  collaborative  efforts. 
They  include  the  following: 

•  Developed  new  tools  for  interagency  planning 

•  Promoted  better  or  more  effective  ways  to  serve  a  shared  target  population 

•  Reduced  isolation 

•  Developed  a  local  network  of  service  providers 

•  Provided  new  materials  and  resources 

•  Changed  conception  of  services  from  an  individual  to  a  family  focus 

•  Provided  confirmation  to  librarians  and  museum  educators  about  the  impor¬ 
tance  of  their  role  in  service  to  children  and  their  families 

•  Developed  outreach  strategies 

•  Provided  opportunities  to  share  information  about  services 

We  have  already  discussed  that  collaborations  take  time.  In  addition,  other 
barriers  may  need  to  be  reviewed  and  discussed  so  that  they  do  not  stand  in  the 
way  of  your  success.  Here  are  some  barriers: 

•  Lack  of  support  or  approval  from  direct  line  supervisors  or  administration 

•  Turf  issues  related  to  funding  and  missions 

•  Lack  of  resources 

•  Lack  of  technical  assistance 


204 


Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


The  key  to  overcoming  negative  effects  on  the  establishment  of  a  good  col¬ 
laboration  is  to  recognize  that  these  items  can  be  barriers  and  to  discuss  them  up 
front  with  all  of  the  involved  players. 

According  to  the  Colorado  Head  Start  State  Collaboration  Project,  the  four  Cs 
of  collaboration  are 

•  Common  vision 

•  Commitment 

•  Clear  communication 

•  Collective  strength 

Benefits  of  Collaboration 

A  long-term  study  by  the  Perry  Preschool  Project  in  Michigan  showed  that 
quality  early  childhood  education  programs  can  do  the  following: 

•  Reduce  the  need  for  special  education  services  in  schools. 

•  Decrease  the  number  of  children  who  repeat  a  grade. 

•  Increase  the  chance  of  graduation  from  high  school. 

•  Decrease  involvement  with  the  criminal  justice  system. 

Memorandum  of  Agreement 

One  of  the  major  barriers  in  a  collaborative  project  is  a  clear  understanding  of 
the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  participating  agencies.  This  barrier  can  easily  be 
overcome  by  drafting  a  memorandum  of  agreement.  The  draft  by  the  key  players 
should  be  agreed  to  and  signed  by  the  administration  of  the  involved  agencies, 
which  in  this  case  would  be  Head  Start,  the  library,  and  the  museum.  Rather  than 
reinventing  the  wheel,  later  in  this  chapter  we  will  give  examples  of  an  agreement 
that  can  serve  as  a  model  for  you  and  of  agreements  that  have  been  actually  de¬ 
veloped  and  used  in  successful  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership  projects. 

Each  location  is  unique  even  though  there  are  many  commonalties  among  like 
agencies.  Therefore,  you  and  your  new  partners  will  want  to  draft  your  own 
agreement.  Gwen  Chance,  Director  of  the  Texas  State  Head  Start  Collaboration, 
states  that  a  win-win  interagency  agreement  clarifies,  formalizes,  and  spells  out 
agency  relationships  in  order  to  avoid  misunderstandings  among  agencies.  She 
further  states  that  an  outcome  of  the  collaboration  process  should  be  the  estab- 


Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


205 


lishment  of  an  on-going  relationship  between  agencies  that  allows  for  the  provi¬ 
sion  of  comprehensive  services  for  children  and  their  families.  According  to 
Ms.  Chance,  agreements  should  contain  the  following: 

•  Name  of  agencies  and  organizations  involved 

•  Brief,  separate  mission  statements  of  organizations  signing  agreement 

•  Purpose  of  agreement 

•  Definition  of  terms  pertinent  to  the  agreement,  if  needed 

•  Roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  agency  partner 

•  Statement  of  fiscal  responsibilities 

•  Mechanisms  for  evaluation  agreement 

•  Procedures  for  each  activity  that  was  committed  to 

•  Dates 

•  Signatures 

We  thank  the  various  partnerships  for  their  willingness  to  share  copies  of  their 
agreements  with  our  readers. 

Publicity  and  Promotion 

Do  not  keep  this  exciting  partnership  a  secret.  Nothing  succeeds  like  success, 
and  you  need  to  tell  your  community  about  the  Library-Museum-Head  Start 
Partnership  project.  Often  when  businesses  and  other  community  agencies  and 
organizations  hear  about  a  cooperative  project,  they  want  to  join.  They  may  even 
want  to  volunteer  to  help  in  the  Head  Start  classroom,  the  library,  or  the  museum. 

Here  are  a  few  suggestions  for  promoting  the  partnership  that  are  adapted 
from  the  Born  to  Read  Planning  Manual  (ALA,  1996),  which  is  based  on  the  suc¬ 
cessful  partnership  between  librarians  and  health  care  professionals  who  serve  at- 
risk  families. 

Define  your  target  audience.  (Whom  would  you  like  to  reach  with  the 
information?) 

Choose  the  best  way  to  communicate. 

•  Use  personal  interaction,  such  as  public  speaking  or  telephone  contact. 

•  Print  written  materials,  such  as  fliers  or  information  brochures. 


206 


Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


•  Use  the  broadcast  medium,  such  as  interview  programs  or  public  service 
announcements. 

•  Advertise  through  displays,  such  as  print  ads  or  banners. 

•  Create  graphics,  such  as  posters,  buttons,  bookmarks,  or  displays. 

Develop  a  fact  sheet  with  basic  information  about  the  partnership. 

•  Include  startling  facts  about  your  service  area. 

•  Give  a  clear  outline  of  the  program  format. 

•  Include  a  contact  person  or  persons  plus  a  local  phone  number  for  further 
information. 

•  Develop  a  promotion  calendar. 

•  Learn  about  your  local  deadlines. 

•  Use  a  checklist  to  remind  you  of  dates  and  elements  of  the  promotion. 

•  Develop  a  press  release  for  the  kickoff. 

•  Develop  a  press  release  as  the  program  progresses,  using  pictures  and  quotes 
from  children  and  families  involved  in  the  program  (with  permission,  of 
course). 

Sources  for  Funding 

Head  Start  has  money  set  aside  for  establishing  cooperative  projects  like  this 
because  such  projects  support  Head  Start’s  policy  of  providing  family  literacy. 
There  are  also  small  sums  of  money  for  transportation,  training,  materials,  and 
other  aspects  of  a  partnership.  However,  you  may  want  to  seek  private  funding  for 
special  projects  within  the  program.  As  you  approach  funding  prospects,  you 
should  consider  these  steps  that  are  based  on  remarks  given  in  1994  by  George  V. 
Grune,  chairman  of  the  DeWitt  Wallace-Reader’s  Digest  Fund  and  Lila 
Wallace-Reader’s  Digest  Fund. 

1 .  Do  your  homework.  Take  time  to  learn  everything  you  can  about  a  funder. 
Suppliers  of  funds  are  looking  for  programs,  projects,  and  organizations  that 
advance  their  mission  rather  than  funding  what  used  to  be  called  “good 
works.”  They  want  to  use  their  money  to  bring  about  long-term  benefits. 


Community  Collaboration  and  Resources 


207 


2.  Play  by  the  rules.  Follow  the  foundation’s  application  guidelines,  and  do 
what  is  asked.  Know  exactly  how  an  organization  likes  to  be  approached.  If 
the  fund  guidelines  specify  a  two-page  letter,  do  not  send  a  50-page 
proposal. 

3.  Communicate  clearly.  That  means  clearly  defining  the  goals  for  the  project, 
the  strategies  for  implementation,  and  the  benchmarks  for  measuring  suc¬ 
cess.  Do  not  make  unrealistic  promises,  because  today’s  sophisticated  fund 
providers  are  practical  and  realistic. 

4.  Deliver  on  your  promises.  If  you  are  fortunate  enough  to  get  a  grant,  there  is 
nothing  more  important  for  your  future  relationship  with  that  fund  than  do¬ 
ing  what  you  said  you  planned  to  do  with  the  money.  All  funds  expect  in¬ 
formation  that  is  clear,  concise,  candid,  and  delivered  on  time. 

Funders  want  their  grantees  to  succeed.  When  we  hear 
about  problems,  we  can  work  together  on  solutions. 

— George  V.  Grune,  chair  of  the  DeWitt  Wallace-Reader’s  Digest  Fund 
and  Lila  Wallace-Reader’s  Digest  Fund 

One  additional  thought  from  experience:  don’t  expect  that  all  contributions 
must  be  large  ones  or  from  foundations  or  businesses.  Many  partnerships  have 
received  support  from  interested  individuals  such  as  the  pediatrician  in  Texas  who 
paid  museum  entrance  fees  for  children  and  Head  Start  families  for  a  year’s  worth 
of  visits.

This  video  is  targeted  primarily  to  Head 
Start  staff  members  and  is  intended  to  assist 
them  in  building  an  effective  partnership  with 
librarians  who  serve  young  children.  The  secon¬ 
dary  audience  is  the  librarians  themselves,  so 
that  they  realize  what  raised  expectations  Head 
Start  staff  members  may  have  of  them.  How¬ 
ever,  the  video  can  be  used  to  raise  awareness 
(1)  of  the  Head  Start  program  and  (2)  of  library 
programs  and  the  value  of  forming  their  partner¬ 
ships  with  many  other  audiences.  Among  those 
audiences  are  potential  volunteers,  potential 
funding  sources,  personnel  of  other  early  child¬ 
hood  and  family-serving  agencies. 

Here  are  some  groups  to  whom  you  might 
offer  to  show  this  video  as  an  hour-long  pro¬ 
gram  (including  time  for  discussion): 

•  Friends  of  the  library  and  trustees  of  the 
library 

•  Adult  learners  and  potential  learners 

•  Daycare  providers  and  childcare  or  youth 
services  coordinating  councils 

•  Elementary  school  teachers  and  members  of 
PTA 

•  Library  school  classes  and  staff  develop¬ 
ment  sessions  for  librarians 

•  City  councils  and  boards  of  supervisors 

•  Mayors  and  other  local  and  state-elected 
officials 

•  Staff  and  administration  of  local  social 
service  agencies 

•  Staff  of  city  and  county  health  departments 

•  Members  of  service  clubs  and  organizations, 
such  as  Rotary,  Soroptomist,  Kiwanis,  and 
AARP  units 

Because  public  libraries  throughout  the 
country  have  suffered  severe  budget  and  staff 
cuts,  you  might,  if  appropriate,  make  a  plea  for 
funds  to  assist  librarians  in  taking  on  this  addi-

tional  major  task  of  supporting  Head  Start  pro-  - 

grams.  Those  librarians  have  an  important  role 

in  developing  learners  and  promoting  literacy.  - 

Be  sure  they  understand  that  all  the  people  in  the 
video  are  really  doing  what  they  do  and  speak- 
ing  without  a  script.  Only  the  narration  was 
scripted.  If  time  is  too  short  to  show  the  entire 
video,  Segments  I  and  IV  work  well  together. 

Segment  IV  emphasizes  the  importance  of  par¬ 
ent  involvement  as  the  children’s  first  and  pri-  _ 

mary  teacher.  These  two  give  you  1 7  minutes  of 

film,  so  the  segments  could,  with  brief  discus-  _ 

sion,  fit  into  a  half-hour  time  slot.  You  can  “fast 
forward”  the  tape  through  Segments  II  and  III. 

Introduce  a  program  to  your  audience  by  - 

talking  briefly  about  why  kids  need  libraries  and 

what  libraries  can  do  to  help  meet  the  growing  - 

need  for  the  following:  lifelong  learning  pat¬ 
terns,  higher-level  thinking  skills,  job  and  career 
flexibility,  and  opportunities  to  relearn  along  the 
life  span.  Mention  also  that  we  know  from  much 
research  that  high-level  literacy  is  usually  based 
on  exposure  to  books  and  to  reading  enjoyment 

in  very  early  childhood.  Above  all,  such  literacy  _ 

is  based  on  exposure  to  parents  and  other  sig¬ 
nificant  adults  who  are  observed  reading  and  _ 

being  very  involved  in  it. 

If  time  permits,  encourage  discussion  _ 

among  members  of  the  audience.  After  they 

view  how  the  library  along  with  the  Head  Start  - 

program  intervenes  in  the  lives  of  low-income 

families,  the  audience  will  understand  how  such  - 

programs  might  lay  a  foundation  of  prevention 
for  these  educational  and  social  dysfunctions  of 
children  as  they  grow  older:  illiteracy,  dropping 
out,  teen  pregnancy,  despair  and  depression, 

addiction,  criminal  behavior,  and  other  _ 

problems. 

Ask  audience  members  how  they,  as  indi-  _ 

viduals  or  as  a  group,  can  see  themselves  getting 

involved  and  helping  with  the  Library-Head  - — 

Start  Partnership.  Ask  if  there  are  people  in  the 

audience  who  would  like  to  help.  Ask  what  - 

other  groups  they  think  should  see  the  video.

Library/Museum/Head  Start  Partnership 
Proposed  Agreement  of  Purpose 

Rockford,  Illinois 

(Revised  Draft:  November  21,  1995) 

Rockford  Public  Library,  Discovery  Center  Museum,  and  the  city  of  Rockford 
Head  Start  share  a  common  commitment  to  encourage  life-long  learning.  These 
three  agencies  agree  that  Head  Start’s  philosophy  expresses  goals  shared  by  our 
organizations.  That  philosophy  states: 

As  educators,  our  primary  goal  in  the  Head  Start  program  is  to  develop 
socially  competent  children.  A  child  can  benefit  most  from  a  comprehensive 
interdisciplinary  program  to  foster  growth  and  development  and  to  remedy 
problems  as  expressed  through  a  broad  range  of  services.  The  child’s  entire 
family,  as  well  as  the  community,  must  be  involved  in  providing  this  broad  range 
of  services.  Parents  are  the  first  educators  of  their  own  child.  A  child’s  family  is 
perceived  as  the  principal  influence  on  the  child’s  development.  Children  leam 
through  play  using  their  five  senses  (i.e.,  sight,  touch,  smell,  taste,  sound).  The 
program  should  maximize  a  child’s  strengths  and  provide  a  rich  environment  to 
expose  each  child  to  a  variety  of  success-oriented  experiences.  Parent  partici¬ 
pation  is  vital  for  an  individualized  program  for  children  to  succeed.  For  this 
reason,  we  actively  encourage  and  seek  parent  participation  throughout  all  phases 
of  our  delivery  of  Head  Start  services. 

The  mission  of  Rockford  Public  Library  is  to  inform,  educate,  entertain,  and 
provide  cultural  enrichment  to  people  of  all  ages  throughout  its  service  area.  The 
Library  must  educate  the  community  in  the  value  and  use  of  its  resources. 

Discovery  Center  is  a  participatory  museum  created  to  provide  hands-on 
learning  experiences  for  visitors  of  all  ages.  Our  exhibits  and  programs  provide  an 
enriching,  challenging,  and  fun  environment  designed  to  stimulate  curiosity  and  to 
promote  interest  in  the  arts  and  sciences. 

Rockford  Public  Library,  Discovery  Center  Museum,  and  the  city  of  Rockford 
Head  Start  will  actively  develop  and  implement  services  with  the  following  out¬ 
comes  in  sight: 

1 .  Families  use  library  and  museum  facilities  and  services  independently  for  rec¬ 
reation  and  information. 

a.  Children  and  families  see  that  literature  is  relevant  and  can  increase  their 
quality  of  life.

b.  Parents  interact  with  their  children  playfully  and  with  curiosity,  under¬ 
standing  that  play  is  the  best  way  for  children  to  grow  physically,  intel¬ 
lectually,  socially,  and  emotionally. 

To  effect  this  outcome,  Rockford  Public  Library,  Discovery  Center  Museum, 
and  the  city  of  Rockford  Head  Start  will  work  together  to  accomplish  the  follow¬ 
ing  goals: 

1 .  At  every  opportunity,  all  staff  members  invite  and  encourage  families  to  use 
the  library  and  museum. 

2.  Families  and  library  and  museum  staff  members  know  how  to  use  the  library 
and  museum  for  fun  and  work. 

3.  Family  members  accompany  children  on  field  trips  to  the  library  and  museum. 

4.  Teachers  and  library  and  museum  staff  members  know  how  to  share  the 
library  and  museum  environments  with  children  and  families  during  field 
trips. 

5.  Teachers  and  library  staff  members  encourage  children  to  enjoy  library 
materials. 

6.  Teachers  are  involved  in  the  selection  of  science  topics  presented  by  the 
museum  staff. 

7.  Teachers  use  in  their  classroom  library  materials  that  relate  to  museum  visits, 
and  call  attention  to  their  use. 

8.  Teachers  and  museum  staff  members  inform  the  library  of  the  materials  they 
need  that  the  library  does  not  currently  own.  The  library  acquires  all  such 
material  that  conforms  to  its  collection  development  policy. 

9.  The  partnership  team  identifies  barriers  of  perception  in  families,  teachers, 
and  museum  staff  members  that  keep  them  from  fully  enjoying  and  using  the 
library. 

10.  The  partnership  team  identifies  barriers  of  perception  in  families,  teachers, 
and  library  staff  members  that  keep  them  from  fully  enjoying  and  using  the 
museum. 

1 1 .  The  partnership  team  identifies  barriers  of  perception  in  library  and  museum 
staff  members  that  keep  them  from  accommodating  and  fully  serving  families, 
teachers,  and  each  other.

12.  Library,  museum,  and  Head  Start  staff  members  encourage  families  to  get  in¬ 
volved  in  programs  as  a  way  of  introducing  opportunities  for  volunteering  as  a 
means  to  future  employment. 

13.  The  partnership  team  continuously  evaluates  and  revises  the  program 
components. 

(See  Appendix  C  for  the  proposal  developed  for  a  grant  under  the  Museum 
and  Library  Services’  Museum  Leadership  Initiative.  The  grant  application  was 
submitted  in  1998,  and  the  requested  funds  have  been  granted  for  the  fiscal  year, 
beginning  October  1,  1998,  through  September  30,  1999.  It  demonstrates  a  further 
step  in  developing  and  funding  a  Library-Museum-Head  Start  Partnership 
project.)

Examples  of  Head  Start  and  Early  Childhood 
Programs  Carried  on  by  Libraries  and  Museums 


There  is  nothing  new  under  the  sun.  There  are  programs  scattered  throughout 
the  country  that  demonstrate  relationships  between  and  among  Head  Start,  other 
early  childhood  programs,  libraries,  and  museums.  On  the  following  pages,  we 
offer  you  a  selection  of  those  programs  because  they  may  be  ones  you  can  repli¬ 
cate  or  refine  to  fit  your  Head  Start  needs.  For  further  information  about  the  pro¬ 
grams  described,  you  may  want  to  contact  the  libraries,  museums,  or  Head  Start 
agencies  involved  in  a  particular  program. 


SAMPLE 

Early  Childhood  Education  Collaboration 

Purpose:  Shared  mutual  interest  in  encouraging  and  celebrating  read¬ 

ing  and  family  literacy. 

•  To  assist  Head  Start  teachers  to  strengthen  their  curric¬ 
ulum  so  children  enter  school  ready  to  read  and  learn 

•  To  maximize  parental  support  and  participation  in  read¬ 
ing  readiness 

•  To  provide  innovative,  child-focused  activities  that  are  fun 
and  educational  so  children  will  read  throughout  their  lives 

•  To  enrich  partner  organizations  through  active  participa¬ 
tion  of  Head  Start  families  in  planning  programs 

•  To  increase  Head  Start  families’  exposure  to  the  Saint 
Paul  Public  Library  and  Children’s  Museum 

Major  partners:  Minnesota  Children’s  Museum,  Ramsey  Action  Program 

Head  Start  (RAP),  Saint  Paul  Public  Library 

Time  period:  The  collaboration  started  at  a  conference  that  was  in  April  1995 

and  was  sponsored  by  the  Minnesota  Center  for  the  Book. 
There  had  been  informal  relationships  among  the  three,  but  this 
conference  formalized  it  and  gave  everyone  a  real  boost.

Administration  of  the  partnership  is  spelled  out  in  a  written 
agreement  that  the  parties  have  developed  and  are  ready  to 
sign.  Activities  of  the  partnership  are  spelled  out  there  and 
range  from  developing  curriculum  and  staff  training  plans  to 
parent  involvement  plans,  transportation  arrangements,  fund¬ 
raising,  and  announcements  of  job  openings  across  partner 
organizations. 

•  A  curriculum  supplement  that  was  jointly  developed  for 
children  3-5  years  old  and  that  focuses  on  museum 
themes  and  uses  library  resources 

•  A  teacher  and  staff  training  plan,  jointly  developed,  to  in¬ 
crease  skill  in  choosing  and  reading  books 

•  A  joint  plan  with  the  RAP  (Head  Start)  Policy  Council  to 
involve  parents  in  supporting  their  children’s  reading,  in¬ 
cluding  distribution  of  library  card  and  museum  member¬ 
ship  applications 

•  Free  participation  with  materials  and  personnel  in  pres¬ 
entations  at  the  other  parties’  presentations 

•  Library-provided  group  card  and  loan  materials 

While  there  has  not  been  a  final  determination  of  evaluation 
and  measurement,  certain  measures  are  already  available  in¬ 
cluding  the  number  of  visits  to  the  Library  by  Head  Start 
groups.  The  visits  have  increased.  The  Children’s  Museum  is 
tracking  the  numbers  of  library  card  applications  that  are 
filled  out  at  the  Museum. 

Commitment  of  the  partners  as  well  as  the  support  at  an  ad¬ 
ministrative  level  will  allow  quality  planning  to  take  shape. 
There  are  no  financial  incentives  other  than  saving  through  a 
better  sharing  of  resources. 

Information  was  shared  at  the  annual  Head  Start  Conference 
at  District  5  and  at  the  Association  of  Youth  Museums  An¬ 
nual  Conference.  On  an  informal  basis,  as  opportunities  arise, 
we  are  sharing  what  we  are  doing  with  others  in  the  library 
community.

Bookfriend  Program 

The  Bookfriend  Program  attempts  to  fulfill  the  Education  2000  goal  that  all 
children  begin  school  ready  to  learn  to  read  by  the  year  2000.  Every  2  weeks  the 
Bookfriend  Program  brings  the  Library  to  children  in  small,  in-home  daycare. 
Volunteers  make  a  trip  to  the  Library  every  2  weeks  to  select  and  check  out  books 
for  their  assigned  in-home  daycare.  The  volunteer  then  visits  the  daycare  home 
and  spends  about  an  hour  with  the  children,  reading  and  telling  stories.  The  vol¬ 
unteer  leaves  the  books  with  the  childcare  provider,  so  the  children  have  new 
books  to  enjoy  until  the  volunteer  returns.  The  program  also  provides  “birthday 
books”  for  the  children.  The  birthday  books  are  selected  by  the  volunteer  and 
given  to  each  child  to  take  home  and  keep.  The  goal  is  for  the  child  to  take  the 
book  home  and  for  the  parents  to  spend  time  reading  with  the  child.

Project  Leap 

The  Library’s  Educational  Alternative  for  Preschoolers 
Cuyahoga  County  Public  Library 


Project  LEAP  (The  Library’s  Educational  Alternative  for  Preschoolers)  is 
Cuyahoga  County  Public  Library’s  response  to  the  need  for  quality  literature  in 
the  childcare  setting.  Through  the  project,  1,000  storytime  kits,  80  puppet  shows, 
and  a  300-title  model  library  have  been  created.  All  of  the  materials  are  designed 
to  stimulate  reading  readiness  and  cognitive  skills  in  children  through  age  5,  and 
there  is  a  strong  emphasis  on  the  inclusion  of  materials  that  depict  all  cultures. 

Each  storytime  kit  contains  eight  books,  a  music  cassette,  an  object  such  as  a 
toy  or  puppet,  and  an  activity  sheet  that  includes  fingerplays  and  suggestions  for 
child  interaction  with  the  materials.  The  storytime  kits  are  thematic  with  topics 
covering  200  different  themes  such  as  these: 


ABC 

• 

Exploring 

• 

Moving 

Art 

• 

The  Farmer 

• 

Noses 

Babies 

• 

Grandparents 

•

Cooking 

•

• 

Siblings 

Dreams 

•

Environment 

• 

Mother  Goose 

• 

Working  Mothers 

The  puppet  shows  include  puppets,  props,  a  written  script,  and  a  recorded  script 
on  tape.  The  storytime  kits  and  puppet  shows  are  reserved  through  the  Audiovis¬ 
ual  and  Booking  Services  Department  of  the  Cuyahoga  County  Public  Library. 
They  circulate  for  1  week,  and  patrons  may  pick  them  up  at  the  branch  library  of 
their  choice. 

In  addition  to  the  storytime  kits  and  puppet  shows,  workshops  are  conducted 
for  child-care  providers,  parents,  and  librarians.  These  workshops  are  intended  to 


226 


Examples  of  Head  Start  and  Early  Childhood  Programs 


provide  information  that  will  enable  care  providers  to  make  the  best  possible  use 
of  the  Project  LEAP  materials,  to  assist  them  in  recognizing  developmental  levels 
of  the  preschooler,  and  to  provide  information  and  ideas  that  will  provide  enrich¬ 
ment  when  sharing  literature  with  children.  Topics  of  past  workshops  have  in¬ 
cluded  visual  perception  and  memory  in  infants,  puppetry,  storytelling,  music  and 
movement,  nonfiction  books,  storytime  ideas,  toys  and  play,  building  cooperation 
skills,  communication  development  and  enhancement,  and  audiovisual  materials 
for  preschoolers.  Two  to  four  workshops  are  presented  each  year,  and  in-service 
credit  is  provided  for  workshop  participants. 

A  librarian  qualified  in  children’s  literature  and  in  early  childhood  develop¬ 
ment  acts  as  a  resource  person  for  childcare  providers,  early  childhood  educators, 
parents,  and  librarians.  The  project  librarian  creates  the  kits;  selects  the  materials; 
writes  activity  sheets,  bibliographies,  and  newsletters;  conducts  staff  training  vis¬ 
its  at  care  centers;  arranges  workshops;  and  corresponds  with  individuals  and  li¬ 
braries  requesting  information  about  Project  LEAP.  Other  groups  to  which  the 
librarian  makes  presentations  include  university  and  college  students,  Head  Start 
teachers,  preschool  PTAs,  job  training  classes,  parenting  classes,  and  county  ex¬ 
tension  agencies.  Recently,  a  session  was  conducted  for  Spanish  home-care  pro¬ 
viders  at  which  the  entire  presentation  was  translated  into  Spanish  by  an 
interpreter. 

Project  LEAP  materials  began  to  circulate  in  June  1988.  During  the  first  year 
of  circulation,  766  storytime  kits  and  puppet  shows  were  circulated  with  an  atten¬ 
dance  of  25,523  children.  By  1993  circulation  had  increased  to  8,806  storytime 
kits  and  puppet  shows  being  shared  with  273,616  children.  Since  the  materials 
began  to  circulate  in  1988,  more  than  1  million  children  have  enjoyed  the  books, 
cassettes,  realia,  and  puppet  shows  that  are  a  part  of  Project  LEAP. 

Funding  for  the  first  3  years  of  Project  LEAP  was  through  a  $234,996  LSCA 
(Library  Services  and  Construction  Act)  Title  I  grant  and  Cuyahoga  County  Pub¬ 
lic  Library.  Since  1990,  Project  LEAP  has  been  entirely  funded  by  Cuyahoga 
County  Public  Library.  Project  LEAP  continues  to  be  a  vital  service  that  enables 
care  providers,  parents,  teachers,  and  librarians  to  share  all  the  wonder  and  joy  of 
delightful  books  with  preschool  children.

Head  Start  Book  Giveaway,  1993-1994 

The  Mesa  County  Public  Library  District  offered  “Open  the  World  of  Books” 
packets  to  the  Mesa  County  Head  Start  families  over  the  holidays.  The  library 
district  used  monies  donated  by  the  community  for  this  project.  To  encourage 
families  to  use  their  library’s  services  and  materials,  the  program  offered  open 
houses  at  the  main  library  and  branches  during  December  1993  and  January  1994. 
At  these  open  houses,  children  heard  stories  and  parents  learned  more  about  the 
library’s  collection  and  services  for  jobs,  about  GED,  about  how  to  write  grants, 
and  about  other  information.  Parents  also  registered  for  library  cards  and  learned 
the  library’s  layout  for  future  use. 

Children  got  to  hear  stories  and  receive  a  bookbag  packet.  Each  Head  Start 
child  was  given  a  packet  of  materials.  Packets  included  library  card  applications, 
information  on  the  Adult  Reading  Program,  a  poster  “Join  the  Read- Aloud 
Crowd,”  and  a  free  book.  Those  families  who  speak  only  Spanish,  received  a 
Spanish-language  “Magic  School  Bus  Inside  the  Earth.”  The  Friends  of  the  Mesa 
County  Public  Library  District  donated  bookbags  to  hold  all  of  these  materials. 

The  project  was  an  overwhelming  success,  thanks  to  the  enthusiasm  and  gen¬ 
erous  support  of  the  Head  Start  Parent  Involvement  Coordinator.  She  gave  per¬ 
sonal  tours  of  the  reference  and  foreign  language  section  to  parents.  In  total,  over 
200  Head  Start  family  members  attended  open  houses  at  the  main  library  and  its 
branches.  Many  families  had  never  been  to  the  library  before.  A  mother  who  lived 
within  three  blocks  of  the  main  library  did  not  bring  her  two  children  to  the  li¬ 
brary  until  this  open  house.  Now  she  says  she’ll  come  back  regularly.  Many  of 
these  families  are  returning  to  their  library. 

To  follow  up  with  offerings,  bilingual  students  at  Redlands  Middle  School 
will  be  giving  personal  tours  of  the  main  library  to  their  families  on  Tuesday,  May 
17.  Also,  the  Friends  organization  is  forming  a  coalition  with  the  Spanish  com¬ 
munity  to  celebrate  “Cinco  de  Mayo.”

Kidsmobile  Services  to  Head  Start  Classes 

The  Pikes  Peak  Library  District  has  operated  “Kidsmobile”  service  to  Head 
Start  sites  in  Colorado  Springs  for  more  than  15  years.  Originally,  this  service  op¬ 
erated  from  a  small  bookmobile  that  allowed  check  out  of  books  from  each  stop. 

When  that  vehicle  needed  replacement,  the  library  district  analyzed  the  serv¬ 
ice  and  decided  to  replace  the  Kidsmobile  with  a  van.  Although  this  change  un¬ 
fortunately  eliminated  the  check-out  opportunity,  it  did  allow  us  to  meet  a  grow¬ 
ing  demand.  We  were  also  able  to  return  to  monthly  visits,  rather  than  every  6 
weeks. 

Now  the  Kidsmobile  van  from  the  Pikes  Peak  Library  District  serves  66  Head 
Start  classes  this  year.  These  classes  have  an  average  of  15  to  17  students.  Each 
site  is  visited  once  a  month  starting  in  mid-September  and  ending  in  mid-May.  On 
the  average,  the  Kidsmobile  specialist  sees  about  1,120  children  a  month.  Each 
program  is  20  to  25  minutes  long,  and  she  averages  four  to  five  children  programs 
per  day. 

The  Kidsmobile  specialist  includes  at  least  three  books  along  with  fingerplays, 
puppets,  props,  flannel  boards,  and  other  visuals.  She  informs  the  classes  of  any 
library  events  that  are  of  interest  to  their  age  group  or  of  programs  their  parents 
would  enjoy.  She  also  sends  the  children  home  with  our  publication,  “Check  It 
Out,”  which  is  a  very  comprehensive  listing  of  adult  programs,  literacy  programs, 
storytimes  and  locations,  branch  locations,  and  hours  of  operation. 

The  Kidsmobile  staff  also  does  a  presentation  to  parents  of  the  Head  Start 
children.  In  this  presentation,  she  informs  the  parents  of  various  library  programs, 
activities,  and  resources  that  the  library  has  to  offer.  She  talks  about  the  impor¬ 
tance  of  reading  and  how  parents  can  select  books  for  their  children.  This  presen¬ 
tation  is  generally  scheduled  once  a  month.

Evaluation  Study  Report 


The  Children’s  Readmobile:  Program  Description 


The  Children’s 
Readmobile  is 
designed  (1)  to 
bring  library 
resources  and 
services  to  chil¬ 
dren  in  childcare 
homes  and  agen¬ 
cies  in  Hennepin 
County  and  (2)  to 
promote  reading 
in  family  and 
childcare 
settings. 


The  Children’s 
Readmobile  cur¬ 
rently  serves 
about  1,000  chil¬ 
dren  and  400 
adults  monthly, 
in  both  licensed 
contract  child¬ 
care  homes  and 
social  agencies. 


The  Children’s  Readmobile,  an  innovative  outreach  program 
of  the  Hennepin  County  Library  System,  was  launched  in  May 
1991.  Designed  to  bring  library  resources  and  services  to  pre¬ 
school  children  in  childcare  homes  and  agencies  throughout  the 
county,  the  Readmobile  is  a  25-foot-long  vehicle  containing 
2,500  books  at  one  time,  37  periodical  subscriptions,  and  more 
than  200  book-cassette  sets.  The  Readmobile,  however,  is  more 
than  a  roving  library.  Of  equal  importance,  it  provides  an  inviting 
and  stimulating  setting  that  encourages  hands-on  access  to  library 
materials,  and  it  provides  interactive,  experiential  learning  activi¬ 
ties  for  preschool  children  led  by  a  trained  library  staff.  Further¬ 
more,  the  Readmobile  staff  seeks  to  enhance  the  interest,  com¬ 
mitment,  and  skill  of  parents  and  childcare  providers  to 
encourage  and  promote  reading  in  family  and  childcare  settings. 
The  Children’s  Readmobile,  then,  is  an  organic  blend  of  library 
resources,  experiential  learning  for  preschool  children,  trained 
staff  members,  and  education  for  parents  and  childcare 
providers — all  made  accessible  by  regularly  scheduled  visits  to 
preschool  settings. 

During  1991-1992,  the  Children’s  Readmobile  itinerary  in¬ 
cluded  8 1  licensed  contract  childcare  homes  and  8  publicly  sup¬ 
ported  agencies  that  provide  childcare  and  family  services. 
Among  them  were  the  following: 

•  Even  Start,  a  family  literacy  program  that  is  in  Crystal, 
Minnesota.  The  program  is  funded  by  a  Chapter  I  grant  from 
the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  and  is  administered 
through  the  Robbinsdale  School  District. 

•  Early  Childhood  Family  Education  (ECFE)  programs  serving 
parents  with  children  between  the  ages  of  birth  and  kinder¬ 
garten.  These  programs  are  funded  with  a  combined  local 
levy  and  state  aid  formula  and  are  conducted  through  partici¬ 
pating  school  districts. 


230 


Examples  of  Head  Start  and  Early  Childhood  Programs 


•  Early  Childhood  Special  Education  (ECSE)  programs  that 
offer  specially  designed  instruction  to  meet  the  unique  needs 
of  children  under  age  7  who  have  disabilities.  The  programs 
are  administered  through  the  Osseo  School  District. 

•  Women,  Infants,  and  Children  (WIC),  a  federally  funded  pro¬ 
gram  that  provides  supplemental  food  and  nutrition  counsel¬ 
ing  for  families  who  meet  income  guidelines  and  have  nutri¬ 
tion-related  health  problems.  The  program  is  administered 
through  Hennepin  County. 

•  Receptive  Environments  Affective  Learning  (REAL),  a  pro¬ 
gram  for  families  whose  preschool  children,  from  birth 
through  age  6,  are  experiencing  stress,  crisis,  abuse,  neglect, 
or  difficulty  in  parent-child  relationships.  The  program  is 
funded  by  Hennepin  County. 

•  Five’s  Alive,  a  preschool  program  offered  through  the 
Robbinsdale  School  District  that  prepares  children  for  kinder¬ 
garten.  Children  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  need  and  are  pro¬ 
vided  free  transportation. 

In  summary,  the  Children’s  Readmobile  currently  reaches 
about  1 ,000  children,  mostly  preschool,  and  400  adults  monthly. 
At  present,  two  library  assistants  and  one  library  clerk,  working  a 
total  of  64  hours  per  week  and  supervised  by  a  senior  librarian, 
serve  as  the  staff  for  the  Readmobile.  The  Readmobile  travels  to 
approximately  eight  sites  per  day  within  Hennepin  County.  Each 
of  the  contract  childcare  homes  is  visited  once  a  month.  Most 
agencies  receive  two  visits  per  month.  Typically,  each  Readmo¬ 
bile  visit  to  the  childcare  home  is  30  minutes.  Each  agency  visit  is 
approximately  60  minutes.

SAMPLE 
Babywise  and  Beyond 
Nassau  Library  System 

The  following  summarizes  a  presentation  given  by  Caroline  Ward,  Youth 
Services  Coordinator,  Nassau  Library  System,  at  the  School  Readiness  Institute 
sponsored  by  the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin,  May  27-June  1,  1994. 

In  1987,  the  New  York  State  Library  made  available  LSCA  Title  I  funds  for 
broad-based  family  literacy  programs.  Of  New  York’s  23  library  systems,  17  re¬ 
ceived  $50,000  each  for  these  “Family  Reading”  grants.  The  Nassau  Library 
System’s  proposal  called  “Babywise”  was  directed  toward  economically  at-risk 
families  in  six  communities.  While  Nassau  County’s  population  of  1.3  million  is 
predominantly  white  (82  percent)  and  most  suburban  libraries  provide  excellent 
library  service,  in  our  demographic  research  we  quickly  discovered  that  the  ethnic 
and  economic  make-up  of  the  county  was  changing.  Certain  communities  had 
great  potential  and  need  for  a  concentrated  outreach  effort.  In  the  six  communities 
selected  for  the  program,  at  least  7  percent  of  the  population  was  at  or  below  the 
poverty  level. 

Babywise  used  a  combination  of  outreach  workshops,  contacts  with  commu¬ 
nity  agencies,  and  distribution  of  “Welcome  Baby”  packets  to  introduce  parents  to 
the  joy  of  reading  and  the  resources  of  the  public  library.  The  project  was  funded 
for  3  years.  While  the  essential  elements  of  the  grant  remained  constant,  we  ad¬ 
justed  and  expanded  our  objectives  each  year  as  a  result  of  our  experiences  and 
responses.  In  the  first  year,  we  focused  on  teen  parents  and  parents  with  children 
under  age  2.  In  subsequent  years,  we  expanded  to  include  all  preschool  children 
under  age  5  and  their  parents.  In  the  second  year,  we  placed  special  emphasis  on 
reaching  out  to  the  Hispanic  population  in  Nassau  County.  We  initially  contacted 
25  agencies  in  our  six  targeted  communities.  By  the  third  year,  13  Babywise  li¬ 
braries  were  part  of  the  program,  working  with  more  than  60  community 
agencies. 

The  grant  made  it  possible  for  us  to  hire  an  essential  resource:  a  project  coor¬ 
dinator.  The  coordinator  worked  closely  with  the  local  librarians,  training  them  in 
outreach  techniques  and  encouraging  them  to  keep  up  their  community  contacts. 
In  addition  she  prepared  materials  used  in  the  workshops  and  in  the  giveaway 
packets.  Our  coordinator  did  not  speak  Spanish,  but  the  grant  allowed  us  to  hire  a 
translator;  in  our  health  clinic  visits,  we  always  brought  along  a  native  Spanish 
speaker.

In  the  first  year,  1,400  Welcome  Baby  packets  were  distributed  through  agen¬ 
cies,  at  libraries,  and  at  programs.  The  packet  included  a  booklet,  “Best 
Beginnings — You,  Your  Baby,  and  Books,”  which  discussed  the  pleasure  and 
values  of  parent  and  child  interaction  through  books,  songs,  and  nursery  rhymes. 

A  special  effort  was  made  to  keep  information  in  the  booklet  clear  and  simple  for 
the  targeted  audience.  “Best  Beginnings”  was  translated  into  Spanish,  and  each 
package  contained  a  library  card  application.  Each  year  more  items  were  added  to 
the  packet:  “A  Special  Invitation  to  the  Library”;  a  bookmark;  Books  Make  Babies 
Grow,  and  a  pamphlet  describing  the  values  of  reading  aloud,  “Can  You  Guess 
These  Reading  Riddles?”  Each  packet  also  contained  a  complimentary  picture 
book;  funds  for  those  books  were  acquired  through  grants  from  businesses 
(mostly  banks)  and  were  further  enhanced  by  matching  funds  from  “Reading  Is 
Fundamental.” 

In  conjunction  with  distributing  the  packets,  “Rock,  Rattle,  and  Read”  pro¬ 
grams  were  held  in  numerous  daycare  centers,  in  teen  parenting  programs,  at 
health  satellite  clinics,  and  even  at  the  county  correctional  facility — wherever  we 
found  parents,  caregivers,  and  children.  Flexibility  was  the  operative  word  at  the 
programs,  particularly  the  ones  with  teen  parents.  Here  experience  demonstrated 
that  an  informal  one-on-one  approach  worked  best.  These  young  people  were  ob¬ 
viously  tired  of  having  adults  tell  them  what  to  do,  and  so  we  stressed  audience 
involvement,  thereby  encouraging  the  teens  to  respond  to  the  librarians  about  the 
books.  In  the  first  year  alone,  80  teen  parents  were  contacted;  one  young  mother 
has  since  become  a  regular  patron  at  the  Elmont  Library. 

Surprisingly,  the  audience  that  welcomed  us  with  the  most  enthusiasm  was  the 
group  at  the  woman’s  division  of  the  Nassau  County  Correctional  Facility. 

Women  are  allowed  to  keep  their  babies  for  up  to  6  months;  it’s  a  particularly 
dismal  place  with  few  activities  to  occupy  the  women.  On  our  first  visit  after  the 
local  librarian  read  Faith  Ringgold’s  Tar  Beach ,  the  women  (babies  and  all)  arose 
and  gave  the  librarian  a  standing  ovation. 

In  the  second  year  of  the  grant,  we  launched  a  successful  partnership  with  the 
nine  Head  Start  sites  in  Nassau  County.  The  county  coordinator  arranged  for  us  to 
speak  with  the  nine  program  directors.  Then  each  Babywise  library  contacted 
their  local  Head  Start  and  held  a  program  for  Head  Start  parents.  Because  Head 
Start  encourages  parents  to  attend  regularly  scheduled  meetings  as  a  means  for 
improving  their  parenting  skills,  these  meetings  are  ideal  settings  for  librarians  to 
meet  parents  who  may  not  be  regular  library  patrons.  At  the  parenting  meetings, 
librarians  discussed  the  value  and  pleasures  of  reading  aloud  with  young  children. 
The  librarians  presented  a  sampling  of  picture  books  and  other  materials  and 
services  available  for  preschool  children  at  the  public  library.  We  were  able  to 
give  extra  children’s  books  to  each  Head  Start  school  site  with  special  Reading  Is

Fundamental  (RIF)  monies.  Here  we  involved  the  parents  in  selecting  the  books 
in  consultation  with  the  project  coordinator. 

Our  attempts  to  track  exactly  how  many  of  the  families  we  initially  spoke  with 
actually  came  into  the  library  was  difficult  until  we  initiated  a  coupon  for  re¬ 
deeming  a  free  book  at  the  public  library.  The  coupons  had  to  be  “cashed  in”  at 
the  Children’s  Department  so  that  the  librarians  could  give  a  nonthreatening,  per¬ 
sonalized  introduction  to  the  library.  More  than  200  coupons  were  returned. 

The  Babywise  project  was  important  to  the  county  because  it  was  our  first  at¬ 
tempt  to  concentrate  on  outreach  to  economically  at-risk  families,  most  of  whom 
were  not  regular  library  users.  During  our  3  years  of  funding,  we  made  major 
strides  not  only  in  reaching  our  targeted  population,  but  also  in  training  a  cadre  of 
librarians  in  the  importance  of  this  type  of  community  involvement.  The  ultimate 
goal  of  the  Babywise  project  (like  all  LSCA  funding)  was  to  have  the  13  libraries 
continue  the  programs  on  their  own  after  federal  funding  ended. 

To  a  great  extent,  we  have  managed  to  do  this.  The  library  contacts  with  the 
nine  Head  Start  Centers  remain  strong.  The  Manhasset  Public  Library  has  given 
funds  to  start  a  mini-library  at  their  local  Head  Start.  The  local  professional  or¬ 
ganization,  The  Children’s  Division  of  the  Nassau  County  Library  Association, 
adopts  two  preschool  sites  per  year.  Bimonthly  programs  at  these  preschools  are 
conducted,  and  at  least  two  free  books  are  given  to  each  child  in  these  programs. 

The  Nassau  Library  system  continues  to  provide  backup  support  by  providing 
free  books  and  Welcome  Baby  packets  to  any  library  willing  to  do  outreach.  Even 
though  the  grant  funding  ended  3  years  ago,  librarians  report  that  free  book  cou¬ 
pons  are  still  being  redeemed,  and  at  least  10  of  the  13  Babywise  libraries  are  still 
actively  involved  in  outreach  activities.

Child  Care  and  Library  Outreach 

This  childcare  library  outreach  grant  provides  mobile  library  service  to  li¬ 
censed  childcare  centers,  including  Head  Start  centers  in  the  four  counties  served 
by  the  regional  library  system.  Rather  than  kits  that  must  be  booked  or  picked  up 
at  a  library,  children’s  librarians  from  the  public  library  deliver  a  new  storytime 
kit  each  month  by  bookmobile,  van,  or  car.  The  hope  is  that  childcare  providers 
who  do  not  normally  use  the  library,  who  would  not  take  the  initiative  to  go  to  the 
library,  or  who  have  only  a  small  collection  of  books  at  their  center  will  have 
easier  access  to  books  and  materials,  thus  encouraging  more  frequent  literacy  ex¬ 
periences.  The  desire  also  is  to  have  children’s  librarians  establish  rapport  with 
the  childcare  providers,  enabling  them  to  form  a  partnership  to  enhance  pre¬ 
schoolers’  literacy  skills. 

Large  Tupperware™  kits  are  sent  through  a  delivery  system  from  one  library 
system  to  another  at  the  end  of  the  month.  Kits  contain  20  picture  books;  3  board 
books  (for  centers  that  also  serve  younger  children);  one  big  book;  a  flannel  board 
kit;  a  resource  book;  a  musical  cassette;  a  literature-based,  public-performance 
video;  and  a  puppet,  floor  puzzle,  or  other  realia  item.  Kits  are  not  totally  theme 
related  because  each  center  has  a  kit  for  an  entire  month  and  would  not  want  to 
share  books  and  materials  on  the  same  theme  for  an  entire  month.  However,  at 
least  five  or  six  books  are  related  theme-wise  to  the  realia  item  and  video. 

The  regional  library  system’s  role  was  to  write  the  initial  grant  to  secure  funds 
for  the  project  (that  is  totally  funded  now  by  individual  libraries  and  the  regional 
system);  to  order  and  process  materials  for  the  kits;  to  set  up  the  mechanism  for 
kit  delivery  and  rotation;  to  establish  an  advisory  group  to  help  with  the  project;  to 
conduct  evaluations  of  the  project  by  both  member  libraries  and  childcare  sites; 
and  to  provide  an  annual  workshop  for  each  county  on  how  to  share  books,  the  art 
of  storytelling,  literature  extensions,  emergent  literacy  skills,  and  how  to  have  a 
literacy-rich  classroom.

Begin  at  the  Beginning  with  Books 

County  of  Los  Angeles  Public  Library 

Begin  at  the  Beginning  with  Books  is  a  project  funded  by  the  California  State 
Library  under  the  Library  Services  and  Construction  Act. 

The  project’s  goal  is  to  ensure  that  parents  have  the  skills  to  provide  their 
young  children  with  an  intellectual  stimulus,  a  love  for  books,  and  a  healthy  body. 
It  is  to  demonstrate  that  developing  these  skills  in  parents  will  result  in  ongoing 
library  usage  by  parents  and  children.  It  will  serve  to  encourage  literacy  among 
parents  and  their  children. 

Target  Group:  Pregnant  women  who  are  receiving  prenatal  care  in  selected 
prenatal  clinics  of  the  Los  Angeles  County  Department  Health  Services. 

Objectives: 

•  Implementation  of  a  model  training  program  for  use  in  library,  health  care, 
and  social  service  settings  that  will  provide  expectant  parents  with  simple 
“book  sharing”  skills  and  simple  health  and  safety  information. 

•  Implementation  of  model  training  in  eight  health  clinics  and  eight  library  sites. 

•  Support  the  development  of  this  program  in  other  venues  by  providing  techni¬ 
cal  assistance  and  support. 

Participants  in  the  program  are  generally  Hispanic  women  with  low  education 
levels.  The  materials  for  the  program  have  been  designed  to  appeal  specifically  to 
this  target  group.  You  will  note  the  integration  of  Spanish  and  English  text.  The 
Spanish  translation  was  specifically  done  in  the  “familiar”  to  give  the  project  a 
more  intimate,  caring  feeling.

Project:  Read  for  a  Head  Start 
County  of  Los  Angeles  Public  Library 


SAMPLE 


as 


Project:  Read  for  a  Head  Start  is  a  pilot  project  to  be  conducted  by  the  County 
of  Los  Angeles  Public  Library,  the  Los  Angeles  County  Head  Start,  and  the  Latin 
American  Civic  Association  Head  Start. 


Goals: 


A.  To  motivate  Head  Start  students  to  want  to  leam  to  read  by  introducing  them 
to  the  delights  to  be  found  in  books  at  school,  at  home,  and  in  their  public 
library. 

B.  To  encourage  Head  Start  parents  to  share  books  with  their  children  in  the 
home  by  acquainting  them  with  the  importance  of  books  and  reading  and  by 
providing  them  with  simple  skills  and  techniques. 

C.  To  encourage  Head  Start  staff  members  to  incorporate  books  and  stories  into 
their  curriculum  and  to  use  the  public  library  as  a  community  resource. 

Project  Objectives: 

1.  To  share  books  and  stories  with  150  children  on  site  at  St.  Simon’s  Head  Start 
Preschool. 

2.  To  introduce  the  children  to  the  public  library  by  conducting  six  picturebook 
sessions  on  site  at  the  San  Fernando  Library. 

3.  To  conduct  a  parent  training  session  for  25  Head  Start  parents  in  the  San 
Fernando  Library. 

4.  To  conduct  a  teacher  training  session  for  10  members  of  the  St.  Simon  Head 
Start  staff. 

5.  To  conduct  a  Head  Start  Family  Reading  Festival  to  encourage  at  least  75 
children  and  their  families  to  visit  the  library  together  to  share  the  joys  of 
books  and  stories. 

Needs  Statement: 

Research  findings  have  documented  the  fact  that  children  who  are  read  to  will 

leam  to  read  earlier  and  more  easily  than  children  who  are  not  read  to  (Durkin, 


Examples  of  Head  Start  and  Early  Childhood  Programs

1966).  Books  play  a  significant  role  in  the  life  of  the  young  child,  but  the  extent  to 
which  they  do  depends  entirely  on  adults.  It  is  up  to  parents,  teachers,  librarians, 
and  others  to  introduce  young  children  to  the  delights  of  books  and  to  serve  as  a 
catalyst  for  literacy  (Cullinan,  1977). 

Head  Start  is  a  federally  funded  program  that  provides  comprehensive  serv¬ 
ices  including  health,  education,  social  services,  and  parent  involvement  to  poor 
children  and  their  families.  More  than  90  percent  of  all  Head  Start  families  live 
below  the  poverty  line. 

According  to  the  Conditions  of  Children  in  California  (1989),  “Large  and 
growing  proportions  of  California’s  schoolchildren  are  from  backgrounds  fre¬ 
quently  linked  with  low  academic  achievement.  Almost  one-quarter  of  them  are 
from  poor  households  and  one-seventh  are  not  proficient  in  English.” 

The  children  of  the  St.  Simon  Head  Start  Preschool  in  San  Fernando  come 
from  predominately  Spanish-speaking  families  whose  income  is  below  the 
poverty  level. 

The  1990  Customer  Satisfaction  Survey  of  the  County  of  Los  Angeles  Public 
Library  indicates  that  the  average  patron  who  uses  the  county  library  is  “well  edu¬ 
cated,  employed,  affluent,  and  Caucasian.”  This  pilot  project  will  enable  the  li¬ 
brary  to  experiment  with  techniques  to  broaden  its  user  base  to  an  underserved 
segment  of  its  market  area.  It  will  enable  the  library  to  move  forward  in  its  goals 
to  develop  “programs  and  partnerships  to  encourage  significant  adults  in  the  lives 
of  young  people  to  promote  reading  in  the  home”  (County  of  Los  Angeles 
Strategic  Direction  #11,  1990). 

Action  Plan: 

During  the  pilot  period  of  April  1-June  6,  1991,  these  actions  will  occur: 

Staff  members  at  the  San  Fernando  Library  will  visit  St.  Simon’s  Head  Start  Pre¬ 
school  to  conduct  a  series  of  storytelling  sessions  in  the  six  participating  classes. 
They  will  introduce  children  to  books,  stories,  and  songs  and  will  introduce  the 
children  to  the  concept  of  “the  public  library.” 

1 .  Students  from  the  six  Head  Start  classes  will  attend  special  storytelling  and 
picturebook  sessions  to  be  conducted  at  the  San  Fernando  Library.  Children 
will  be  introduced  to  the  library  and  to  the  variety  of  books  that  are  there  for 
them  to  enjoy.  Children  will  have  an  opportunity  to  browse  through  picture 
books.

Examples  of  Head  Start  and  Early  Childhood  Programs 


2.  Library  staff  members  will  conduct  a  parent  training  session  (for  approxi¬ 
mately  25  parents)  as  part  of  the  St.  Simon’s  Parent  Involvement  Program.  It 
will  be  conducted  at  the  San  Fernando  Library,  and  the  staff  will  share  stories; 
techniques  for  reading  to  children;  and  simple  songs,  games,  and  crafts.  Li¬ 
brary  staff  members  will  share  techniques  for  expanding  the  television  view¬ 
ing  experience  to  include  books.  Parents  will  also  be  introduced  to  the  Library 
Adult  Literacy  Program. 

3.  Library  staff  members  will  conduct  a  training  session  for  Head  Start  teachers 
and  classroom  aides  at  the  San  Fernando  Library.  They  will  be  introduced  to 
the  broad  range  of  library  materials  available  to  them  to  supplement  their 
classroom  activities  and  will  be  encouraged  to  seek  the  support  and  assistance 
of  the  public  library  staff  as  a  community  resource. 

4.  The  program  will  culminate  with  a  Family  Reading  Festival  where  the  Head 
Start  children,  their  parents,  siblings,  and  teachers  will  be  invited  to  visit  the 
San  Fernando  Library  for  an  evening  event.  Dessert  will  be  provided.  Families 
will  tour  the  library  and  will  enjoy  a  performance  by  J.  P.  Nightingale,  musi¬ 
cal  storytellers.  Each  family  will  be  encouraged  to  sign  up  for  library  cards. 
Handouts  and  reading  incentives  will  be  provided. 

The  library  staff  will  be  sure  that  all  parent  and  child  activities  have  a 
Spanish-language  component. 

News  releases  will  be  sent  to  local,  county,  and  national  media. 

Budget: 

All  basic  resources  will  come  from  existing  staff  and  materials.

Incentives:

Evaluation: 

Library  staff  members  will  evaluate  the  success  of  the  program  based  on  the 
number  of  persons  who  attend  the  voluntary  activities:  workshops  and  family¬ 
reading  festival.  We  will  keep  track  of  the  number  of  library  cards  that  the  par¬ 
ticipants  receive.  Library  staff  members  will  also  issue  a  special  “Head  Start  in¬ 
centive”  (i.e.,  teddy  bear  name  tag  or  membership  card),  which  children  will  be 
encouraged  to  bring  with  them  when  they  return  to  the  library.  Each  time  the  child 
visits,  the  incentive  will  be  marked.  If  the  child  returns  to  the  library  two  times  or 
more  during  the  summer  months,  that  child  will  receive  a  special  Head  Start 
reader  certificate.  The  number  of  certificates  issued  will  measure  the  on-going 
effectiveness  of  the  project. 

Follow-up: 

We  expect  the  pilot  to  result  in  closer  communication  and  cooperation  be¬ 
tween  the  San  Fernando  Library  and  the  St.  Simon  Head  Start  and  to  result  in  on¬ 
going  cooperation.  More  important,  however,  we  hope  that  the  program  will  be¬ 
come  a  model  for  cooperation  among  county  libraries  and  Head  Start  providers 
throughout  Los  Angeles  County.

Literacy  Volunteers  of  America-Northern  Rhode  Island 
with  Libraries  and  Head  Start 

For  the  past  2  years,  Literacy  Volunteers  of  America-Northern  Rhode  Island 
(LVA-NRI),  Woonsocket  Head  Start  Child  Development  Association  Inc. 
(WHSCDA),  and  the  Woonsocket  Harris  Public  Library  (WHPL)  have  provided 
an  intergenerational  literacy  program  to  parents  and  children  enrolled  in 
WHSCDA’ s  Head  Start  Program. 

The  program,  titled  the  Family  Reading  Program,  includes  a  full  day  of  parent 
education  that  specifically  focuses  on  literacy  and  uses  children’s  literature.  Ad¬ 
ditionally,  high  school  equivalency  preparation  classes  are  provided,  as  well  as 
individual  tutoring  and  the  opportunity  to  develop  pre-employment  skills. 

The  project  also  established  an  on-site  lending  library  in  the  larger  of  the  two 
Head  Start  centers.  Through  this  project,  space  was  renovated  and  the  WHPL  cre¬ 
ated  a  circulating  library.  Head  Start  parents  were  trained  and  assisted  in  devel¬ 
oping  a  library  filing  and  card  cataloging  system.  This  resulted  in  creation  of  a 
valuable  resource  that  is  used  by  children,  parents,  and  staff  of  the  entire  agency. 
This  library  is  stocked  with  copies  of  the  books  and  materials  from  the  Family 
Reading  Program  curriculum,  a  collection  of  more  than  300  books  on  long-term 
loan  from  the  WHPL  and  from  a  significant  memorial  donation. 

The  following  describes  a  sample  of  the  program: 

Parents  and  children  arrive  at  Head  Start  together  at  9:00  a.m.  While  the  chil¬ 
dren  are  in  their  preschool  classroom,  parents  participate  in  the  Family  Reading 
Program.  Parents  spend  1  hour  with  the  Literacy  Specialist  as  they  learn  strategies 
to  use  when  reading  to  their  children.  These  strategies  also  transfer  to  their  own 
GED  preparation.  The  model  for  the  project  is  “The  Family  Reading  Program,” 
published  by  New  Readers  Press.  Children’s  literature  is  used  to  enhance  interest 
in  reading,  and  to  develop  literacy  skills  necessary  to  successfully  participate  in 
additional  educational  activities  for  both  parents  and  children  alike.  When  parents 
have  completed  their  portion  of  the  program,  their  children  join  them  for  a  crea¬ 
tive  activity  based  on  that  particular  session’s  book.  Before  the  creative  activity, 
the  book  is  read  to  both  parents  and  children,  so  that  time  together  not  only  is  en¬ 
joyable,  but  also  serves  to  reinforce  strategies  that  parents  have  worked  on  in  their 
sessions. 

Participants  are  given  all  of  the  children’s  materials  used  in  the  session:  a  total 
of  10  children’s  books.  Our  goal  is  that  this  literature  will  then  become  the  basis

of  each  family’s  own  private  library.  Parents  will  have  easy  access  to  books  that 
are  right  in  their  own  homes  and  are  suitable  for  use  with  their  children. 

Parents  then  participate  in  2  hours  of  additional  literacy  activities  that  are 
based  on  the  results  of  their  educational  assessment.  These  activities  include  indi¬ 
vidual  tutoring  for  parents  with  lower  literacy  skills,  GED  preparation  for  those 
interested  in  obtaining  a  high  school  equivalency,  or  employability  development 
activities.  Parents  complete  the  day  at  1 :00  p.m.  and  leave  the  center  with  their 
child. 

All  Head  Start  children  benefit  from  this  project.  The  children’s  librarian  from 
the  WHPL  conducts  a  storytime  in  all  the  Head  Start  classrooms,  using  a  variety 
of  materials,  as  well  as  the  children’s  literature  recommended  in  the  Family 
Reading  Program  curriculum.  The  collaborative  efforts  among  the  participating 
agencies  demonstrate  an  innovative  approach  to  solving  the  problem  of 
intergenerational  illiteracy.  The  evaluation  process  of  this  program  has  shown 
measurable  results. 

The  focus  of  the  project,  which  uses  children’s  literature,  fosters  the  child’s 
connection  with  books.  In  a  program  such  as  this,  children  become  eager  to  learn 
as  they  see  that  learning  is  something  their  parents  value.  In  addition,  the  child’s 
enthusiasm  motivates  the  parents  further,  and  the  parent  and  child  relationship 
becomes  a  partnership  for  success. 

Head  Start  centers  are  conveniently  located  and  well  known  in  the  commu¬ 
nity.  By  eliminating  the  obstacles  that  prevent  participation  because  of  a  lack  of 
transportation  and  child  care,  parents  can  easily  gain  access  to  the  Family  Literacy 
Program  and  can  benefit  from  the  services  provided.

The  Family  Reading  Project 
Central  Vermont  Head  Start 

One  of  the  requests  of  the  1989-1990  Policy  Council  was  to  address  literacy 
needs  of  parents  participating  in  the  Head  Start.  One  particular  Policy  Council 
member  wanted  to  see  parents  get  books  just  like  those  received  by  the  children 
experienced  with  the  Reading  Is  Fundamental  (RTF)  project.  Sarah  Mehegan,  family 
services  coordinator,  consulted  with  Mary  Leahy,  coordinator  of  Central  Vermont 
Adult  Basic  Education,  to  see  what  was  available  to  address  literacy  needs.  Ms. 
Leahy  suggested  introducing  our  parents  to  the  possibility  of  participating  in  a 
family  reading  project. 

Our  Family  Reading  Project  is  an  offshoot  of  the  Vermont  Reading  Project  and 
is  funded  by  a  grant  from  Vermont  Council  on  the  Humanities.  Held  in  a  library,  the 
programs  involve  participants,  literature  that  follows  a  theme,  and  group  discussions 
led  by  a  scholar.  What  sets  the  Family  Reading  Project  apart  is  that  it  involves  chil¬ 
dren’s  literature.  It  is  also  geared  to  families,  particularly  families  with  adults  who 
have  limited  reading  skills  or  an  interest  in  learning  more  about  children’s  literature. 
The  themes  in  children’s  literature  are  clear  and  Adult  Basic  Education  (ABE)  stu¬ 
dents  often  express  an  interest  both  in  their  own  reading  ability  and  in  being  able  to 
read  to  their  children. 

At  the  Policy  Council  meeting  in  October  1990,  Mary  Leahy  gave  a  presenta¬ 
tion  about  the  Family  Reading  Project.  She  stressed  that  the  gift  of  participating  in  a 
project  is  what  happens  when  people  get  together  over  books.  ABE  has  integrated 
participation  in  the  project  into  the  classroom  instruction  of  adult  learners.  The 
Policy  Council  was  interested,  so  Sarah  Mehegan  proceeded  by  contacting  Sally 
Anderson,  Vermont  Reading  Project  coordinator,  to  see  what  could  be  done  for 
Head  Start  families  in  the  Central  Vermont  area. 

In  November,  Mehegan  met  with  Anderson,  Leahy,  and  several  ABE  teachers 
from  Orange  and  Washington  Counties.  The  group  decided  that  although  Head  Start 
home  visitors  and  ABE  teachers  serve  in  different  capacities  (Head  Start  is  more 
family  focused  and  ABE  more  adult  focused),  we  are  essentially  seen  by  our  clients 
as  educators.  We  also  in  many  cases  serve  the  same  economic  population  and  have 
some  dual  enrollment.  We  decided  to  poll  our  people  to  see  what  kind  of  interest 
there  was  in  participating  in  projects  together.  Anderson  contacted  possible  scholars 
to  lead  the  discussions,  along  with  the  libraries  in  each  area  to  see  what  interest 
there  was  in  hosting  a  group.  In  the  end,  we  had  good  responses  from  libraries, 

Head  Start  parents,  and  ABE  students  in  several  communities.  Through  coor¬ 
dination  with  Anderson,  ABE  personnel,  community  librarians,  and  Head  Start 
personnel,  we  made  plans  for  Family  Reading  Projects  in  seven  communities.

The  themes  offered  are  friendship,  home,  courage,  and  history.  After  choosing  a 
theme,  participants  received  10  books  from  the  bibliography  prepared  by  the 
Vermont  Reading  Project.  The  books  ranged  in  appropriateness  from  preschool  to 
upper  elementary  ages. 

Susie  Wizowaty  led  the  group  in  Barre,  which  was  a  large  group  of  ABE  stu¬ 
dents  and  parents  from  two  of  our  Head  Start  field  offices.  The  theme  was  friend¬ 
ship.  Wizowaty’ s  approach  was  to  get  people  to  talk  about  the  content  of  the  book 
and  the  process  of  writing.  She  asked  people  how  they  liked  the  illustrations  and 
how  their  children  viewed  the  illustrations.  When  the  participants  discussed  the 
book  The  Hundred  Dresses ,  which  was  written  in  the  1 940s,  some  of  the  younger 
people  commented  that  they  thought  the  illustrations  were  “not  that  great”  while  the 
older  participants  seemed  to  love  them.  The  book  is  about  peer  pressure  and  being 
made  fun  of  because  you  are  viewed  as  different.  This  theme  generated  a  lively 
response  as  participants  shared  their  childhood  experiences  of  being  ridiculed  and 
singled  out  as  “different.”  One  parent  shared  how  she  deliberately  picked  on  one  kid 
in  her  class  whom  she  saw  as  unusual.  This  parent  stated  how  she  clearly  remem¬ 
bered  pulling  together  her  friends  to  agree  with  her  in  tormenting  the  other  child. 

Another  participant  shared  how  her  daughter  was  going  through  this  very  ex¬ 
perience  at  school.  She  read  The  Hundred  Dresses  with  her  daughter  who  then 
requested  to  take  the  book  to  share  with  her  teacher.  This  teacher  was  trying  to  help 
the  children  work  on  acceptance.  Through  this  one  family,  the  Family  Reading 
Project  moved  into  the  public  school. 

Wizowaty  also  shared  her  experiences  of  how  she  writes  children’s  literature 
and  how  in  many  ways  it  is  more  difficult  than  adult  fiction.  The  book  The  Biggest 
Bear  was  written  in  the  early  1950s  about  a  boy  who  makes  a  friend  out  of  a  bear 
cub.  The  boy  solved  his  problem  of  the  cub’s  growing  up  into  a  rambunctious  and 
always  hungry  big  bear  by  giving  him  to  a  zoo.  It  was  almost  unanimous  that  if  this 
book  had  been  written  recently,  one  would  not  write  a  book  about  trying  to  make  a 
friend  out  of  a  bear.  The  group  did  not  see  the  solution  of  putting  a  bear  in  a  zoo  as 
a  happy  one.  Therefore,  the  discussion  turned  to  how  would  one  write  a  book  about 
a  boy  and  a  bear,  and  why  there  has  always  been  a  fascination  with  bears. 

Ken  Smith  led  the  group  in  the  Connecticut  Valley  area.  One  parent  stated  that 
he  had  the  ability  to  paint  pictures  in  her  head  with  his  words  and  actions.  When  the 
group  discussed  the  book  Frog  and  Toad  Are  Friends,  this  parent  could  just  picture 
a  “silly  little  toad  in  his  silly  little  bathing  suit,  feeling  silly.”  Then  this  parent 
shared  that  she  knew  just  how  this  toad  felt,  how  she  had  felt  this  way  at  times. 

Another  point  this  parent  talked  about  in  her  experience  of  being  in  Smith’s 
discussion  was  that  although  many  personal  experiences  were  shared  and  people 
expressed  different  opinions,  there  was  always  an  acceptance  of  each  individual  and 
that  person’s  thoughts,  fears,  and  dreams.  Smith  kept  the  atmosphere  light  by  using 
humor.

Although  it  may  not  be  unique,  an  outreach  to  our  local  Head  Start  is  one  of 
the  programs  of  which  we  are  proudest. 

In  May  1994, 1  attended  a  Library-Head  Start  Workshop  in  Topeka,  Kansas, 
sponsored  by  the  Center  for  the  Book,  Library  of  Congress.  Even  though  I  had 
worked  with  Head  Start  for  5  years,  this  workshop  gave  me  an  insight  into  other 
ways  to  serve  children’s  needs. 

During  the  school  year,  I  visit  Head  Start  on  a  regular  basis  to  share  stories, 
fingerplays,  crafts,  puppets,  and  songs  with  each  class. 

An  idea  I  have  implemented  since  the  workshop  is  a  “Storytime  Box”  filled 
with  books,  songs,  fingerplays,  bulletin  board  items,  old  magazines,  etc.,  to 
supplement  the  curriculum.  All  materials  are  left  on  site  for  1  month,  and  the 
teachers  have  found  them  very  helpful. 

Because  of  transportation  shortage,  each  of  the  seven  classes  can  make  only 
one  visit  per  school  year  to  the  library.  I  try  to  make  this  a  very  special  visit  and 
have  a  small  take-home  item  for  each  child.  Any  material  given  out  is  marked 
with  our  library  stamp  to  make  parents  aware  of  the  library  involvement. 

I  have  also  provided  training  for  teacher  aides  by  sharing  books  and 
storytelling  techniques.  This  training  was  held  at  the  library  and  was  a  first  visit 
for  some.

SAMPLE 

North  Bend  Public  Library,  Oregon 

Outreach  programs  are  usually  scheduled  October  through  May,  with  each 
Head  Start  or  day  care  having  a  monthly  visit  on  the  same  day  and  time  each 
month,  such  as  the  first  Tuesday  of  each  month  at  10:30.  Last  year,  I  regularly 
visited  eight  Head  Start  classes  at  a  variety  of  sites  and  two  day  care  centers.  (Pre¬ 
schools  usually  schedule  a  once-a-year  field  trip  to  the  library.) 

I  perform  roughly  the  same  program  for  Outreach  that  I  am  doing  at  that 
week’s  Storytime  unless  the  teacher  has  requested  a  specific  theme.  (If  I  already 
have  a  file  for  that  theme,  I  can  usually  honor  a  teacher’s  request.)  I  often  try  out 
new  material  during  Head  Start  visits  because  the  children  are  such  eager 
audiences  and  are  used  to  being  together  as  groups. 

A  typical  Outreach  program  would  begin  with  a  “warm-up”  pertaining  to  the 
theme,  such  as  a  stuffed  animal  to  admire  and  discuss,  a  song  or  fingerplay  about 
the  topic,  an  imaginary  experience  with  the  theme,  some  “realia”  to  pass  around, 
or  a  short  discussion  of  the  children’s  experiences  with  the  topic.  Next  comes  a 
book,  followed  by  a  song  or  fingerplay  that  allows  the  children  to  move  in  some 
fashion  and  “get  the  wiggles  out.”  Then  comes  another  book  (or  a  flannel  board 
story,  puppet  story,  etc.)  followed  by  another  active  song  or  fingerplay.  I  continue 
in  this  fashion  for  the  allotted  time  or  as  long  as  the  children’s  interest  holds. 
(Regular  Storytimes  end  with  a  simple  craft,  which  I  omit  for  Outreach  sessions.) 

I  look  for  books  that  have  wonderful  pictures  and  fairly  simple  stories.  Books 
with  repetitive  phrases  or  predictable  plots  are  always  popular.  As  the  year 
progresses  and  the  children  become  better  listeners  and  can  sit  still  for  longer 
periods,  I  usually  choose  at  least  one  longer  story  per  session.  As  I  get  to  know 
the  classes,  I  often  substitute  books  within  a  theme  that  better  suit  the  abilities  and 
idiosyncrasies  of  a  particular  group. 

Reaching  out  to  Head  Start  classes  is  one  of  my  top  priorities.  Research  shows 
that  children  who  are  read  to  regularly  usually  become  readers  themselves.  Many 
of  the  Head  Start  children  are  not  being  read  to  at  home.  I  like  to  think  that  I  can 
make  a  difference  in  these  children’s  reading  futures.

Fact  Sheet 


Born  to  Read 

Helping  parents  raise  children  with  healthy  bodies  and  minds  is  the  goal  of 
Bom  to  Read:  How  to  Nurture  a  Baby’s  Love  of  Learning.  This  3-year  national 
demonstration  project  is  being  administered  by  the  Association  for  Library  Serv¬ 
ice  to  Children  (ALSC),  a  division  of  the  American  Library  Association  (ALA). 
Funded  by  a  grant  from  The  Prudential  Foundation.  Bom  to  Read  builds  partner¬ 
ships  between  librarians  and  health  care  providers  to  reach  out  to  new  and  expec¬ 
tant  at-risk  parents  and  to  help  them  raise  children  who  are  “bom  to  read.” 

Goals 

•  To  develop  models  of  how  library-health  care  provider  partnerships  can  work 
together  to  break  the  intergenerational  cycle  of  illiteracy. 

•  To  help  parents  improve  their  reading  skills  and  to  impress  upon  them  the  im¬ 
portance  of  reading  to  their  children. 

•  To  promote  greater  public  awareness  of  health  and  parenting  resources  avail¬ 
able  in  libraries. 

Programs 

Five  libraries  were  selected  as  national  demonstration  sites:  the  H.  Leslie 
Perry  Memorial  Library  in  Henderson,  N.C.;  the  Carnegie  Library  of  Pittsburgh; 
the  Provo  (Utah)  City  Library;  the  Sutter  County  Library,  Yuba  City,  Calif.;  and 
the  Memphis/Shelby  County  (Term.)  Public  Library  and  Information  Center. 

These  sites  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  innovation  and  creativity,  evidence  of 
need,  enthusiasm,  and  commitment  to  the  project  goals.  Each  grant  recipient  was 
awarded  $30,000  to  implement  its  winning  program  proposal  at  the  local  level. 
The  first  programs  were  launched  in  March  1995. 

•  The  Bom  to  Read  program  at  the  H.  Leslie  Perry  Memorial  Library  includes 
training  literacy  volunteers,  conducting  storytimes,  and  hosting  programs  for 
parents  of  newborns.  A  collection  of  picture  books  was  placed  at  the 
Granville- Vance  District  Health  Department,  and  parenting  classes  and  sto¬ 
rytimes  were  held  at  three  local  housing  projects  and  at  the  Health  Department 
on  Prenatal  and  Well-Child  Clinic  days.

•  The  Provo  City  Library’s  Bom  to  Read  program  includes  a  special  series  for 
fathers  and  their  babies  called  “Time  With  Father.”  The  program  promotes  a 
child’s  early  interaction  with  his  or  her  father.  Parents  of  approximately  3,000 
babies  bom  at  two  local  hospitals  received  parenting  materials,  and  follow-up 
visits  were  made.  A  van  is  used  to  distribute  toys  and  books  to  at-risk  families. 
Two  program  series — “Book  Babies”  and  “Mother  Goose  Time” — are  held 
for  baby  and  parents  at  the  library. 

•  A  family  literacy  program,  “Beginning  with  Books,”  expands  the  Carnegie 
Library  of  Pittsburgh’s  Bom  to  Read  program.  A  series  of  Read- Aloud  Clubs 
offers  parents  an  opportunity  to  share  their  experiences  by  reading  picture 
books  to  their  babies.  Staff  members  from  the  Allegheny  County  Health  De¬ 
partment  and  the  Magee-Women’s  Hospital  give  presentations  on  nutrition, 
child  development,  and  immunizations. 

•  Targeting  a  multilingual  population,  the  Sutter  County  Library’s  Bom  to  Read 
program  involves  4  health-care  agencies  and  1 1  community  organizations, 
including  the  local  Migrant  Head  Start  Program.  Activities  include  a  major 
public  awareness  campaign,  parenting  programs,  infant  and  parent  storytimes, 
and  Bom  to  Read  graduation  celebrations  at  various  community  sites. 
Sunsweet  Growers  Inc.  is  a  corporate  sponsor. 

•  The  Memphis/Shelby  County  Public  Library  and  Information  Center  will  ex¬ 
pand  the  services  of  Training  Wheels,  a  mobile  classroom,  to  take  materials 
and  programs  on  early  literacy  skills  and  child  development  to  two  Memphis 
neighborhoods.  Three  videotapes  will  be  produced  for  the  library’s  cable  tele¬ 
vision  channel  and  will  be  available  for  checkout  at  branch  libraries.  Parenting 
classes,  a  variety  of  library  programs,  and  home  visits  by  health-care  staff 
members  from  LeBonheur  Children’s  Medical  Center’s  Healthy  Families  pro¬ 
gram  are  part  of  the  project. 

How  It  Works 

The  Bom  to  Read  project  provides  support  materials,  training,  and  technical 
assistance  to  the  selected  library  and  health-care  provider  partners.  A  national  ad¬ 
visory  committee  oversees  implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  project.  The 
committee  established  the  criteria  for  the  national  demonstration  sites  and  devel¬ 
oped  the  overall  program  goals  and  objectives.  It  assists  in  the  planning  of  train¬ 
ing  seminars,  the  production  of  a  Bom  to  Read  video,  and  the  evaluation  of  pro¬ 
gram  sites.  First  Lady  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  is  honorary  chair.

Building  on  Success 

These  demonstration  sites  have  inspired  several  libraries  to  raise  local  funds 
for  implementing  of  Bom  to  Read  programs  in  their  communities.  For  informa¬ 
tion  about  how  to  organize  a  Bom  to  Read  program,  contact  the  Bom  to  Read

“THE  LIBRARY-HEAD  START  PARTNERSHIP” 


1 .  Introduction-montage  and  title. 

The  children,  teachers,  aides,  and  parents  in  this  Head  Start  classroom  have  a  new  partner  ...  the 
librarian  and  staff  from  the  local  public,  or  perhaps,  the  school  library. 

It’s  all  part  of  the  Library-Head  Start  Partnership  Project,  designed  to  help  integrate  books  and 
library  programs  into  the  experiences  of  Head  Start  children  and  their  families. 

la.  Dolly  Wolverton  on-camera. 

“The  overall  goal  of  this  wonderful  undertaking  is  to  give  Head  Start  children  exposure  to  lots  of 
imagination-stirring,  thought-provoking  books,  as  motivation  for  further  learning.” 

2.  Library:  children’s  librarian  at  work  talking  with  a  child  about  a  book  as  it  is  being  selected  from  a 
face-out  rack. 

Just  as  you  individualize  the  Head  Start  curriculum,  the  librarian  selects  and  organizes  books  and 
other  materials  for  the  varied  needs  of  children. 


3.  Librarian  at  another  library  location  with  a  computer.  Around  her  are  journal  reviews,  children’s 
books,  etc.  She  examines  and  leafs  through  a  new  book. 

A  librarian  uses  recommendations,  reviews,  and  hands-on  examination  to  select  and  order  books, 
and  to  keep  up-to-date  on  the  best  children’s  books  and  supporting  media.  The  librarian  also  has 
access  to  many  other  print  and  electronic  resources. 


261 


4.  Head  Start  teacher  and  librarian  meeting  in  the  empty  Head  Start  classroom.  They  discuss  her  lesson 
plan. 

Your  collaboration  with  the  local  library  begins  with  a  visit  and  a  discussion  about  your  group  of 
children. 

You’ll  discuss  class  size,  age  range,  and  other  general  characteristics  that  guide  your  approach  to  a 
daily  learning  plan  for  each  individual. 

(The  Head  Start  teacher  describes  her  class.) 

However,  the  focus  of  your  discussions  will  be  on  the  special  needs  of  the  children. 

(Discussion:  “What  do  you  find  most  difficult  to  individualize  in  terms  of  what  you  have  to  cover  in  the 
curriculum?”  The  Head  Start  teacher  talks  about  a  child  with  a  new  sibling.)

5.  Wide  shot  of  a  Head  Start  classroom  full  of  active  children.  At  the  end  of  the  first  sentence,  the  video 
freeze-frames  and  the  words  “Learning  Style”  appears  on  the  screen. 

You’ll  discuss  the  learning  styles  of  your  children.  Do  some  learn  best  when  they  have  both  visual 
and  listening  experiences,  and  others  when  they  have  something  in  their  hands? 


6.  A  different  wide  shot  freeze-frames  with  “Developmental  Levels”  keyed. 

You’ll  profile  the  variety  of  developmental  levels  within  your  classes.  Are  some  performing  below 
or  above  their  age  level?  What  do  they  understand,  laugh  at,  and  respond  to? 


7.  A  different  wide  shot  freeze-frames  with  “Emotional  Variables”  keyed. 

Are  there  children  whose  emotional  health  is  a  factor  in  your  teaching?  Do  some  have  attention 
deficit,  or  are  withdrawn,  or  are  disabled  physically? 


8.  A  different  wide  shot  freeze-frames  with  “Home  Situation”  keyed. 

Are  many  children  from  single  parent  homes  with  the  parent  working?  Do  some  come  without 
breakfast?

games,  toys,  etc.  The  teacher  and  librarian  are  included  in  some  of  the  shots. 

You’ll  want  to  visit  with  the  librarian  at  the  library  to  see  all  the  possibilities.

Dissolve  to: 

13.  The  librarian  and  Head  Start  teacher  are  seen  at  a  library  table  with  the  books  and  related  materials 
they  have  collected.  They  are  talking  about  books  and  how  they  can  be  used  in  groups  and  with  individual 
children. 

Though  many  of  the  book-related  activities  will  be  conducted  in  groups,  you’ll  find  a  variety  of 
materials  to  better  suit  the  individual  needs  and  interest  of  your  children. 

(The  discussion  will  point  out  that  there  are  different  uses  for  the  books.  Some  are  for  reading  to  the 
group;  others  are  to  be  read  to  specific  children:  “For  the  child  with  the  family  that’s  moving  [or  dealing 
with  a  death,  a  new  sibling,  illness,  absence  of  a  parent,  etc.],  this  book  will  show  her  a  character  dealing 
with  the  same  emotions.  This  other  book  would  be  good  for  your  4-year-old  who  is  not  quite  ready  for 
advanced  material.”) 

(The  discussion  turns  to  the  support  material  they  have  collected  on  the  table.) 


14.  Close-ups  on  the  broad  range  of  book-related  materials  on  the  table. 

However,  the  library  has  more  than  books.  Enhancement  materials  fully  integrated  into  the  story 
experience  can  support  a  variety  of  learning  styles. 

(Discussion:  “Puppets  are  a  great  way  for  kids  to  express  themselves  about  the  ideas  they  learn  in  this 
story.  Why  don’t  I  bring  the  puppets  when  I  come  to  visit  your  classroom?”)

“ENTERING  THE  WORLD  OF  BOOKS” 


21 .  Scene  of  a  teacher  enthusiastically  reading  a  story  with  participation  by  the  children. 

When  children  enjoy  stories,  think  about  and  identify  with  ideas,  they  are  building  self-esteem.  It  is 
this  self-esteem,  this  confidence,  that  will  lead  to  literacy  and  eventually  to  full  participation  in  life 
as  an  adult. 


22.  From  the  point-of-view  of  a  child,  we  enter  an  empty,  but  “print-rich”  Head  Start  classroom.  As  the 
camera  moves,  we  see  a  well-organized  room  with  words  labeling  many  things.  The  shot  then  cuts  to  the 
particulars  that  make  the  room  “print-rich,”  such  as  the  areas  labeled  “Blocks”  and  “Science.”  The  signs 
are  neatly  printed  with  markers.  The  children’s  artwork  is  on  the  wall,  each  under  a  brightly  labeled 
child’s  name. 

One  of  their  first  steps  along  this  life  path  will  be  the  one  they  take  into  a  “print-rich”  Head  Start 
classroom.  In  such  an  environment  pre-readers  quickly  become  familiar  with  the  words  that 
identify  objects  and  actions.  Their  artwork  and  clothes  hooks  are  labeled  with  their  names. 
Learning  centers  of  the  room  are  identified  with  words.  There  are  books  displayed  face-out  as  w  ell 
as  in  baskets.  There  are  pictures,  posters,  and  globes — all  with  words  that  give  them  added 
meaning. 

There  are  manipulatives  w  aiting  to  be  enjoyed,  such  as  blocks  and  large  wooden  puzzles  to 
strengthen  eye-hand  coordination  and  other  pre-reading  skills. 


23.  Pretend  doctor’s  office,  with  magazines,  etc. 

Reading  and  related  activities  should  take  place  all  over  the  classroom.  A  pretend  doctor’s  office 
can  have  medical  charts,  get  well  cards,  and  even  magazines.  The  guidance  and  additional 
resources  to  help  you  create  a  “print-rich”  environment  is  one  of  the  benefits  of  your  partnership 
with  the  library  staff. 


24.  Reading  Comer.  Close-ups  of  the  bookshelves,  etc. 

The  librarian  can  also  assist  you  in  preparing  a  special  reading  corner,  organizing  it  to  be  more 
inviting,  more  interesting  with  comfortable  pillows  to  sit  on,  and  an  easy  chair  for  an  adult  reader 
or  storyteller. 


25.  Writing  Center.  Includes  a  small  table  with  chairs  and  the  objects  described. 

The  Reading  Corner  can  include  a  writing  center  with  pencil  and  paper,  crayons,  rubber  stamps, 
stencils,  envelopes  and  scissors,  magnetic  letter  boards,  and  block  and  cutout  letters.

tape  player  looking  at  a  book.  Displayed  nearby  are  story  dolls,  puppets,  etc. 

The  library  can  also  help  you  identify  other  materials  to  place  in  your  Reading  Corner  to  support 
the  development  of  pre-reading  skills.  In  addition  to  a  continuing  flow  of  books,  these  can  include 
puppets,  toys,  and  story  dolls  created  from  book  characters. 


28.  We  dissolve  into  the  conversation,  as  the  Head  Start  teacher  and  the  librarian  talk  about  reading  aloud 
skills. 

One  of  the  most  valuable  benefits  of  your  collaboration  with  a  librarian  will  be  help  in  acquiring 
skills  for  reading  books  with  children. 


Dissolve  to: 

29.  The  teacher,  seated  alone,  studying  one  of  the  books  from  the  pile. 

Begin  by  selecting  a  book  that  you  like  and  are  comfortable  with.  Read  it  to  yourself  several  times 
to  identify  ways  to  make  it  come  alive. 


Dissolve  to: 

30.  The  camera  cuts  to  a  Head  Start  teacher  starting  her  focusing  ritual. 

Focusing  rituals  help  children  settle  and  prepare  them  to  participate. 


3 1 .  Teacher  reads  and  discusses  with  children. 

When  you  are  reading  to  a  group,  use  books  that  are  large  enough  so  that  everyone  can  see  the 
illustrations.  The  pictures  should  be  bold  and  well-defined,  and  relate  to  the  words  you  are  reading. 

Don’t  be  too  eager  to  get  on  with  the  story.  Move  the  book  around  slowly  to  be  sure  everyone  has  a 
chance  to  see  and  think  about  the  pictures. 

Children  like  it  when  you  change  your  voice  to  create  different  characters  and  personalities. 

Key  to  the  reading  experience  is  that  the  children  have  the  opportunity  to  participate.  Books  with 
repetition,  a  rhyme,  or  a  chant  offer  the  chance  for  them  to  join  in. 

Let  children  enter  into  the  story  and  relate  the  story  to  themselves  and  their  own  experiences. 


266 


Appendix  B 


Ask  questions  as  you  go  along.  But  be  sure  they’re  open-ended  questions  that  elicit  more  than 
simple  yes/no  answers. 

Let  them  guess  what  they  think  happens  next  before  you  read  on. 


Dissolve  to: 

32.  The  same  Head  Start  classroom.  An  aide  reads  Peter  Rabbit  to  two  children  in  the  Reading  Comer. 

When  sharing  a  book  with  an  individual  or  just  a  couple  of  children,  sit  close  or  hold  a  child  if  it’s 
appropriate.  Warmth  can  also  be  conveyed  by  the  tone  of  your  voice. 

In  an  intimate  setting,  you  can  use  smaller  books,  since  you’ll  be  sitting  close.  Many  children  like  to 
examine  tiny  details  in  the  pictures.  (She  talks  to  them  about  the  pictures  and  connects  the  story  to 
their  own  experiences.) 

This  is  an  ideal  opportunity  to  relate  aspects  of  the  story  to  each  child  as  an  individual.  Allow  plenty 
of  time  for  personal  responses  and  questions. 


Dissolve  to: 

33.  Montage  of  storytellers. 

Storytelling  is  as  old  as  history  and  a  tradition  in  many  cultures.  You  can  make  this  tradition  your 
own. 

Effective  storytellers  choose  stories  they  like  since  the  stories  will  have  to  be  learned  and  told  with 
drama  and  enthusiasm.  Storytellers  find  stories  in  books  or  use  their  own  remembered  experiences. 

(Rose,  standing  amidst  the  children.  She  pulls  out  the  “story  hat.”) 

Some  storytellers  like  to  provide  a  focusing  point,  like  a  “story  hat,”  that  signals  that  “magic”  is 
about  to  happen. 

(The  storyteller  begins  the  story.) 

Shorter  stories  are  usually  appropriate  for  young  children.  Add  or  subtract  elements  for  different 
audiences  and  situations. 

Be  prepared  for  participation,  especially  if  the  story  contains  chants,  challenges  by  characters,  or 
repetitions. 


Dissolve  to: 

34.  Later  as  part  of  a  new  story,  the  storyteller  uses  a  hand  puppet. 

Puppets  are  excellent  enhancements  and  can  help  children  participate  in  the  story.  The  use  of  story 
extender  materials  can  enhance  a  child’s  experience  with  books  and  stories. 


Appendix  B 


267 


35.  A  child  using  a  puppet  later  with  an  aide. 

Puppets  and  story  dolls  can  also  be  used  by  the  child  who  has  trouble  expressing  emotion.  Puppets 
can  be  an  alter  ego,  making  it  possible  to  communicate  feelings. 


36.  Puppet  types  displayed. 

There  are  a  wide  variety  of  puppet  types:  stick,  string,  hand,  finger.  The  librarian  can  suggest 
which  stories  work  well  with  puppets  and  other  dramatic  play.  Simple  stages  can  be  built  from 
cartons  and  colored  paper. 


37.  A  flannel  board  is  used  in  a  story  told  by  Oralia  Garza  Cortes. 

Cut-out  figures  that  stick  to  a  flannel  board  are  another  popular  enhancement.  Children  can  assist 
the  storyteller  in  illustrating  the  story. 


38.  An  area  in  the  library  where  children’s  recordings  and  audio  are  kept,  as  a  librarian  pulls  some 
material. 

The  library  is  also  a  good  source  for  music  to  accompany  stories.  Audiotapes  are  easy  to  use. 


39.  Multimedia  materials  displayed  with  the  related  books. 

There  are  a  lot  of  books  that  are  accompanied  by  related  media,  such  as  videos  and  filmstrips. 
These  can  help  you  develop  a  story  theme  built  around  an  animal,  holidays,  or  even  a  color. 


40.  Graphic  screen  with  video  window.  The  consistent  heading  is  “Book-related  Activities”  next  to  the 
video  window.  The  video  window  changes  to  different  close-ups  as  described.  Below  the  window  are 
captions  for  the  individual  activities. 


41.  C.U.  a  picture  being  drawn.  Caption:  “Art  Activities.” 

The  activities  that  are  already  part  of  your  Head  Start  program  can  also  relate  to  books,  such  as 
children  and  volunteer  parents  together  creating  artwork  from  stories. 


42.  Children  acting  out  a  scene.  Caption:  “Dramatic  Play/ Acting.” 

Dramatic  play  and  acting  out  scenes  from  books  are  effective  enhancements  as  are  finger  plays  and 
games. 


43.  Children  singing.  Caption:  “Music/Songs.” 


268 


Appendix  B 


Songs  related  to  your  theme  can  be  used  to  close  a  storytime,  or  give  children  a  chance  to  stretch 
between  stories. 


44.  C.U.  of  food  being  prepared  by  children,  cut  to  play  recipe.  Caption:  “Nutrition.” 

A  surprising  number  of  stories  have  food  as  a  major  element,  which  ties  in  nicely  with  the 
importance  of  nutrition  and  meal  preparation  in  Head  Start. 


45  &  46.  Head  Start  teacher  talking  to  a  child  about  one  of  the  stories  read  earlier,  connecting  the  story 
with  some  emotion  the  child  is  feeling. 

(We  hear  a  brief  discussion  with  a  child.) 

However,  the  best  enhancement  you  can  provide  may  be  simply  talking  about  the  stories,  showing 
children  that  books  continue  to  have  meaning  for  them  long  after  the  stories  have  ended.

The  number  of  children’s  books  published  grows  each  year.  But  which  are  the  outstanding  ones 
that  children  will  make  their  own? 


48.  Book  retrieval  shots  are  intercut  with  close-ups  of  a  written  list  as  a  finger  points  to  various  book 
titles. 

A  librarian  reads  and  compares  lots  of  children’s  books  and  uses  tools  to  help  her  evaluate  them. 
She  can  share  with  you  some  of  the  things  she  knows  about  what  makes  a  good  book  good. 


49.  A  table  full  of  bibliographies  on  many  different  subjects. 

Among  the  basic  selection  tools  are  bibliographies  and  book  lists.  Bibliographic  listings  are  a  guide 
to  the  best  of  the  huge  number  of  children’s  books,  and  are  available  to  help  you  select  books  from 
a  multitude  of  topics.  There  are  book  lists  for  children  with  special  interests  and  needs,  books  about 
places  or  kinds  of  people. 


50.  Table  of  journals  and  magazines  with  reviews,  close-ups  of  reviews. 

Reviews  provide  additional  guidance  to  the  content  and  quality  of  children’s  books.  Reviews  appear 
in  professional  journals,  library  journals,  those  for  the  early  childhood  community,  and  periodicals 
for  teachers  and  others.  They  also  appear  in  newspapers  and  consumer  magazines. 


5 1 .  Head  Start  teacher  and  librarian  at  the  library  working  together  with  sources,  writing  up  a  list. 

You  will  use  some  of  these  bibliographies  and  reviews  yourself,  and  your  librarian  can  prepare 
special  lists  for  you  based  on  what  you  think  your  children  will  like. 


52  &  53.  Montage  of  Head  Start  teachers  and  children.  C.U.’s  of  books  displayed  on  end  in  the  Reading 
Comer  surrounded  by  Head  Start  classroom  activity.  A  child  picks  one  to  read.  Fyecha  al  Sol,  Whistle  for 
Willie,  Mommies  at  Work. 

As  a  Head  Start  teacher,  you  know  an  individual  child’s  needs  are  not  just  based  on  age  and  stage 
of  development.  Among  the  books  you  choose  should  be  those  that  reflect  the  culture,  family 
lifestyle,  and  racial  and  ethnic  background  of  children  in  the  classroom.  Also  considered  should  be 
the  child’s  emotional  life  and  physical  abilities.

Appendix  B 


54.  Child  with  or  without  an  adult,  looking  at  pictures  in  a  book.  A  variety  of  other  books  are  nearby:  The 
Lost  Lake,  How  My  Parents  Learned  to  Eat,  Madeline. 

But  children  must  also  be  exposed  to  people  and  cultures  beyond  their  own  experience.  It  is  not 
enough  to  avoid  stereotypes  and  tokenism.  The  books  you  select  should  open  the  child’s  mind  to  the 
differences  and  similarities  of  people. 


CONTENT  AND  LITERARY  CRITERIA 

There  are  a  number  of  things  to  look  for  in  selecting  a  good  storybook  for  reading  to  children. 

55.  SETTING 

Children  like  stories  to  be  grounded  in  a  definite  location  and  time.  Some  stories  can  reflect 
everyday  experiences. 

Children  enjoy  stories  set  in  imaginary  places  as  well. 

But  stories  should  also  stretch  children’s  thinking  by  introducing  them  to  new  worlds  and  cultures. 


56.  POINT-OF-  VIE  W 

Many  stories  are  told  by  an  all-knowing  narrator  who  describes  the  action  and  what  the  characters 
are  feeling. 

However,  stories  told  by  the  main  character  have  a  special  immediacy  and  appeal. 


57.  CHARACTERS 

The  characters,  whether  people  or  animals,  should  be  dynamic,  developing  and  changing  as  real 
people  do. 

Characters  should  have  traits  and  feelings  children  will  recognize  in  themselves. 

Select  stories  that  show  characters  in  a  range  of  roles,  genders,  ages,  races,  and  cultures. 


58.  PLOT 

Children  like  to  know  where  a  story  is  going,  and  even  be  able  to  anticipate  the  next  event. 
Knowing  what  is  coming  next  gives  children  the  feeling  that  they  are  reading  by  themselves. 

Humor,  suspense,  and  surprise  all  delight  children. 


Appendix  B 


271 


59.  THEME 


Good  stories  have  underlying  themes.  Children  should  “get”  the  main  idea:  For  example,  the 
importance  of  sharing. 

60.  WORDS  &  VOCABULARY 

A  book  should  contain  words  that  can  expand  vocabulary. 

Sentence  structure  and  length  should  be  appropriate  for  the  age  group. 

An  added  plus  are  “juicy”  words  that  tickle  the  imagination  and  are  fun  to  say. 

Kids  love  word  play  and  rhymes. 


61.  ILLUSTRATIONS 

The  style  and  mood  of  a  book’s  illustrations  should  complement  the  text,  and  help  children  follow 
the  story  sequence. 

Pictures  can  extend  the  story  by  saying  things  the  words  don’t  say. 

Just  by  themselves,  good  illustrations  can  help  children  understand  the  story’s  basic  concepts. 

A  well-illustrated  book  delights  children  and  allows  them  to  discover  more  in  the  pictures  each  time 
they  pick  it  up. 


63.  A  Head  Start  teacher  reading  a  story.  Cut  to  a  close-up  of  the  book  as  she  shows  the  pictures  to  the 
children. 

The  book  itself  can  play  a  major  role  in  introducing  children  to  reading  skills. 


64.  Close-ups  of  books  concentrating  on  the  physical  properties. 

They  should  have  the  opportunity  to  see  individual  words  and  letters.  Large  type  sizes  and  clear 
words  are  important  for  pre-readers. 

The  printing  of  the  illustrations  should  be  of  high  quality.  Good  printing  enhances  children’s  sense 
of  what  a  quality  book  is. 

The  open  book  should  allow  everything  to  be  seen.  Words  should  not  run  into  the  margins. 

Good  jacket  artwork  definitely  attracts  readers.  Laminated  or  plastic  covers  help  protect  books 
from  stains  or  fingerprints. 

The  binding  should  be  strong  and  the  pages  sewn-in,  not  glued,  to  stand  up  to  heavy  use  in  the 
classroom  setting. 


272 


Appendix  B 


65.  Character-generated  text  list  including  “audio-visual  materials,  videotapes,  film  strips,  films,  slides, 
records,  tapes,  CDs,  magazines,  educational  computer  programs,  toys,  games,  and  realia.” 

In  your  pre-reading  program,  stimulate  and  follow-up  interest  in  the  story  with  non-book 
materials.  A  story  can  often  be  told  in  a  non-print  format. 


66.  Display  of  reviews,  lists,  and  other  information  about  materials 

To  help  you  select  the  best  of  these  materials,  there  are  published  lists,  reviews,  and  other  guidelines 
the  librarian  can  help  you  locate. 


67.  Flashback  to  teacher  and  librarian  talking  about  book-related  materials  in  the  library. 

If  you  are  using  library-owned  materials,  you  can  be  confident  that  the  material  in  your  library’s 
collection  has  been  selected  using  established  guidelines. 


68.  Teacher  at  the  library  reviewing  some  materials,  such  as  a  videotape  or  a  story-related  toy. 

However  you  obtain  these  materials,  never  use  them  with  children  unless  you  are  familiar  with 
them  yourself. 


69.  Montage  of  shots  from  this  segment  focusing  on  the  selection  and  reviewing  activities,  and  ending 
with  a  reading  aloud  scene. 

Choosing  among  the  vast  array  of  books  may  at  first  seem  a  daunting  task.  But  with  the  help  of  the 
librarian,  you’ll  find  that  using  books  that  are  right  for  your  children  is  a  reward  in  itself.

(Section  title:  “Building  Bridges  to  the  Home.”) 

Parents  are  the  first  and  most  important  influence  on  a  child’s  desire  to  learn.  To  help  their 
children  get  ready  to  read,  Head  Start  parents  need  to  know  how  to  reinforce  what  the  children  are 
learning.  As  a  Head  Start  teacher,  there  are  some  things  you  can  do  to  help  them. 


71.  Parent(s)  listening  to  a  book  being  read  in  a  Head  Start  classroom. 

Begin  with  inviting  parents  to  observe  your  reading  and  story  activities  in  the  classroom. 

72.  Parent(s)  assisting  in  story  activities.  (Nice  example  of  a  2-3  language- speaking  parent  who  comes  in 
to  translate  for  a  child.) 

Then  encourage  parents  to  participate  in  class  storytime. 


73.  Head  Start  teacher  talking  to  parents  about  follow-up.  A  parent  shows  concern  for  the  child  with  the 
teacher.  The  teacher  knows  others  have  expressed  these  concerns  also.  Perhaps  the  librarian  can  put  a 
workshop  together. 

Discuss  with  parents  their  child’s  pre-reading  activities  and  the  possibility  of  workshops  that  will 
help  them  practice  these  activities  at  home. 


74.  Group  of  5-6  parents  in  a  training  workshop,  hosted  by  the  Head  Start  teacher  and  a  librarian. 

The  librarian  can  help  design  workshops  that  involve  parents  in  their  child’s  development  as  a 
reader.  Workshops  can  include  a  variety  of  topics,  such  as  helping  their  children  identify  objects 
and  develop  concepts,  and  how  to  read  aloud. 


74a.  (Workshop  discussion  on  making  family  books,  including  drawings,  photos,  favorite  small  objects 
for  focusing  family  discussion.) 

One  focus  will  be  encouraging  parents  to  recognize  learning  opportunities  they  see  in  everyday 
home  life.  Tell  parents  it’s  important  to  talk  to  their  child  about  everyday  family  matters. 


75.  At  home  with  one  of  our  families.  We  see  the  environment  and  activities.

Appendix  B 


Parents  need  to  know  that  they,  too,  can  create  a  “print-rich”  environment.  The  library  can 
provide  them  with  resources,  such  as  picture  cookbooks  that  they  will  enjoy  using  with  their 
children.  Even  the  simplest  things  can  enhance  children’s  pre-reading  skills  such  as  magnetic 
letters  on  the  refrigerator,  shopping  lists,  newspapers,  magazines,  and  word  games.  Seeing  parents 
reading  to  themselves  can  be  a  great  motivator. 


76.  A  shot  of  a  parent  talking  to  a  kid  while  watching  a  dinosaur  program  on  TV. 

Parents  should  also  know  they  can  harness  the  power  of  TV  as  a  learning  tool.  Adults  can  select 
programs  that  they  and  their  children  can  watch  together. 


77.  A  parent  looking  through  a  book  about  dinosaurs  with  the  child. 

Libraries  sometimes  receive  advance  information  about  TV  programming.  Parents  can  talk  about 
and  follow-up  programs  with  books  and  related  materials  from  the  library. 


78.  Shots  of  home-based  program.  Teacher  is  discussing  a  book. 

If  you  are  a  home  visitor  in  the  home-based  option,  you  will  need  to  emphasize  to  parents  their 
added  responsibility  in  using  books.  Provide  them  with  a  variety  of  carefully  selected  materials. 


79.  Large-scale  special  event  at  a  library  attended  by  parents  and  children. 

(Section  title:  “Library  Resources  for  Adults.”) 

Getting  Head  Start  parents  involved  in  their  child’s  pre-reading  introduces  them  to  their  own  use 
of  the  library. 

An  orientation  to  the  library  itself  can  be  linked  to  events  you  urge  families  to  attend,  including 
those  Head  Start  and  the  library  jointly  sponsor  for  special  occasions. 


80.  Library  scenes. 

Or  their  introduction  can  be  through  library  programs  you  promote  such  as  parent-child  story 
times. 

Once  familiar  with  the  library,  parents  will  find  many  services  that  can  help  them. 


81.  Brief  scenes  to  match  narration. 

The  library  is  a  center  for  meetings  and  community  activities.  Library  cards  are  available  for  the 
loan  of  books  and  other  materials.  Typewriters,  copiers,  and  computers  including  databases  also 
may  be  available  for  use.

video  box  are  assorted  items,  including  people  requesting  computer  or  print  listing  of  jobs,  licensing 
requirements,  community  service  information,  etc. 

Libraries  provide  employment  information,  which  may  include  a  state  job  bank.  They  will  have 
listings  of  accredited  vocational  and  technical  training  programs,  licensing  requirements  for 
occupations  such  as  drivers  and  beauticians,  guidance  on  GED  high  school  equivalency  and 
requirements  for  entrance  into  higher  education  programs. 


82a.  (CG  text  heading  changes  to  “Community-based  Services.”) 

The  library  can  identify  and  refer  adults  to  community-based  services,  including  housing 
information,  where  to  find  counseling  for  children,  the  availability  of  literacy  volunteers,  and  health 
related  programs. 


83.  Scene  of  family  literacy  program. 

The  library  itself  may  sponsor  classes  in  areas  such  as  parenting  skills,  English,  language  training, 
and  family  literacy. 


84.  Short  workshop  scenarios  in  the  Head  Start  classroom  that  will  show  a  librarian  interacting  with  Head 
Start  teachers  and  staff  on  the  topics  discussed  in  the  narration. 

(Section  title:  “Technical  Assistance  for  Head  Start  Staff.”) 

The  children’s  librarian  and  library  resources  can  also  help  you  do  better  what  you’re  already 
doing.  Requesting  special  workshops  is  an  excellent  way  to  increase  the  skills  of  your  staff  and 
classroom  volunteers. 


85.  Workshop  in  progress. 

(Discussion:  “Follow-up  materials  for  Spaghetti,  I  Say  book  including  graph  and  Venn  diagram.”) 

Library  workshops  can  help  you  identify  learning  experiences  in  your  curriculum  using  library 
books  and  other  materials.

thinking.  Books  and  various  related  objects  are  on  the  table. 

(Discussion:  “Concept  books  like  Whose  Shoe?  can  help  children  use  their  imagination.  Follow  up  with 
Shoe  Tic-Tac-Toe.”) 

Another  library  workshop  focus  can  be  the  use  of  books  in  the  development  of  creative  thinking. 


276 


Appendix  B 


86a.  The  same  workshop  turns  to  the  topic  of  self-evaluation:  “Let’s  identify  some  objectives  so  that  we 
can  evaluate  how  we’re  doing.  What  are  some  objectives  we  should  include?” 

Based  on  goals  and  objects  you  establish,  workshops  can  help  identify  ways  of  evaluating  the 
success  of  what  you  are  doing  with  library  materials.

The  library  can  also  help  you  expand  activities  that  help  children  focus  on  the  enjoyment  of  books 
and  reading. 


89.  Teacher  handing  over  a  list  to  a  librarian.  The  librarian  is  at  the  computer  surrounded  by  book 
catalogs. 

And  when  you  decide  to  add  to  your  permanent  book  collection,  coordinating  book  selection, 
ordering  and  purchasing  with  your  library  partner  may  provide  you  with  a  broader  selection  and 
price  benefits. 


90.  Closing  statement  supported  by  a  montage  from  all  of  the  segments. 

What  children  gain  from  living  with  books  is  a  desire  to  explore  a  world  much  larger  than  their 
own,  a  sense  of  identity  and  confidence,  and  a  sense  of  who  they  can  become. 

Acquiring  a  love  for  literature  is  the  most  powerful  incentive  for  children  to  become  lifelong 
readers  and  writers.

Grant  Proposal  for  the  Museum  and  Library  Services’ 
Museum  Leadership  Initiative 

Rockford,  Illinois 


[This  grant  proposal  submitted  for  an  Institute  of  Museum  and  Library  Services  Museum  Leadership 
Initiative  in  1998  has  been  granted  the  requested  funds,  beginning  October  1,  1998,  through  September 
1999.  It  demonstrates  a  further  step  in  developing  and  expanding  a  Library-Museum-Head  Start 
Partnership  Project.] 


Abstract 

Discovery  Center  Museum,  Rockford  Public  Library,  and  City  of  Rockford  Head  Start  are 
pursuing  this  grant  offering  to  implement  a  project  that  will  expand  our  long-term  partnership  in  a 
way  that  will  create  a  better  living  environment  in  our  community  for  families  served  by  Head 
Start.  We  seek  grant  funds  to  underwrite  a  cohesive  array  of  programmatic  activities,  interrelated  on 
different  levels,  while  working  toward  the  time  when  such  costs  would  be  included  in  our  yearly 
operating  budgets. 

The  goals  of  this  grant  project  are  to  raise  the  awareness  among  Head  Start  parents,  children, 
and  staff  that  learning  is  fun  and  enjoyable  and  lasts  a  lifetime,  to  motivate  parents  served  by  Head 
Start  to  use  museum  and  library  facilities  independently  and  competently,  and  to  sensitize  museum 
and  library  staff  to  the  special  needs  of  families  served  by  Head  Start.  A  shared  goal  of  our 
organizations  is  to  build  linkages  and  partnerships  that  serve  low-income  families. 

This  project  has  five  objectives: 

1 .  To  continue  existing  classroom-based  programs  of  field  trips  to  and  site  visits  from  the 
Discovery  Center  and  Library. 

2.  To  develop  cross-training  opportunities  for  Museum  floor  and  education  staff,  Library 
public  service  staff,  and  Head  Start  social  service  and  teaching  staff,  directed  toward 
creating  a  comfortable  and  inviting  environment  at  our  facilities  for  Head  Start  families. 

3.  To  strengthen  the  parent-involvement  component  of  the  project  by  hosting  “Parents  Night 
Out”  for  each  Head  Start  site  and  a  follow-up  Family  Fun  Day  at  Discovery  Center 
Museum. 


279 


4.  To  refine  methods  of  evaluation  for  the  program,  with  pre/post  surveys  and  a  revised  Club 
Card  approach,  using  information  gained  from  discussions  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council, 
a  parent  group. 

5.  To  develop  a  casebook  documenting  our  experiences  and  providing  suggestions  for 
developing  similar  partnerships  within  other  communities. 


Description  of  Current  Collaboration 

Introduction  to  Rockford,  Illinois,  and  Collaborating  Agencies 

Rockford,  Illinois  (population  142,000),  is  Illinois’  second  largest  city,  and  mirrors  United 
States  Census  averages,  falling  one  or  two  percentage  points  on  either  side  of  the  median  in  every 
respect. 

Discovery  Center  Museum  attracts  over  135,000  visitors  annually  with  18,000  square  feet  of 
indoor  interactive  exhibitions  and  an  8,000-square-foot  science  park.  Our  mission  statement  reads: 
“Discovery  Center  is  a  participatory  museum  created  to  provide  hands-on  learning  experiences  for 
visitors  of  all  ages.  Our  exhibits  and  programs  provide  an  enriching,  challenging,  and  fun 
environment  to  stimulate  curiosity  and  promote  interest  in  the  arts  and  sciences.”  The  museum 
opened  to  the  public  in  1981,  and  serves  three  primary  target  audiences:  families,  school  groups, 
and  under-served  populations.  Our  commitment  to  being  accessible  to  all  people  has  led  us  to 
initiate  a  variety  of  programs  to  make  this  commitment  real.  We  are  open  free  to  the  public  one  day 
a  week.  We  seek  out  partnerships  with  many  community  agencies  who  serve  low-income  and 
minority  participants  and  offer  programs  in  the  museum  and  through  outreach  including  tuition  free 
summer  camps,  youth  internships,  science  outreach  in  community  centers,  and  community-wide 
festivals  and  events.  With  an  operating  budget  of  $750,000,  58%  of  which  is  earned  through 
admissions,  gift  shops  sales,  and  program  fees,  Discovery  Center  has  a  strong  financial  base.  Our 
museum  has  experience  in  collaborative  projects  locally,  statewide,  and  nationally.  We  have  a  full 
time  staff  of  10  and  an  additional  part  time  staff  of  16. 

Rockford  Public  Library  consists  of  a  centrally  located  main  library  and  five  branches.  Our 
mission  is  “to  inform,  educate,  entertain,  and  provide  cultural  enrichment  to  people  of  all  ages 
throughout  our  service  area.  The  Library  must  educate  the  community  in  the  value  and  use  of  its 
resources.”  Last  year,  people  checked  out  over  1  million  items,  got  answers  to  136,000  questions, 
and  enjoyed  1,800  programs.  The  Youth  Services  Division  presented  795  programs  with  an 
attendance  of  16,748  children  and  parents.  Rockford  Public  Library’s  Youth  Services  Division 
recognizes  the  importance  of  welcoming  all  children  into  the  world  of  language  and  learning. 

City  of  Rockford  Head  Start  will  serve  544  families  in  1998-99.  Department  of  Children  and 
Family  Services  has  identified  1,200  children  under  the  age  of  five  in  the  Rockford  area  who  are  in 
families  with  incomes  that  place  them  below  the  poverty  level.  Head  Start  is  governed  by  the  Head 
Start  Policy  Council,  which  consists  of  a  minimum  of  51%  parents  representing  all  aspects  of  Head 
Start,  49%  community  members,  and  the  Head  Start  director  who  serves  ex  officio.  The  overall  goal 


280 


Appendix  C 


of  the  Head  Start  program  is  to  bring  about  a  greater  degree  of  social  competence  in  children  of 
low-income  families.  Social  competence  means  the  child’s  every-day  effectiveness  in  dealing  with 
both  the  present  environment  and  later  responsibilities  in  school  and  life.  Social  competence  takes 
into  account  the  inter-relatedness  of  cognitive  and  intellectual  development,  physical  and  mental 
health,  nutritional  needs,  and  other  factors  that  necessitate  a  developmental  approach  to  helping 
children  achieve  this  goal.  The  Head  Start  program  is  family  centered  and  is  designed  to  foster  the 
parent’s  role  as  the  principal  influence  on  the  child’s  development  and  as  the  child’s  primary 
educator,  nurturer,  and  advocate. 

The  Discovery  Center  Museum  and  Rockford  Public  Library’s  Main  Library  are  conveniently 
located  three  blocks  from  each  other  in  downtown  Rockford,  an  area  that  houses  the  largest 
percentage  of  low-income  families  in  the  city.  In  addition,  all  Head  Start  sites  are  relatively  close  to 
one  of  Rockford  Public  Library’s  five  branch  locations. 

Birth  and  Growth  of  a  Partnership 

Recognizing  similarities  in  our  missions  and  realizing  that  we  share  the  very  important  goal  of 
nurturing  life-long  learners,  Discovery  Center  Museum,  Rockford  Public  Library,  and  City  of 
Rockford  Head  Start  began  a  three-way  collaboration  in  April  of  1995  at  the  Library-Museum- 
Head  Start  Partnership  Project  Region  V  workshop,  sponsored  by  the  Library  of  Congress  Center 
for  the  Book  in  St.  Paul,  Minnesota.  The  guiding  vision  of  our  collaboration,  expressed  in  our 
Agreement  of  Intent  to  Collaborate  (adopted  July  1996),  is  that  families  served  by  Head  Start  use 
the  museum  and  library  independently  for  recreation  and  information;  children  and  families  see  that 
literature  is  relevant  and  can  increase  their  quality  of  life;  and  parents  interact  with  their  children 
playfully  and  with  curiosity,  understanding  that  play  is  the  best  way  for  children  to  grow  physically, 
intellectually,  socially,  and  emotionally.  Our  agencies  have  engaged  in  the  following  activities  over 
the  past  three  years: 

•  Implementation  of  a  pilot  project  focusing  on  the  educational  component  of  Head  Start,  which 
turned  into  a  regular  program  of  site  visits  and  field  trips  to  and  from  the  museum  and  library. 

•  Adopted  a  formal  “Agreement  of  Intent  to  Collaborate,”  outlining  our  shared  purpose  and  goals. 

•  Presented  at  the  National  Association  for  the  Education  of  Young  Children  Annual  Conference 
and  the  Illinois  Family  Literacy  Conference  about  how  collaborations  develop. 

•  Hosted  “Head  Start  Family  Fun  Day”  at  the  Discovery  Center  Museum. 

•  Instituted  “The  Club” — an  initiative  to  encourage  families  to  enjoy  the  museum  and  library, 
using  specially  designed  cards  that  alert  staff  that  families  are  from  Head  Start. 

•  Surveyed  a  sample  of  Head  Start  parents  about  their  family’s  use  of  the  museum  and  library. 

Our  planning  team  continues  to  meet  regularly  to  review  our  goals,  assess  the  progress  of  our 
partnership,  and  review  needs  for  special  funds.  Because  we  are  committed  to  working  together  to 
meet  the  needs  of  Head  Start  families,  most  of  the  activity  of  this  collaboration  has  been  funded  by 
the  operating  budgets  of  our  three  agencies.  An  area  of  continued  need  is  financial  support  for 
admission  fees  for  Head  Start  field  trips  and  whole  family  activities  at  Discovery  Center,  as  well  as 


Appendix  C 


281 


staff  support  for  site  visits  from  Discovery  Center  to  Head  Start.  In  1997-98,  site  visits  to  Head 
Start  from  Discovery  Center  and  field  trips  from  Head  Start  to  Discovery  Center  were  funded  in 
part  by  a  start-up  grant  from  the  Ronald  McDonald  House  Charities.  We  continue  to  meet  regularly 
to  explore  our  short-term  funding  needs  and  seek  special  opportunities  such  as  this  IMLS  grant 
offering  to  enhance  our  effectiveness  in  serving  this  important  population  while  we  work  toward 
long-term  funding  of  our  programs  through  our  general  operating  budgets. 

Included  in  the  attachments  is  a  copy  of  our  Agreement  of  Intent  to  Collaborate,  as  well  as 
newspaper  and  newsletter  articles  about  some  of  our  activities. 


Narrative 


Reason  for  Request 

Discovery  Center  Museum,  Rockford  Public  Library,  and  City  of  Rockford  Head  Start  are 
pursuing  this  grant  offering  to  implement  a  project  that  will  expand  our  long-term  partnership  in  a 
way  that  will  create  a  better  living  environment  in  our  community  for  families  served  by  Head 
Start.  We  seek  grant  funds  to  underwrite  a  cohesive  array  of  programmatic  activities,  interrelated  on 
different  levels,  while  working  toward  the  time  when  such  costs  would  be  included  in  our  yearly 
operating  budgets. 

A  shared  goal  of  our  organizations  is  to  build  linkages  and  partnerships  that  serve  low-income 
families.  Head  Start  family  resource  workers  do  a  needs  assessment  with  individual  families  at  the 
beginning  of  each  school  year,  which  identifies  how  families  use  community  resources.  Of  the  512 
families  served  by  Head  Start,  we  estimate  that  less  than  2%  come  to  the  library  or  go  to  the 
Discovery  Center  independently  on  a  frequent  basis.  Efforts  to  track  use  of  the  museum  and  library 
during  the  1997-98  school  year  indicate  very  low  usage  by  Head  Start  families,  as  well  as  a  lack  of 
awareness  about  what  these  organizations  have  to  offer. 

Museum  and  library  use  has  a  positive  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  of  users  and  in  turn 
improves  the  quality  of  life  of  the  community.  People  who  use  the  museum  and  library  practice 
self-determination  in  making  choices  about  what  activities  to  do  and  what  materials  to  select,  which 
contributes  to  a  healthy  sense  of  control,  freedom,  and  satisfaction.  The  goals  of  this  grant  project 
are  to  raise  the  awareness  among  Head  Start  parents  and  children  that  learning  is  fun  and  enjoyable 
and  lasts  a  lifetime,  to  motivate  parents  served  by  Head  Start  to  use  museum  and  library  facilities 
independently  and  competently,  and  to  sensitize  museum  and  library  staff  to  the  special  needs  of 
families  served  by  Head  Start.  The  following  narrative  explains  how  we  arrived  at  these  goals,  and 
outlines  a  plan  for  their  achievement. 

Assessment 

From  the  beginning  of  our  collaborative  work  together,  anecdotal  information  told  us  that 
families  served  by  Head  Start  felt  “put  off  by  the  museum  and  library — that  the  museum  was  “for 
other  people,”  and  that  the  library  was  “intimidating.”  Earlier  surveys  of  broader  but  corresponding 


282 


Appendix  C 


populations  and  discussions  with  community  groups  indicated  similar  feelings.  Further  discussions 
with  a  variety  of  Head  Start  parents  reveal  a  lack  of  motivation  to  access  our  services.  While  we 
have  steadily  worked  toward  the  goal  of  encouraging  independent  use  of  the  museum  and  library 
since  our  collaborative  relationship  began,  and  while  we  have  sought  to  identify  and  remove  the 
kind  of  perceptual  barriers  noted  above,  our  most  current  information  tells  us  that  a  majority  of 
Head  Start  families  still  do  not  use  our  facilities  or  services.  In  the  first  phases  of  our  collaboration, 
we  focused  on  the  relationships  between  the  staff  of  our  three  agencies  and  direct  service  to  the 
Head  Start  children.  To  strengthen  this  project,  we  intend  to  build  strong  relationships  with  the 
parents. 

Three  jointly  planned  activities  in  the  1997-98  school  year  have  helped  us  gauge  how  parents 
actually  feel  about  the  museum  and  library  and  how  much  they  use  it. 

In  the  first  activity,  Head  Start  teachers  administered  a  survey  to  a  sample  of  parents  from  three 
classrooms  at  one  site  during  home  visits  in  October.  The  survey  asked  about  frequency  of  visits, 
what  people  liked  about  our  agencies,  and  what  kept  them  from  using  our  facilities.  Sixty  percent 
said  they  never  go  to  the  Discovery  Center  Museum.  Then,  80%  indicated  that  they  would  like  to 
go  once  a  month.  When  asked  “What  keeps  you  from  going  to  the  Discovery  Center  Museum?” 
33%  said  they  never  thought  about  going  before  and  26%  said  they  did  not  know  that  admission 
was  free  on  Thursdays.  With  the  Library,  33%  reported  that  they  never  go  or  had  not  been  in  years. 
Half  reported  that  they  would  like  to  go  about  once  a  week  and  the  other  half  reported  that  they 
would  like  to  go  about  once  a  month.  Not  having  enough  time  was  the  most  frequently  reported 
reason  that  kept  parents  from  the  Library.  Thirteen  percent  indicated  that  transportation  was  a 
problem  in  getting  to  the  Museum  or  Library.  A  large  portion  (40%)  found  library  staff  helpful  and 
the  Discovery  Center  atmosphere  inviting.  When  asked  “What  attracts  you  to  the  library?”  63% 
said  reading  is  important  and  they  want  their  children  to  read.  When  asked  “What  attracts  you  to  the 
Discovery  Center?”  53%  said  they  like  to  do  fun  things  with  their  child.  We  believe  this  survey 
measured  perception  more  than  reality.  It  tells  us  that  parents  like  the  idea  of  visiting  the  Discovery 
Center  Museum  and  the  Library. 

In  the  second  activity,  we  attempted  to  track  families’  use  of  our  organizations  by  encouraging 
Head  Start  parents  to  pick  up  special  “Club  Cards”  from  their  child’s  teacher  for  use  at  the  museum 
and  library.  The  cards  listed  a  variety  of  things  to  do  at  either  facility.  Parents  would  leave  the  card 
at  the  museum  or  library  after  checking  off  activities  that  they  participated  in  and  pick  up  another 
card  before  their  next  visit.  These  cards  were  then  forwarded  to  Head  Start  staff  who  kept  track  of 
their  use,  looking  especially  for  repeat  visits.  Staff  at  the  museum  and  library  agreed  to  spend  extra 
time  with  families  who  presented  the  cards  to  make  sure  they  felt  welcome  and  were  comfortable  in 
their  surroundings.  Cards  were  used  only  five  times  at  the  Discovery  Center  and  nine  times  at  the 
Library  in  all  of  the  1 997-98  school  year. 

The  third  planned  activity  was  Head  Start  Family  Day  at  the  Discovery  Center  Museum.  On  this 
day,  staff  of  all  three  organizations  hosted  299  children  and  180  adults  from  Head  Start  who  were 
given  free  admission  to  the  museum.  Along  with  the  many  interactive  exhibits,  we  offered  hands-on 
activities,  refreshments,  science  kits  to  take  home,  storytelling,  and  door  to  door  transportation.  We 
used  this  large  gathering  of  Head  Start  families  as  an  opportunity  to  offer  library  card  registration. 


Appendix  C 


283 


Twenty-five  families  registered  for  library  cards.  We  far  exceeded  our  goal  for  the  event,  which  was 
to  attract  15%  of  families  served  by  Head  Start. 

We  conclude  from  these  activities  and  from  information  from  Head  Start  Policy  Council  that 
parents  need  incentive  and  personal  encouragement  to  come  to  the  museum  and  library.  Once  here, 
they  are  usually  amazed  at  what  they  have  been  missing.  We  believe  that  there  is  a  large  amount  of 
goodwill  toward  the  museum  and  library  among  parents  served  by  Head  Start.  Clearly,  the 
anecdotal  information  that  indicated  people  were  “put  off  by  our  organizations  is  not  true  for  all 
parents.  Motivation  to  get  to  the  museum  and  library  and  information  about  using  our  facilities 
seem  to  be  the  greater  factors. 

Project  Objectives 

This  project  has  five  objectives: 

1 .  To  continue  existing  classroom-based  programs  of  field  trips  to  and  site  visits  from  the 
Discovery  Center  and  Library. 

2.  To  develop  cross-training  opportunities  for  Museum  floor  and  education  staff,  Library 
public  service  staff,  and  Head  Start  social  service  and  teaching  staff,  directed  toward 
creating  a  comfortable  and  inviting  environment  at  our  facilities. 

3.  To  strengthen  the  parent-involvement  component  of  the  project  by  hosting  “Parents  Night 
Out”  for  each  Head  Start  site  and  a  follow-up  Family  Day  at  Discovery  Center  Museum. 

4.  To  refine  methods  of  evaluation  for  the  program,  with  pre/post  surveys  and  a  revised  Club 
Card  approach,  using  information  gained  from  discussions  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council,  a 
parent  group. 

5.  To  develop  a  casebook  documenting  our  experiences  and  providing  suggestions  for 
developing  similar  partnerships  within  other  communities. 

The  Partnership  Planning  Team  is  responsible  for  scheduling  and  implementing  all  activities. 
This  team  includes  the  Head  Start  Education  Coordinator,  Head  Start  Parent  Involvement 
Coordinator,  Discovery  Center  Early  Childhood  Education  Coordinator,  and  Library  Youth 
Services  Manager.  The  planning  team  will  depend  on  input  for  each  activity  from  meeting  with  the 
Head  Start  Policy  Council.  (Note:  the  following  list  of  activities  is  in  numerical  order,  not 
chronological  order.  For  project  chronology,  see  schedule  of  completion.) 

Objective  1:  To  expand  existing  classroom-based  programs  of  field  trips  to  and  site  visits  from 
the  Discovery  Center  and  Library. 

This  objective  meets  the  goal  of  raising  children’s  awareness  that  learning  is  fun  and  enjoyable 
and  lasts  a  lifetime.  Field  trips  and  site  visits  serve  children  directly.  Head  Start  parents  tell  us  that 
enthusiasm  generated  by  these  activities  spills  over  into  the  home,  with  children  asking  parents  to 
bring  them  back  to  Discovery  Center  and  the  Library  and  telling  them  about  what  they  learned  that 
day.  Reciprocal  field  trips  and  site  visits  also  increases  the  children’s  comfort  level  with  the

museum  and  library  as  children  become  familiar  with  museum  and  library  “friends”  (staff)  and 
surroundings. 


Activity7 1:  Field  Trips  from  Head  Start  classrooms  to  Discovery  Center. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  school  year,  Head  Start  schedules  two  field  trips  per  classroom,  one  in 
the  fall  and  one  in  the  spring.  Field  trips  feature  Tot  Spot,  the  early  childhood  area  of  Discovery 
Center,  and  last  about  one  hour.  Discovery  Center  staff  facilitate  children’s  involvement  with  the 
activities  and  exhibits. 

Admission  fee:  544  students  @  S2  per  student  x  2  trips  =  $2,224 
Transportation:  28  classrooms  x  $90  per  trip  x  2  trips  =  $5,040 
Discovery  Center  Staff  Salary:  56  visits  x  $10  per  hour  x  1.5  hours  =  $840 


Activity  2:  Field  Trips  from  Head  Start  to  Library. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  school  year,  Head  Start  schedules  three  field  trips  per  classroom.  Field 
trips  feature  story  time,  which  includes  book  sharing,  language  play,  songs,  puppets,  and  an 
occasional  short  video. 

Transportation:  28  classrooms  x  $90  per  trip  x  3  visits  =  $7,560 

Library  Staff  Salary:  84  visits  x  $1 1  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $1,848 

Activity  3:  Site  Visits  from  Discovery7  Center  to  Head  Start. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  school  year,  Discovery  Center  schedules  two  site  visits  to  each  Head 
Start  classroom,  one  in  the  fall  and  one  in  the  spring.  Site  visits  include  a  45-minute  hands  on 
science  activity  session  and  a  “Teacher  Packet”  with  lesson  plans  for  follow  up  activities  and  an 
item  for  classroom  science  centers. 

Discovery  Center  Early  Childhood  Education  Coordinator  salary:  60  visits  x  2  hours  x  $15  per 

hour  =  $1,800 

Teacher  Packets:  16  teachers  x  $10  =  $160 

Materials  and  Supplies:  544  children  x  2  visits  x  $1  =  $1,088 


Activity  4:  Site  Visits  from  Library  to  Head  Start. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  school  year,  the  Library  schedules  two  site  visits  to  each  Head  Start 
classroom,  one  in  the  fall  and  one  in  the  spring.  Site  visits  include  a  30-minute  storytime  of  book 
sharing,  fingerplays,  songs,  and  language  games. 

Library  Staff  Salary:  60  visits  x  2  hours  x  $1 1  per  hour  =  $1,320 


Appendix  C 


285 


Objective  2:  To  develop  cross-training  opportunities  for  Museum  floor  and  education  staff 
Library  public  service  staff  and  Head  Start  social  service  and  teaching  staff  directed  toward 
creating  a  comfortable  and  inviting  environment  at  our  facilities . 

This  objective  meets  the  goal  of  sensitizing  staff  to  the  needs  of  families  served  by  Head  Start, 
and  raising  Head  Start  staffs  awareness  of  Museum  and  Library  services  about  and  increasing  the 
competence  with  which  staff  [members]  use  them. 


Activity  5:  Half-day  workshop  presented  to  Museum  and  Library  staff  by  Head  Start  staff 
about  low-income  family  needs. 

While  staff  at  both  the  Museum  and  Library  have  had  regular  customer  service  training  as  well 
as  cultural  diversity  training,  we  recognize  a  need  for  additional  training  in  working  directly  with 
Head  Start  families  to  create  the  most  comfortable,  welcoming  environment  for  them.  Specifically, 
we  want  to  help  staff  foster  the  parent’s  role  as  the  principal  influence  on  the  child’s  development. 

Head  Start  Presenter  Salary:  2  presenters  x  $20  per  hour  x  8  hours  =  $320 
Library  Staff  Salary:  25  staff  x  $1 1  per  hour  x  4  hours  =  $1,100 
Discovery  Center  Staff  Salary:  8  staff  x  $10  per  hour  x  4  hours  =  $320 


Activity  6:  Head  Start  staff  in-service  at  Museum. 

The  in-service  includes  an  orientation  to  the  museum  as  well  as  time  for  staff  to  explore 
interactive  exhibits  at  their  own  pace.  This  will  allow  Head  Start  staff  to  experience  the  importance 
of  learning  through  play  in  the  museum.  We  hope  from  this  experience  that  teachers  will  help 
involve  parents  and  children  in  the  same  kind  of  play  during  subsequent  field  trips  and  visits.  The 
museum  in-service  will  also  provide  teachers  with  the  museum’s  schedule  of  events  and  exhibits 
for  the  year. 

Museum  Presenter  Salary:  1  presenter  x  $20  per  hour  x  4  hours  =  $80 

Head  Start  Staff  Salary:  19  teachers  x  $13  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $494 

Activity  7:  Head  Start  staff  in-service  at  Library. 

The  in-service  includes  an  orientation  to  the  library,  specifically  geared  toward  supporting 
teacher’s  classroom  needs.  How  to  search  for  materials  using  the  computer  catalog  will  be  featured, 
and  teachers  will  participate  in  an  activity  allowing  them  to  use  the  catalog  to  help  create  a  lesson 
plan.  The  in-service  will  also  cover  selection  of  high  quality  materials  for  classroom  use,  as  well  as 
an  overview  of  library  services  related  to  the  Museum/Library/Head  Start  collaboration. 

Library  Presenter  Salary:  1  presenter  x  $20  per  hour  x  4  hours  =  $80 

Head  Start  Staff  Salary:  19  teachers  x  $13  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $494

Appendix  C 


Objective  3:  To  strengthen  the  parent-involvement  component  of  the  project  by  hosting  “Parents 
Night  Out”  for  each  Head  Start  site  and  a  follow-up  “Family  Fun  Day ”  at  Discovery  Center 
Museum. 

This  meets  the  goal  of  motivating  parents  served  by  Head  Start  to  use  museum  and  library 
facilities  independently  and  competently. 

Activity  8:  Meet  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council  to  plan  “Parent’s  Night  Out.” 

The  idea  of  “Parent’s  Night  Out”  is  to  increase  the  comfort  level  of  parents  at  the  museum  and 
library.  Based  on  surveys  and  family  interviews,  we  determined  that  a  large  number  of  families  had 
not  visited  either  place.  Although  they  thought  it  would  be  worthwhile,  they  had  not  taken  the 
initiative  to  visit  on  their  own.  We  will  create  incentive  to  visit  the  museum  and  library  by 
extending  a  special  invitation  to  parents  and  attempting  to  eliminate  any  barriers  they  might  have. 
Barriers  that  parents  on  the  Head  Start  Policy  Council  had  mentioned  were  transportation,  fatigue, 
and  spending  more  time  watching  their  children  than  experiencing  the  museum  or  library.  We  plan 
to  have  door-to-door  transportation,  family  dinner,  and  then  child  care  at  the  Head  Start  sites, 
freeing  up  parents  to  have  their  own  first-hand  experiences  at  each  facility.  After  dinner,  parents 
will  be  transported  from  Head  Start  sites  to  the  museum  and  library.  They  will  get  a  brief 
orientation  at  each  site  and  would  be  encouraged  to  play  in  the  Tot  Spot  and  other  areas  of  the 
Discovery  Center,  and  to  explore  the  children’s  game  computers,  Internet  computers,  CDs,  videos, 
and  other  features  and  resources  of  the  Library.  To  motivate  parents  to  visit  the  museum  with  their 
children  after  Parent’s  Night  Out,  parents  will  be  given  a  free  family  pass  for  each  parent  attending, 
with  a  one-month  expiration  date  to  encourage  its  early  use.  Parent’s  Night  Out  would  occur  in  the 
fall  toward  the  beginning  of  the  school  year. 


Activity  9:  Host  Parent’s  Night  Out  at  Discovery  Center  Museum. 

After  Hours  Museum  Rental:  $350 

Family  Pass  for  future  visit:  75  families  x  $10  per  family  =  $750 
Transportation:  5  buses  *  $90  =  $450 

Head  Start  Staff  Salary:  20  staff  *  $13  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $560 
Dinner:  225  people  x  $2  =  $450 


Activity  10:  Host  Parent’s  Night  Out  at  Library. 

Transportation:  5  buses  x  $90  =  $540 

Head  Start  Staff  Salary:  27  staff  x  $13  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $702 
Dinner:  225  people  x  $2  =  $450 

Library  Staff  Salary:  2  staff  x  $1 1  per  hour  x  2  hours  =  $44 


Appendix  C 


287 


Activity  11:  Meet  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council  to  plan  “Head  Start  Family  Fun  Day.” 

The  idea  behind  Family  Fun  Day  is  to  give  more  families  exposure  to  the  museum.  Since 
exhibits  and  programs  change  frequently  at  the  Discovery  Center,  this  additional  opportunity  for 
families  to  enjoy  the  museum  shows  parents  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  museum.  The  Head  Start 
Policy  Council  would  like  to  preview  the  activities  for  the  science  kits  and  create  the  promotional 
activities  that  will  entice  parents  to  come. 

Activity  12:  Host  “Head  Start  Family  Day”  at  Discovery  Center  Museum. 

This  event  will  take  place  in  mid-winter,  a  time  when  families  have  said  they  look  forward  to 
something  special  to  do.  The  staff  of  all  three  organizations  will  participate.  Door  to  door 
transportation  will  be  offered. 

Admission:  180  families  w/  3  people  per  family  =  540  x  $2  per  person  =  $1,080 

Learning  Kits:  180  families  x  $2  per  kit  =  $360 

Refreshments:  540  people  x  $l  per  person  =  $540 

Promotion  and  Postage:  $225 

Additional  Museum  Staff:  3  staff  x  2  hours  x  $15  per  hour  =  $90 

Library  Staff:  2  staff  x  2  hours  x  $14  per  hour  =  $56 

Transportation:  1  bus  @  $90 

Objective  4:  To  refine  methods  of  evaluation  for  the  program ,  with  pre/post  surveys  and  a  revised 
Club  Card  approach ,  using  information  gained  from  discussions  with  Head  Start  Policy 
Council. 

Keeping  in  mind  the  need  for  confidentiality  of  Head  Start  families,  Head  Start  Family 
Resource  Workers  will  share  results  of  their  initial  yearly  needs  assessment  with  the  partnership 
planning  team  in  order  to  refine  our  surveys. 


Activity  13:  Administer  pre/post  survey  about  Museum  and  Library  use. 

Surveys  will  be  administered  to  all  families  by  Head  Start  Family  Resource  Workers  during 
home  visits  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  school  year.  The  survey  will  be  developed  by  the 
partnership  planning  team. 

Duplication  costs  for  Activities  13  through  17:  $175 

Activity  14:  Revise  Museum  and  Library  Club. 

Although  the  percentage  of  return  of  the  Museum  and  Library  Club  Cards  was  very  low  in  our 
pilot  year,  the  Head  Start  Policy  Council  has  encouraged  us  to  revise  the  distribution  system  and 
continue  the  activity.  The  implementation  plan  for  the  coming  year  is  for  Head  Start  Family 
Resource  Workers  to  distribute  club  cards  to  parents  at  the  home  visit  in  which  the  initial  survey  is 
given. 


288 


Appendix  C 


Activity  15:  Administer  evaluation  after  “Parent’s  Night  Out.” 

Parents  will  be  asked  to  fill  out  an  evaluation  at  the  end  of  Parent’s  Night  Out,  while  still  at  the 
Museum  or  Library.  The  partnership  planning  team  will  compile  the  results  of  the  evaluation. 

Activity  16:  Meet  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council  to  evaluate  “Parent’s  Night  Out.”  The 
partnership  team  will  report  the  results  of  the  evaluation  to  the  Policy  Council,  and  with  the  help  of 
the  Policy  Council,  analyze  them. 


Activity  17:  Administer  evaluation  after  “Head  Start  Family  Fun  Day.” 

Head  Start  Family  Resource  Workers  will  do  a  short  interview  with  those  parents  who  attended 
the  Family  Fun  Day  at  the  next  home  visit  after  the  event  and  report  the  results  to  the  partnership 
planning  team. 


Activity  18:  Meet  with  Head  Start  Policy  Council  to  evaluate  “Head  Start  Family  Day,” 
using  interview  results  and  Policy  Council  parents’  own  experience  with  the  event. 

Objective  5:  To  develop  a  casebook  documenting  our  experiences  and  providing  suggestions  for 
developing  similar  partnerships  within  other  communities. 


Activity  19:  Partnership  team  meets  to  determine  format  and  content  of  casebook  and 
distribution  system. 

Working  with  the  Institute  of  Museum  and  Library  Services,  we  would  determine  an 
appropriate  clearinghouse  for  the  casebook.  Both  Discovery  Center  Museum  and  Rockford  Public 
Library  have  web  sites  which  could  include  the  casebook.  Both  organizations  annually  attend 
conferences  and  would  be  pleased  to  serve  on  panels  describing  our  experiences. 

Casebook  production  cost:  $15  per  book  x  10  books  =  $150 


Activity  20:  Partnership  team  meets  to  write  casebook. 

Community  Relation  Coordinator  of  Rockford  Public  Library  and  Marketing  Coordinator  at 
Discovery  Center  Museum  will  be  co-editors. 

Key  Personnel 

Key  personnel  for  the  project  are  Joanne  Lewis,  Head  Start  Education  Coordinator;  Debbie 
Beutel,  Discovery  Center  Early  Childhood  Education  Coordinator;  and  Andrew  Finkbeiner, 
Rockford  Public  Library  Youth  Services  Manager.  In  terms  of  administration,  the  Discovery  Center 
Museum  will  serve  as  the  fiscal  agent  and  project  coordinator.  Discovery  Center  has  an  experienced 
accountant  who  is  accustomed  to  doing  financial  records  for  federal  and  state  grants.  The  Rockford 
Public  Library  will  serve  as  meeting  facilitator.  Head  Start  will  serve  as  the  training  and  marketing 
coordinator.  For  qualifications  of  key  personnel,  see  attached  resumes.  Additional  personnel

involved  in  the  project  include  members  of  the  Head  Start  Policy  Council,  Discovery  Center 
education  staff  and  executive  director,  Rockford  Public  Library  Youth  Services  staff,  and  Head 
Start  faculty. 

Potential  for  Continuation 

Our  history  of  work  in  this  collaboration  demonstrates  the  commitment  of  our  agencies  to  work 
together  to  serve  Rockford’s  low-income  families.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  this  implementation 
year,  Head  Start’s  intention  is  to  secure  funding  for  continuing  field  trips  and  site  visits.  Discovery 
Center  Museum  and  Rockford  Public  Library  will  each  include  in  their  respective  2000  budgets 
funds  dedicated  to  personnel  and  materials  for  the  continued  growth  of  the  collaborative 
relationship.
