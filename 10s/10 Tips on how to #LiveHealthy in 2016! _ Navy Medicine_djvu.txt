Exercise  will  improve  your  overall  health.  It  also  helps  with  your  mental  health,  not  to  mention  the 
confidence  you  gain  from  taking  care  of  your  body.  Making  fitness  goals  a priority  between  two  or  more 
people  is  a great  because  you’re  able  to  hold  each  other  accountable  and  stick  to  your  goals  instead  of 
falling  off  the  wagon  because  no  one’s  watching.  Whatever  you  do  try  to  get  30-60  minutes  in  every  day. 
Check  out  this  31  day  challenge  from  Navy  Marine  Corps  Public  Health  Center. 

4.  Learn  about  your  family’s  medical  history

Knowing  your  family  health  history  is  important  when  setting  goals  for  your  health.  Talk  to  your  family 
and  talk  to  your  doctor.  Know  your  risks  and  learn  what  preventative  measures  you  can  take  to  stay 
healthy.  Check  out  the  CPC’s  family  health  history  resources. 

5.  Take  advantage  of  time  you  have  with  your  doctor,  ASK  QUESTIONS!

Ask  your  doctor  what  you  could  be  doing  to  live  healthier  and  commit  to  making  those  changes.  Also 
take  advantage  of  your  Personal  Health  Assessment  (PHA)  or  physical  exams  and  schedule  all  of  the 
available  screenings.  It’s  important  to  know  what’s  going  on  with  your  body.  You  only  have  one! 

6.  Make  time  for  your  family  and  friends

Sit  back  and  analyze  the  stressors  in  your  life.  Focus  on  ways  to  alleviate  or  eliminate  that  stress.  Are  you 
taking  on  too  many  projects?  Do  you  need  help  in  certain  areas  you’re  not  asking?  Take  inventory  of 
your  daily  activities  and  try  to  de-stress.  Also  make  sure  you’re  making  time  to  take  care  of  yourself  and 
do  things  you  enjoy.  See  where  you  fall  in  the  stress  continuum  with  this  graphic  from  Navy 
Operational  Stress  Control. 

8.  Write  your  goals  down  and  make  them  public — get  buy  in!

Talking  to  others  about  your  goals,  even  if  they’re  not  participating  with  you,  helps  you  achieve  your 
goals  and  stick  to  them. 

9.  Ask  for  help

The  reality  is,  any  type  of  lifestyle  change  is  going  to  be  challenging,  but  nothing  worth  having  comes 
easy.  Some  days  will  be  easier  than  others..  You’ll  perform  better  some  days  and  not  so  well  on  others 
but  what’s  important  is  just  getting  through  today.  Start  your  journey,  and  continue  to  challenge  yourself. 
Remember  if  you  put  your  heart,  mind,  and  strength  into  anything  you  do,  nothing  is  impossible.
