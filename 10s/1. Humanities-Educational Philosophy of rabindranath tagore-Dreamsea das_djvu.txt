ABSTRACT 

Rabindranath  Tagore  was  a  universal  personality.  His  genius  was  versatile.  He  was  influenced  by  the  Christian 
conception  of  the  fatherhood  of  God  and  by  Shakespeare,  Goethe,  Wordsworth  etc.  But  the  roots  of  his  intellectual 
creativism  and  emotional  make-up  lie  in  the  Upanishads,  in  the  poetry  of  kalidas,  in  the  lyrics  of  Vaisnavas,  in  the  mystic 
poems  of  Kabir  and  the  religious  atmosphere  of  the  Brahmo  Samaj.  Tagore' s  inspired  poetry  and  prose  becomes  the 
literary  vehicle  of  the  regeneration  of  a  fallen  race.  His  songs  and  messages  were  like  inspirations  to  social  and  political 
workers.  Tagore  was  venerated  as  a  seer  of  Indian  freedom.  Apart  from  his  political  and  social  thoughts  his  educational 
thoughts  were  also  standing  as  a  landmark  in  the  educational  system  of  India.  He  tried  to  give  India  an  educational  system 
which  can  meet  the  spiritual  and  natural  needs  of  human  beings.  The  objective  of  the  paper  is  to  analyse  the  educational 
thoughts  of  Tagore,  his  basic  conception  of  education  and  its  process.  The  paper  is  primarily  based  on  secondary  sources 
like  the  Books,  Journals  and  Articles  etc.  The  method  used  is  historic-analytic  method.  Tagore  was  a  great  champion  of 
education  for  international  understanding.

INTRODUCTION 

Rabindranath  Tagore  was  a  universal  personality.  His  genius  was  versatile,  synthetic  and  original. 
He  was  influenced  by  the  Christian  conception  of  the  fatherhood  of  God  and  might  have  been  inspired  in  his  early  years  by 
Shakespeare,  Goethe,  Wordsworth,  Ruskin,  Shelley,  Keats  and  Browning.  But  the  roots  of  his  intellectual  creativism  and 
emotional  make-up  lie  in  the  Upanishads,  in  the  majestic  poetry  of  kalidas,  in  the  lyrics  of  Vaisnavas,  in  the  mystic  poems 
of  Kabir  and  the  religious  atmosphere  of  the  Brahmo  Samaj. 

Different  philosophers  have  described  the  character  of  Tagore's  philosophy  differently.  Hirendrenath  Datta 
describes  his  philosophy  as  Concrete  Monism.1  It  is  monism  because  reality  is  conceived  as  one,  and  it  is  concrete  because 
the  one  reality  is  not  an  abstract  principle  negating  completely  the  reality  of  the  many,  but  is  a  concrete  whole, 
comprehending  the  many  within  its  bosom.  Radhakrishnan  says,  "We  do  not  know  whether  it  is  Rabindranath' s  own  heart 
or  the  heart  of  India  that  is  beating  here.2  Tagore  in  his  philosophy  tries  to  revive  the  ancient  ideals  of  life;  and  then,  they 
have  been  re-stated  in  accordance  with  the  needs  of  the  present  times.  The  traditional  philosophical  notions  of  India  have 
been  brought  out  by  Tagore  from  the  dark  abyss  of  abstraction,  where  they  were  lying  all  the  time,  into  the  open  to  be 
viewed  in  the  light  of  the  present  philosophical  beliefs. 

Tagore  was  a  writer  of  deep  originality  and  creative  attainments.  He  was  a  patriot.  During  the  day  of  the  agitation 
against  the  partition  of  Bengal  his  stirring  words  rang  with  strength  and  he  was  later  on  venerated  as  a  national  poet. 
He  stood  for  social  reform,  Swadeshi  and  the  solidarity  of  the  country.  He  was  not  a  politician  but  a  political  prophet  who 
taught  unity,  harmony  peace  and  co-operation.  He  has  given  to  modern  India  a  philosophy  of  world-and-life-affirmation.3

Dreamsea  Das 


Rabindranath  was  a  believer  in  cultural  synthesis  and  international  unity.  He  decried  the  aggressive  cult  of  the 
nation.  He  became  one  of  the  intellectual  leaders  of  Indian  nationalism.  After  Bankim  Chandra  Chatupadhya,  it  was  he 
who  strengthened  the  movement  of  Bengalee  literary  renaissance.  This  literary  renaissance  was  the  intellectual  background 
of  a  political  ferment  and  consciousness.  Tagore's  inspired  poetry  and  prose  becomes  the  literary  vehicle  of  the 
regeneration  of  a  fallen  race  because  in  his  writings  he  embodied  some  of  the  noblest  ideals  of  Indian  culture. 
His  songs  and  messages  were  like  inspirations  to  social  and  political  workers.  Hence,  although  not  in  the  trick  of  the 
political  fight  for  independence,  Tagore  was  venerated  as  a  seer  of  Indian  freedom.4 

Apart  from  his  political  and  social  thoughts  his  educational  thoughts  were  also  standing  as  a  landmark  in  the 
educational  system  of  India.  He  tried  to  give  India  an  educational  system  which  can  meet  the  spiritual  and  natural  needs  of 
human  beings. 

METHODOLOGY 

The  present  paper  is  primarily  based  on  secondary  sources  like  the  Books,  Journals  and  Articles  etc. 
The  method  used  is  historic-analytic  method. 

Objective  of  the  Paper 

•     The  objective  of  the  paper  is  to  analyse  the  educational  thoughts  of  Tagore.  His  basic  conception  of  education  and 
its  process. 

SOCIAL  VALUE  OF  THE  STUDY 
Educational  Philosophy 

Tagore  was  one  of  the  great  educational  thinkers  of  the  world.  "Tagore  was  undoubtedly  the  greatest  leader  of  the 
Indian  Renaissance  and  his  influence  was  felt  in  all  sides  of  our  culture.  Education  did  not  escape  it".  Tagore  wrote 
130  essays  covering  about  1750  pages  on  education.  In  1892  his  Article  on  education  entitled  "Sikshar  Herpher"  was 
published  which  created  considerable  stir  in  the  field  of  education. 

Rabindranath  had  understood  that  the  educational  system  the  British  had  enforced  on  India  was  meant  only  to 
train  people  to  work  as  clerk  in  their  offices,  and  if  possible,  to  inculcate  in  the  so-called  educated  men  a  feeling  of 
inferiority  for  their  own  culture  and  philosophy.5  For  this  reason  Tagore  pleaded  for  an  education  system  in 
India  independent  of  colonial  British  control.  This  idea  of  Rabindranath  gave  birth  to  "Santiniketan"  (abode  of  peace)  an 
Ashrama  style  educational  institution  in  which  he  provided  education  based  on  the  principle  of  freedom,  natural  trust, 
co-operation  and  joy.  In  his  opinion  child's  education  would  be  more  effective  if  teachers  and  pupils  live  and  work  far 
away  from  din  and  bustle  of  the  city,  like  the  teachers  and  students  of  the  past.  He  says,  "this  school  should  be  home  and  a 
temple  in  one  where  teaching  should  be  a  part  of  worshipful  life".  Placing  teachers  above  the  method  of  teaching 
Tagore  said — 

"The  fact  that  education  is  something  vital  makes  the  teachers  duties  and  responsibilities  deserving  of  serious 
attention.  The  teachers  should  know  that  it  is  for  him  to  inspire  life  in  the  students  by  his  own  living  to  enkindle  the  flame 
of  knowledge  in  the  students  by  his  own  knowledge."

Rabindranath  introduced  some  cultural  subjects  in  his  educational  institution  like  singing,  dancing,  painting, 
acting  etc.  because  he  believed  that  education  is  a  process  of  upholding  the  creative  abilities  of  children  and  not  a  process 
which  merely  concerned  with  bookish  learning.  He  had  no  faith  in  rigorous  method  of  teaching  and  was  not  in  favour  of 
making  the  path  of  knowledge  a  very  smooth  one. 

In  keeping  with  his  theory  of  subconscious  learning,  Rabindranath  never  talked  or  wrote  down  to  the  students, 
but  rather  involved  them  with  whatever  he  was  writing  or  composing.  The  students  were  allowed  to  have  access  to  the 
room  where  he  read  his  new  writings  to  teachers  and  critics,  and  they  were  encouraged  to  read  out  their  own  writings  in 
special  literary  evenings.  In  teaching  also  he  believed  in  presenting  difficult  levels  of  literature,  which  the  students  might 
not  fully  grasp,  but  which  would  stimulate  them.  The  children  were  encouraged  to  follow  their  ideas  in  painting  and 
drawing  and  to  draw  inspiration  from  the  many  visiting  artists  and  writers. 

There  is  a  touch  of  mysticism  in  Tagore's  philosophy  of  education.  But  his  mysticism  is  healthier  than  that  of 
Froebels  who  limited  it  only  to  childhood.  Tagore  brought  their  mysticism  to  the  level  of  realities  of  life  and  included  in  it 
all  the  stages  of  education.  It  is  in  this  respect  he  was  ahead  of  Pestalozzi  experience,  that  is,  elementary  and 
pre-elementary  stages  of  educative  experience. 

Tagore  was  a  spiritualist  in  education.  Generally,  naturalism  discards  transcendental  experiences. 
Tagore  was  a  naturalist  but  his  naturalism  was  not  a  narrow  one.  It  was  a  sort  of  means  to  spiritualism  which  he  wanted  to 
develop  among  the  boys. 

Tagore  was  a  great  champion  of  education  for  international  understanding.  He  loved  his  nation  and  wanted  to 
improve  its  conditions  but  in  this  connection  his  nationalism  was  not  a  narrow  one.  His  patriotism  and  nationalism  leads  to 
internationalism.  He  regarded  the  world  as  one  and  enables  us  to  feel  that  we  have  to  develop  respect  for  world  citizenship 
also.
