000 Acres Burned 


Fire Losses Hit $3.5 Million 


By irene Pettyjohn 

The most destructive forest fire in Crawford County history 
swept through the area last Tuesday, May 8, destroying homes 
and outbuildings valued at nearly $3.5 million. The DNR said 
the fire was started by “human activity.” 

The DNR is expected to release results of its investigation into 
the cause of the fire on Friday, May 18. 

Miraculously, the only fire related injury reported was 
smoke inhalation by a fireman who was treated and released 
from Mercy Hospital. The injury occurred during the evacu- 
ation effort when the fireman pushed open a door and was met 
with a thick cloud of black smoke. 

The DNR estimates the fire burned more than 5,000 acres 
destroying 81 residences (year-round homes, vacation homes, 
cabins and mobile homes), 115 outbuildings, and 37 motor 
vehicles such as snowmobiles, OR V’s, boats, trucks, and cars.

sor Curt Marshall estimated that approximately 3,500 acres 
was residential acreage valued at about $850,000. (Sce page 
3 for the names of fire victims and a description of property 
destroyed by the fire.) 

DNR fire officer Duane Brooks said the fire could be the 
most expensive forest fire in Michigan’s history. 

He said the fire appeared to have started off Thendara Road 
and burned out of control from about 3:56 to 11 p.m. The fire 
traveled in a north casterly direction for about nine milcs 
jumping Stephen Bridge Road just south of the bridge, the 
AuSable River at Guides Rest, and North Down River Road 
twice beforc it was contained ina swampy arca near Dyer Trail. 
It was finally extinguished by heavy rains on Thursday. 

Govermor James Blanchard declared the county a disaster 
area at about 10:50 p.m. on Tuesday and he and DNR director 
David Hales visited the burned area on Wednesday afternoon. 


Designation as a disaster arca will allow victims to apply for 
State aid to ielp with reconstruction efforts. 

DNR fire fighting units from all over northern and north 
central Michigan were calicd in to battle the blaze. Volunteer 
fire departments from surrounding counties, as well as every 
fire dept. in Crawford County assisted in the fire fighting effort. 
The Michigan National Guard fire unit assisted with men and 
equipment. An Ohio National Guard helicopter crew fought 
the fire with their Bambi Bucket until additional helicopters 
could be flown in by the Michigan National Guard. Eventually 
three buckets were used to carry water to the fire, 

The Crawford County Sheriff Dept. was assisted by the 
Michigan State Police, military MP’s, and sheriff departments 
from several neighboring counties. Conservation officers 
were called in from all over northem Michigan. 

About 150 persons worked together to evacuate the arca, 


Losses at $500,000 
south Branch Fire 


Burns 615 Acres 


At the same time fire fighters were fighting the big fire, two 
smaller fires were buming in South Branch Township. 

DNR officials believe a downed power line started the fire 
on Sunrise Road of f Mc Masters Bridge Road that bummed about 
15 acres, The third fire was located in the Indian Glens 
subdivision, near the Roscommon County line and bummed 
about 615 acres before fire fighters were able to bring it under 
control, 

The Indian Glens fire was spotted at 5:06 p.m. by the DNR 
aimlanc. Tt was contained at 4:30 a.m. 

“The rain at 8:30 that night really contained the fire,” said 
Jim Fisher, DNR fire supervisor, “but we didn’t call it con- 
tained until we had a line around the fire.” 

Tisher said an initial estimate of structure damage, suppres- 
sion costs and timber damage is $500,000. He said one pole 
bam contained nine snowmobiles, four ORV's and several 
pieces of heavy equipment. 

“Those kinds of losses add up fast,” he said. 

Property destroyed in South Branch Township included five 
motor homes, ten travel trailers, 15 sheds, one automobile, two 
pole bams and one garage. Property damaged included a travel 


trailer, cabin and one home. 

Fisher said one travel trailer that was thought to have 
survived the fire burned the following day when temperatures 
built up inside the trailer causing it catch fire. He said firemen 
saw smoke coming from the trailer, but it had already been 
gutted, 

Most of the property destroyed in South Branch Township 
was privatcly owned, Fisher said he recommended that prop- 
erty owners conlacta consulting forester for advice on replant- 
ing the burned woodlands. 

Human activity was also cited by DNR officials as the cause 
of this fire. (See page 3 for damage and loss report.) 


“The rain at 8:30 that night really 
contained the [Indian Glens] fire,” said 
Jim Fisher, DNR fire supervisor. 


DNR fire officer Duane Brooks said 
the fire could be the most expensive 
forest fire in Michigan’s history. 


contain the fire, and control traffic. Equipment at the fire 
included 73 tractors/plows and water units. 

More than 300 persons were evacuated Tuesday aftemoon. 
Shelter was provided at the Michelson Memorial United 
Methodist Church, the Grayling High School gymnasium and 
Camp Grayling. Some stayed with friends. 

Residents were allowed to return to the evacuated area about 
4 p.m. on Wednesday aftemoon. Some residents complained 
because they had been kept out of the area 17 hours after the fire 
had been contained, but Brooks said this was necessary to 
allow the electric utilities to make ensure that all downed 
power lines were shut off and to sure there was no further 
danger of propane gas tank explosions. 

Many of those who had been evacuated returned to find their 
homes as they had left them, but others found only ash where 
their homes once stood. 


Children Raise 
$305.98 For 
Fire Victims 


Age has not been a factor in the relief effort. 
Fifteen children, between the age of 6 and 19, sold 
cool aid, peanut butter cookies, and popcom on 
Saturday and Sunday, May 12 and 13, at the comer of 
North Down River and Wakeley Bridge roads. On 
Saturday, the children raised $38 and on Sunday they 
raised $267.98, The money was taken by several of 
the children to Rev, Robert Gordon and asked that it 
be used to help victims of the fire. Pastor Gordon said 
several of the children came from families who are 
themselves, victims of the fire, The children's names 
are: James Love 10, Marty 7, Kathi Oberg 16, Becky 
Oberg 15, Jill Love 12, Jody Love 6, Mike Green 12, 
Susan Dedafoe 11, Louie Kehr 10, Janise Dedafoe 9, 
Wendy Dedafoe 7, Joshua Sheldon 8, Michelle Oberg 
19, Chad Lingle 9, and Leah Lingle 12. 

Children from the Grayling Elementary School 
donated canned goods for the relief effort.

As soon as people in 
Crawford County learned of 
the seriousness of the fire and 
its affect on their neighbors, 
the community began looking 
for ways to help, 

LTC Waync Koppa, Camp 
Commander, open Camp 
Grayling’s barracks for about 
30 people Tuesday night. 
Glen’s Market offered grocer- 
ics to feed those who had been 
evacuated. 

Personnel from the 107 ist 
ran a shuttle bus between 
Grayling and Camp Grayling, 
and between buildings on the 
base. Bobby Martinez stayed 
atthe telephone, trying tohelp 
people calling the Camp lo- 
cate their familics and relay- 
ing messages. Area ministers 
were contacted to talk to the 
people. 

Clark’s and Mac's drug 
stores opened so that prescrip- 
tions left at home could be 
filted. Mercy Hospital offered 
free medical treatment to 


anyone suffering from inju- 


rics or illness caused by the 
fire and prepared break fast and 
dinner at the Knights of Co- 
lumbus hall on Thursday and 
Friday for fire victims. More 
than 2300 meals were served. 

Families from the Michel- 
son Methodist church invited 
evacuated persons into their 
homes, and area motels of- 
feredroomsatnocharge. Res- 
taurants prepared and deliv- 
ered food to the fire fighters 
and police agencics Tuesday 
night, and offered meals to 
fire victims. 


On Wednesday morning the 
Knights of Columbus hall be- 
came the community disaster 
relief center and representa- 
tives from the American Red 
Cross, Salvation Army, Dept. 
of Social Services, and insur- 
ance companies began meet- 
ing with people whose homes 
had been destroycd by the fire. 

Crawford County Emer- 
gency Management director 
Howard Taylor began com- 
piling information about the 
fire for state and federal agen- 
cies. 

Everyone who suffered any 
kind of loss as a result of 
Tuesday’s fire is being asked 
to report the loss to Taylor so 
that a total assessment of the 
damage caused by the fire can 
be compiled. Governmental 
agencies use this information 
to determine the area’s eligi- 
bility for low interest loans 
and grants, Fire victims are 
asked to report their losses 
even if they do not intend to 
requestany type of assistance. 

In addition to scores of lo- 
cal volunteers, about 25 Red 
Cross volunteers from all over 
Michigan arrived to help with 
the recovery effort. The Red 
Cross nurse came from Ne- 
braska. 

Throughout the week the 
numbers of homes lost and 
damaged and the number of 
persons affected by Tuesday’s 
fire continued to increase as 
people registered at the disas- 
tercenter. At Avalanche press 
time, the American Red Cross 
had registered 50 families. 


Buildings 
In Clearings 
Fared Better . 


To the untrained observer, Tuesday’s fire appeared to jump 
around taking this house and that one, but leaving the house 
over there without rhyme nor reason, but according to DNR 
officials, in many cases there were precise reasons why some 
structures bumed and other did not. 

On Good Morning Michigan this week, Scott Heather, from 
the DNR Regional Headquarters in Roscommon, told viewers 
that buildings in clearings, away from pine trees, fared much 
better than those sitting in a wooded area. 

During the program, Heather suggested that homeowners 
cut pine trees back 75 feet from their structures and replace 
them with Iess flammable trees such as maples, oaks, and 
poplars. Shrubs should be not be planted next to buildings. 

Other suggestions included keeping wood piles away from 
buildings and leaving a hose connected to an outside faucet. 


Nese ch.

TOTAL LOSS..This is all that remained 


Thirty-seven familics reccived 
financial assistance from the 
Red Cross at a cost of more 
than $11,000. 

RaxAnn Adams, a volun- 
teer at the center, said their 
records indicated that 48 ycar- 
round residences were com- 
pletely destroyed by the fire, 
Icaving 136 persons homeless. 
The estimated value for these 
homes is $3,675,780 and she 
said that estimate is probably 
tow. 

Adams said the estimated 
loss for both destroyed and 
damaged property is well over 
$4.5 million. She said nearly 
400 people have been affected 
by the fire. 

The good news is there 
appears to be all kinds of as- 
sistance available to fire vic- 
tims through the American 
Red Cross, Salvation Army 
and DSS, but people must 
come into the disaster center 
as soon as possiblc and regis- 
ter with the various agencies 
there, 

“If they don’t come in to see 
us,” said Darlene Adas, a Red 
Cross family services officer, 
“we don’t know they need 
help.” 


Funds are available for 
security deposits, appliance 
replacement, utility bills, re- 
location expenses and other 
needs for those who qualify. 


Emotional support was 
made available to Grayling 
Elementary School students 
on Wednesday following the 
fire from the school district's 
social worker, Donna 
Ribaudo, and Craig Hexham, 
of New Life Community Serv- 
ices. Children were encour- 
aged to talk about the fire and 
Ribaudo and Hexham were 
there to answer questions. 
Counselors at the Grayling 
High School also met with 
students whose homes were 
destroyed. 


Further support will be 
available on Monday, May 21, 
at9a.m., when Kristi McKen- 
zie from the Lutheran Social 
Services of Michigan, holds a 
seminar on crises gricf recov- 
ery at the Grayling Holiday 
Inn. Rev, Robert Gordon, 
pastor of St. John’s Lutheran 
Church, said school counsel- 
ors, clergy, or anyone in a po- 


|Community Support Poured In 


sition to counsel victims of 
the fire are encouraged to at- 
tend. 

Food, clothing, furniture 
and monctary donations have 
been arriving ona daily basis. 
A Petoskey radio station is 
putting on a fund raiser for 
Crawford County with 
$10,000 as its goal. The Gray- 
ling Lions Club has offered 
$3,000 and the Quality North 
Chevrolet Dealerships do- 
nated $5,000. 


Assistant animal control of- 
ficer Dixie Lobsinger was at 
the Crawford County Animal 
Shelter Tuesday night to ac- 
cept pets from persons evacu- 
ated from their homes. She 
said ten puppics and a yellow 
lab were brought in for tem- 
porary housing. 

Lobsinger said she is com- 
piling a list of missing and 
found pets from the area in the 
hope that she can help reunite 
pets and their masters who 
were separated during the fire. 

Anyone missing a pet or find- 
ing a stray animal is asked to 
contact Lobsinger at the shel- 
ter. 


CLOUDS OF SMOKE A The billowing clouds smoke that rose above 


the tree tops warned residents for miles that a major forest fire was ripping 
through the county. The smoke could be smelled in Grayling.

Opinions 


O rthern Views 


By Jon Thompson 
Here are ten things!’ carry with me from that tragic fire: 

1. Anyone who felt or saw that horrible wind pushing 
the forest fire knows how lucky we are that no human life 
was lost. 

2. Atonc point Tuesday aftemoonon May 8 there were 
two large fires in Grayling Township, one large fire in 
South Branch, and several smal! ones along Arrowhead 
Rd. One fire was moving toward Lovells and the South 
Branch and Arrowhead fires were pointed in the direction 
of Grayling. As strong as the wind was blowing and as dry 
as this county has been, guess what scary thoughts started 
creeping into people’s thoughts? 

3. Our policemen, DNR conservation officers, DNR, 
Camp Grayling, township, and city firefighters put in 
some heroic efforts. Please store that in your memorics. 

4. At ncarly the same time Tuesday night that some 
people were actually praying for the rain to hit the fire 
area, the first reports of looting came in. I was madder 
than hell. But later on it became apparent the number of 
good people wanting to help outnumbered the looters 
probably 10,000 to 10. 

5. The millions of dollars lost may grab headlines but 
the losses that seem to hurt the most are the possessions 
lost that hold special memories. Possessions treasured 
because they can never be replaced. 

6. I don’t agree with letting the Governor and media 
into the area before the homeowners. Homeowners 
deserve to be put in front of politicians and media. 

7, “The 2nd week of May.” Thad an ecric feeling the 
first time in 1983 I heard DNR firefighter Duane Brooks 
say that the 2nd week in May has traditionally been the 
worst week of the year for fires in Crawford County. 
Almost all the big fires have struck during that one weck. 

8. We had that week’s newspaper just about finished 
Tuesday afternoon when the fire struck. Because of all 
the rumors flying around, we rebuilt pages to include a 
forest fire story, stayed up all night covering the action, 
and took the pages to the printer in Gaylord at 5:30 a.m. 
hoping to have newspapers back in Grayling earlier than 
usual for people wanting information. A part broke on 
the press and we didn’t get the newspapers back to town 
until 9:15 a.m. 

9. We have some of the most independent, stubborn 
people in the nation living in our county. But during a 
disaster, they're also the strongest, most determined, and 
even the most caring. 

10. Something that made the loss of all the homes, 
structures, possessions, pets, wildlife, and forests even 
tougher to swallow was an observation by Grayling 
firefighter Dean Goss on Wednesday after the fires: “If

Resource Review

Conservation Oficer 


The Stephan Bridge Road 
Fire of 1990 is now history, 
and a terrible memory for 
hundredsof people. As I write 
this, I do not know the final 
figure for lost homes, garages 
and property. Roughly 70 
structures with an estimate 
value of 2.5 million dollars 
were fost according to pre- 
liminary estimates. As greata 
tragedy as this is, it is nothing 
short of miraculous that there 
were no deaths or serious in- 
juries, This kind of wind 
driven wildfire can race at 
terrifying speed, consuming 
everything in its path. 

I honestly feel that deaths 
would have occurred had it 
not been for the efforts of a 
handful of Conservation Offi- 
cers and Sheriff's Deputies 
who risked their own lives to 

wam and evacuate residents 
in the path of the fire. I cannot 


this rain had come a day sooncr, all those houses and 
everything would still be here.” 


say enough about what the 
officers did to help the resi- 
dents of the area. 

Something else that most 
people do not realize is that 
we nearly lost a DNR pilot 
airplane. The Aircraft was 
working the fire when the 
engine quit at low altitude. 
The pilot was attempting to 
land on North Down River 
Road, but could not because it 
was filled with traffic. Mostly 
gawkers, Fortunately, he was 
able to restart the engine and 
barely made the Grayling 
Airport. 

DNR fire fighters were also 
at risk as they attempted to 
save what they could for 
people in the area. 

You may not like every- 
thing the Department of Natu- 
ral Resources does, but it is a 
public service agency. This 
was very evident in the late 
afternoon of May 8, 1990.

An Open Letter.To The Fire 
Victims: 

I am going to presume to 
speak for the rest of the com- 
munity, although I have no 
right, but I want you to under- 
stand how most of us feel. 
From the moment we heard of 
the devastating fire on Tucs- 
day, we have prayed for life 
and safety; we have agonized 
over how best to show our 
support when we realized what 
a truc tragedy it was going to 
be for so many people. 

By Wednesday everyone I 
know was either calling or 
showing up al the various re- 
lief agencies around town, 
saying “HowcanThelp? What 
can I do? What is needed?” 
And the answers were neither 
simple nor certain, because 
we could only imagine your 
loss, not having gone through 
it Ourselves. What we did 
know is how it feels to stand 
helplessly by while our friends 
and neighbors lose everything 
they have worked for all their 
lives. We had to do some- 
thing, but what? 

In most cases we have tried 
to find our own answers; 
money and household sup- 
plics, clothing and food came 


<i.

pouring in; churches were 
mobilized to handle the in- 
flux. The Knights of Colum- 
bus opened their hall to rescue 
workers, Red Cross and So- 
cial Services; volunteers 
manned phones and helped 
with Jogistics. Businesses, 
stores, the hospital, the Na- 
tional Guard, and others all 
began in their various ways to 
try to minimize the damage. 
People from other communi- 
tics throughout the state called 
— or came — or sent things, 
because they too, needed to 
do something. 

What prompted this Icttcr 
are (wo families I know of that 
were affected by the fire — 
onc is too proud to take “hand- 
outs”; another is hesitant, 
saying that “other people may 
need it worse than we do.” 
We are wondering if some of 
you might feel the way onc of 
these families does. Please 
don’t! We’re all in this world 
together, and when we’re up 
against forces we can’t con- 
trol, no one should have to — 
orshould try to— standalone. 

Many of youare covered by 
insurance and will eventually 
get your lives back on track. 
We're confident of that. 


BREAKFAST BREAK--Roger and Judy Heliste, of Detroit, (couple in foreground) and Patrick and — 


Peggy Sullivan, of Grayling, took a few minutes for breakfast at the KC hall Friday morning before they 
met with insurance agents at their properties on North Pine Road, 


Also, we know it's nol easy 
to accept “charity” — we all 
take pride in our self-suf- 
fiency, right? Butitshouldn’t 
be difficult to accept love, and 
such an outpouring of love 
and concern I have never seen 
before! Let us help you now, 
for our sakes, if not for your 
own. 

Take the moncy, the furni- 
ture, the clothes, the food, ctc., 
and rebuild your lives; some- 
day, when you're stronger, 
some of us will need to lcan on 
you, and we know you'll be 
there!

People Make 
Tragedy Easier 
To Accept 


Never ina million years did 
we think that the home we 
grew up in would be taken 
away from us, At such a dif- 
ficult and devastating time in 
our fife, so many people have 
meant so much and made this 
tragedy a little casier to ac- 
cept. We would like lo thank 
the Red Cross for all their 
assistance and caring, the 
churches for food, clothing 
and linen, and all the unmen- 
tioned for your love, support 
and kindness. We know say- 
ing “Thank You” may not be 
enough, buteverything you’ ve 
done has meant so much and 
we appreciate it more than we 
can express. You've made 
our life alot brighter with your 
help as we start to rebuild our 
life. Thanks to everyone who 

volunteered,

Editor: 

We wish to express our sin- 
cere gratitude for the way the 
public agencies and private 
sector pulled together on the 
recent wildfires in Crawford 
County. 

It would be impossible to 
name all who provided heavy 
equipment, water tankers, 
food, etc. Township fire de- 
partments, county sheriff, state 
police, National Guard, and 
others joined forces with the 
Department of Natural Re- 
sources to form a coordinated 
evacuation/fire suppression 
team. 

Similarly the townships, 
county, Red Cross, arca 
schools, and churches and 
many private businesses and 
individuals raltied to assist the 
familics who suffered the 
tragic loss of theirhomes. This 
effort continues. 

To all who have joined in 
this total community cffort 
Thank You.

Let's Talk About It 


By Joe Murphy 


The tragic fire that struck our area on the cighth of May 
was the most costly in property in our county’s history. 
But we can all be thankful that no lives were lost. ‘The fact 
that the number one priority was evacuating folks from 
the endangered arcas is highly commendable. Property 
can be replaced, human life can’t. Perhaps more could 
have been saved but at the cost of human lives. My heart 
goes out to those that lost their homes. But I feel a great 
deal of pride of the way folks pitched in to help their 
neighbors in their time of need. Fire departments from 
many surrounding towns were there to help. City Police 
Officer Dennis Long tells of while manning a road block 
a fire truck manned by two young ladies from Lewiston 
appeared through the heavy smoke. They asked him if 
there was a homie near by. He replied that one that might 
have already burned was back in ona ncarby road. They 
said they'd check and took off through the heavy smoke. 
He became worried when they didn’t come back and 
went in to find them busy saving the home. There were 
many acts of heroism on that tragic day. We should say 
a big Thank You to everyone who worked so hard to 
contain that terrible fire. 

The outpouring of aid for the fire’s victims again 
proves that concem and love for others is alive and well 
in this area. Sometimes we tend to feel that neighbor 
helping neighbor is a thing of the past. Then in times of 
need the outpouring of Christian love people demon- 
strate proves us wrong. To everyone who stepped for- 
ward to offer help to the fire’s victims another big Thank 
You for restoring my faith in human nature. 

Another point] wish to make is while we expect the fire 
department, the D.N.R., and the National Guard tocommit 
and endanger men and equipment.in fighting fire, there 
were many private contractors who furnished men and 
equipment to the fire suppression efforts, Again I feel we 
owe them a big Thank You. 

The local merchants were there to do all they could in 
supplying food both for the fire fighters and its victims. 
The school offered the victims a place of shelter. Again, 
Camp Grayling proved a good neighbor in opening 
buildings for the over flow from the school. The Red 
Cross was right on the job along with many others to 
serve the needs of those evacuated from the fire’s path. | 
know there are many that gave aid that I may have failed 
to mention. A Big Thank You To All Who Helped In 
Any Way On That Tragic Day And Its Aftermath, [am 
very proud to be a part of this arca and its caring people. 


1 think that full page ad that appeared in last week’s 
Avalanche was very impressive and will do much to 
show that Crawford County residents are not all anti 
Camp Grayling or industrial growth. Allof us wantto see 
our environment protected and improved but balanced by 
the reality of the need for growth and development. We 
cannot shut down all growth and stil! provide a livelihood 
for those younger folks that also wish to live here. The 
vast majority of our residents see the need for controls, 
and we have agencies charged with that responsibility; 
Ict’s give them a chance to do their job. | wish to Thank 
everyone who signed and or contributed to help pay for 
the ad, Thank You For Caring.

Mother Nature’s rain and cooler temperatures were ex-

DNR fire officer. 


were Cxtremcly helpful in extinguishing the fires. 

“If the rains had not come and the winds dicd down as they 
did,” he said, “the fire would have probably burned through the 
night and taken off and run all day the next day.” 

Brooks described the fire as “extremely dangerous.” High 
winds fanned the flames moving the fire approximately nine 
miles in about 4 1/2 hours. He said there were so many people 
involved in evacuating the area and the fire was spreading so 
fast, the chance of somcone getting trapped in the fire was a 
very real possibility. 

“Some people refused to move,” he said, “and we can’t 
make them leave. All we can do is warn them, give them the 
facts,” 

Grayling City and Township assistant fire chief Dean Goss 
said the intense heat and speed of the fire forced his firemen to 
get themselves and their equipment out of the Pappy’s Trait 
wea, abandoning sore of ihe hom s there, He said there were 
times when it was all they could do to stay ahead of the fire. 

Brooks said the heat from any forest fire is tremendous. The 
energy rcleascd can create a full size tornado. He said this 
forest fire burned so intensely that it disintegrated the struc- 
tures in its path, leaving only ash, cement work and scrap metal. 

Tucsday’s fire was a crown fire and Brooks said there is no 
technology known to fight a crown fire.

in northern Michigan. On May 8, 1968, fires in Beaver Creck

10, 1975, 3,598 acres burned in the Bald Hill area and an 
additional 2,802 acres burned on North Down River Road. 
More than 25,000 acres were destroyed in the Mack Lake, Mio, 
fire on May 5, 1980, and 1,931 acres were lost in Ogemaw

Brooks said the burning index on Tuesday afternoon was a

“That’s about as bad as it gets,” he said. 

Inan effort to save time should a fire be reported, Brooks had 
equipment standing by at Wakeley Bridge and M-72 East and 
at McMasters Bridge and North Down River Road. Even with 
these precautions, he said they lost time getting to the South 
Branch fire because the equipment at McMasters Bridge and s "a ote a : 

North Down River roads had to double back to Wakclcy Bridge [RES ' eS § =

What Comes Next in Aftermath of Fire? 


As residents begin the rebuilding process, cmergency serv 
ices in the county are moving fromm their mass care phase thu 
provided emergency shelters and dining hall meals to provid: 
ing individual and possibly long term assistance to the victims 
of last week's fire. 

Red Cross family services officer Darlene Adas said the Rea 
Cross has financial assistance available for temporary housing 
at area motels and hotels, and can also help with some or all of 
the cost of rebuilding for individuals with limited resources 
She said all assistance from the American Red Cross comics 


from: grants, aot loans, and does not require repayment. She 
said representatives from the national office would be in the 
arca as fong as they are needed. 

Donations of fort and clothing are no longer needed, but 
temporary housing that can be rented for three to six months 
while families rohuild is desperately needed. Especially hous- 
ing that will allow pets, 

Grayling Township assistant assessor Curt Marshall said 
mostof the peante he talked to intend to rebuild their homes as 
SOON as possible. Rebuilding the destroyed forests wilt take 


Some Residents Will Rebuild 


John Murray, a victim of the fire, who lost his home on the 
corner of Shaw Park and Stephan Bridge roads, said he had 
been told for years that Crawford County with all its Jack Pines 
was a prime candttate for a devastating forest fire, but said he 
never believed it. 

“Talways knew it was going to happen.” said PNR fire 
officer Duane Brooks. “I just didn’t know wher.” 

Murray said his insurance would not replace everything he 
had lost in the fire. He said he would be able to replace hishome 
and most of its contents, but not his garage or recreation 
vehicles. 

“PH rebuild,” he said, “but then Tam going to think seriously 
about putting the place up for sale. Two fires in three years is 
enough for me,” said Murray. 


A chimney is all that remains of Linda and John Speese’s 
house on North Down River Road. Linda and John tive in 
Oakland County and planned to retire in Crawford County in 
a few years, Besides their home, John said they lost 20 acres 
of woods that is now only a blackened graveyard of smolder-

gone, but nota single leaf on the peony that is located about | 
[72 foct from where the house stood is even singed,” 

Jonathan, Kimberly and six month old Amanda Weymers 
had vane downstate to pick up a bed, and returned to find that 
every thing but the bed had been destroyed by the fire. They did 
not have any tnsurance. 

“We were just getting started up here,” said 21-year old 
Jonathan. He said he was waiting untit he got a better job 
before he got homeowners insurance. 

Patrick and Peggy's mobile home was spared, but they lost 
their travel trailer and snowblower. Peggy said everything 
inside their home is covered with black smoke. They estimated 
their loss at $15,000. 

‘Two historic homes in the County were among the homes 
destroyed by fire, The Schreiber farm house, owned by Delbert 
Sheldon, was built in 1889 by Hugo Schreiber, Fay Bovee’s 
grandfather,

destroved. Both homes were located on North Down River

much longer, DNR officials are estimating reforestation will

Meanwhile Forestry Management ts busy taventorying the 
damaged forest and plans to offer the salvageahle timber for 
sale. 

Jim MeMittian, DNR forest manager, said damaged jack 
pines would be chipped and offered to cogeneration plants in 
Midland, Lincoln and Hillman. The larger red pines (over [0 
inches in diameter) will be sald for timber. Because of the 
threat of damage from bark beetles, Mc Millian said the timber 
harvest would have to take wilhin the next three weeks or so. 

Another victim of Tuesday's fire is the tiny Kirtland’s 
warbler. About a quarter of the “active” warbler habitat 
located on Bald Hill Road between Grayling and Lovells was 
destroyed as wellas about half of an “on-line” plantation being 
developed for future use. Dr. Sylvia Taylor, district wildlife 
biologist at Mio, said the burned portion of the plantation, 
planted this spring, had a value of about $50,000. 

“We would have lost a lot more active habitat if the new 
plantation hadn'tacted like a fire break," she said. “We cannot 
have fires like that.” 

In an effort to cut down the numbers of forest fires, Dr. 
Taylor said the DNR has developed the Kirtland’s Plan which 


Net 


a 


Biri, ‘E 


will provide more warbler habitat by keeping the forest young. 
She satd the plan is ideal because it will also provide the most 
production for timber and is the safest way to manage a jack 
pine forest. Since jack pines reforest themselves during a 
forest fire when the heat opens its pinecones spilling out the 
seeds, Dr. Taylor said the DNR will be artificially regenerating 
the forest by planting young trees. 

“T know people have a hard time with clear cutting,” said Dr. 
Taylor, “but these open areas serve as fire breaks and prevent 
large forest fires, like the Mack Lake fire.” 

What affect the lost Kirtland’s warbler habitat destroyed in 
Tuesday’s blaze will have on the endangered bird is still 
uncertain. Dr. Taytor said they will know more after they 
conduct their warbler census in June. She said she had not 
heard any Kirtland’s warblers prior to the fire, but when she 
toured the burned area on Monday, she heard them singing. 

Dr. Taylor said there is a Kirtland's habitat plantation near 
Red Oak and another near Lovells ready for the birds. 

The Kirtland’s warbler ts an endangered species that divides 
i lime between north central Michigan in the summer and the 
Bahamas during the winter. There are only about 200 pairs of 
the small birds feft. The birds usually return to Michigan 
during the second week in May.

Hell’s Fury © 


The fire struck like Hell's fury 

The quiet country side became a raging hell 
Billowing smoke filled the air 

Full of wood smoke’s srneil 


High winds in the jackpine forests 

Along with the weather being hot and dry 
sent the fire scampering here and there 
sending each containment plan awry 


Fire units from the near by area 
Came to help as good neighbors do 
The D.N.R. and the National Guard 
And some private contractors too 


Many homes were lost to the fire 
But their efforts saved quite a few 
Men working in that hot smoky hell 
Did all that men could do 


No lives were lost in the fire 

Thanks to the evacuation plan 

That was first to save propeny when possible 
But first of all save man 


When finally the fire was defeated 
With some help from the Man Above 
The fire’s victims could find solace 
In an out pouring of Christian love 


Folks rallied to help thelr neighbors 

In their great hour of need 

Hell’s fury may have destroyed those homes 
But God's love made folks pay heed

As summer approaches a few points to remem- 


ber about the family pet: 


1, Make sure your pet has plenty of water. 
2. Ifkeptoutside, make sure they have a shady 


area to lay in. 


3. Donot exercise your pet for prolonged peri- 
ods of time. A dog running with you jogging or 
retrieving a ball does not know when to stop. 

4. Comb out the winter coat your pet is now 
shedding or have them professionally groomed. 

5. Remember to have your dog tested for heart- 


worms.

Estimating crowds 
is guesswork 


{ SEE BY THE PAPERS that pro-life boosters are 
unhappy with crowd-estimaters at their recent rally in 


Washington. 


U.S. Park Police, usually quoted about such matters, 
estimated the pro-life crowd around Washington and 
Lincoln Memorial in Washington at 200,000, Pro-tifers 
think there were more people there... a fot more. 

Last spring, pro-abortion boosters held a similar rally 
in the same spot, and came away with a crowd estimate 
of 300,000. This year’s demonstrators obviously wanted 
to outdo that figure. 

“The reason for our rally was to show that we could 
outdo them by a factor of two or three, according to Dr, 
John Willke, president of National Right to Life. 

But the park police wouldn't cooperate. 


* ” * 


HOW MANY PEOPLE really were there? 


knows. 


Who 


According to the papers, rally planners wanted to study 
aerial photographs to try to document their claims of 
somewhere between 350,000 and 700,000 persons at the 
rally — safely above the pro-choice ruly, 

Syndicated columnist Joseph Sobran, apro-lite booster, 
recently cited a variety of figures. Cable News Network, 
he claimed, estimated the crowd at 60,000, Mr. Sobran, 


who admitted he was untrained in such matters, said he 
though there were “at least twice that many.” United 
Press International, Mr. Sobran wrote estimated 569,000. 

In a letter to the editor of The Lansing State Journal, 
one who said he attended the pro-life rally, Michael D. 
VanDyk of Lansing, clatmed he was “a lithe crowded” 
around the Washington Monument “because of the 
400,000 to 500,000 people “who were at the same spot. 

A spokesman for the Park Police, William Spruill, 
quoted in the Detroit Free Press, said: “We've been 
esumating crowds for over the past 30 years, since the 
early 60s. If the Park Police were going to be biased, we 
would always overestimate tL.” 


Columnist Sobran, an admitted conservative, hinted al 
some sort of a devious liberal pro-abortion plot, seeking 
lodownplay theefforsolthe pro-lifers and to mislead the 
publtc about the true depths of pro-life public support. 


* * * 


ESTIMATING CROWDS CAN be a tricky busi- 
ness. Usually itis a highly subjective procedure, and one 


guess Can be 


as good as the next. 


Most street reporters who cover events with lots of 
people involved, have personal experience making est- 


Males, 


When you try to guess how many persons attend a 
football game when the stadium is full, it’s simple. But 
when you estimate a crowd at an outdoor rally, or a 
festival, or a parade, you're really guessing. 

As a young teporter at The Holland Evening Sentinel, 
I covered several years of the world tamous Holland 


Tulip Festival. 


There were a lot of people at those 


festivals. Our newspaper always included a crowd est: 
mate, which | made, 

As good boosters of the festival, and the community, 
The Sentinel reported each year that this year’s crowd 
was the largest ever. Each vear had at feast a sdipht 
increase Over the previous year... uoless i rammed, of 


Course, 


Sooner of later, you run into Gouble that way. Ho your 
crowd figure is 100,000 this year, and 120,000 next year, 
and $30,000 the third, then one of these years you come 
up with figures that are obviously ludicrous, 


Ls * * 


BUT WHO CARES? Tosti amounts toa whale of a 


lol ot people, 


OF course, civic festivals and pro-life ralies are Iwo 
completely different matters, Ls casy tounderstand why 
the pro-hfers are upset Butas long as a dot of people 
tumed out, crowd estimates don’t imake alot of duller: 


enee, 


Whether CNN or the Park Police or conservative 
columnists or cub reporters make the estimates, reall, 
doesn "bE matter. 

Those who wantto believe will beheve anyway. ‘Those 
who don't, wort.

‘The Bible Speaks 


| John 1 5. 7 
Part #3 
Covering Sin 


To get Christian fellowship 
with God in perspective, we 
must look at the sin problem 
of man. The first principle we 
must recognizc is the holiness 
and perfection of God in con- 
trast to our sinfulness. “This 
then 1s the message which we 
have heard of him, and de- 
clare unto you, that God is 
light, and in him is no dark- 
nessatall.” (John 1:5). Light 
Pictures righteousness and 
darkness sin. John 3:18-22), 
We confess with Habakkuk, 
“Thou art of purer cyes than to 
bchold evil, and canst not look 
on iniquity...” (Hab. 1:13). 
God will not tolerate one sin 
in His presence. How then 
can we as sinners have fel- 
lowship with Him? 

The next thing we discover 
is the danger of an empty pro- 


fession. “If we say that we 
have feltowship withhim, and 
walk in darkness, we lic, and 
do not the truth.” (I John 1:6). 
[tis not how loud we shout, or 
how cloquently we speak that 
gives evidence of our {ellow- 
ship with God. The practice 
of sin in our daily lives proves 
us liars, and shows to the whole 
world that our faith is empty 
and vain. This kind of empty 
hypocrisy has done morc to 
harm the cause of Christianity 
than any other trick of Satan. 

The key to Christian fel- 
lowship is walking inthe light 
of God’s Holy Scriptures. 
“But if we walk in the light, as 
he is in the light, we have 
{cllowship one with another, 
and the blood of Jesus Christ 
his Son cleanseth us from all 
sin.” (If John 1:7). [tis the 
shed blood of Jesus Christ for 
our sins which saved us, and it 
is His shed blood which daily 
cleanses us from sins of igno- 
rance. To live above sin, it 


From Calvary Rapier. Church 


would be necessary to know 
every teaching in the Bible 
perfectly, and obey everything 
in the Bible perfectly by 
thought, word, and deed. 
Since this is humanly impos- 
sible, God made provision for 
our sins of ignorance as we 
walk in fellowship with Him. 
We then pray the Psalmist, 
“Who can understand his er- 
rors? cleanse thou me from 
secret faults,” (Psalms 19; 12). 

Only the shed blood of Je- 
sus Christ can cover our sins 
and give us fellowship with 
God. You may go to a psy- 


chologist who tells you that . 


you have no sins. You may 
look at society and believe sin 
is right if enough people prac- 
tice it. You may justify your 
sin by pointing back to your 
family or environmental roots. 
You may blame the peer group 
which influenced you to fol- 
low the practice of some cer- 
tain sin, Butone thing isclear, 
you cannot be in fellowship 


with God and live with the 
practice of known sin in your 
daily life. “He that covercth 
his sins shall not prosper: but 
whoso confesseth and for- 
saketh them shall have 
mercy.’ (Pro. 28:13).
