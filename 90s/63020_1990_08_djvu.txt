In the twelve months since the August 1989 reference 
date: 


* average weekly ordinary time eamings of full-time 
adult employees have increased by 6.4 per cent. 


* average weekly ordinary time earnings of full-time 
adult females have increased at a slightly higher 
rate (6.8%) than for males (6.5%). 


* average weekly ordinary time earnings of full-time 
adult employees have increased at a higher rate in 
the public sector (7.6%) compared with the private 
sector (5.7%). 


* average weekly total earnings for all males have 
increased at a significantly higher rate in the public 
sector (7.1%) than in the private sector (6.6%). 
Similarly, average weekly total earnings for all 
females in the public sector (7.3%) increased at.a 
aad higher rate than in the private sector 

170). 


© States that increased by more than the national 
average for full-time adult ordinary time earnings 
in the year to August 1990 were Victoria (7.0%), 
Queensland (6.9%), South Australia (7.3%), 
Western Australia (7.9%), Tasmania (6.9%), the 
Northern Territory (6.9%) and the Australian Capi- 
tal Territory (6.8%). 


Notes on the estimates 

The movements between May 1990 and August 1990 of 
employee average earnings at the national level were 
Statistically significant for all categories of employees ex- 
cept for average weekly total earnings of full-time adult 
males and all males. 


Supplementary information obtained during the survey 
(which should be regarded as indicative only) suggests 
that approximately 54 per cent of full-time adult 
employees had received an increase for the second instal- 
ment of the August 1989 National Wage Case decision.

ORDINARY TIME EARNINGS OF FULL-TIME 
ADULT EMPLOYEES, AUGUST 1990 


NSW eeee 
Vic. |- 
Qld }- 




















These movements were influenced by the flow-through of 
the second increase handed down in the National Wage 
Case decision of August 1989. This decision allowed for 
an increase of $15.00 (or 3%, whichever is greater) for 
skilled workers, $12.50 for semi-skilled workers and 
$10.00 for unskilled workers. 


Where a flat dollar increase was awarded, the increase for 
lower paid employees was proportionally more than for 
higher paid employees. 





Many factors can cause increases in estimates of average 
weekly eamings. The major factor is National Wage Case 
decisions which directly influence award rates of pay and 
ordinary time earnings. A recent history of National Wage 
Case decisions is listed at the back of this publication. 


Average weekly earnings may be affected significantly in 
some periods by changes in the composition of the 
employed labour force (see paragraph 8 of the Ex- 
planatory Notes). 


NOTE: The statistics of Average Weekly Eamings are compiled from data obtained from a sample survey of 
employers. Refer to Paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Notes (page 10) for information regarding the sampling frame 


_used by this survey, and the possibility of future revisions.

EXPLANATORY NOTES 


Introduction 

This publication contains estimates of average weekly 
earings for August 1990 based on information obtained 
from a sample survey of employers. 


Coverage Adjustment 

2. This survey uses as its sampling frame the ABS’s 
register of businesses which is regularly updated to take 
account of new businesses and businesses ceasing opera- 
tion, A major source of information on new businesses is 
group employer (GE) registrations with the Australian Tax 
Office. The ABS is developing an improved computerised 
system which will reduce the delay in new businesses 
from this source being recorded on the register, while at 
the same time undertaking an analysis to identify busi- 
nesses which have been omitted from the register in the 
past. During the time these improvements to the register 
are being implemented, it has been necessary to tem- 
porarily suspend updating the register from GE 
registrations. The effect is that the survey will not repre- 
sent new GE businesses in the period June to December 
1990. The non-representation of these units would have a 
major effect on the estimates only if the average weekly 
earnings of such units is significantly different from that 
of the rest of the population. This is considered unlikely, 
and so no adjustment has been made to the estimates in 
this publication. However, when the improvements to the 
business register have been completed in 1991 the series 
in this publication for the period June to December 1990 
will be reassessed using information that will then be 
available concerning new GE businesses. If necessary, 
revisions will be made to the data at that time. 


3. Background information about the average weekly 
earnings series is provided in Information Paper: New 
Statistical Series: Employment, Average Weekly Earnings, 
Job Vacancies and Overtime (6256.0) published on 21 
June 1984, copies of which are available on request. 


Scope of the survey 


4. All wage and salary earners who received pay for the 
reference period are represented in the survey, except: 


* members of the Australian permanent defence for- 
ces; 


* employees of enterprises primarily engaged in 
agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; 


© employees in private households employing staff; 
* employees of overseas embassies, consulates, etc.; 
* employees based outside Australia; and 


* employees on workers’ compensation who are not 
paid through the payroll. 


5. Also excluded are the following persons who are not 
regarded as employees for the purposes of this survey: 


© directors who are not paid a salary; 


© proprictors/partners of unincorporated businesses; 
and 


© self-employed persons such as subcontractors, 
owner/drivers, consultants and persons paid solely 
by commission without a retainer. 


Definitions 

6. Weekly ordinary time earnings refers to one weck’s 
eamings of employces for the reference period attributable 
to award, standard or agreed hours of work. It is calcu- 
lated before taxation and any other deductions (e.g. 
superannuation, board and lodging) have been made. In- 
cluded in ordinary time earnings are award payments; 
base rates of pay; overaward payments; penalty payments; 
shift and other allowances; commissions and retainers; 
bonuses and similar payments related to the reference 
period; payments under incentive or piccework; payments 
under profit-sharing schemes normally paid each pay 
period; payments for leave taken during the reference 
period; all workers’ compensation payments made through 
the payroll; and salary payments made to directors. Ex- 
cluded are overtime payments; retrospective pay; pay in 
advance; leave loadings; severance, termination and 
redundancy payments and other payments not related to 
the reference period. 


7. Weekly total earnings of employees is equal to 
weekly ordinary time earnings plus weekly overtime carn- 
ings. 


8. Average weekly earnings statistics represent average 
gross (before tax) carnings of employees and do not relate 
to average award rates nor to the earnings of the ‘average 
person’. Estimates of average weekly earnings are derived 
by dividing estimates of weekly total earnings by es- 
timates of employment. Changes in the averages may be 
affected not only by changes in the level of eamings of 
employees but also by changes in the overall composition 
of the labour force. There are several aspects which can 
contribute to compositional changes such as variations in 
the proportions of part-time, casual and junior employees, 
variations in the occupational distribution within and 
across industries and variations in the distribution of 
employment between industries. 


9. Employees refers to all wage and salary eamers (as 
defined in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Explanatory Notes) 
who received pay for any part of the reference period. 


10. Full-time employees are permanent, temporary and 
casual employees who normally work the agreed or award 
hours for a full-time employee in their occupation and 
received pay for any part of the reference period; if agreed 
or award hours do not apply, employees are regarded as 
full-time if they ordinarily work 35 hours or more per 
week, 





11. Adult employees are those employees 21 years of age 
or over and those employees who, although under 21 
years of age, are paid at the full adult rate for their oc- 
cupation. 


12. Reference period for the survey refers to the last pay 
period ending on or before the third Friday of the middle 
month of the quarter. The reference date for the current 
survey is 17 August 1990. 


13. Sector. Public sector includes local government 
authorities and all government departments, agencies and 
authorities created by, or reporting to the Commonwealth 
and State Parliaments. All remaining employees are clas- 
sified as private sector. 


Survey design 

14. A sample of approximately 4,800 employers is 
selected from the ABS register of businesses to ensure 
adequate State and industry representation. The sample is 
updated each quarter to reflect changes in the ABS 
register of business units. These changes arise from the 
emergence of new businesses, takeovers and mergers, 
changes to industry classification, changes in the number 
of employees, and businesses which have ceased opera- 
tions. Such updating of the register can contribute to 
changes in the estimates of average weekly earnings. 


15. Recently the ABS has introduced new definitions 
and rules for recording units on the register with greater 
emphasis being given to the way organisations are struc- 
tured and the type of data available from businesses’ 
accounts. These changes should reduce respondent load 
and lead to improved data quality. In order to correctly 
apply these new rules the ABS is undertaking a program 
of visits to the largest private and public sector organisa- 
tions in Australia to obtain up to date information on the 
Structure and operations. The outcome of these visits and 
the adoption of new units definitions may result in chan- 
ges in the survey estimates as outlined in paragraph 6 
above. Amendment to the register is expected to be spread 
over the next several quarters. 


16. The statistical unit for the survey comprises all ac- 
tivities of an enterprise in a particular State or Territory. 
Each statistical unit is classified to an industry which 
reflects the predominant activity of the enterprise in the 
State or Territory. In a small number of cases where an 
enterprise has significant employment in more than one 
industry, a separate statistical unit is created for each in- 
dustry. The statistical units are stratified by State, 
public/private, industry and size of employment and an 
equal probability sample is selected from each stratum. 


Industry classification 

17. The information in this publication is available by 
industry. This supplementary information is available 
(subject to provisions of confidentiality and quality) in 
various forms. For further information, contact the in- 
quiries officer. 


18. Since 1981 additional data items have been collected 
in the survey each November. Preliminary estimates of 


1 


average weekly earnings for full-time adult employees 
classified by industry are included in the November issue 
of Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia 
(6302.0). Final estimates are released in the subsequent 
publication, Average Earnings and Hours of Employees, 
Australia (6304.0). 


19. Industry is classified according to the Australian 
Standard Industrial Classification (ASIC) 1983 Edition, 
Volume 1 - The Classification (1201.0). 


Comparability of results 

20. When comparisons are made between period to 
period movements in average weekly ordinary time earn- 
ings (AWOTE) for full-time adults and movements in the 
Award Rates of Pay Indexes (ARPI) it is important to 
recognise the different coverage, scope, definitions and 
methodology used in the construction of each series. In 
particular, the AWOTE series includes a number of pay- 
ments additional to award rates of pay used in compiling 
ARPI. Allowances covered under awards which are not 
industry or occupation wide in their application such as 
site, travelling, height and dirt allowances are excluded 
from ARPI but included in AWOTE. The AWOTE series 
also includes other payments, such as shift penalty pay- 
ments and overaward pay. A significant number of 
employees are not covered by awards but are included in 
AWOTE. The AWOTE series is affected by composition- 
al change in the labour force. However ARPI is not, 
because it is a fixed-weight index constructed from a rep- 
resentative ‘basket’ of occupations selected from the May 
1985 Survey of Employee Earmings and Hours and subject 
to reselection and rebasing at infrequent intervals. Other 
factors affecting comparisons of the two series include 
seasonal influences on earnings and differences between 
the two series in the treatment of retrospective pay in- 
creases. A detailed description of the methodology, scope 
and definitions used in ARPI is published in Award Rates 
of Pay Indexes, Australia (6312.0). 


21. It is also important to recognise that whilst average 
employee earnings can be derived from the Survey of 
Employment and Eamings (SEE) published in Employed 
Wage and Salary Earners, Australia (6248.0), these 
average earnings will not be comparable with those 
produced from the Survey of Average Weekly Earnings 
(AWE). In the AWE survey, information is obtained relat- 
ing to a specified pay period (the last pay period ending 
on or before the third Friday of the middle month of the 
calendar quarter). The SEE collects the sum of employee 
earnings paid in all pay periods ending in a calendar 
quarter including payments to employees which are ex- 
cluded from the scope of the AWE survey such as 
retrospective pay, pay in advance, leave loadings and 
severance, termination and redundancy payments. Whilst 
the quarterly earnings produced by the SEE are affected 
by the varying number of pay periods from quarter to 
quarter the AWE results are unaffected because of the 
selection of a specified pay period in the middle of a 
quarter. The SEE eamings data are also more subject to 
seasonal variations, particularly in the December and 
March quarters, due to the incidence of holidays taken in 








January being paid in advance and the earnings being 
reported in December quarter figures. 


Historical series 

22. The series was introduced in August 1981 when it 
replaced the average weekly eamings series based prin- 
cipally on information from payroll tax returns. Revised 
estimates of average weekly earnings for the period 
August 1981 to November 1983 were included in Average 
Weekly Earnings, States and Australia, March Quarter 
1984 (6302.0) published on 12 July 1984. Users who need 
a measure of the movement in earnings for a period which 
spans both the payroll tax based and employer survey 
series should refer to Table 3 in that publication which 
presents both series linked to a common index base 
(August 1981 = 100). 


Reliability of estimates 

23. As the estimates in this publication are based on in- 
formation relating to a sample of employers rather than a 
full enumeration, they are subject to sampling variability. 
That is, they may differ from the estimates that would 
have been produced if the information had been obtained 
from all employers. This difference, called sampling 
error, should not be confused with inaccuracy that may 
occur because of imperfections in reporting by respon- 
dents or in processing by the ABS. Such inaccuracy is 
referred to as non-sampling error and may occur in any 
enumeration whether it be a full count or sample. Efforts 
have been made to reduce non-sampling error by careful 
design of questionnaires, detailed checking of returns and 
quality control of processing. 


24, The sampling error associated with any estimate can 
be estimated from the sample results. One measure of 
sampling error is given by the standard error which indi- 
cates the degree to which an estimate may vary from the 
value that would have been obtained from a full enumera- 
tion (the ‘true’ figure). There are about two chances in 
three that a sample estimate differs from the true value by 
less than one standard error, and about nineteen chances 
in twenty that the difference will be less than two standard 
errors. 


25. An example of the use of a standard error is as fol- 
lows. If the estimated average earnings was $500.00 with 
a standard error of $4.00, then there would be about two 
chances in three that a full enumeration would have given 
. an estimate in the range $496.00 to $504.00 and about 
nineteen chances in twenty that it would be in the range 
$492.00 to $508.00. 


26. An example of the use of a standard error for a 
quarterly change estimate is as follows. If the estimated 
standard error for a quarterly change estimate of average 
weekly earings was $1.00 and the quarterly change es- 
timate between two quarters was $1.50, then there would 
be about two chances in three that a full enumeration 
would have given a quarterly change estimate in the range 
+$0.50 to +$2.50 and about nineteen chances in twenty 
that it would be in the range -$0.50 to +$3.50.

27. Quarterly movements in estimates of average weekly 
earnings are considered to be statistically significant 
where they exceed two standard errors.
