Abstract 


There are many ways to measure the intelligence, especially when it comes to measuring through 
multidimensional scaling. This study examines the nonverbal abilities of the individuals using 
Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test. RSPM is a nonverbal culture fair test that 
identifies nonverbal reasoning abilities. It has 60 visually presented geometric-parallel-like 
problems based on five sets, having 12 items in each set. The tool was administered collectively 
(group-class) to a representative sample of 267 adolescents (both boys and girls) studying at 
higher education institutions in Pakistan. The sample was drawn from two public sector 
universities. The data was analyzed through descriptive statistics and principle component 
analysis (PCA) to extract nonverbal abilities. The results indicate that 25% participants have 
secured 60% or less tests scores, 50% participants have secured 73% or less tests scores, and 
25% participants secured more than 81% tests scores. It is also found that participants have 
very sound intellectual capacity and nonverbal reasoning abilities which is generally identified 
as fluid intelligence and it is correlated with measures of abstract reasoning, puzzle solving, 
problem solving, learning and pattern recognition. Principle component analysis has revealed 
the grouping of the individuals and the common factor that affects the performance of the 
participants. 


Keywords: Fluid intelligence, intelligence measure, RSPM 
1. Introduction 


Intelligence is an underlying concept and a latent variable, therefore, cannot be measured directly. 
However, literature suggests that it can be measured by a variety of tests available which are 
applied at different levels to capture the individual scores and are used as an indirect measure 
of intelligence. It is also evident that the assessment of intelligence requires good measurement 
instruments considering purpose, level of participants, IQ scores and maturity of respondents. 
Intelligence tests as described by Demirtasli (2002) are psychometric instruments, consisting 
of standardized questions and tools for assessing the potential of an individual in a given domain 
or for a particular ability. These are designed specially to measure complex mental abilities of 
young and adults; and the designing of these tools requires deeper understanding of metal 
capabilities of respondents based on age, educational background, language, and culture. A 
careful analysis is needed to extract the findings, controlling diverse threats to reliability, and 
ensuring internal and external validity of the tool. In practice, there are lots of suitable measurement 
instruments are available on the basis of verbal scales like: information, digit span, vocabulary, 
comprehension, similarities; and non verbal scales like: picture completion, picture arrangement, 
block design, object assembly, digit symbol etc. (Wechsler 1981). 


In this study intelligence is measured on the basis of nonverbal scale developed by Raven’s 
Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test items by using statistical procedure principle 
component analysis. RSPM test is a nonverbal culture fair test that was developed by Raven

in 1939. RSPM test measures the ability to extract and understand information from a complex 
situation (Raven, Raven, & Court 1998), and is widely used as a test of nonverbal reasoning 
ability. This ability is generally identified as fluid intelligence (e.g., Caroll 1993; Jensen 1998; 
McGrew & Flanagan 1998). Fluid intelligence exhibits the psychobiological capacity of the 
individual to acquire knowledge whereas reasoning processes are an important part of this ability. 
Fluid intelligence generally correlates with measures of abstract reasoning; puzzle solving, 
problem solving, learning and pattern recognition. This test is also used as a general intelligence 
test in the world (Demirtasli 2002). It is a standardized intelligence test that consists of visually 
presented parallel geometric problems in which both sections A and B contain 12 matrices with 
a dimension of 2x2, while the sections C, D, and E contain 12 matrices with a dimension of 
3x3. Section A involves simply filling in the missing part of an image; later sections require 
more abstract reasoning. The correct missing entry must be selected from a set of six possible 
answers from the 2x2 matrices, or a set of eight possible answers in case of 3x3 matrices. 
Standard progressive matrix (SPM), therefore, assesses the ability to make new insights and 
information out of already perceived or existing knowledge, which is a necessary ability to 
extract meanings out of a state of confusion or during solving multifarious puzzles. 


Principle component analysis (PCA) a statistical technique, developed by Pearson and Hotelling, 
is concerned with explaining the variance-covariance structure of a set of ‘p’ variables through 
a few ‘k’ linear combinations known as principle components of these variables. Its general 
objectives are data reduction and interpretations. There is almost as much information in the k 
principle components as there is in the original p variables. The k principle components can 
replace initial p variables and the original data set (Johnson & Wichern 2006). 


2. Literature Review 


Raven’s progressive matrices were initially developed with an intention to capture genetics and 
environmental determinants related to measuring intelligence of a person (Raven 2000). The 
basic purpose of development of these matrices was to help in conducting and interpreting these 
tests among the participants of different ages and culture. Raven (2000) argued that there are 
two main components of general cognitive ability, known as ‘g’; first is eductive ability which 
is directly related to the capability of drawing meanings from the confusion and handling complex 
schemas; while the second is reproductive ability which is concerned with absorption, recall 
and reproduction of general information. There are several versions of Raven tests available 
which are applied in myriad situations; and work is widely accepted by various researchers like 
Styles and Anbdrich (1997), Deary (1995) and Stough (1996). Various studies conducted by 
using Raven tests show that the tests are consistent over different cultures and ages; however, 
not consistent over time (Raven 2000). 


Over last few decades, there has been a debate regarding the true measurement of SPM. The 
debate revolves around whether the SPM is a true measure of ‘g’ or it also measures some 
aspects of visualization or spatial ability. Jenson (1998, p. 541) argued that “total variance of 
Raven scores in fact comprises virtually nothing besides ‘g’ and random measurement error.” 
It was further endorsed (Raven, Raven & Court 2000, p. 34) as “the progressive matrices have 
been described as one of the purest and best measure of g or general intellectual functioning.” 
But it is not universally accepted that these tests are a pure measure and not accounting for 
spatial and other abilities related to visualization. Van der Ven and Ellis (2000) concluded this 
debate as “[the] SPM contains two significant factors which they identified as (1) Gestalt 
continuation present in early time for which the correct solution must be found according to 
some Gestalt continuation rule..., and (2) analogical reasoning, present in later items” (Lynn, 
Allik & Irwing 2004, p. 412).

Gabriel and Vernon have also contested that the SPM is largely a pure measure of general 
cognitive ability ‘g’ but also contains a small spatial ability factor (Demirtasli 2002). Gustaffson 
(1984, 1988) contended that the SPM has a reasoning factor and another factor that he labeled 
as cognition of figural relations. Van der Ven and Ellis (2000) concluded that the RSPM have 
Gestalt continuation. Gestalt continuation is a visual perception law that says human brain try 
to organize information and make meaningful order from what we see. Gestalt psychologists 
assume that brain does not prefer sudden changes in the movement of a line. In other words, 
the brain seeks a smooth continuation of a line as much as possible. Demirtasli (2002) was 
investigated the order of item's difficulty indexes of RSPM according to classic test theory and 
Rasch model; this study showed that difficulty estimation of RSPM's items were ranked from 
the easiest to the hardest. Lynn and Irwing (2004) completed a meta-analysis investigating sex 
differences on the progressive matrices. Lovett, Forbus and Usher (2010) introduced a structure- 
mapping model of RSPM as more advanced model, consisting of four most complex sections 
of the test. Earlier (Lovett, Forbus, & Usher 2007), described the same model by only using two 
sections of the SPM test. 


Rushton, Skuy and Fridjhon (2002) have used RSPM to highlight Jensen Effects among 
engineering students in South Africa based on African, Indian and White races. Their claim was 
that a bimodal distribution exists in African population which in fact is not distinguishable in 
Whites. There was a significant difference in terms of g, general factor of intelligence among 
African, Indian and White students, although there was no difference among those students in 
terms of gender and races. Earlier studies (e.g. Jensen 1980; Osborne 1980 & Rushton 1998) 
also tested the Jensen Effect and proved that there is a difference among the races like black- 
white, in terms of general intelligence by using SPM. 


There are many versions of SPM, like colored and advanced versions etc. Using a particular test 
to a certain type of participants is essentially required before validating the results obtained from 
these tests. Raven (2000) posited that “it is important to note that the SPM was, from the start, 
known to have both certain strengths and limitations. Its strengths were that it could be used 
with the respondents of all ages from early childhood to old age and was such a length that it 
could reasonably be administered in homes, schools, and workplaces (where time is necessarily 
limited) as well as in laboratories ... it had limited discrimination at the upper and lower levels. 
This was overcome by developing Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) and Coloured 
Progressive Matrices (CPM) tests for use among the more and less able, respectively” (p. 4). 


3. Research Methodology 


The SPM (1338) test was administered collectively (group-class) in Karachi to a representative 
sample of 268 adolescents, including boys and girls both through gallop survey. The ages of 
participants ranged from 17 to 25 years, belonging to graduate and postgraduate levels. The 
sample was drawn from two public sector universities in Karachi having multiple departments. 
Data was collected over a period of three months. The test was administered in different 
departments like: Statistics, Physics, Mathematics, Business Administration, Computer Science, 
Microbiology and Chemistry, without any time limitations so that this could allow the researchers 
to asses intellectual capacity without the interruption of speed in completing the task. The test 
scores of 60 items have been analyzed using the MINITAB for descriptive statistics and for 
principle component.

The above-mentioned table presents the descriptive analysis of all test sets (A to E) and total 
score, showing mean, median, upper and lower quartiles, skewness and dispersion. 


Furthermore, analysis is conducted by using PCA to extract the factors from the data and it is 
found that there are five significant factors that are contributing towards the most of variance 
in the data. The Eigen values analysis of these components is given in the following table.

4. Discussion 


Table | exhibits the information about the descriptive statistics, therefore, mean of the test scores 
is =10.97 and the standard deviation of the test score is s=1.76 in the 12 items of set A, since 
mean is very high, showing this task is very easy to respondent, but each progressively harder 
than the last, because the mean scores of the students in set E are showing very low. Demirtasli 
(1995), Lovett, Forbus, & Usher (2007) also investigated RSPM's items were ranked from the 
easiest to the hardest according to classic test theory and Rasch model. The entire RPM test 
which has 60 items, the median of total scores is 44 showing that 50% student secured less than 
73% it seems that intellectual capacity is very sound, first quartile Ql = 36.25 showing 25% 
student secured 60% tests scores, third quartile Q3= 49 showing 25% student secure more than 
81% tests scores. Over all result shows 75% student of Karachi University as well as Federal 
Urdu University as having very sound intellectual capacity and nonverbal reasoning abilities, 
which generally identifies fluid intelligence and it correlates with measures of abstract reasoning, 
puzzle solving, problem solving, learning and pattern recognition, Cattell (1971). According to 
Gestalt continuation theory, students which have very strong visual perception their brain seeks 
as much as possible a smooth continuation of a line, indicating that these students are suitable 
for professions like interior designing, graphic designing and music. When graphic designers 
are laying out advertisements, posters, or even business cards, they lay out the information and 
graphics in such a way that readers follow the lines of the layout. When professional musicians

organize their musical expressions without breaking the rhythm, they too, conform to the law 
of continuation (Behrens 1984; Mullet & Sano 1995; Moore & Fitz 1993). It also exhibits that, 
items in section A have very large kurtosis >3, implicitly that the test results being highly 
concentrated around the mean, and the variations within the test results of 268 student are low, 
showing most of the student secure same test scores. The nonverbal abilities of the student for 
item A are strong. But items B,C and D give kurtosis < 3, indicating that the distribution of 
scores have a large spread, that shows a platykurtic distribution. While a low kurtosis distribution 
has a more rounded peak and shorter thinner tails. 


Table 2 Exhibits the first PC which is denoted by U1 where: 


U1 = 0.379A +0.470B +0.476C +0.482D +0.420E 


First PC may be interpreted as contribution of general intelligence on the score of the test RSPM. 
55.7% marks are due to general intelligence. The ability to learn, understanding of complex 
instructions and success in problem solving 1.e. “cognitive ability” as described by Eysenck 
(1982, p. 8) has 55.7% effect on the scores. 


The second PC which is denoted by U2 that contributes 15.2% 

U2 = 0.787A+ 0.237B-0.235 C- 0.202D -0.478E 

In U2 the signs of the coefficients for set A and set B are different from the set C, D and 
E. This indicates the difference between easy sets (A, B) and relatively difficult sets (C, D, E). 
The third PC which denote by U3: 

U3 = 0.412A-0.437B-.334C-.180D-0.703E 


U3 contributes 11.8%, which refers to a contrast between easy and difficult and medium type 
of sets, because the sign of coefficient correspond set A+ ve while the remaining have -ve sign. 


5. Conclusion 


The findings prove that above-mentioned results are in consonance with other studies conducted 
earlier in different cultures and among various races. This test is also applicable to the students 
at higher education level in Pakistan. However, these are required to be applied cautiously and 
must be checked though distribution analysis for representing the unimodal or bimodal distribution. 
Findings further reveal that two factors, general intelligent and students choice in selecting the 
particular matrices, may affect the studies and results. It is recommended further to use this test 
to check the results on the basis of gender and disciplines in which the students are enrolled. 
This test may also be used for employment after certain changes to test cognition of the employees 
and match with the existing ones, especially in creative departments or fields.
