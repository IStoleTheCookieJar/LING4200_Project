Fuzzy endpoint results for 


Cirié-generalized quasicontractive 
fuzzy mappings 


B. Mohammadi* 


Abstract 


We introduce Cirié-generalized quasicontractive fuzzy mappings and pro- 
vide the necessary and sufficient conditions of having a unique endpoint for 
such mappings. Then we introduce 3-w-quasicontractive fuzzy mappings, es- 
tablishing an endpoint result for them. Finally, we provide some results as 
an application.

1 Introduction and preliminaries 


The concept of fuzzy set was introduced initially by Zadeh [12] in 1965. In 
1981, Heilpern [6] established the fuzzy contraction and proved a fuzzy fixed 
point theorem, which was a generalization of Nadler’s fixed point theorem for 
multi-valued mappings (see [9]). In 2001, Estruch and Vidal [5] utilized the 
result of Heilpern to fuzzy fixed point with fixed degree a for some a € [0, 1], 
which was later generalized by many authors (see, for instance, [1,3,11]). Re- 
cently, Abbas and Turkoglu [11] proved the existence of a fuzzy fixed point for 
a generalized contractive fuzzy mapping. On the other hand, In 2010, Amini- 
Harandi [2] proved that some multi-valued mappings T : X + CB(X) havea 
unique endpoint if and only if they have the approximate endpoint property. 
Afterwards, considering the same properties, Moradi and Khojasteh [8] gen- 
eralized Amini-Harandi’s result. In this paper, in the sense of [8], we prove

that some fuzzy mappings have a unique fuzzy endpoint if and only if they 
have the fuzzy approximate endpoint property. 


Definition 1.(see [6]) Let X be a space of points with generic element x 
and I = [0,1]. A fuzzy set in X is a function that associates any point of X 
with a number in interval [0,1]. If A is a fuzzy set in X and x € X, then 
A(a) is called the grade of membership of x in A. 


Definition 2.(see [6]) Let (X,d) be a metric space and let A be a fuzzy 
set in X. For a € [0,1], the a-level set of A denoted by [Al]q, is defined as 


[Ala ={a|A(a) 2a} if ae (0,1 
and 
[A]o = {2|A(a) > O}, 
where B denotes the closure of the nonfuzzy set B. 
Definition 3.(see [6]) Let X be a nonempty set. For x € X, we write {x} 


the characteristic function of the ordinary subset {x} of X. For a € (0, 1], 
the fuzzy point x, of X is the fuzzy set in X given by 


Q, = xz, 
tely) 7 ie : #2. 
Define 


W(X) ={C € I* : [Clq is nonempty and compact}. 


Throughout this paper, J* denotes the collection of all fuzzy sets in X. For 
A,B €I*, it is called that A is more accurate than B (denoted by A C B) 
whenever A(x) < B(x) for alla € X. Forxe X,SC X, A,B Ee W(X), 
and a € (0, 1], we define 


d(x,8) = inf{d(x,a) : a € S}, 

Pa(z, A) = inf{d(x,a): a € [Ala}, 

pa(A, B) = inf{d(a,b) : a € [A]a,b € [Bla}, 

D(A, B) = A (Ale, (Bla) = max{supze 4 Pot, B), suPyeg Poly, A)}, 


where H is the Hausdorff distance. It is easily seen that Dg is the Hausdorff 
metric on W,(X) induced by the metric d. Hereafter, we denote by Da (x, A) 
the amount Da({x}, A) = H({z}, [A]q) for alle € X and A € W,(X). 


Definition 4.(see [5]) Let X be a nonempty set, let T : X — I*, and 
let a € (0,1). A fuzzy point x, is called a fuzzy fixed point of T if a, C Tx 
(or equally x € [Tx].). This means that the fixed degree of x is at least a. 
If {x} C Tz, then it is called that x is a fixed point of T. 


Fuzzy endpoint results for Cirié-generalized quasicontractive fuzzy mappings 187 


2 Main results 


Now, we are ready to state and prove the main results of this study. Firstly, 
we give the following definition: 


Definition 5. Let X be a nonempty set, let T : X > I*, and let a € (0,1). 
We say that a point « € X is a fuzzy endpoint of T if {x} = [Tz],. This 
means that x is the only point in X that the fixed degree of x is at least a. 
If {a} = [T2]1, we say that x is an endpoint of T. 


Now, we give the following definition of fuzzy approximate endpoint prop- 
erty in the sense of Amini-Harandi [2]. 


Definition 6. Let (X,d) be a metric space, let T : X — I*, and let 
a € (0,1]. We say that T has the fuzzy approximate endpoint property 
whenever 
inf sup d(z#,y)=0 
ZExX y€[T a] 0 
or equally 
inf Da(x,Tx) = 0. 
Cex 


Definition 7. Let (X,d) be a metric space, let a € (0,1], and let 
T : X + W(X). We say that T is a Cirié-generalized quasicontrac- 
tive fuzzy mapping whenever there exists an upper semicontinuous (u.s.c) 
mapping 7 : [0,+00) > [0,+00) such that ~(t) < t, for all t > 0 and 
lim inf;_,..(t — w(t)) > 0 satisfying 


D.(T2,Ty) <y(M(a,y)) for all 2, y € X, (1) 
where 


M(z, y) = max{d(z, y), D,(2,Tz), Daly, Ty), Do(z, Ty), Daly, Tz)}. 


Theorem 1. Let (X,d) be a complete metric space, let a € (0,1), and let T : 
X +> W(X) be a Cirié-generalized quasicontractive fuzzy mapping. Then, 
T has a unique fuzzy endpoint if and only if T has the fuzzy approximate 
endpoint property. 


Proof. If T has a fuzzy endpoint, obviously, it has the fuzzy approxi- 
mate endpoint property. Conversely, let T has the fuzzy approximate 
endpoint property. Then, there exists a sequence {x,,} in X such that 
limn—+ooDa(n,TX¢n) = 0. Now for any n,m € N, we have 


188 B. Mohammadi 


M(an,0m) = max{d(%n,tm),Da(tn,TLn), 
Dea(im,Ttm),Da(tn, T@m), Da(&m,TXn)} (2) 
< Da(an,T2n) + Da(@m,Ttm) + Dal(T2n,T&@m) 
< Dal(@n, T&n) + Dal(&m,T&m) + (MM (an, 0m)). 


Therefore, from the above inequality, we have 


lim inf (M(an,%m) — (MM (an, Um))) = 0. 

n,m—oo 
From the property of 7, we can conclude that lim sup, m0, M(&n,%m) < 00. 
Thus from (2) and by upper semicontinuity of 7, we have 


lim sup M(an,2%m) < limsup w(M (an, %m)) 


nym—oo n,m—oo 


< p(lim sup M(an,2m)). 


n,m—oo 


So we have lim sup, 550 M(2n,%m) = 0 and so {xp} is a Cauchy sequence. 
Since X is complete, there exists «* € X such that lim, +. d(ap,x*) = 0. 
We shall show that {*} = [T'x*],. To see this, we have 


Da(u*,Ta*) < d(a*, tn) + Da(fn, Tin) + Da(Tan, T2*) 
(3) 


< d(a*, an) + Da(an, T@n) + U(M (an, 2*)). 
Limiting from both sides of (3), we get 


D,(x*,T2*) < limsupv(M (apn, 2*)). (4) 


noo 


On the other hand, 


M(an,2*) = max{d(an,2*), Da(an, Tn), 
Da(a*,Tx*), Da(an, Tx*), Da(x*,Txn)} 
< d(ayn,2*) + Doa(an, Tin) + Da(a*,Tx*), 


which implies 
lim sup M (ay, 2*) < Da(a*,T2*). (5) 


noo 
Consequently, from right upper semicontinuity of w, (4) and (5) yield 
Da(x*,Tx*) < w(Da(a*, Tx*)) 


and so H({a*}, [Tx*]a) = Da(a*,Tx*) = 0. This means that {a*} = [Ta*]q. 
The uniqueness of endpoint is concluded from (1). 


Definition 8. Let (X,d) be a metric space, a € (0,1), and T: X > 
W.(X). We say that T is a Cirié-generalized 8-~-quasicontractive fuzzy 
mapping whenever there exists an upper semicontinuous (u.s.c) mapping w : 


Fuzzy endpoint results for Cirié-generalized quasicontractive fuzzy mappings 189 


[(0, +00) + [0, +00) such that w(t) < t, for allt > 0 and lim inf;_,. (t-w(t)) > 
0 and a function 6: X x X — [0,0o) satisfying 


B(x, y)Do(Tx, Ty) < ¥(M(a2,y)) for all x,y € X, (6) 
where 
M(a, y) = max{d(x, y); Dat, Tx), Daly, Ty), Dealt Ty), Daly; Tp)}. 


Theorem 2. Let (X, d) be a complete metric space, let a € (0,1), and let 
T:X > W4.(X) be a Cirié-generalized B-w-quasicontractive fuzzy mapping. 
Moreover suppose that 


(i) there exists a sequence {x,} in X such that B(tn,%m) > 1 for all 
n,meéEN withn <m and limn+.0 Da(an,T@n) = 0, 


(ii) for any sequence {xp} in X which B(an,e%m) > 1 for alln,m EN with 
n<m andr, x, we have B(an,x) > 1, for alln EN. 


Then, T has a fuzzy endpoint. 


Proof. For any n,m € N, we have 


M(an,%m) = max{d(tn, Lm), Da(tn, Tn), 
Dea(Lm,TXm), Do(@n,TLm), Da(Lm,TXn)} 
< Da(@n, Tin) + Dal(@m,Ttm) + B(an,%m)Dal(Tin, T&m) 
< Da(@n, T&n) + Dal&m,Ttm) + (MM (an, 0m)). 
(7) 


Similar to Theorem 1, we conclude that lim sup, m0 M(#n,%m) = 0 and 
so {x,} is a Cauchy sequence. Let limn+o. d(an,7*) = 0. We show that 
{x*} = [Tx*],. To see this, we have 


Da(x*,Ta*) < d(x*, tn) + Daan, T&n) + B(an, 2*)Do(Tan, Tx*) 
(8) 


< d(a*, an) + Da(an, Ttn) + 0(M (an, 2*)). 
Consequently, as in Theorem 1, we obtain 
Da(x*,T2*) < (Da(a*, T2*)), 


which implies H({2*}, [Tx*]a) = Da(x*,Tx*) = 0. This means that {x*} = 
[Tx*]q. 


Let Cc be the partial order on W,(X) defined by A Cc B if and only if 
A(a) < B(x) for alla € X. In the following result, we restrict the contraction 
condition only for x,y € X with Ta Cc Ty.

Corollary 1. Let (X,d) be a complete metric space, a € (0, 1], andT : X > 
W(X) be a fuzzy mapping such that there exists an upper semicontinuous 
(u.s.c) mapping w : [0,+00) + [0,+00) with w(t) < t, for allt > 0 and 
lim inft_00(t — w(t)) > 0 satisfying 
D,(Tx,Ty) < v(M(a,y)) for allay € X with Tx C Ty, (9) 
where 
M(z,y) = max{d(x,y),Do(x, Tx), Daly, Ty), Da(t, Ty), Daly, Tx)}. 


Moreover suppose that 


(i) there exists a sequence {x} in X such that {T xp} is a nondecreasing 
sequence in W,(X) and limy +. Da(fn, TXn) = 0, 


(it) for any sequence {x,} in X which {Tx,} is a nondecreasing sequence 
in Wa(X) and a, > x, we have Tx, C Tx, for alln EN. 


Then, T has a fuzzy endpoint. 


Proof. Define the mapping 8 : X x X — [0,00) by 6(x,y) = 1, whenewer 
Tx C Ty and 6(a2,y) = 0 otherwise. Then apply Theorem 2. 


Corollary 2. Let (X,d) be a complete metric space, let x* € X be a fixed 
element, let a € (0, 1], and let T : X > W(X) be a fuzzy mapping such that 
there exists an upper semicontinuous (u.s.c) mapping w : (0, +co) — [0, +00) 
with w(t) <t, for allt > 0 and lim inf,_,..(t — w(t)) > 0 satisfying 


Do(Tx,Ty) <v(M(a2,y)) for alla,y € X with Tx(x2*) = Ty(a*), (10) 
where 

M(z,y) = max{d(z,y), Da(z, Tx), Daly, Ty), Dalz, Ty), Daly, Tz)}- 
Moreover suppose that 


(i) there are a sequence {xp} in X and  € [0,1] such that Tx,(a*) = A 
is fixed for alln EN and limn-yo0 Da(tn, T2n) = 0, 


(ti) for any sequence {x} in X that Txp(a*) = X is fixed for alln € N 
and tp, — x, we have Tx(a*) =X, for alin EN. 


Then, T has a fuzzy endpoint. 


Proof. Define the mapping 6 : X x X — [0,00) by 8(a,y) = 1, whenever 
Ta(x*) = Ty(a*) and B(x,y) = 0 otherwise. Then applying Theorem 2 
completes the proof.
