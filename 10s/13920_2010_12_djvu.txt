ABS NEWS AND RELEASES 


SA Stats 


SA Stats provides an overview of the state's population and economy. This publication is 
updated on a monthly basis, with most releases also containing a feature article on socio- 
economic and environmental issues of interest. 


SA Stats, November 2010 


This month's article explores the recently released National Regional Profile (NRP). The 
NRP draws together ABS and non-ABS data to provide snapshots for over 2,000 regions 
across Australia. As well as highlighting key features of the product and new data items, the 
article also demonstrates how the NRP can be used to quickly find data for your region, 
using the Local Government Areas of Coober Pedy, Holdfast Bay and Salisbury as 
examples. 


SA Stats, October 2010 


This month's edition of SA Stats includes an article about making better use of public sector 
information. Government organisations are increasingly interested in sharing data and 
making it available for public use to help build a comprehensive and coherent statistical 
picture of the economy, society and the environment. Data sharing allows maximum use of 
data for statistical purposes and enhances the decision-making capability of governments 
and communities. The article provides a brief overview of 'A Good Practice Guide to Sharing 
Your Data with Others', developed by the National Statistical Service (NSS) and the ABS. 
The guide provides a non-technical introduction to data sharing and describes the key 
concepts and components of data sharing arrangements and agreements. 


SA Stats, September 2010 


September's feature article provides an overview of the changes in full-time student, school 
and teaching staff numbers in South Australia between 1993 and 2009. The article 
particularly focuses on the changes in male staff numbers, both by sector (government and 
non-government) and by school level (primary and secondary). In 2009, almost one-third 
(31.3%) of South Australia's teaching staff were male, the highest proportion of all states 
and territories in Australia. This is despite the proportion of male teaching staff in schools 
falling from 37.5% in 1993 to 31% in 2009. 


National Regional Profile 


The latest version of the National Regional Profile (NRP) was released on 22 November 


2010. 


The NRP presents a range of social and economic indicators over a five year period, from 
2005 to 2009. In addition to the broad range of economic and social data such as income, 
age, occupation, building approvals and agriculture, this edition of the NRP contains new 
data on tourist accommodation and additional government payments. 


The NRP uses a Google Maps based interface, making it easy to find data for your region. 
Data are available for Local Government Areas, Statistical Local Areas and other larger 
geographies. 


Selected findings for South Australia include: 


=» The Local Government Area (LGA) of Copper Coast had the fastest average annual 
growth rate of population outside of the capital city from 2004-05 to 2008-09, reaching 
a population of 12,901 in 2008-09. 

= Copper Coast also recorded large increases in the number of people receiving the 
Baby Bonus and Family Tax Benefit over the period 2004-05 to 2008-09.

2008-09 of $418,100.

proportion of motor vehicles 10 years or older in SA in 2008-09.

Water Account Australia 


Released 29 November 2010, Water Account Australia, 2008-09 (cat. no. 4610.0) presents 
information on the supply and use of water in the Australian economy in 2008-09. 


The aim of the Water Account Australia is to integrate data from different sources into a 
consolidated information set making it possible to link physical data on water to economic 
data. It consists of supply and use tables (referred to as flow tables) for both physical and 
monetary volumes. Accounts like this can facilitate the understanding of a range of issues, 
including the consequences of economic growth, contributors to particular environmental 
problems and implications of environmental policy measures across sectors. 


Findings for South Australia include: 


= In 2008-09, SA consumed 1,168 GL of water, a 14% decrease since 2004-05. 

= SA's total water consumption per capita was 719kL, above the Australian average of 
642 kL per capita. 

= SA households recorded the third highest average water price, paying on average 
$2.30 per kL in 2008-09 compared to the Australian average of $1.93 per kL. 

» Agricultural activities consumed 902 GL or 77% of total water consumption for the 
State. This is a drop of 11% from 2004-05. 

» The manufacturing industry is a significant user of water in SA, consuming 88GL or 
8% of the state's total water consumption. 


Estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas 


Estimates of Personal Income for Small Areas, Time Series, 2003-04 to 2007-08 (cat. no. 
6524.0.55.002) was released on 14 September 2010. It contains estimates of the sources 
and amount of personal income people received for the years 2003-04 to 2007-08. The 
estimates have been compiled using aggregated individual income tax data from the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO). 


Key findings for South Australia include: 


» Walkerville recorded the highest average total income of $67,690 in 2007-08, closely 
followed by Roxby Downs ($66,400). 

» South-west Burnside ($61,109), east Unley ($60,212) and north-east Mitcham 
($59,120) round out the top five income areas in the state.

state average ($40,488).

Holidaying abroad 


There were a record 6.8 million short-term departures by Australians in 2009-10, equivalent

New Zealand, there were 15 living in Australia. 


Parental divorce or death during childhood

likely to finish school, more likely to enter a de facto relationship at a younger age, and of 
those who married, they were less likely to remain married. 


The city and the bush: Indigenous wellbeing across Remoteness Areas 

While there have been improvements in a range of indicators for Indigenous Australians in 
recent years, such as school completion rates and employment, inequalities remain evident 
between Remoteness Areas. 


Older people and the labour market 
Just over one-third of all people aged 55 years and over (or 1.9 million people) were in the 
labour force in 2009-10, with this participation rate increasing strongly over the past decade.

having a non-school qualification in 2009, up from 59% in 2001. One third of people aged 
25-34 had a bachelor degree or higher, making this group the most qualified.

Census Data Enhancement Project: An Update, Oct 2010 (cat. no. 2062.0) 


The Census Data Enhancement (CDE) project is a major project involving integrating unit 
record data from the Census of Population and Housing with other ABS and non-ABS 
datasets to create new datasets for statistical and research purposes. 


The project delivers a number of significant benefits, including the improved availability of 
information to support good government policy making, program evaluation and service

and Housing.
