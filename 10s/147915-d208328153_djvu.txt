days  folowing  the  removal  of  such  delaying  cause,  and  this  lease  may  be  extended  thereafter  by  operations  as  rf  such  delay  had  not  occurred 

12.  Lessor  agrees  that  this  lease  covers  and  includes  any  and  al  of  Lessor's  rights  in  and  to  any  existing  wel(s)  and/or  welbore(s)  on  said

deemed  the  same  as  the  drilling  of  a  new  well. 

1 3.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this  tease,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  which  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee 
giving  notice  to  Lessor,  a  well  which  has  been  drilled  and  Lessee  intends  to  frac  shall  be  deemed  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying 
quantities  and  the  date  such  well  is  shut-in  shall  be  when  the  drilling  operations  are  completed. 

14.  As  a  result  of  land  development  in  the  vicinity  of  said  land,  governmental  rules  or  ordinances  regarding  well  sites,  and/or  surface 
restrictions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  this  lease  and/or  other  leases  in  the  vicinity,  surface  locations  for  well  sites  in  the  vicinity  may  be  limited 
and  Lessee  may  encounter  difficulty  securing  surface  kx^tion(s)  for  drilling,  reworking,  or  other  operations.  Therefore,  since  dnINng, 
reworking  or  other  operations  are  either  restricted  or  not  allowed  on  said  land  or  other  Teases  m  the  vicinity,  it  is  agreed  that  any  such 
operations  conducted  at  a  surface  location  off  of  said  land  or  off  of  lands  with  which  said  tend  are  pooled  in  accordance  with  this  tease, 
provided  that  such  operations  are  associated  with  a  directional  well  for  the  purpose  of  drilling,  reworking,  producing  or  other  operations 
under  said  land  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  shall  for  purposes  of  this  lease  be  deemed  operations  conducted  on  said  land.  Nothing 
contained  in  this  paragraph  is  intended  to  modify  any  surface  restrictions  or  pooling  provisions  or  restrictions  contained  in  this  lease, 
except  as  expressly  stated. 

15.  The  consideration  paid  for  this  lease  shall  also  constitute  consideration  for  an  option  to  the  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns, 
to  extend  the  initial  three  (3)  year  primary  term  for  a  second  two  (2)  year  term.  This  option  may  be  exercised  anytime  dunng  the  initial 
primary  term  by  delivery  of  payment  of  an  additional  bonus  of  $18.500.00  per  net  mineral  acre.  The  bonus  payment  shall  constitute 
notice  to  Lessor  of  exercise  of  the  option.  In  the  event  Lessee  elects  to  exercise  this  option  and  makes  the  bonus  payment  provided  for 
above,  then  all  terms  of  this  tease  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  as  if  the  original  primary  term  was  five  (5)  years. 

IN  WTTNESS  WHEREOF,  this  instrument  is  executed  on  the  date  first  above  written.
