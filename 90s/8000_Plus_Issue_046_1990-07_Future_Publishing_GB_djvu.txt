Comms a time ... 

Il can he quiie frustrating arriving, for the first time, 
alone in a strange country unable to perform anything 
more proficient in the indigenous language than order- 
ing a cup of coffee. But that's precisely how most per- 
sonal computer owners feel when they are first con- 
fronted by the jargon-rich world of communications. 
It's a pity that the substantial and very real bene- 
fits that the world of communications offers you as a 
PCW owner have to be so besmirched and muddled 
by the impenetrable cloud or language surrounding 
them. What should be a relatively straightforward pro- 
cess passes silently and irretrievably into the domain 
of arcane computer lore: enter this kingdom at your 
peril. So why should you even think about making 



friends with comms? Simple: it enables you to access infor- 
mation in as lime -effective a way as possible. It doesn't 
have to be solely computer-related information either. 

As we hope our recent series of "on-line" articles has 
shown, computer communications allows you to do any- 
thing as diverse as making an airline reservation to Bali to 
finding out what The Guardian had to say about the 
Brighton Vintage Car Rally this month three and a half 
years ago. It can help you maintain contact and swap ideas 
with like-minded people pursuing similar interests. This 
month, for example, we've attempted to show you just how 
easy it can be to access a typical PCW bulletin board. 

Our feature aims to shed as much light as possible on 
information technology. De shrouded of its mystery, it can 
provide you with the gateway to a world of information and 
help. Here's hoping it really will be as easy as a phone-call. 



Foreword thinking 

Sending off your latest hope-iaden manuscript/article to an awaiting pub- 
lisher/magazine editor is harrowing enough without that sudden sick reali- 
sation that you have forgotten to include in the text something important. 
Similarly, how many limes do you stop - midflow - to scribble a hasty 
reminder to yourself on the back of envelope not to forget to include such 
and such an idea later on in the document you're writing? 

Il may well be that Bath-based Software Imperative (of Flipper fame> 
have come up with the permanent solution to this long series of writers' pit- 
falls and bugbears. The program in question (for a program it is) is called, 
quite simply. Foreword. 

It works as a kind of ideas and outline processor. In other words, you 
can, wilh Foreword's help, slowly piece together the skeleton of an article, 
dissertation or manuscript, idea upon idea, paragraph upon paragraph. 
Begin, for example, by thinking about the major tenet or thrust of the article 
you will write; determine exactly what you want to convey in each para- 
graph and encapsulate it in a single sentence. Work your way through the 
document in this way. 

Once you've assembled the bare bones of the document, in the form of 
these headers', you can go back through the paragraphs slowly fleshing 
them all out - with paragraph sub-texis. sub sub-texts and so on. The pro- 
gram's method of "crunching" the whole of a document's conients into 
what is a visually economical - and therefore easily assimilable - form 
means, says Andy Wilton, the man behind Software Imperative and 
Foreword - that "even in its more advanced stages, you can still see the 
wood for the trees. And you don"t suddenly come up against any brick walls 
whereby the program can't handle any more text." Foreword, he informs us. 
has up to eight consecutive levels of text emry. 

As you continue to add meat to the bones, you will probably find lhat 
you need 10 shuffle ideas around, alter the sequence of some of the para- 
graphs - and so on. Foreword, say its creators, takes the hard graft out of 
the creative process and helps you to painlessly transform raw copy into the 
finished polished product that the eventual recipient will be dying to read. 

Foreword's ace in the pack, however, is its ability to converse fluently, 
easily and quickly with LocoScript 2. You can import your Foreword arti- 
cle, at any stage of its maturity, into a LocoScript document for further 
refining. The imported document floods its way and very quickly across 
the LocoScript screen at a rate of 1 50-200 words a minute. You can stop at 
any point in the transfer process. Entire paragraphs reformat automatically 
any time you press a key - no need to wait for the [ RELAY] key to re- 
arrange your words. 

"If you are a dedicated LocoScript user," comments Andy Wilton, "you 
will never have to boot up CP/M to use this program. Similarly, if you 
threw your systems disc away 
when you bought your machine, 
you won't have to go rummag- 
ing around in the bin to find it 
again to use Foreword." 
Confirmed Pretext users 
shouldn't despair, however. 
Foreword works with CP/M 
word processors too. 

So, what's the damage? 
Software Imperative will be 
releasing Foreword, priced 
£39.99. sometime between the 
beginning and I he middle of 
July. As soon as this happens, 
we'll be reviewing it. It sounds 
good: watch this space! 



That's the spirit! 

So capable is the PCW when il comes 
in the world of comms, that it can 
even get in touch with the spirits of 
those departed. Psychic counsellor 
Ken Li mage has had a program writ- 
ten for his 8256 which enables him to 
converse wilh members of the spirit 
kingdom. "1 have about six regular 
contacts with whom I converse fairly 
frequently" explained Mr Limage, 
"and one night I dreamt that a friend 
had come up with a computer program 
which would allow me to ask my cor- 
respondents questions, and receive 
answers in a simple 'yes" or "no" 
form," Sure enough, the friend 
obliged, and Ken now has regular 
chats about all kinds of topics wilh his 
spirit companions. "I had a conversa- 
tion with Winston Churchill the other 
day" said Ken, '"He told me that Hitler 
was si ill alive, but lhat on no account 
should anyone try to find him". 

The predictions which have 
been made by some of his less 
famous contacts have been uncannily 
accurate, "A friend of mine was told 
that there would be death in his envi- 
ronment in the near future" Ken told 
us, "and within ihc next few days his 
mother-in-law passed away. He was 
also told to expect some kind of 
delay in dealing with the death, 
which turned out lo be true. He was 
held up for two days trying to get a 
boat across to sort out the funeral". 
The spirits even predicted the 
outcome of the opening match of the 
World Cup, between Argentina and 
Cameroon. "I asked if Argentina 
would win. and the answer was 'No'. 
I was so amazed that I then asked

'Are you sure?" to which the reply 
was 'Yes'. Ii also predicted this 
year's Derby winner and 1 won 
£20." The spirits, however, do not 
lake kindly to their advice being 
used for direct Financial gain. It is 
also unfeasible for just anyone to 
use the program, "There are only 
certain people who can talk to spir- 
its. A journalist came down to have 
a look at the program, and she asked 
if she could type her questions into 
the computer. 1 asked the contact, 
who said 'No'. 1 had to ask the ques- 
tions for her." 

Ken is, however, considering 
turning his discovery into a com- 
mercial venture - but not to predict 
race results or pools combinations. 
"1 spend most of my lime helping 
my friends to learn more about 
themselves through my psychic 
powers" he explained. "I would like 
to expand it to encompass more peo- 
ple by turning it into a business. 1 
have also been writing down all the 
conversations which 1 have had - 
they are fascinating to read and 
would make an excellent book. At 
the moment 1 consider myself as a 
sort of psychic social worker who is 
overworked and underpaid!" So 
what is standing in the way of Ken's 
commercial plans? "Capital and 
business expertise" he replied, "of 
which I have neither." 

Watch this space for any further 
spooky developments; perhaps 
Ken's PCW will itself turn psychic 
and be able to talk to corrupted data 
languishing in the great limbo file 
in the sky... 



On the move (I) 

Industry efforts to make comput- 
ing a totally mobiie pursuit never 
cease to expand. Only recently, 
the Plussers were convulsed with 
laughter at the sight »f Paul 
Stephens, Editor of our sister 
magazine PC Plus, wandering 
around the building with - wait 
for it - a wrist top computer 
strapped to his arm. The Husky 
Hunter 16 measures 8.5" by 6.2", 
and is fine if you are right- 
handed (the keypad is on the far 
right of the machine, so left 
handed folk will have an interest- 
ing time tickling the crook of 
their elbows while trying to gel 
the hang of the positioning). 
However, the likelihood of being 
laughed out of the bus queue will 
prohahly outweigh that of your 
ever using it in the manner fur 
which it was designed. Of course, 
the wrist top location is not com- 
pulsory; the machine can be used 
anywhere about your anatomy 
which you choose (as long as the 



System addict 

Digita International, specialists in 
home and small business accounts 
packages such as DG Payroll and 
Business Controller, have released 
the PCW version of their popular 
accounts package. System 3. The 
software was developed on the 
same principle us Database 
Software's Mini Office, in that it 
comprises a suite of three pro- 
grams, written specifically for the 
PCW, which may be used indepen- 
dently, or integrated as necessary. 
The invoicing element can be used 
to produce invoices, statements and 
VAT summaries, while the stock 
control program offers inventory, 
stock valuation and price list facili 
ties. A cashflow controller makes 
up the complete system, which is 
aimed at the home or office user. 
Said Digita's .Jeremy Rhyll 'The 
other versions of System 3, particu- 
larly for machines like the Atari 
ST, have been immensely popular. 
This is an important release for the 
PCW, and we are expecting the 
same kind of response." System 3 
costs £49.95, and is available soon 
from Digita International (tele- 
phone 0395 268893). We will be 
reviewing it in the near future. 



strap fits around it... I or as a desk- 
top, complete with a portable disc 
drive. Its serial port means that it 
can be used in conjunction with 
the PCW. with the relevant inter- 
facing. How long will it be before 
the first fingertip-top mainframe 
svstem is released? 






On the move (II) 

If you've been following our recent 
reviews of the PCW-compatible 
portable computers, the Atari 
Portfolio and Micro writer's 
AgendA. you will be aware of just 
how useful it is to turn time-wast- 
ing train journeys into productive 
working hours. Now it seems that 
not only can you use your time to 
prepare work while you are on the 
move, you can also print it out as 
well. Canon have announced the 
release of their new PCW compati- 
ble BJ-lOe 'bubblejef printer, the 
first personal printer that is a desk- 
top and a portable unit. The BJ-lOe 
is the size of an A4 pad, and 
weighs only 4lbs. 

There is no compromise on 
quality; the bubble-jet print is 
reputed to be of near laser print 
standard. The technology itself was 
discovered accidentally, by the con- 
tact of a soldering iron with an ink 
filled syringe. Thus on the print 
head itself, there is a small electric 
heating element on top of each of 
the 64 nozzles, which heals the ink 
inside and causes it to evaporate 
into a bubble which then forces a 
drop of ink out on to the page. 
Although this sounds like a labori- 
ous and complicated process, the 
rate at which ink jets can be gener- 
ated goes into thousands per sec- 
ond. The production of graphics 
and text, at a maximum of 360 dpi 
(dots per inch) is far superior to 
that which the PCW packaged 
printers - dot matrix for the 8000 
series and daisy wheel for the 95 1 2 
- can achieve. 

Maintenance for the standard 
PCW printers can often be a nui- 



sance, with the risk of the compo- 
nent parts such as the printer head, 
the ribbon and the roller developing 
faults. Canon's new product uses a 
cartridge which contains both the 
print head and the ink supply. It has 
a lifetime of 700,000 characters if 
used for high quality print, or 
1,400,000 in economy mode. Each 
cartridge costs £19.93, and can be 
fitted as easily as a replacement 
ribbon on a dot matrix primer. 

The BJ- lOe bubble] et printer is 
due for release in September, and 
8000 Plus will be putting it through 
its paces around that time. When 
we received details of this revolu- 
tionary new piece of equipment, we 
were amazed at the budget price of 
£45. The very next day, however, 
brought an urgent message from 
Canon that there was. in fact, a 
small yet highly significant '3' to 
put infront of the misprinted figure.

Club News 

As the M25 user club approaches its third birthday. Chairman Ken Ritchie 
informs us that all is going well. The Club meets twice a month; the first 
of the two sessions deals with program handling, where members will 
compare notes on LocoScripl, Supercalc or MicroDesign, and the second 
of the two is devoted to CP/M. "We are currently looking at the idea of 
buying a club version of MicroDesign 2. which we are all very keen on at 
the moment. We are also concentrating on building up the membership" 
explained Ken Ritchie. 'After all, new members mean new ideas and new 
expertise". So willing is Ken to welcome new members, he will even meet 
them at Perivale Tube Station on the Central Line and take them to one 
of the club meetings. "New membership is the lifebiood of any club, 
and since the first meeting is free anyway, I don't mind helping new 
people find us." 

Ken acknowledges that setting up a user club can be a daunting 
prospect for some. "It seems like a difficult task, but you would be sur- 
prised how many people are willing to gel together and give it a go," Ken 
has very kindly offered to send 8000 Plus a copy of the club's constitu- 
tion, and any readers who are thinking of setting up a user club can con- 
tact us for a copy. For informalion about joining Ken and the M25 User

Talk to me 

We announced several months ago that PCW World had launched a 
new disc format translation service, enabling data from Amstrad 
PCW 3 inch discs to be transferred to a plethora of diverse formats. 
Interest has been such that new equipment has been brought in to 
cope with increased public demand. Transfers can be made to the 
Apple Macintosh, IBM PC, Atari ST, and Hewlett Packard machines 
- the list is endless. In addition, data from any of these formats can be 
transferred back to 3" disc for use on the PCW. A service such as this 
means that the home user can prepare documents on the PCW, and 
have the data adapted for reading by, say, the office computer, which 
is likely to be a different machine. If you are thinking that the time 
span between submitting discs for transfer, and having them returned 
in a new format will be longer than is practical, rest assured. PCW 
World undertake to carry out transfers and send you the finished 
product by return of post in most cases. The service is far from costly; 
PCW owners are privy to a special price of £5.95 per disc, which cov- 
ers data transfer, VAT, post and packing and insurance. Contact 
Gerry Austin of PCW World on 0384 66269 for further details. 



Ink-lined to be 
of help 

Meanwhile, Tom Burden of 
Leeds Polytechnic has come up 
with a helpful service for users of 
Hewlett Packard desk jet print- 
ers, (which have an Epson PX80 
emulation so are supported by 
LocoScripl 2's printer driver). 
'The cartridges can run out very 
quickly, especially if they are 
used to print graphics and DTP" 
explained Mr Burden. 
"Replacements cost £14- £15, 
which is pretty costly." Burden 
has come up with a re-inking ser- 
vice w hich will cost vou less than 



half the price. One ribbon will cost 
you £7.50. but reductions are 
available for "bulk" orders. Two or 
three ribbons will be re-inked for 
£6.00 each, and four ur more will 
cost a mere £5.00 per ribbon. "1 
am hoping that 1 will be able to 
develop a cheaper way of replac- 
ing the cartridges for the new 
Canon buhblejet" (see 'On the 
move 11', over the page) Tom told 
us. " I just need to persuade some- 
one to lend me their new printer 
for a few days!" Telephone 
enquiries can be made to Mr 
Burden on 0532 782355, or rib- 
bons can be sent straight in to 
Tom at 9, St Chad's Grove,

Walkthrough 



Get the boot 

A problem which has been 
interesting TOO scries owners 
and software developers is the 
following; is ii possible lo boot 
(startup I an 8256 or S5 1 2 from 
the B; drive? The 95l2has to 
boot from j double density 
inn (lit atl its got!) so why nul 
the 8001) series'! Well, the 
machines have very different 
architectures and, as far as we 
know, no one has yet come up 
wilh aB:dnve bowing 81)00 
scries machine. Anyone got any 
bnjhi ideas? The point of .ill 
this, by the was. is lhal once 
your A: drive breaks there's no 
way into your machine without 
buying a new one. 



What's in a 
name? 

The 8256 and 85 12 arc so called 
bcause [hey make use of Ihe 

ZSfl processor chip. The Z 
• I and> lor Zilog and was devel- 
oped by a large company called 
Intel. So.doeslhc 95 12 make 
use of a Z90? In a word no. 
There is nosucii thins;, [ft 
called the 95 12 because 
Anrstrad needed a number u> 
follow 8. 



More 95 1 2 for you 

Just because the 9512 came out of its box with one built-in drive it 
doesn't mean that it has to stay that way. Tim Smith makes the upgrade 




OAII electronic equipment stores residual voltage. This is especially 
tine of computers. So, unless you have some strange power which 
enables you lo store eleciricity, you should leave the 95 1 2 switched off and 
unplugged overnight, Before going into ii you should also earth yourself.

I The *J5 12 is a secure beast. It comes with six retaining screws ■ cress 
head (Philips) variety. There are two on the side (towards the front), 
two on ihe base al the back and two on each side of the top of the machine, 

Remove these, as well as the contrast and brightness switches. 




I Once the screws are removed and stored you can take the back casing 
_. from the machine. Have a blanket or other non-scratch surface ready 
to lay the 9512 down on. You actually have to remove ihe front of the PCW

tighten it withoul the cable connected. 



©There are more cables to deal with. They all need removing from the

Walkthrough _ 



T 

he PCW 95 I 2 came with a 
number of very big surprises for 
•M. those people who hatl been used 
to doi matrix printers, small keyboards 
and single density (A: drive) discs. One 
of these shocks was the fact that the 
machine was bundled with one, lonely 
double density disc drive. While this 
gave a storage capacity of 780k. which 
seems a more than adequate amount, it 
did make the process of baeking-up 



files rather tedious. There was always 
massive amounts of disc swapping to 
to he done. 

Lurking within the machine, 
however, is space, power and cabling 
for yet another drive. Filling a new 
drive here would double the storage of 
the 95 12 and cut down on disc swap- 
ping. It also means, with the new 
memory packs which have recently 
become available, that your Stan of Day 



procedure can uiLike even more use ol 
the machine. Using two drives, a 
RatnPack and Flipper you could turn 
your PCW 0512 into a mighty computer 
which would put some upstart IBM PC 
clones to shame. 80(X) Plus will now 
show you just how easy it is to fit a new 
double density drive and make your 
9512 work even harder for you.

l Once you have the cables removed you will need to free the from 
panel from ihe main body of the machine. There are four screws on 
each side of the front of the 9512 which need 10 be released and stored for 
later. Take care not to loosen the screws around Ihe screen itself. 



OOnce all the cables have been released you can remove the front from 
the body of the machine and lie them next to each other. You can then 
get a good look at Ihe mounting for your new drive. This might also be a 
good time 10 remove the front panel and plastic guard flap. 




OYour new drive should now be unpacked. On the back of it is a small 
metal guard flap secured with one screw. Loosen it and remove the 
guatd. This will need 10 be refined laier. The screw will secure both ihe 
guard and the earthing cable. Before that, ensure that ihe apenure is clean.

When you've goi the drive ruled to its moorings you're ready for

Variety Performance 

Phil Craven goes bargain-spotting and shows you how to go about 
attaching non PCW-specific external drives to your machine 




Remember when Amstrad 
launched the first PCWs onto a 
relatively unsuspecting nation 
with their impressive "get rid of your 
typewriter and buy all this great gear" 
TV campaign? We all dashed off to our 
local computer shop with our type- 
writers tucked neatly under one arm. 
The shops didn't warn our typewriters 
but, undaunted, we staggered back 
again, proud as punch, clutching our 
shiny new PCWs under the other arm. 
Remember that? It was just before the 
first advertisements appeared to tell us 
that our 3" disc drives might not really 
be the bee's knees after all; our little 
hearts were suddenly thrown into turbu- 
lent disarray. 

In those days we were offered the 
5.25" drive as an alternative and, more 
recently, a number of 3.5" drives have 
been added to the range. We now know, 
of course, that the 3" version is in no 
way inferior to any other and that each 
size has its own particular merits which 
have been fully explored in our pages. 
In one way we are perhaps a little fortu- 
nate in that if we want the merits of a 
particular disc drive, we don't have too 






THE CIRCUIT BOARD 



Tandy circuit boards have 
copper rings around each hole 
making soldering to them very 
simple. Slrip board is not ideal 
for this purpose since too 
many strips would need lo be 
cut and the number of wire 
connections is not reduced. 
Slots may need to be cut in the 
26-way female IDC connector 
to accommodate the bumps of 
fee PCWs socket.

many to choose from - unlike owners of 
PCs. Amigas or STs whose respective 
magazines contain a plethora of disc 
drive advertisements each purporting to 
be the best. 

As PCW owners, we have been 
blessed with relatively easy choices. 
Until now, thai is. For now [ ant going 
to explain why almost any disc drive 
can be made to work on all models of 
PCW, Why would you want to know 
this? Well, there are many new and used 
drives offered for sale in various maga- 
zines, auctions, sales - and other places 
- a! prices so low that our wallets would 
positively leap out of our pockets if 
only they would work with our PCWs! 
But they are usually designed for other 
computers, or not even cabled up at all. 

Do you take Shugart? 

They may be cased, uncased, with or 
without a power supply, 5.25 inch. 3,5 
inch, 3 inch. full. half, third or quarter 
height, single or double -sided, 80 track, 
40 track or even 40/80 switchable, It 
sounds confusing, doesn'l it? Without a 
little bit of prior knowledge, they would 
all appear to be absolutely worthless lo 



us. But, in fact, many of them would be 
more than suitable for us and it isn't 
difficult to find out which ones. 

The first thing to realise is that 
almost all disc drives conform to the 
same interface standard and are, as far 
as your PCW is concerned, much of a 
muchness. Whether they be Teac, 
Hitachi or Citizen, they interface to the 
computer in an identical way. They may 
have differences such as 40 or 80 tracks 
and take different sizes of discs but, lo 
us. they are the same. 

Obviously then, none of the PCW 
alternative drives we see advertised on a 
regular basis are in fact PCW-specific. 
They are all standard drives which have 
special cables to allow them to connect 
to the PCW. Similarly, an Atari or PC 
drive is standard but has a special Atari 
or PC cable. The one thing which stan- 
dardises them is the set of 34 signals 
(connections), known as the Shugart 
interface, by which they connect to a 
computer. Like most computers, the 
PCW implements this signal set; there- 
fore most drives can be connected to it. 

So standard is the Shugart interface 
that it is reasonably safe to assume an

Complete cable assembly 

Constructing the cable to connect the PCW to the 

disc drive - via the circuit board ■ is quite a simple 
task. You will need about 4 feel of 34-way, flat 
ribbon cable from which you make the long, 26- 
way cable (from [he PCW to the circuit board) 
and the short cable (from the drive to I he circuit 
board}. You will need 2 34-way female IDC 
connectors, male and female 26-way IDC 
connectors, a small circuit board and some dual 
header strip. All the connectors must be cable- 
mounted. The circuit board needs only the header 
strips and wires, as shown in the diagram, 
soldering to it. A short, 2 inch piece of ribbon 
cable should be cut from the main length and the 
34 way female IDC connector squeezed onto one 
end in a vice. The disc drive's connector is 
squeezed onto the other end. It can then be 
pushed onto the circuit board as shown. 

The rest of the cable joins the circuit board to 
the PCW. but first 8 strands need to be removed A 
leaving a long 26 way cable. A 26 way connector 
should be squeezed onto each end. The diagram 
shows this and it is important to put them on the 
sides of the cable as shown. It can then be pushed 
onto the board and the job is complete.

unknown disc drive to have it. However, 
there is one important thing to watch out 
for. Pin 34 of the drive's 34-way 
connector must be allocated to the 
'Ready' signal. Many computers don't 
use it, but the PCW docs. Some drives 
don't implement it and, without a modi- 
fication, they will not work for us. Pin 
34 is clearly marked on all drives and it 
should have a printed circuit track 
running from il. Not only that, but il 
should also go somewhere sensible. I 
once came across a promising drive with 
the said I rack running from pin 34 but, 
alas, it disappeared into a hole never to 
emerge again. 

Getting on the right track 

To pul il simply, 40 tracks on one side of 
a disc will provide about 180K of 
storage space and 80 tracks will provide 
aboui 360K. The PCW 8000 series' A 
drive is a 40 track device with one head 
io read one side of the disc only. Hence, 
there are 1 69 K free after formatting. A 
double headed drive has, funnily 
enough, one head for each side of the 
disc, making it unnecessary lo turn the 
disc over to use ihe other side. So an 80 
track, double-headed (or -sided) drive 
will provide aboui 720K of disc space 
and is the type which ihe PCW 95 1 2 has 
for its A drive and which all 8000s have 
for the B drive. It is this type which we 
would be looking out for, so only an 80 
track, double-sided drive is any use in 
us, 40/80 track switchable drives can 
have a special use (see last month's 
issue). It would also need to be a 1 
megabyte drive rather than a 1 .4 meg or 
higher. If the owner gets around 700K - 
800K storage per disc, then the drive is 
eminently suitable. 

Full, half, ihird and quarter heights 
only matter cosmetically. Since the 
arrival of the floppy disc in the 
computer world, they have become 
smaller and smaller: a one third height 
drive is likely io be newer lhan a half 



height one, although it cannot be taken 
for granted. 

Wired for action 

Whether or not a drive has its own 
power supply is important. The PCW is 
able to supply power for 3" and 3.5" 
drives but it is not wise to try to run the 
larger 5.25" from it. In this case, it is 
better to buy one with its own power 
supply although separate power units 
can be found. 

When you've found and bought 
your incredibly cheap disc drive and you 
try to fit it by following our recent step 
by step instructions, you will quickly 
notice one important thing. You don't 
have a cable! And even if you have, it is 
sure to be the wrong one. Inside your 
monitor are two spare connectors which 
normally connect to the internal B drive. 
One is a 26-way and carries all the 
Shugart signals the PCW needs. The 
other is the 4 way power connector. 

All you have to do, via a 34-way 
flat ribbon cable and a small DIY circuit 
board, is connect the PCW's 26 signal 
lines correctly to the disc drive's 34. If 
your drive is small enough and doesn't 
have its own power supply, you will also 
need to connect the 4-way power 
connneetor. The diagram above shows 
you how. 

Make the connection 

One more little operation is needed. 
Your disc drive needs to know that it is 
to operate as the B drive and not the A. 
On its circuit board it has a set of links 
marked DSO DS 1 DS2 DS3 or 1 2 3 or 
1 2 3 4 or even A B C D. They will be in 
a row, though not necessarily side by 
side, and one of ihein will already be 
linked. The drive number will be 
whichever link is made: for example, if 
DSO is linked, the drive is number or 
A. To make it the B drive, the second in 
the series must be linked- DSl. The 
rest, of course must not be linked. Some 



3.5" drives have a 4 position slide 
switch instead of the links, with four 
clearly marked positions. Either way, 
the second position or link must be 
selected. 

Fitting the drive to the PCW is very' 
simple (see June issue) but one or two 
points should be noted. If the PCW's 
power is used, be careful to connect it 
correctly. Wrong connections can result 
in damaging the drive. Many drives 
have protection in case this happens but 
it cannot be assumed to exist. 

If the signal cable is fitted the 
wrong way round, then the drive will 
not operate. But no harm will come to 
either the drive or the computer. When 
powered up, the message 2 disc drives 
found will appear on screen; the A drive 
will function as normal, but the B drive 
will dig its heels in and refuse lo budge. 
The solution is to turn everything off, 
turn the cable over and begin again. All 
those drives which have their own 
power supply should be switched on 
before the computer. 

PCW power-house 

If you have a 3 or 3.5 inch drive and you 
are going to make use of the PCW's 
power then make sure that you connect 
the right voltages lo the righi pins. You 
can do this by measuring the voltages on 
the PCW's 4-way connector with a 
multimeter. They are 12v, Ov, Ov, and 5v 
- in that order. Mark the 12 volt line so 
that there is no error. Disc drives are 
standard in the way their power connec- 
tors are mounted; the 1 2 volt pin is 
always the closest to the comer of the 
printed circuit and the 5-volt pin nearest 
to the centre. The two volt lines are 
between them. 

The spare eight strands of the long 
cable could be pressed into service for 
power. !n fact they wouldn't even need 
to be cut off. Three strands could carry 
12 volts, three could carry volts and 
two could carry 5 volts. •

THERE ARE SEVERAL 
DATABASES FOR THE PCW 




But only one for LocoScript 2 



LocoFile is the easy-to-use, pop-up database that works 
within LocoScript 2, 

You can use it just like a card index; there's a separate card 
for each page of information. You can design the layout of 
the cards to suit your needs and you can change the 
number and order of the items in your cards at any time. 

LocoFile is ideal for storing any type of information from 
membership records to your personal address book. You 
can then sort these cards in any order you wish - by name, 
by town, or by any item on the card. 

When you're typing a letter, simply call up LocoFile and 
copy names and addresses straight into your document - 
you never need to type an address again! 

And LocoFile can doa great deal more when you use itwith 
LocoMail - the mail merge program. LocoMail lets you 
create standard letters merged with LocoFile information to 
produce mailshots, detailed reports and labels.

Masterfile _ 



Get it together! 

In the last of the Masterfile series, Rob Ainsley covers file transfer with 
Loco Script, mail-merging and much much more 



With Masterfile you can import 
and export your data - which 
means essentially that you 
can use Masterfile data in other 
programs and vice-versa. Suppose you 
keep a list of club members or customer 
addresses on a Masterfile database; you 
can export the data into LocoScripl and 
have the name and address list appear in 
a LocoScript (or Protext) file at the 
touch of a button - no tedious retyping! 
Similarly, if you have a name and 
address list in LocoScript, you can 
import this into Masterfile and have. a 
database instantly set up. (Though 
unlike Britain, you'll be exporting far 
more than you import). 

Here's an example. Load up the 
example file X05ADDR.MFC from 
your Masterfile copy disc. It contains a 
few names and addresses with telephone 
numbers. (Press [D] for Display to have 
a look at it). Say you want this list 
'typed' for you into a LocoScript tile. (If 
you select certain ones first, only that 
selection will be exported). 

From the main menu press [L] for 
Load/Save then [E] for Export. You see 
the format zero on screen showing all 
the fields and are asked to (>ive 
data number. If you wanted the list to 
be in the order address-telephone 
number- name, you'd type 2 [ENTER) 
then 3 |ENTER|then I | ENTER) 
then | ENTER J. If you wanted just the 
name and address, you'd type 1 
[ENTER] then 2 [ENTER] then 
[ENTER1. If you want all the items in 
the same order as they appear, just press 
[ENTER) first off. 

Now you're asked a series of 
questions: 



Data identifiers (Y/N>? 

You usually answer [Njo to this. If you 

answer [Y]cs, you'll find that all the 
first field items (names) are prefixed by 
a & A, all the second (addresses) by &B, 
the third (phone numbers) by &C, the 
fourth by &D (not applicable here) and 
so on. It sounds useless, but actually 
can be vital for LocoMail users. Answer 
N unless you want to use the file as a 
data file in LocoMail or LocoFile, in 
which case enter Y. 

Surname Shuffle (Y/N)? 
This makes names entered as 
Smith<John come out as John Smith. 
Enter Y if you're exporting to 
LocoScripl or Protext. 



Line breaks: B= hbmk C=split 
other=n/e 

Your addresses are normally entered as 

1 High SI Hull or whatever, with that 

underscore character splitting lines on 

printout. If you press [B] here, the above 

line would come out as 

1 High St Hull whereas [C| will make it 

1 High St 

Hull 

and anything else will make it 1 High 

St_Hull. You should press [C] if you're 

exporting to LocoScript or Protext. 

Comma delimited (Y/N)? 
Answering [Y] gives you 
John Smith,l High St Hull.0482 
577363,M Green,6 The Parkway... 

and so on, whereas [N] gives you 

John Smith 

1 High St Hull 

0482 577363 

M Green ... and so on. Press [N| unless 

you work with Protext. set up for 

comma delimited data files. 

Wrapped in quotes (Y/N)? 
Answering Y you'll get John Smith 
coming out as "John Smith" whereas 
[N] makes it John Smith. Unless you 
work with Protext set 
up for data files 
wrapped in quotes 
like this, press [N]. 



the cursor over the file that holds the 
exported data (ADDS or whatever) and 
[ENTER] twice. You now see the infor- 
mation that was in the database typed in 
for you. Save the new file; there you 
have it. 

In Protext. you can just edit the file 
ADDS straight off. 

Deeper waters 

Unfortunately things aren't quite that 
simple. The list has probably come 
across in a slightly unsuitable format for 
your purposes. You need to polish it up 
before you can use it. 

If you want to print the names and 
addresses as labels (having set up the 
Loco document to label fonnat first, of 
course) you must have a new page 
between each name. If you answered 
Y to Recnrd separators, your 
problems are over: just press [EXCH] 
and give [RETURN | [RETURN) as the 
text to find, |ALT] [RETURN] as the 
text to replace it with, and select auto- 
matic exchange to end of document. 
This makes all blank lines into new 
page commands. 

But if you want to make a

Masterfile can print labels:

Record separators 

(Y/N)? 

|Y] puts a blank line 
between records; [N] 
does not. [Y] is 
usually the best bet.

sheet of A4), 



LocoMail or LocoFile data file of the 
new list, you need a bit more fiddling 
about. Let's assume the first page of the 
LocoMail/File file - the one that tells 
LocoM ail/File how to interpret the list 
that follows- is like this: 
name 

addressttel no 
(new page) 

[f you have answered Y to Data identi- 
fiers, you can do three exchanges 
(remember to go back lo the beginning 
of the document before stage 2 and 
stage 3 below): 

1. [EXCHJall [RETURN] (RETURN) 
&A by [ALT] [RETURN] 

This puts the required new page 
between each record. 

2. [EXCH] all &B for nothing. 
This strips out all the &Bs 

3. [EXCH] all [RETURNJ&C for ; 
This puts a semi-colon at the end of the 
address. However many lines it had in 
Masterfile. LocoMail/File will now 
know where it ends. 

The result can now be used in 
LocoMail or LocoFile - saves a lot 
of re-typing. 

Balance of payments 

So what about the converse - putting 
that LocoMail file into Masterfile, for 
example? (LocoFile to Masterfile is a 
bit trickier - see "Tipoffs" in Ihis issue). 
Suppose you have a name-address- 



telephone list set out as 

name 

addressttel no 

(new page) 

Tilings are a bit complicated, because 

Masterfile can't just be told 'the address 

is the thing up to the semi-colon'. First 

you have to make the file into a form 

that Masterfile can import - essentially 

you must reverse the three steps 

outlined in the previous section. So: 

1. [EXCH] all |RETURN|sforan 
underline character (which is [SHIFT] 
hyphen). 

2. [EXCH) all semicolons (;) for 
| RETURN] 

3. Put a line break between the names 
and addresses - sorry, you'll have to do 
this manually! 

4. [EXCH] all [ALT] [RETURN] for 
[RETURN1 [RETURN] 

Now save the new file as ADDS or 
something. At the disc manager, press 
[I'll for Make ASCII file (|t7] in 
LocoScript 1 ) and give ADDS as the 
file to be made into ASCII and 
ADDS.MF say as the name for the 
result. Select the Simple text option. 
Make sure ADDS.MF is in group of 
the disc. 

To insert into a Masterfile file, run 
up Masterfile and create a new address 
file (or load up an existing one) which 
must have at least three fields, the first 
three being Name. Address and

ADDS.MF on it and give that name. 
You see the message importing and 
the number of records increasing as the 
data is imported. Next time you view 
the file you should see the new items 
incorporated. If you import a file with 
say three fields into one with seven, the 
last four in each record are taken to be 
blank. You can't import a file that has 
more fields than the one into which 
it is inserted. 

Invisible earnings 

You can export and then re-import a 

data file in Masterfile - very useful if 

you want to change the setup of a file. 

Suppose you started off with the name 

as the key field of your club member 

list, but now want the membership 

number as the key. At the moment it 

looks like: 

Name 

Address 

Mem no 

but you want it as 

Mem no 

Name 

Address 

You export the file, but giving the 

membership number, 3, as the first field, 

then 1 as the second, and 3 as the third. 

Export it giving N for every option, and 

calling it say MEMBERS.EXP. Then set 

up a new file set out with Mem no as 

the key field, import MEMBERS.EXP, 

and there you have it. 

Another use for this trick is when 
you need extra fields. Suppose, for 
example, you have set up a simple 
name-address-phone database, like 
X05ADDR.MFC, and realise as you're 
typing in the names that you also need 
the age of each person. Export the file, 
giving | ENTER] to include all the fields 
and then N for all the options, and call 
the result TEMP. Then set up a new 
database with four fields: name, 
address, phone and age. Press |L] for 
Load/Save, [I) for Import, give the 
name TEMP as the file to import and 
your database has been expanded. 

Format tricks 

Finally. Masterfile lets you indulge 
your artistic leanings by putting in 
fancy boxes, lines and panels in your 
formats, as in the many formats in 
Masterfile "s example files. These don't 
print out but can liven up screen data. 
You insert them as other elements, by 
pressing I when making a format. Then 
you have the following options, [B] 
inserts an outline box and [P] a solid 
panel. Your further options are to move 
it with |MJ, change the size with [S]. 
[A| draws lines across and [V] lines 
down. Your further options for lines are 
[P] for 'pattern' (pressing (P] cycles 
between bright, medium and dark lines) 
[L] for length, how many ([N]), spacing 
f[S| plus cursor increases or decreases 
the space apart) and move ([M]), 
When you've finished an operation, 
hit [ENTER |. •

AMSTRAD FX9600T 
FAX MACHINE 

£689 • Amstrad • 0279 454SSS 

Right, we'll gel this straight from the 
st^n; fax machines are incredibly 
useful, easy to use and. for the most 
part, they are extremely expensive. The 
next thing to agree upon here is that no 
yuppie jokes will be cracked ... AK? 
Back in October of last year, Amstrad 
announced the launch of their first fax 
(or to put ii pedantically, facsimile) 
machine. Nol only would it enable you 
to send and receive text and pictures, it 
would also interlace (connect) with 
your computer. We waited and waited, 
anticipating its built-in photocopying, 
primer and other, programmable, 
features. Finally, a grey plastic box, the 
size of a 24 pin printer, arrived. 

The FX9600T is a typical Amstrad 
product: cheaper than its competitors (in 
the world of the fax you can expect to 
pay anything From £800 to £2000) and 
bursting with features. A normal, run of 
the mill fax machine serves a simple 
purpose; to send and receive text and 
graphics over the telephone lines, 

In order to achieve these feats, the 
machine takes hard copy (printed) infor- 
mation and encodes it in such a way that 
it can be transmitted over the wires. It 
then decodes the same data and 
provides a hard copy facsimile of the 
original document. Far from being a 
frivolous luxury, this ability to send and 
receive written or graphic matter 
quickly provides anyone, from a travel- 
ling salesperson to a university lecturer. 



with the ability to access information 
quickly and efficiently. 

Ready, handset, go! 

Now for the machine itself. When you 
first open the box. you will find the fax 
itself ( prepare your desktop for a minor 
shock as you will need to clear as much 
space as you would for the PCW itself). 
You will also find a polythene wrapped 
telephone handsel dangling down from 
the body of the machine. 

Most users of fax machines will 
find the idea of a handsel quite quaint. 
The reason for this being that, in the 
office where these machines are most 
commonly found, there are dedicated 
fax lines and most faxes come with 
numeric keypads built on. The 
FX9600T. however, is aimed at the 
small business or possibly even the 
home user. These two areas of use 
require a little more thought as there 
might be only one telephone line avail- 
able. Consequently, the addition of a 
handset enables the line to lie used for 
voice communications as well as for fax 
transmissions. Handy really. 

The idea, as with most things 
Amstrad, is excellent and will be a boon 
to many people. The execution, 
however, leaves quite a lot to be 
desired. The handset is too slim; it has 
to fit flush with the easing of the 
machine, which makes it uncomfortable 
to use (unless you happen to have tiny- 
ears ). The fact that the mouth and 
earpieces are almost, but not quite, the 
right distance apart and that the unit 
feels over heavy turns a great idea into a 
bit of a pain. 

To the right of the handset is a 
small, black, pinwheel which nestles by 
the side of the LCD (liquid crystal 
display). The pinwheel controls the 
screen contrast. The screen provides a 
mass of information from the time and 
date to the number you are dialling to 
details of the programmable features. 

Below the LCD are three 'soft- 
keys'; these are used to 'program' the 
fax with such information as the 
Character Set you are using (Epson for 
the PCW please, although there are also 
two IBM settings), which Language Set, 
and other details like accessing your list 
of telephone numbers and printing out 
"Activity Reports". 

Fax a lot 

Once you have these you are ready for 



the off. As a standard fax machine, the 
FX9600T does its job adequately and 
with little fuss. It does, however, lack 
two facilities which many (expensive) 
dedicated faxes have: the first is 
Polling, a method by which one fax 
calls several others and prompts them to 
send documents which have been set up 
for transmission. The second is 
Broadcasting; this is simply the ability 
to send one document to several other 
machines automatically (without 
having to dial for each machine). 
As we have already mentioned, it is 
possible to connect to the British 
Telecom (or Mercury) line which 
you would normally use for voice 
communications. 

If you do so, the voice has prece- 
dence over the fax at all times. 
Receiving faxed mail is simplicity itself. 
There are two modes available in the 
form of manual and automatic. You will 
probably find that the laner becomes the 
most used function purely because it 
needs less input from the user. As its 
name suggests, the automatic facility 
answers all incoming calls as if they 
were faxes. 

The phone will ring twice and will 
then be answered with a high-pitched 
facsimile scream. Using the manual 
system entails having to press the fax 
start/stop button when you want to 
receive, but it does save unsuspecting 
callers from the ear-splitting screech. 

Fax transmission is a little more 
complex if only because the range of 
options open to you is extremely wide. 
Using the FX9600T as a standard fax 
machine allows you to store phone 
numbers so that they can be recalled at 
the touch of a button - or even by the 
keying of two digits. The hands-off 
function allows dialling to be carried 
out without recourse to the uncomfort- 
able handset, but the really impressive 
features relate to the quality of docu- 
ment which you are able to send. 

This is where the Fine and 
Halftone keys come in. While the 
manual advises you to experiment with 
the halftone facilities (it is woolier than 
Larry the Lamb in a sheepskin jacket 
when it comes to defining the difference 
between halftone I and halftone 2) both 
the halftones definitely add to the 
quality of output. The Fine option will 
also preserve details. The only problem 
here, and it is nol the fault of the 
machine, is that the receiving device has 



Fax Machine _ 



lo be capable of dealing with hatftoned 
images. Unless you are sure about the 
fax at the other end of the line, it is best 
to stick with halftone off. 

A PCW's story 

You will be pleased to know that your 
PCW, with its interface and cable luted, 
does not merely sit around looking 
pretty. It has a number of roles to play. 
Firstly, and most importantly, you can 
create a message document in 
LocoScripl or Proiexl and instead of 
having lo produce hard copy (a printed 
sheet) you merely set the fax to Online 
and Text, tell the PCW that its printer . 
now derives from the parallel port and 
print the document. The Text light on 
the FX9600T will flash confirming that 
the data has been received and is ready 
to send. You then dial the number and 
the message is sent. No paper involved 
here at all. 

Although your PCW and the 
FX9600T can communicate quite 
happily with each other, it is a sad fact 
that the FX9600T was designed for PC 
rather than PCW compatibility. This 
means thai a small program has to be 
written in order to make use of one of 
the functions built in to the fax; it is 
theoretically possible to create a list of 
your most commonly used telephone 
numbers (in the form of name, voice 
number and fax number), using a word 
processor and then transfer these details 
over to the FX9600T This ability to 
create and transfer telephone details 
from the PCW to the fax is a most 
useful one. 

Copier cat 

One function which we have mentioned 
in passing is photocopying. The 



BUTTON IT, PAL 

To the right or the LCD you can 
see a large, grey pad - this is the fax 
Start/Stop button used when the 
machine is in manual mode. 

Below this is a slim Reset key. 
Further to the right is the numeric 
dial/keypad, Below that you will 
find a rank of soft (squidgy actu- 
ally! blue keys which control the 
various modes under which the fax 
can operate. They are, from left to 
right. Auto (for automatic reception 
or messages), On-line (this is used to 
set the fax as a printer for your 
PCW), Text (use this when you want 
to send a pre-prepared piece of text 
directly from your PCW to the fax). 

Then there's Fine (this sets 
a high resolution, for example, 
when sending detailed drawings), 
Halftone (used to give three ha 
If tone settings - Off, 1 and 2 when 
transmitting or copying). Copy (this 
turns the fax into a photocopier), 
Shortcode (this one turns those 
regularly used phone numbers into 
two digits), On Hook (this is for 
those occasions when you're busy 
with something and you need to 

FX9600T is not content merely to sit 
around being a fax machine, it also 
doubles as a copier in incredibly simple 
style. All you need do is take your orig- 
inal document, feed it into the document 
tray as you would with a written fax 
document, and press the Copy key. As 
with most photocopying, it is advisable 
to use monochrome images for the best 
results; if you really have to use colour 
matter, then the ubiquitous halftones 




YOU SEND ME 

If you w ish to use your PCW to prepare and send taxes you will need to 
carry out the following commands: in LocoScript 2 you should go to the 
Settings option and tell the PCW that the printer now works from the 
parallel port; save this to a SETTINGS.STD file. Using LocoScript it is a 
good idea to save your document file as plain text ASCII. Then simply print 
out the document; it will be sent to the fax. The same system is used if you 
want to use the FX96uOT as a printer, except this time you should not have 
the Text key set to on. 

Using Protexl is even easier. Again, save a document as ASCII but this 
time simply enter the command PAR at the command line. 

CP/M is slightly more complex. The first thing to do is to use DEVICE 
.COM in the following mannner: 
At the M> prompt you enter DEVICE and you wilt see the following 

Physical Devices: I=Inpul, 0=Output, S=Serial, X=Xon-Xoff 
CRT NONE IO LPT NONE O SIO 9600 IOSX CEN NONE O 

Current Assignments: CONIN: = CRT CONOUT: = CRT AUXIN: = SIO 
AUXOUT: = SIO LST: = LPT 

Enter new assignment or hil RETURN (you then enter) LST:=CEN and see 

Physical Devices: 1 = Input. 0=Output, S=Serial, X=Xon-XofT 
CRT NONE 10 LPT NONE O SIO 9600 IOSX CEN NONE O 

Current Assignments: CONIN: = CRT CONOUT: = CRT AUXIN: = SIO 
AUXOUT: = SIO LST: = CEN 

Once the printer output (LST: I has been directed to the parallel port all 
LPRINT commands in BASIC will go to that port. You can also send files 
from CP/M using PIP.COM like Ihis: 

PIP LST:=SENDFILE.DOC So, not only docs the FX9600T act as a 
printer and a fax it also teaches you a little bit more about CP/M. 




dial; with 'hands off* dialling, the handset stays on the hook 
and a microphone sets in), Redial (this is for making tea; no 
really, it's to redial the last mini her I. 

Beneath this lut are two further ranks of soft blue 
buttons. These act as a kind of keyboard used lor entering 
header details such as the name of your company and the 
date. They arc also used for the automatic dialling of stored 
'phone numbers. That's the keys dealt with. 

You will need two further pieces of equipment if you 
are thinking of connecting your PCW to the FX9600T; the 
first is an RS232 interface - these range in price from 
around {45 up to £70. Then you will need a parallel cable 
(costing around £10; you would have thought that Amstrad 
could have included one). 



come into play yet again (See 'It's a con' 
in the margin on the previous page). 

One minor downside with this is 
that the FX9600T was designed as a fax 
machine and, as such, it has to use 
expensive thermal paper. This type of 
paper is slightly glossy and although the 
copied images are of excellent quality, 
the paper on which they appear is 
flimsy; it is also a bit of a pain to feed 
into the fax for transmission. Absurd as 
it sounds, you may well And yourself 
having to hunt down a true photocopier 
in order to copy your copy before 
sending it as a fax! However, for the 
price of the machine compared with 
what you would expect to lay out for a 
fully fledged photocopier, this whinge is 
easily overlooked. 

Even if Amstrad did not think to 
include a parallel cable, they were able 
to include one roll of thermal paper and 
six batteries. The batteries are cunningly 
hidden in the polystyrene packing. Once 
you have discovered ihem you will need 
to upend the fax and fit them into a 
compartment on its underside. The 
batteries serve as a memory' back-up for 
the the details which you have 
programmed in. Without them, every 
time you switched off the machine you 
would lose the stored telephone 
numbers, fax header details and the fax 
signature (this is a handy utility which 
enables your signature to be automati- 
cally printed out on each fax you send). 

In conclusion then, the Amstrad 
FX9600T serves its many purposes 
with, for the most part. ease. Because it 
has been set up as a Jack of all trades, it 
is obviously a master of none. But it will 
provide the small business or home user 
with several effective tools without 
breaking the bank. •

Style Council 

Sophie Lankenau shows you why you need never send drab, dull-looking 
documents out into the world - ever again 



LocoScript 




If you have recently made the break 
from typewriter to PCW you will 
probably be languishing in the 
ease with which your new machine 
allows you to work. With the help of 
LocoScript 2. the preparation of 
everyday written material is transformed 
into a simple task. Not only this, but the 
program can also turn your work into a 
visual feast on the finished page. The 
use of LocoScript 2"s Style, Size and Set 
and Clear Menus enables you to dress 
text in a clean and professional way, 
making simple documents stand out 
from the crowd. 

The Style menu allows you to 
impose details such as underlining, 
emboldening and italics to your work. 
All of these features will add extra defi- 
nition to a document, be it a simple 
memo or a lengthy piece of writing such 
as a report. For our purposes, we are 
going to show how stylistic changes can 
be added to a press release giving details 
of a new product launch. This kind of 
'enthusiastic' sales letter can rely 
heavily on visual impact to help draw 
attention to the information it contains. 
The tools which LocoScript offers to 
enhance the text you are preparing can 
be accessed by pressing [f3] for Style 
once you are in document editing mode. 

Going in strike 

First of all, we want to make the header 
PRESS RELEASE stand out as a title. 
Before you do this, you must ensure that 
the cursor is placed over the first char- 
acter of the word you are going to 
'style'. The |D| drop down menu 
reveals several options, all of which can 
be imposed by carrying out the same 
simple procedure. The option Double 
strike is a good way to ensure that text 
is adequately highlighted. This simply 
means that each character is printed 
twice by the printer. So, 

select Double Strike by moving the 
cursor with the down arrow key. and 
press the [+| key to the left of the 
spacebar. As soon as you press 
[ENTER], the double strike effect is 
activated. Now move the cursor char- 
acter by character (or word by word 
using [*SHIFT][CHAR|) until you want 
the double strike effect to slop. The left 
hand edge of the cursor defines the 
parameters of the action you are 
imposing, so be sure to include the last 
of the full stops after the final occur- 



rence of RELEASE. 

Now call up the [f3] Style menu 
and 'de-select' the double strike option 
by pressing the [-] key to the right of the 
spacebar. Pressing [ ENTER 1 returns you 
to the document. 

We now want to give more visual 
impact to the product name itself. Go to 
the first character of the word Plughole 
and call up the Style menu once more. 
Select Bold by moving the cursor with 
the down arrow key and pressing [+|. 
Press [ENTER] and you are returned to 
the document. Move the cursor along 
the width of the product name, stopping 
it after the T of KIT. Now go back 
to the style menu and 'deselect' the 
bold effect by highlighting the command 
and pressing [-]. 

It's code out there 

Although we seem to be giving extra 
definition to parts of our document, 
the effects of our action are not visible 
on screen. Everything which we are 
asking LocoScript to do is being stored 
as a code, which will instruct the 
printer to behave in a certain way when 
reproducing the document on the 
finished page. 

To ensure that the right instructions 
are being given, we can ask the program 
to show us the "codes' we have inserted. 
Press lSHIET][f7] to call up the [ffi] 
Options menu. Highlight Codes and 
select it by pressing the [+] key. A 
touch of the [ENTER] key triggers the 
appearance of a series of very strange 
looking codes. Closer examination 
reveals that they do in fact bear a 
resemblance to the style commands 
which the program has received from 
you. (See screenshot I ) 

These codes can be inserted into 
the document using another method. 
The |+] and [-] signs which precede 
each code correspond with two other 
drop down menus, which can be 
summoned by pressing those keys. The 
convenient give and take nature of 
LocoScript's short-cut menu is immedi- 
ately made obvious; for what Set ([+]) 
can give to a document with the utmost 
ease. Clear (|-|) can take away. 

A question of give and take 

Summon the Set menu by pressing [+[ 
to the left of the spacebar. The small 
time delay between pressing the key and 
seeing the menu appear can be appreci- 



ated when the list of options staggers on 
to the screen - there are 25 of them. 
(See screenshot 2) 

Each code contains either one or 
two capital letters; for example, CEntre. 
SupeR script. Reverse. These refer to 
keystroke instructions (we will be 
looking at them later) which allow you 
to implement stylistic changes without 
having to call menus down. 

To demonstrate the use of the Set 
and Clear menus in our document, we 
are going to go through and highlight 
the name of the company whose product 
is being announced. Placing the cursor 
at the start of the first occurrence of 
Wonko, press the [+| key and wait for 
the Set menu to appear. 

Select Bold and return to the 
document by pressing [ENTER]. 
Work through the word, leaving the 
cursor to the right of the last character. 
Now call up the Clear menu, (which is 
identical to the Set menu) and select 
Bold once more.

speed up ihe process, the use of the 
keystrokes mentioned earlier can be 
undertaken. 

Place the cursor at the beginning of

codes which are implied by the drop

capital letters) might be difficult to

familiar with this quick method of 
imposing stylistic variations, try itali- 
cising ihe list of product features by 
using [+][!] to start, and |-[)l jto stop. 
If you need lo check your actions, call 
up the |f8| menu and summon the 
Codes to the screen. 

Lay it above the line 

Among the various unfamiliar 
commands on the Set and Clear menus, 
you will see SuBscript and 
SupeRscript. These are commands to 
place text above or below the normal 
line position, and are probably best 
exemplified in a chemical equation. 

Our document happens to have one 
such equation which needs arranging in 
this fashion. The third paragraph 
contains a reference to ihe type of 
plastic used in Wonko's new product. 
Go to the figure 2 (after CH) and call 
up the Set menu by pressing [+1. The 
command we need is not visible on the 
portion of the drop down menu shown 
on screen, so keep pressing the down 
arrow key until it appears. 

Seleci SupeRscript and press 
I ENTER}. Back in the document, move 
the cursor to ihe 'f ' and call up the 
Clear menu to deselect Superscript (by 
highlighting it and pressing I ENTER] 
again). Now. go to the figure 3 and 
select SuBscript from the Set menu. 
Once the figure has been covered by the 
cursor, deselect the command using the 
Clear menu. To put the final figure 3 
into SupeRscript, we are going to use 
keystrokes to avoid having to call up the 
lengthy Set and Clear menus. Using the 
obvious capital letters, type in [+] SR 
when the cursor is on the 3. Move the 
cursor over lo the right of the 3 and 
deselect the option by pressing [-JSR. 

Now call up the [f8] menu and ask 
to see the state of the codes (by 
selecting Codes and pressing the 
spacebar or the [+] key. The screen 
will show a mass of bracketed codes 
which virtually obscure ihe actual text! 
(See screenshot 3) 

LocoScript is not content to offer 
you jusl the range of enhancements 
demonstrated so far. There are other 
ways to highlight text, using alterations 
in character size and line spacing. 
Return the cursor to the top of the 
screen and press [f4] for Size to see 
what is available. Don't be put off by 
the host of figures, ticks, and termi- 
nology; the best way to explain and 
implement the size options is to work 
methodically through Ihe menu. 

Strength of character 

If you have been following the World 
Cup Final, the first option might make 
you think of green things in Italy. 
However, character pitch refers to the 
size of the letters or figures on screen, 
and how many can be fitted to each 
horizontal inch on the line. Altering the 
pitch from the default setting of 1 2 (thai 
is, 1 2 characters per inch) to say, 10, 
means that text can be 'stretched', while 



22 ivh%gimPLVS 



changing it to 17 compresses the char- 
acters inlo a smaller space. 

In our document, we want lo make 
Ihe product name still more noticeable. 
Move Ihe cursor to the 'P' of Plughole 
and press [f4] for Size. Select 10 by 
moving the cursor arrow keys vertically 
and horizontally, and pressing [+] or the 
spacebar followed by [ENTER], Go 
through the product name, and leaving 
the left hand edge of the cursor in the 
space after the 'T* of KIT, go back to 
the [f4| Size menu and return the char- 
acter pitch to its default setting of 12, 

The Normal or Double width 
settings are self-explanatory in that the 
latter option allows for characters to be 
printed at exactly twice their normal 
width - another useful feature for 
extra definition. 

The Line Spacing options allow 
you to set the number of lines which 
the printer head moves down between 
lines iif text. The default selling of 1 
ensures single line spacing, whilst a 
setting of 2 produces double-spaced 
text. This would be particularly useful 
if you were submitting some written 
work for scrutiny by, say, a magazine 
editor, when visual clarity is of the 
utmost importance. 

Your carriage awaits you 

The option CR extra spacing offers a 
means of introducing extra spaces 
between paragraphs, CR standing for 
'carriage return', ft can be used in 
conjunction with line spacing settings, 
or on its own. in our document, we want 
to introduce an extra space before and 
after our list of asterisked features. 

Taking the cursor to the carriage 
return after 'creating' (the line above 
the list), press [f4] for Size, and select 
CR spacing with Ihe down arrow key. 
Move from Ihe default selling of to 10 
and press [ENTER]. (See screenshot 4). 
Take the cursor down to the last carriage 
return of the list after the word 'gold- 
fish', call up the size menu again, and 
return Ihe CR spacing to the default 
setting of 0. 

Line pitch is the final setting, and 
refers to the number of lines per vertical 
inch on the page. The defaull selling of 
6 means that each line is one sixth of an 
inch away from the next. Alterations 
can be made to all the size menu 
settings by using the 'codes' indicated 
at the top of the screen preceded by the 
l+l or [-[ keys. The use of keystrokes 
will actually prompt a modified verson 
of the Set and Clear menus to appear at 
the top right hand comer of the screen 
with the relevant command on display. 
Pressing [ENTER] disposes of the menu 
and initiates the sizing command into 
the document. All that remains is to 
print out your document, and see 
exactly how those invisible style and 
size variations have affected your work. 
(Sec the final picture). As with mosi 
things LocoScriptian, you will be both 
pleasantly surprised and extremely 
impressed with the professional and 
eye-catching result. •

RECHORD 

£29.95 • Cavalier Software • 
081 639 6683 • All PCWs 

Cavalier Software are no strangers to 
the production of good quality, easy to 
use 'vertical' software. The release of 
'Hotel' reviewed in 8000 Plus in 
January of this year proved that the 
company lias a particular talent of 
taking a specific market or interest and 
producing a tailor-made database to 
serve its needs. If you have a collection 
of recorded music which extends into 
the hundreds, then their latest offering, 
entitled 'Re-chord', will be of consider- 
able interest to you. Re-chord allows 
you to catalogue and access any item in 
a collection of music, whether it is an 
album, cassette or compact disc, with 
the minimum of fuss. 

Installation is a simple affair; the 
manual contains separate instructions 
for all three PCWs, which are clearly 
written and easy to follow. Be prepared 
to have two formatted CF2 discs to 
hand; the program and .EMS files must 
be copied on to these before you can 
start. Once this has been done, the soft- 
ware is self-booting, so you can give 
your CP/M disc a well earned rest while 



you are using Re-chord. 

Re- chord's opening menu displays 
eight options, from updating 'types' 
(this refers to the form in which 
recorded music is stored, whether it is 
an album, cassette, compact disc, and so 
on) and 'classifications', which include 
classical, popular and jazz music. 

When you are entering details of 
your collection, the option to select is 
[BJ for Create/ A mend Library Item. 
You are immediately asked to provide a 
reference number. It is suggested that 
you assign each classification a healthy 
range of numbers - say from 1 to I 999 
for the first group, 2000 to 3999 for the 
next and so on. You are then presented 
with a screen into which you enter the 
details of a particular recording. 

The sound of music 

If you complete ii fully, you will have 
the name of the artist and the title of the 
piece, its type and classification, a refer- 
ence code and the date - which can be 
the release date, the current date - it is 
up to you. You can also list all the tracks 
on lite recording, together with the 
eounter number which corresponds with 
each track (see screenshot). The hash 
key to the left of [RETURN] takes you 
back to the main menu. 

The reference number which you 
assign to a given library item is crucial. 
Numerical sorting is a logical yet irri- 
tating feature of the program, as every 
lime you want to either add or amend a 
library item, you have to remember its 
reference number. Even if your collec- 
tion is of modest proportions, you might 
not be able to remember instantly that 
you gave Des O' Connors's Greatest 
Hits the number 87. 

Without this reference number you 
cannot progress beyond the opening 
menu for many of the options. The 
numbers you choose are then supposed 
to be represented on the cassette box or 
album sleeve, so you could always rifle 
through your collection to check the 
number. There is, however, a way 
around this, whereby you track down 
the artist or piece first, and then find out 
the number you have allocated to it. 
This comes in the form of the ID] 
option - Trace Library Item. 

Go fetch! 

Re -chord's tracing system is both thor- 
ough and fast, and allows you to search 
for an item with the tiniest clue as a 
starting point. Selecting [D] calls up a 
list of search options (see screenshot) to 



help find a given record. So, if you 
wanted to find details of all the work in 
your collection by, say. Beethoven, the 
search by name option would be the one 
to pick. Similarly, if you were interested 
to find out the titles of all the recordings 
you bought or catalogued in July of 
1985. search by date would provide you 
with the relevant information. 

The Search by track option 
provides instant satisfaction to those 
plagued by knowing the name of a song 
or a piece, but not being able to 
remember who it was by or which 
recording it came from. All you do in 
this case is enter the name of the track - 
or even the first few letters - and Re- 
chord will charge through the records 
and give you a list of possibles. About 
the only thing which Re-chord's 
searching facility cannot do is to let you 
to hum tunelessly into the disc drive on 
your PCW. hoping that the machine 
knows the tune as well and can come up 
with the name of the song and the artist. 
This would solve the age old problem of 
bending your friends' ears with a less 
than Pavarottian rendition of a piece of 
music, and expressing surprise when 
they cannot recognise the song. 

A card up your sleeve 

Re-chord's 'coup de grace" is its 
printing options. The ability to print 
artist and album 'index cards' is an 
extremely useful feature, and allows 
you to keep a paper 'back up' of every- 
thing you have entered in the database. 
Not only does this save you having to 
load the whole program if you only 
want to run a quick check on one item 
in your collection, it also means that if, 
(heaven forbid) your PCW has a fit of 
amnesia in the middle of a Re-chord 
operation, at least you have all the infor- 
mation in card index form. 

The [G] option, for Print Cassette 
Index card is a real boon. What Re- 
chord produces for you is an actual 
cassette sleeve, which fits into your 
cassette case and displays all the infor- 
mation you need. So, the spine shows 
the artist and name of the recording, and 
on the cover there is a list of the tracks 
on each side of the recording. 

The beauty of the program is that 
you can exploit its storage capacity to 
the full, or you can keep details to the 
barest minimum yet still have a handy 
catalogue of your music. Whatever your 
needs. Re -chord is a capable database 
which is easy to use, and represents 
good value for money. •

THE COMPLETE HOME 

ENTERTAINMENT 

CENTRE 

£19.99 • CDS • 0302 321134 

Up until now there has never been darts 
on the PCW - that's right, dans. Along 
with this outing to the oche come domi- 
noes, a card game, a word-search and 
backgammon. You may well ask what 
the point is of having games on a PCW 
which you can quite happily play on a 
board. To which the answer comes 
'Have you ever tried playing dominoes 
on your own?' A single player game of 
backgammon is also not the most exhil- 
arating pastime in the world. 

The Complete Home 
Entertainment Centre comes on an A: 
drive disc. Loading is simple; all you 
need do is put the disc in the drive and 
type DISK. The contents of the M: 
drive are then wiped in order to load the 
games into RAM. Once this is done, the 
main menu screen loads and you're 
ready for the off. 

The main menu gives you the five 
options of darts, dominoes, something 
called the Video Card Arcade, 
backgammon and word-search. Choose 
one by pressing a relevant letter. We 
decided to begin with a pleasantly 
relaxing word- search. 

Hide and seek 

The word-search game is the same as 
those which you would find in maga- 
zines such as The Puzzler (or even at the 
back of last month's 8000 Plus). Hidden 
within what appears to be a chaos of 
letters are various words, all of which 



relate to the same topic. You move from 
the main menu to a sub-menu. Here you 
are asked at which level you would like 
to play. There are three levels - the first 
sees all the hidden words going in one 
direction leaving eight words to find, 
none of which cross each other. Level 2 
has sixteen words to discover; this time 
they cross. Level 3 has twenty-four 
words going in all directions, crossing 
and criss-crossing. 

The PCW comes into the fray 
when you decide which liming you 
want lo put on the game. There are four 
levels with 1 being quick and 4 being 
very quick. You use the cursor (arrow) 
keys to move around the board and 
control a small pointer. 

Once you have hit upon the 
required sequence of letters (the current 
word to find is listed for you) you use 
the |ALT] or [EXTRA] keys fo actually 
point in the direction (up. down, diag- 
onal) in which the word is going; for 
example, WORDSWORTH might run 
diagonally from left to right, so you 
move the pointer over the board to the 
first W in Wordsworth and then use the 
[ALT] key to point the pointer down the 
line; press [RETURN] and bingo! 
You've done it! 

Only it's not always that simple. 
You also have four lives to play with. A 
life is lost if you run out of lime or point 
in the wrong direction. 

Point scoring is straightforward: 
ten points for each word found. Bonuses 
accrue if you complete a particular 
theme. Different bonuses crop up 
depending on how long you took, how 
many lives you used up and al which 



level you were playing. Up to four 
players can join in. Be warned; Ihe 
game might sound simple but the timing 
factor gives it some zest. The only real 
problem is the fact that approximately a 
third of the PCW screen is used tor the 
word board itself; this makes reading it 
a tad wearisome. 

What a card 

Once we'd played a few, we felt it was 
time to really get the adrenalin flowing. 
A few games of cards were in order so 
we set off for the Video Card Arcade, 
Moving into this sub -menu gives the 
choice of three games; Poker Royale, 
Pontoon (otherwise known as 2 Is or 
Blackjack) and a game called High- 
Low. Not being a gambling magazine, 
no-one here had ever had any experi- 
ence of poker whether Royale or five 
siud or single draw with deuces wild. 
Poker Royale it was. 

Choose this and you are presented 
with five cards, side by side, at the top 
of the screen. Below this is the bank 
(where your winnings go) and credits; 
you begin the game with twenty of 
these and use one each time you play. 

The idea is that you are dealt five 
cards; you must then decide which, if 
any of the five, to hold and which to 
change. There is one change. The 
lowest winning hand is two pairs 
(scoring 20), the highest is a royal flush 
(scoring 300). Bonus credits are 
awarded and there is also a high score 
table. Gameplay is simple enough; press 
[RETURN] to deal and tap the number 
of the card (1,2, 3, 4 or 5) if you want 
to hold it. Once you made your choices 




The Plussers are not gambling people, so naturally we were rather flummoxed by ihe 
prospect of having lo play a card game. Poker Royale is now a compulsory office pastime. 

" 28 My 90 SWOTS 



Dominoes can't be played by one person, and CDS have solved the problem by providing 
you with a mean opponent - your PCW. The chubby hand selects your move, by ihe way. 



Games _ 



all you need do is re-deal tor the new 
cards - and hope. It's surprising Ihe 
amount of excitement which you can get 
from playing this game without any 
money being involved. 

After breaking the bank it was time 
to move onto Pontoon, If your PCW was 
ever to be a croupier, it would endear 
itself to the boss no end: it would also, 
however, gel lynched by the punters 
before too long. Aside from coming in 
on, or under, 2 1 and beating the bank, 
(this is the lowest win) you can also play 
for flushes, runs and the other classic 
card-playing formations. 

Again, you press [RETURN] to 
deal. Once the cards have been dealt, 
you have the choice of |T] wist or 
|5]lick. As wilh Poker, you have a 
number of credits to play with. Bonuses 
will pep these up but, essentially, 
Pontoon is a game which lacks any skill 
- especially so when there are no actual 
cards to be shuffled. Any normal game 
of cards (so we've heard) entails a deal 
of 'card-counting'; this means that you 
try to remember which cards have been 
played and mould your game from 
there. In all of the card games here, you 
can expect, say, the Queen of Clubs, to 
be played twice in two deals! Hence no 
card count; hence no skill. 

The next game up is High-Low. We 
won't go into this in any detail; suffice 
to say that the same credit/bonus system 
is used. This time, you have to guess 
whether the 'next' card dealt will be 
higher of lower than the one preceding 
it. Again, pleasant relaxation, but no 
skill involved. 

Domino theory 

You can almost smell the acrid odours 
of Scroggins Triplee Cripplee real ale 
mixing with old Jakes Best Navy Shag 
coming from the snug when the domino 
screen comes up. You have four playing 
options; you can either play with a 
Double-Six set (the most common) or 
the more yuppified Double -Nine. 

Tit is later set has more dots than a 
leopard with measles. The two-playing 
options are good old Domino Out, in 
which you play with seven doms a hand 
and attempt to play them all. You play to 
60 points (scored on what looks like an 
old cribbage scoreboard). Points are 
scored for 'getting out' and at the end of 
a hand for the person with the least 



points in their hand. 

The final game option is 3's and 
5's. This is fascinating and difficult to 
get the hang of if you've only been used 
to playing Domino Out. Points are 
scored not by the hand, but on each play. 
The idea is to make sure that you can 
'get out' and that the sum of the domi- 
noes at each end of play can be divisible 
by 3 or 5. So, if someone lays a double- 
six to begin with, this scores 4 
(6+6=12,12/3=4). The next player could 
then lay a 6/3 domino (six dots at one 
end and three at the other) on the double 
six to give a score of 8 ( 1 2+3=15. 
15/3=5, 15/5=3, 5+3=8). The game 
continues thus until someone scores 60. 

Because of the random nature of 
dealing in dominoes, the game is not 
affected by the computer. In fact, the 
PCW plays a damned good game. The 
dominos are chosen by moving a 
distinctly 1960s pop art hand (very 
Yellow Submarine). In fact the whole 
look of the game is clean and profes- 
sional - as you would expect from CDS. 

Back gammon stake 

The backgammon hoard could, however, 
have been better designed. It looks a 
little tatty - the dice jump rather than 
glide. You will also find that many of 
the thrills which come with playing 
backgammon for stakes are missing. 

Basically you play to four levels. 
Level one shortens the PCW's thinking 
time while level four allows it to 
contemplate for a few minutes. Play is 
still fairly rapid and even inexperienced 
players will find themselves getting the 
hang of it and winning more often than 
they lose. Happily, nothing in the docu- 
mentation claims marvels for the game. 
It should keep the kids amused for a 
while as they learn about the game but 
for more adult, experienced gammoners 
it holds little wonderment. 

With this in mind, we will move 
swiftly on to the piece de resistance: 
dans on the PCW. 

There are three game options open 
to you here in the form of 501 , Cricket 
and Tour Board, There are also three 
levels to play. The PCW can be Good. 
Average and Poor. Frankly, there seems 
to be little difference between the three 
which means that al least the game isn't 
fixed from the start. 

Once you've chosen the game and 



the level, you are taken to the board. 
This occupies up most of the screen, 
save for two side bars which give the 
impression of being a blackboard where 
your scores are chalked. The way you 
actually play is highly ingenious. At the 
bottom left of the scveen you will see a 
small point which jiggles around in 
frenetic (if drunken) manner. You use 
the cursor keys to move this point over 
the area into which you wish the dart to 
land. Once you have the point in the 
vicinity of your chosen number, you 
press the space bar and watch the dart 
flying through the air. 

If you have ever tried to chuck a 
few arrows standing in a crowded bar, 
then this simulation of hand-to-eye co- 
ordination is not far off the mark. The 
darts, on the other hand, often are. The 
PCW is also lumbered with the inebri- 
ated pointer and appears to lack the 
native intelligence which tells anyone 
else to go for the treble twenty. 

As for the games themselves, 501 
is the classic game in which you attempt 
to go from 501 to and throw a double 
to get out. Cricket has one player to bat; 
this means that he or she throws for the 
highest score possible, but does not hit 
trebles or bulls (that means a run-out). 
The next player then bowls - they have 
to hit the outer bull (one wicket) or the 
inner (two wickets). Once ten players 
are out the roles reverse and the next 
and final innings is played. 

Tour board means going around the 
board from 1 to 20, outer bull, inner bull 
in order. The different levels of diffi- 
culty mean that when playing Poor you 
are able to hit any part of the number, 
while playing Good means that only 
trebles are allowed. 

It's all jolly good stuff and much 
more enjoyable than standing in a 
smoky bar with a bunch of drunks 
bearing small metal weapons. • 



In a nutshell 

Five games in one is excellent. 
Darts is quick, slick and ingenious. 
Backgammon is only for beginners 
and lacks excitement. Might intro- 
duce dominoes as an Olympic 
event. The word-search is fun hut 
hard on the eyes. Card games lack 
zest and skill but are playable.

Following the release of LocoScript PC, Amstrad PCW users wishing to upgrade to a PC or compatible are asking 
Can I transfer my existing data from my PCW computer to my new PC compatible? 

THE ANSWER IS YES! 

TIMATIC SYSTEMS offer a unique kit which will allow you to connect a standard Amstrad FD4 second 720K disk drive to your PC 
or compatible and allow transfer of data from the full range of Amstrad CP/M - LocoScript machines. 

The simple to use kit allows you to connect the drive (as if it were a Standard external floppy disk) to most machines that have 
a normal PC type floppy controller and suitable cables. 

If your machine already has its full compliment of floppy disk drives, TIMATIC SYSTEMS can still help. We can provide a disk 
controller card that will enable connection of a further four floppy disks. The card is flexible enough to allow most types of drives 
to be connected, including high density 3 1/2 and 5 1/4, even on a standard PC. 
This includes such machines as the Amstrad 1 512/1 640/2086 and most true compatibles. 

Software is provided with all versions of the kit to allow AUTOMATIC DETECTION of which Amstrad disk format you are reading, 
making the kit very simple to use. The kit will allow you to READ and WRITE files from both CP/M and Locoscript. 

The versions of the kit available are:- 

FD4 board only - FD4 board and Cable kit - FD4 board, cable kit and controller card - FD4 cased drive, inc. cables etc. 

Formats supported by the software provided include:- Amstrad 464, 664, 6I28, PCW256, PCW85I2 and PCW95I2

Picture This ... 

Tony Hart continues his exploration of Mini Office Professional and 

shows you how you can arrange numerical data more 

attractively using the graphics module 



Mini Office _ 




ell, as the old adage says, 
"Every picture tells a story," If 
you can present information in 
graphic form - particularly stodgy 
numbers-based information that has the 
potential to become very boring indeed - 
the impact, visually at least, will be 
many times more than a mass of tabular 
data. Look, for example, at screen shots 
1 and 2 showing product sales. Both 
contain exactly the same information 
but one displays the information in 
tabular form, the other in graphic form. 
This graph is a line- graph. 

Another kind of graph is the bar- 
chart and screenshots 3 and 4 show how 
effective this can be when conveying Ihe 
trends of, say, a golf club membership 
over a number of years. The third 
popular form of graphic display is the 
pie-chart and you can see an example of 
this in screenshots 5 and 6 where the 
breakdown of Japanese computer tech- 
nology is being illustrated. 

These examples demonstrate the 
enormous differences in the presentation 
of information and the ease with which 
the graphic interpretation is accepted by 
the human eye and brain. 

Painting by numbers 

Your PCW can become an invaluable 
tool when it comes to quickly translating 
boring, tabular data into interesting, 
easy-to-assimilate graphics. Numerous 
graphics "packages' are available for the 
PCW at very reasonable prices. 

Mini-Office Professional is one of 
these packages. This article will use 
Mini-Office to show just how easy it is 
to generate graphics on the PCW from a 
tabular collection of numbers - like 
those created in the program's spread- 
sheet module. 

Graphs, whether they are line- 
graphs, bar-charts or pie-charts can be 
created from two sources in Mini- 
Office. One is by a direct input of 
numerical data, the other by transferring 
the contents of the Mini-Office spread- 
sheet into the graphics module. We are 
going to use the latter spreadsheet-to- 
graphics method taking, as an example, 
the "Product Sales'* example shown in 
our fin two screenshots. 

Getting started 

We'll start from the assumption that 
Mini-Office is up and running and that 



the "Product Sales" spreadsheet 
example, as shown in screen shot I 
below, is loaded. The steps to convert 
the potentially deadly' table of spread- 
sheet numbers to a picturesque graph are 
as follows: 

• Create a graphic 'windows' from the 
spreadsheet data 

• Move the window from the 
spreadsheet module to the graphics 
module by exiting from the former 
and loading the latter. The file that 
you have just been working on will 
have been saved with a .GRA suffix. 

• Load the graphics windows and 
display as a line graph, 

• Enhance the display with distinctive 
text. 

• Save the final display for future use. 

1, How to create the windows 

The window required will include the 
titles and values of the columns and 
rows of the spreadsheet. In the Product 
Sales example in screenshot 1 , the titles 
will be the product codes RED. 
WHITE and BLUE, and the month of 
sale - January to December. The values 
will be the actual sales made in each 
month for each product. The window 
must not contain unnecessary text like 
the spreadsheet title or totals. To create 
the window follow these steps; 

a) Cursor to cell AS, Product. 

b) Select Window I by pressing [PAGE] 

c) [SHIFT|/lf8j to select Row 
selection 

d) [RETURNj to include row 5 in the 
window 

e) Cursor to row 7, | RETURN! 

f) Do step (e) for rows 8 to I S 

g) [SHIFT]/[ E8 J again to complete the 
row selection 

Now to select the columns to be placed 

in the window: 

h) [SHlFT]/[f6] to begin column 

selection 

[RETURN] to include column A 

Cursor to column B, [RETURN] to 

include column B 

Do step (j) to for columns B.C and 

D 

|SHlFT]/[f6] to complete column 

selection 
The window has now been created and 
you should be able to Hip between the 
window and the full spreadsheet by 
pressing [SHIFT|/[DOC| and [PAGE] 
alternately. . — r--^

[laving created the required window 
from Ihe spreadsheet we now need to 
transfer the window from the spread- 
sheet module into ihe graphics module 
so lhat ihe sets of data can be selected 
and displayed as an impressive graph: 
a) Select Window I then [EXIT]

d) Select Graphics Window then 
choose Window I by pressing 
[ENTER] until 1 is displayed. 

e) Select Data sets are then choose 
Columns by use of the [ENTER] 
key. There is a choice of Columns 
or Rows. 

f) Seleci Continue. [ENTER], 
and the window will now be 
transferred into the graphics module 
where a Graphics Data screen 
will be displayed. (See scree n.shot 
7). 

The cursor will be on the first of the 
data sets i.e. RED and the values of the 
sales relating lo RED will be displayed

This tabular data isn't easy to interpret particularly because it represents a 
change from one period to another, ihe range of values is also very wide 




The pie-chart of the same info displays only ihe 1995 expected figures and the 
major sectors are made clear. Pie-charts are ideal for show ing parts of a \\ hole 




The Graphics data screen (of the gold club membership figures) displays the 
charade ristics of ihe data sets (left) and their actual values (right) 



in Ihe vertical columns on the right of 
the screen. The data sets to be 
displayed as graphs (in this example, all 
the sets, i.e RED, WHITE and BLUE) 
are now to be selected as follows: 
h) With the cursor on RED press 

[ENTER] 
I) Cursor to WHITE. [ENTER], 

and repeat for BLUE 
Each time [ENTER] is pressed, an S 
will be displayed against that data-set to 
indicate that it has been selected for 
display, 
j) Finally press [S] to start [he Save 

routine. 
A file-screen will now be displayed and 
a default filename presented that is the 
same as the spreadsheet file-name but 
ending with ,GRA instead of ,SPR, 
k) Press [ENTER] to save the graphics 

window and the selected data-sets. 
Now lo return to the spreadsheet and 
save it along with the spreadsheet 
window that was created: 
1) [EXIT], Select Save data then 

[ENTER] and [ENTER] again after 

the file-name has been presented. 
m) [EXIT1 and [EX1T| again to return 

lo the Mini-Office main menu 

3. How to load the graphics 
module and display the graph 

Now that the spreadsheet window has 
been selected and transferred into the 
graphics module, the real benefit of an 
"integrated" package like Mini-Office 
can be gained. Without this integration, 
the alternative would be to type every 
number from a spreadsheet into a 
graphics package before it could be 
displayed. Displaying the Product Sales 
graph is very simple: 

a) Select Graphics, then [ENTER], 
to move into the graphics module 
menu. 

b) Select Load/Save, [ENTER], Load, 
[ENTER] 

Now a file-screen is shown from which 
the relevant graphics file to be displayed 
is to be selected. 

c) Select the graphics file that was 
saved in the last section at step (k), 
i.e.PRODUCTS.GRA, [ENTER], 
then [EXIT] back to the graphics 
module menu 

d) Select Line graph. [ENTER], and 
a graphics option screen will be 
displayed. (See sereenshot 8). 

e) Select OPT. [ENTER |. then Data 
Set, [ENTER] 

n Type 3, [ENTER] in response to 
the question about the number of 
data-sets. (We're using data-sets 
RED. WHITE and BLUE). 

g) Enter 1 . 2 then 3 lo the requests for 
the primary, secondary and tertiary 
(third) data-sets. 

h) | EXIT] then [ENTER] for the graph 
showing Product sales for RED, 
WHITE and BLUE to be drawn on 
the screen, {See sereenshot 2). 

4 How to enhance the 
graphics display 

Once Mini-Office has drawn the basic 
graph on the screen from the data-sets 



now in the graphics module, we can now 
enhance this screen by adding various 
kinds of text to complement the data on 
the screen. 

All the extra text shown on screen- 
shots 2, 4 and 6 has been created using 
the text-option. To create the Product 
Sales - 1989 headline do the follow ing:- 

a) Select the TEXT icon on the right of 
the screen and [ENTER] 

b) Select SIZE, then press [ENTER] 
until the size of text you require is 
shown, 

c) Move the cursor down one and select 
BOLD by using the (ENTER] key. 

d) Move the cursor down to Border 
and select the inverted border again 
by using the [ENTER] key. 

e) Cursor back to TEXT. [ENTER] 
then type in the required text i.e. 
Product Sales - 1989 into the field 
at the bottom of the screen. Press 
[ENTER]. 

A rectangular box will now appear in the 
top, left-hand comer of the screen. By 
using the cursor arrow keys you can now 
position ihe box anywhere on the screen. 

f) Press [ENTER] to place text where 
the box is finally positioned. 

This same process can be repeated for all 
the other text fields. Variations in the 
size, brightness and border are easily 
made using the options on the text 
screen. 

5. Saving the enhanced display 

Lip to now we have two files saved on 
the disc. One is the spreadsheet file with 
its new window (PRODUCTS.SPR), 
the other is the graphics file with the 
three data-sets (PRODUCTS.GRA). In 
order not to have to repeat this enhance- 
ment process unnecessarily, we can now 
save this enhanced file within the 
graphics module. The file is saved as a 
"picture" rather than as a number of 
data-sets. Save it as follows: 

a) [EXIT] from the Text creation 
screen. 

b) Select OPT then [ ENTER] for the 
options screen. 

c) Select the 'Save to floppy' icon, i.e. 
the icon showing a floppy with an 
arrow pointing TOWARDS it! 

d) Now enter a file-name e.g. PROD 
UCTS.ZZZ. then [ENTER], 

e) The enhanced screen will now be 
saved to the disc. 

f) [EXIT] three times back to the Mini- 
Office menu. 

Note that this enhanced file is brought 
back and re-drawn by going into the 
graphics module, loading the graphics 
file with the three data- sets that were 
saved from the spreadsheet window, i.e. 
file PRODUCTS.GR A then loading the 
enhanced screen, PRODI: CTS.ZZZ 
with the "load from floppy" icon. 

On display 

The easiest way of reproducing PCW 
graphics is 'dumping' the screen to the 
printer (just press [EXTRA]/[PTR]>. 
This printout can then be included in a 
report, pinned on a notice board or 
reduced using an office copier and 
"pasted" between text paragraphs. •

Creating a Workstation 

Unpack it, unwrap it and look what you've got! We piece together the PCW package 



V 

M or many readers of 8000 Plus, buying their PCW 
I > represents their first ever computer purchase. And 
^L >f you've never done it before, it can be very 
daunting to arrive home, open the box and survey each of 
those tightly-packed components which are waiting for 
you to arrange them into some semblance of order. 

Yet, as we hope this photographic guide shows, it 
doesn't have to be all that difficult. A brief look should be 
enough to show even the most hesitant newcomer exactly 
how A connects to H. We've also included a few optional 
extras to show the beginner how he or she can straight 
away make their working area as comfortable and as 
productive as possible. 



The printer 




This is the doi matrix printer that tomes packaged with the PCW 8256 and 
8512. This primer is set up to print on 1 1 inch continuous stationery; ihe trac- 
tor feeder (supplied with the machine) ensures that the paper doesn't slide in 
any way as it is fed through. Using continuous paper means removing the 
pape r tray extension (which folds down over the top of the printer when it isn 
in use) and feeding in the paper from the back. 

To avoid possible obstructions and fouling, we've set up a simple two- 
level letters tray. This means that instead of the printed section falling onto ihe 
incoming stack, treating a confusing tangle, each part oetupies its own tray, 
Ihe latter occupying the one underneath. Try not to tear continuous stationery 
while the printer is in mid-flow; it can lead lo smudged letters, 

The printer has two cables with which to connect it to the back of the 
monitor. First, insert the connector on the end of the flat ribbon cable into the 
narrow 34-way socket: then insert the plug into the power out socket. Both 
sockets are easily located on the back of Ihe machine 

External disc drives 

Why not make your PCW a more approachable, not to men lion, versatile, 
machine by adding an extra external drive like ihe 5.25 inch drive shown 
here? Follow our simple, step by step walkthrough showing you how to do 
just that on pages 10 and II of our May issue. It could just as easily be a 3.5 
inch drive, though (find out how in issue 4 1 ). 95 1 2 owners, meanwhile. 
should read last month's special 95 1 2 Surgery feature. 

Mouse and mat 

Try and use a mouse - instead of the keyboard - whenever possible. Not only 
does it make the creative process when using DTP programs much easier and 
intuitive, it will also protect your keyboard from any unnecessary bashing. 
Pictured here is ihe Kempston Mouse which comes wiih its own interface for 
ft9,95. Mouse mats, indispensable items of comfort for both you and your 
rodent, arc available through most hardware suppliers for about a fiver. 

Books 

The books featured on this page represent Ihe best in PCW learning. They have 
all been written with one purpose in mind: to help you gel the best out of your 
machine, whether you are programming in Mallard BASIC {Mallard BASIC. 
Introduction and Reference from Locomotive Software), learning to use the 
PCW's native word processor, LocoScripi I (Easily into LocnScript by Susan 
Rogers) or trying ihe alternative word processor. Pretext (Rob Ainsley's 
Protexl. A PCW User's Guide). Respeclive prices and publishing houses can be 
found in the April issue. The blue book on the chair is the User Guide supplied 
with ihe machine. 



The keyboard 



You hear a loi, ihese days, aboul tenosynovitis (more easily refened to as repetitive strain injury) a common 
affliction of VDU operators. To minimalise the risk of such occupational hazards, be sensible aboul the posi- 
tioning of your keyboard in relation to where you will be silting. Don't succumb lo the temptation of resting 
your wrists on that pan of the keyboard below the spacebar while you type. Make sure that your hands hover 
over the keyboard at all limes - not claw-like however. Your lower arm - from the inner elbow to the middle 
linger knuckles - should always be kept at right angles to your upper arm. 

The keyboard is connected to the monitor by means of ihe 4-pin DIN plug at the end of its cable; this 
clips imo the socket on the right hand side of ihe monitor. 



34 MyWMWftl'S 




The monitor 

The Central Processing Unit, or monitor, is the most important element of the 
three that form your PCW system, it is in here that all the hard wott of 
creating, saving and retrieving is carried oul. 

The monitor is switched on and off by means of the pushbutton power 
switch on the front, bottom left hand comer, When switched on. the screen 
itself becomes bright green. Leaving it switched on, without inserting a disc 
into its drive, will elicit after a few minutes, a quite shrill three-beeped signal 
to tell you that you've forgotten something. Simply insert the appropriate side 
of one of the supplied discs and press the space-bar. The program will load 



after first displaying a screenful of green and black horizontal stripes. 

The brightness knob is located underneath the monitor at the bottom, 
right hand corner- under where it says Brightness, funnily enough. This 
allows you to alter the contrast on screen to a personally acceptable level to 
avoid eyestrain. Use it to fade the screen completely when the PCW is 
swiiched on but unused for any length of time: this will prevent "image 
bum". This is a condition where, after leaving your machine on for long 
periods of time, the words on the screen seem to leave an impression on the 
glass. The monitor should be positioned about IS inches from your eyes. 




The disc drives 

Depending on whether you have bought a PCW 8256 or 8512, you will have 
cither one single density 3 inch disc drive positioned to the right of I he screen 
- or two of them. The machine pictured here is an 85 1 2. 

Insert a disc into Ihe drive by holding it at its labelled end and pushing 
it gently in until it clicks home. You will then hear the drive whirring gently 
as the small red light underneath it to the right begins to flicker intermittently 
on and off. This means thai the machine is reading what is on the disc. The 
larger the file it has to load, the longer this will take. 



The modem 

The modem is an essential pre- 
requisite for the dedicated comms 
enthusiast. Its role is lo act as an 
intermediary beiween your PCW 
and the data that is either being 
sent or received down the 'phone- 
line. In other words, it's an inter- 
preter. Modems can be very 
expensive, some costing up to 
nearly twice as much as you paid 
for your PCW; it pays, therefore, 
lo make your purchasing decision 
carefully, Don't be seduced by all 
of the bells and whistles that you 
see; not all of them will be of use 
to you. Become a discerning 
modem buyer and read our Which 
modem? feature in last year's 
August issue. Pictured here is the 
AmstradSM2400. 



Discs and 
disc boxes 

The PCW comes with two 3 inch 
double-sided, floppy discs. On 
these are CP/M, LocoScripl 1 , 
Mallard BASIC and DR Logo. 
First of all make back-ups of these 
master discs and put them away 
somewhere safe. It is usually a 
good idea to keep your working 
discs somewhere safe - like the 
disc box shown here. While it 
won't necessarily prevent them 
from being pinched or bumi in a 
fire, it will perfotm a very valu- 
able service in protecting them 
from more everyday enemies, like 
dust, the "phone and, that old 
favourite, coffee spillage. 

Don't play around with your 
floppy discs, like pulling back the 
shutter to reveal the delicate disc 
surface, and keep them well away 
from magnetic fields, like loud- 
speakers and telephones. Above 
all, make regular back-ups of discs 
holding important information. 



To withdraw a disc from the drive, simply press the eject switch, the black 
rectangular button, lo the right of the drive opening. Never do this, however, 
while you can still hear the drive whirring and see the light flashing. This 
could damage both the disc and the head thai is reading it. 

Similarly, always empty the drives of their discs before switching the 
monitor off or rebooting it. While you will, from time to lime, see many a 
blase user doing jusl that, it's not recommended practice. The power surge 
could corrupt your data.

Speakeasy 



Not today, thank you 

Process versus purpose: Dr James Willis reports on the rather uneasy relationship that 
exists between the computer enthusiast and the end user 



In the early days of motoring, if somebody 
called himself a 'motorist' it would be taken 
as a more or less complete description of the 
man. You'd know exactly what to buy him for 
Christmas, for example. Today, just the same son 
of person might call himself 'a computer enthu- 
siast'. The very same chap who would have had 
a bad back, a rocky marriage and black finger- 
nails a generation ago, has a bad back, a rocky 
marriage and black rings round his eyes today. 
Where once he spent his life under his car, he 
now struggles endlessly with neurone-knotting 
problems of the kind only computer enthusiasts 
know exist. Tm just going upstairs to the 
computer for a few minutes, and I may be quite 
sometime ...' 

Unfortunately, what the enthusiast wants 
from computers is quite different from what the 
ordinary computer user wants. The enthusiast is 
interested in process, the user in purpose. The 
latter doesn't give a damn how the thing works, 
so long as it does the job. And while the enthu- 
siast wants development, novelty and change, 
the user desperately wants and needs stability. 
That is why it is so significant that it's the enthu- 
siast who currently calls the tune. 

Change for change's sake? 

There seems to be a circus of manufacturers, 
programmers, journalists and enthusiasts whose 
vested interest is bound up with continual 
change. They follow the latest developments and 
ideas as avidly as the motorist of twenty-five 
years ago followed double wishbones and toggle 
switches. And they have as much contempt for 
those who do not follow the scene as any other 
fashion buff. But as they whoop off down the 
road of change enveloped in razzmatazz the 
bemused user is left behind on the roadside care- 
fully blowing the dust out of his trusty keyboard. 

You would never guess from the computer 
shelves in a bookshop that the most widely used 
word processor in this county is the Amstrad 
PCW. This is, par excellence, a user's machine. 
Almost as soon as it appeared, large numbers of 
people whose interest was words recognised that 
at last they had a useful tool at a price they could 
afford. Amstrad PCWs have been selling like hot 
cakes all over the world ever since. A great deal 
of the credit for this goes to Locomotive 
Software for the accessibility and deceptive 
simplicity of the word processor program which 
comes with the machine; LocoScript. 

It is a program that 76-year-old grand- 
mothers can learn to use. It can be enhanced to 
perform arithmetic in documents, to personalise 
letters for lists of people, and now to store infor- 
mation in a database of the most modem, conve- 




PCW-tmningCP James Willis: "the FC version of 
LocoScript is the Iws thing thai could lave happened for ilu? 
PCW because it ensures thai people's investment in exper- 
tise and accumulated data will be transferable to IBM PC 
should they ever wish in make ilie move in the future " 

nient and flexible kind. And to equip LocoScript 
to do all this costs a total of £84.80, not the 
hundreds of pounds charged for a typical IBM PC 
program. Similarly, accounts, payroll, graphics, 
spreadsheet and DTP programs for the PCW all 
cost well under a hundred pounds. And they all 
produce amazingly good results on the PCW's 
standard printer which is included (of course) in 
the original price. 

Monitoring the temperature 

This is a machine which will do a great many 
very useful things for people who take the trouble 
to leam its ways. It will take them years to 
exploit anywhere near its full potential. All that 
time they will be building their investment, not 
just in programs they bought, not just in their 
energy spent learning to use them, but also in the 
way they have organised their lives. 

Their computers will impinge on their lives 
like pen and paper. Accounting records, 
summaries of plants in the garden, copies of 
correspondence - the list is endless. So the more 
commonplace the use of computers in our lives, 
the more dependent we become upon them. And 
the less we are able to accommodate the change 
which is part and parcel of the enthusiast's life. 

Remember the decimalisation board? How 
long was it they thought it would take us to adapt 
to centigrade temperatures? I remember the plan 
- two years with the radio announcers giving 
Fahrenheit followed by Centigrade, then two 



years the other way round, then drop the 
Fahrenheit altogether and bingo, we're all 
thinking in Centigrade! How far out could they 
have been? If that was a small step for a man. 
surely changing over to a new word processor 
would take him all the way to the moon! 

One last analogy: I'm suggesting a solution 
to this problem. Take the RISC chip; the story 
here is that microcircuits became too sophisti- 
cated for their own good. The designers were 
just going on and on, adding every new bright 
idea in an attempt to keep ahead of the competi- 
tion. As a result, the chips were so bulging with 
clever features that the complexity got in the 
way. So some bright spark came up with the 
idea of making it simple again. And the 
Reduced Instruction Set Computer was the 
result. RISC. A no-frills, back to nature affair, 
stripped out for action, which worked very well. 

RISCy business 

What we need is a set of computer standards 
designed to be used for a purpose, not to be used 
as an end in itself. The principal characteristic of 
the RISC system should be stability to allow 
people to grow into the use of these novel tools 
without their investment constantly being under- 
mined by change (which isn't necessarily the 
same thing as progress). And although the 
vested interest of the computer circus lies in 
change, we need recognition that the vested 
interest of society as a whole requires a lot of 
stability as well. 

The Amstrad PCW is far more appropriate 
as the Model T Ford of the computer age than is 
the IBM PC, because it is primarily a user's 
machine. With 600,000 users in Britain alone, 
its future appears secure, but I remember them 
saying that the Commodore PET was the 
machine to get if you didn't want to be left high 
and dry. And I believed them. 

A number of medical writers I know have 
been persuaded by computer enthusiasts that 
their PCWs are old-fashioned and that they 
should change to the IBM PC. Only to find the 
new machine more expensive, bulkier, totally 
unfamiliar and generally less satisfactory. You 
don't really appreciate the flexibility of a dot 
matrix printer until you buy a daisy wheel and 
find that you can't print graphs or the mini-print 
for your Filofax telephone number list. 

But then the enthusiasts don't know about 
the PCW anymore, do they? They haven't got 
the time to find out. They are off somewhere 
down the road and round the comer, enjoying 
that colour, loving those 3D graphics, thrilling 
to that sound. Hardly able to wait until next 
week when the new model comes out with 
double wishbones and toggle switches. •

FLIPPER 2 

and expanded 

memory: 

now you can 

have your cake 

and eat it. 



\ 



FLIPPER 2 was quite an 
unusual program. It could split 
your PCW's memory in two, let- 
ting you run LocoScript 2 in one 
half and a CP/M program in the 
other. Or it could let you load 
two CP/M programs at once, 
one in each half. It could even 
tackle tricky programs like Mini 
Office and LocoFile. Best of all it 
could FLIP you from one half to 
the other in as little as two sec- 
onds, any time you wanted. And 
it wouldn't lose your place. 

Things have changed since we 
launched FLIPPER 2. Now 
you can buy an SCA or Isenstein 
Ram add-on and double your 
PCW's memory size at a stroke. 
That's why we've brought out 
FLIPPER 2 PLUS. This still 
gives you all FLIPPER 2's 



memory-splitting power, but it 
can handle extra memory as 
well. This means that, with an 
SCA or Isenstein 51 2K add-on 
fitted, FLIPPER 2 PLUS 
can cram two (very nearly) 
full-size 8512s or 9512s into 
one machine. You'll be able to 
load all your LocoScript 2 add- 
ons and dictionaries on one 
side of the machine, and still 
have room for a hefty CP/M 
set-up on the other. With 
power like that on offer, why 
compromise? 



Please send me FLIPPER 2 PLUS for my: 

□ 8512 L! 951 2 □ Expanded 8256 
□ I enclose a cheque/postal order for £29.95 
L I enclose my FLIPPER/FLIPPER 2 masterdisk and a

Sophie Lankenau journeys to Truro to visit the source of inspiration for 
thousands of aspiring writers and finds two PCWs busy earning their keep 



The Write 
Lines 

More people than you think 
are wiling for a hobby. Gill 
was invited for an interview 
on Radio Cornwall's 
'Cornwall Daily' programme, 
where listeners were invited 
to phone in with questions 
about becoming a writer. The 
switchboard was husj for 
.dun »i an hour. 



V 

» oms de Plume is a company run 
■ by four clever women. The 
X i work of Gill, Anne, Joyce and 
Alice ensures that hundreds of aspiring 
writers can have easy access to a course 
which promises to improve their 
creative technique. Joyce and Alice are 
responsible for the production of all the 
course's written material - no small feat 
when you consider that they are both 
under five years of age. It all sounds 
pretty astounding until you discover that 
Joyce and Alice are, in fact, the two 
PCW 8256s used relentlessly by Noms 
de Plume since the inception of the 
business in 1988. 

Gill Kingsland created Noms de 
Plume in response to the extra curricular 
interest which her creative writing 
evening classes were generating. 
"People were phoning me between 
sessions, asking for advice and for 
written information about publishers 
and so on. In the end, a sort of club 
evolved; it gradually expanded into 
Noms de Plume," she told us. "There 
are many people who feel that they 
want to write, but are hindered by lack 
of time and resources. What we provide 
is a course consisting of a cassette and 
written study sheets, which people can 
digest at their leisure in the comfort of 
their own homes." 

Bridging the gap 

Having a PCW alleviates some of the 
more complicated aspects of running a 
business, particularly since Gill's 
partner, Anne Ac aster, lives 350 miles 
away, "Exchanging information over 
that distance would be both inefficient 
and frustrating if we weren't able to just 
pop a disc into an envelope and send it 
off' explained Gill. "Also, the cost 
would be phenomenal - the paper 
equivalent of what a disc can hold 
would be very expensive to send by 
post!" she added. 

The team of PCWs are used in 
every aspect of the business, from 
producing letters and course work to 
managing the accounts. The business 
(and home) accounts are dealt with by 



Gill using SuperCalc 2. LocoScript 2 
looks after the bulk of the other busi- 
ness. It is used in conjunction with 
LocoMail to produce a list of some 500 
names and addresses for any mail-outs 
which need to be done. Ever)' student is 
allocated a file in LocoScript 2 in which 
are stored details of their progress, and 
appraisals of the written assignments 
which they submit. On completion of 
the course, they receive a print-out of 
their file. 

"Without the PCW, we simply 
couldn't run the business" explained 
Gill. "Because LocoScript 2 is so 
simple and so capable, we can do every- 
thing which is required with no fuss and 
the minimum of effort. We treat our 
machines almost like humans - they are 
invaluable" she added. 

So why did Noms de Plume adopt 
the PCW in the first place? "I had done 
a BTEC in wordprocessing at Falmouth 
college" Gill explained,"so at least I had 
some idea of what 1 wanted out of a 
system. The initial thing about the PCW 
was that it was a well-priced package 
which 1 could afford. Also, LocoScript 
was very easy to learn, and offered the 
kind of editing facilities which I saw as 
important I'm glad that LocoSpell is 
around - my own spelling is best 
described as imaginative! I also like the 
idea of having so much screen space to 
work on, with all the menu commands 
clearly on show - some packages have 
you working in a tiny box somewhere!" 
she continued. 

Was there anything which Gill 
didn't like about the machine? "I just 
wish that they had let me write the 
manual." she laughed. "It could have 
been written in Cantonese for that all I 
could understand of it!" 

By accident and design 

Partner Anne Acaster is also an ardent 
fan of the machine. "My husband 
persuaded me to buy the PCW in the 
first place, because he knew that it was 
the kind of machine I could get to know- 
without yielding to the temptation of 
throwing it out of the window! At first, 



• *• 




Noms de Plume partner Gill Kingsland: "To be a writer yoy have to be 
arrogant, to believe totally in yourself and your ability." 



1 suppose I just saw the PCW as a flash 
typewriter - but then my husband Tony 
(who is a CAD supervisor for an 
avionics firm), showed me the other 
things which it is capable of." 

It was tinkering with Masterscan, a 
scanner which attaches to the primer 
head, which first gave Tony the idea of 
producing a sleeve for the course 
cassettes which students work from (see 
picture). "The capabilities of 
Masterscan together with the tools 
which MicroDesign offers means that 
we can experiment endlessly with 
design - from these sleeves, to letter 
headings and stationery" added Gill. 

Anne shares her business partner's 
enthusiasm for LocoSpell. "The 
spellchecker is vital, given the nature of 
the business. A casual bungle now and 
then just isn't permissible when it is so 
important to convey confidence and 
literacy at all times. My spelling is, in 
fact, pretty abysmal, so everything I put 
on the screen - be it a three line memo 
or a 2000 word evaluation of someone's 
course work - 1 run through the checker 
automatically."

Articles of 
Faith 

(31 Kin&land and Anne 
Acaster art welt qualified (a

'Tliedat I tind a market and

Ironi behind my pseudonym!" 
said Anne. 



It is not a matter or lucky coincidence 
that both Anne and Gill find ihe PCW 
and LocoScript so easy to use, "When 
we decided to set the business up," 
explained Anne, "we had already 
bought our PCWs independently, 
without one or the other's recommenda- 
tion. Therefore, we had none of the 
obstacles which many small businesses 
encounter, such as having to get to grips 
with new technology before we could 
even think of progressing." she told us. 

Travelling light 

Since the business is divided between 
Kent and Cornwall, Gill is often travel- 
ting from one county to the other for 
meetings with her partner. "1 just wish 
that 1 could take Joyce (my PCW) with 
me - I waste so much time on trains. 
Once you have gained the ability to 
Ihink into a machine rather than use a 
pen and paper for your writing, it is 
difficult to revert back - I find my 
fingers itching for the keyboard." Had 
Gill considered investing in one of the 
portables currently on the market? "1 
have been looking at the Atari 
Portfolio" she replied, "but 1 haven't 
come to any decisions yet. 
Unfortunately, money is always a 
limiting factor in situations like these". 

At the moment, the Noms de 
Plume courses consist of tape-recorded 
tutorials. Gill and Anne's plans for the 
future include presenting the informa- 




tion in disc form as well. 
"More and more 'part- 
time' writers have word- 
processors, so putting the 
course on disc is a logical 
step. We will still have 
the cassettes though, 
because we have blind 
and partially sighted 
people amongst our 
students." 



Prosed for success 

Gill is unequivocal about 
the role of the PCW for a 
writer, whether aspiring 
or established. She 
frequently has to deal 
with people who lack 
confidence in what they 
produce, and think that 
their efforts are worth- 
less. "People are so afraid 
of the blank page - and 
they are limited when 
typing or handwriting their work, 
because the prospect of editing involves 
such a laborious process. The PCW is 
fantastic in that respect. For me. it has 
improved my writing - 1 no longer 
worry about making grammatical 
mistakes or spelling errors. With the 
PCW. I can let my inspiration take over, 
put down all my ideas and then go back 
and evaluate the piece later on." 

Gill does warn, however, about the 







MATTER OF COURS3 



Noms de Plume have three courses. The 
Foundation course can be completed in six 
weeks, the Intermediate link takes three to 
four weeks, and the Advanced section takes a 
further six weeks. This all depends upon 
whether students apply themselves regularly 
to the work. "The thing about our courses is 
thai Ihey can be 'interactive' or 'non-interac- 
tive' explained Gill. "That is simply the di (Ter- 
ence between sending in written assignments 
fur marking, or just using the assignments for 
your own practice. An interactive course is 
more helpful for gauging your progress 
though," she added. 

The Foundation course and the Advanced 
course cost £45 each, and the Intermediate 
course (non-interactive) is £20, If you buy all 
three together, you save £20. Tapes comprise 
lectures and exercises, and are backed up with 
written notes. There is a series of 'How to' 
courses, dealing with individual topics in depth, 
such as the writing of short stories, romance, 
n on -fiction and advertisement copy. These are 
£15 (non-interactive) or £25 (interactive). 

(till finds that offering a tutorial in cassette 
form makes for a more structured learning 
process. "People tend to take notes as the tape 
plays through, treating it rather like a class- 
room situation. Luckily, our teaching methods 
involve a certain amount of humour, so Ihey 
bear no resemblance to being at school!" 

Spreading the word 

Students can join at any time of the year - there 
are no 'terms' at Noms de Plume, simply 
because the work is done by people in their own 



homes, 'I am hoping that we will be able to set 
up a series of area lectures, so that our students 
can get together. I do run lectures in this area on 
Saturdays at the moment, and for those who 
cannot attend, the lectures are available on tape 
at a cost of £15 each" explained Gill. Most of 
the original enquiries about Noms de Plume's 
courses come from women. However, Gill told us 
that the majority of those who then buy and 
complete the courses are men. "The trouble with 
writing is that it has a sort of stigma attached to 
it - unlike most other hobbies. I suspect that for 
an awful lot of women who are at home, reliant 
upon their husbands' incomes, taking a chunk 
out of Ihe household budget for their hobby is 
something which they are wary of doing." 

However, it was a female Noms de 
Plume student who recently won a competition 
for writing about the most unusual romantic 
meeting. Her success not only earned her a 
weekend in Paris, but also a regular reporter's 
job on a regional newspaper. "And she is the 
proud owner or a PCW8256:" added Gill. 

Noms de Plume run their own annual 
competition for Creative Writing. Entry forms 
are currently available for IWO's three category 
contest. Competitors are invited to write either 
an historical romance of not more than 5000 
words, a three minute story for a radio 
broadcast, or a 600 word newspaper article. 
Judges include author E.V Thompson, Tim 
Hubbard of Radio Cornwall and Max Hodnett, 
Editor of the West Briton. Submissions must 
be accompanied by the official entry form, 
which can be obtained by writing to the address 
shown in the margin overleaf. 



The Nomsde Plume study pack, Courses can be interactive' or 

nan -interactive'; this is simply the difference between having work 

marked, or just keeping it for your own reference 



dangers of assuming that using a word 
processor will suddenly make you into a 
writer. "It is rather like the courses 
which we run - we cannot guarantee 
that at the end, you will become *a 
writer.' All we can do is leach tech- 
nique, in a lively and humorous way, 
and offer to improve the quality of 
people's writing. 

In the same way, you cannot expect 
the PCW to make you into a writer - 
what it will do is to ease the practical 
obstacles which hold up the flow. I do 
disagree with those who maintain that 
word processing lakes the soul out of 
writing, that it encourages format 
writing or laziness. Basically, if you 
don't suffer from those faults in the first 
place, the PCW won't give them to you, 
and if you do have them, they won't 
suddenly be cured!" 



*- 4(jTJiily90flfflWM.£/S 



Do the write thing 

The question 'How can 1 become a 
writer?' is one which Gill encounters 
daily. "1 hear from a variety of people, 
who are either in the 'I'm brilliant, can 
you get my work published' school, or 
the 'Where do I start?' division. My 
answer is simple. You start by getting a 
pen and paper, or a blank screen in from 
of you. You then work at turning your 
hobby into a credible pursuit." 

Noms de Plume's courses are in 
demand abroad. An American agency 
has approached Gill to go to the States 
and back up promotion of the courses 
with a nationwide lecture tour. As soon 
as time and money permit, the offer will 
be taken up. In the meantime. Gill and 
Anne are concerned with encouraging 
more and more people to try the course 
and to discover the enjoyment of 
writing. And the secret for Gill? "To be 
a writer you have to be arrogant, to 
believe totally in yourself and your 
ability. Above all, though, you must 
have fun whilst you are writing. The 
final step is not so simple. You have to 
hope that one day, you will meet 
someone who appreciates your work- 
and Ihen it's all worth it!". •

Growing Pains 

Nick Vandome charts the progress of a writer's work, from the joy of 
birth through to adolescence, old age and even reincarnation 






T 

o most casual readers the 
average lifespan of a newspaper 
A or magazine article is about 
fifteen minutes - after which it is 
wrapped casually around a fish supper 
or deposited in the pile of reading 
matter next to the toilet that people flick 
through to take their minds off last 
night's curry. However, for the writers 
of these throw-away masterpieces - 
who are never casual, only slightly 
obsessed at limes - they represent 
living, breathing creatures that they 
have nurtured during their formative 
years and finally seen disappear onto an 
editor's desk. But as with all siblings, 
the journey from birth to adulthood is a 
torturous one that is fraught with worry.

The birth of any article comes in 
that ephemeral form of The Idea. 
Writers seem to have differing views 
about the ease with which ideas pop 
into their heads: some appear to have to 
fight them off every second of the day 
while others claim they sometimes go 
days or weeks, struggling to dream up 
one idea for a saleable article. In 
between these two extremes, and with a 
greater reliance on graft than inspira-

GREAT WORKS FROM LITTLE ACORNS GROW... 




Roving reporter, Nick Vandome; that's me! 






JUST over a year ago I was lying on a beach in 
northern Queensland, enjoying the near-perfect 
climate and watching the numerous tourist vessels 
sailing out to the Great Barrier Reef. In my sun 
induced stupor I wondered vaguely about what 
was being done to preserve the Reef from this 
ever increasing number of tourists. An idea for an 
article was born. 

I worked on this idea, studied the market 
of likely magazines and then sent my First 
query letter to GEO magazine, the Australian 
equivalent of National Geographic. I explained 
to the editor who 1 was and told him the outline 
of the idea, tourism and conservation on the 
Reef, and mentioned some of the people who 
I planned to interview. Much to my delight he 
wrote back and asked if 1 couid produce a 2001) 
word article for him, including some background 
history of the area. 

For my initial research I contacted the local MP who was very helpful and gave me access to 
his personal library of books and press clippings concerning the Reef. Next I interviewed Frazer 
Muir, a conservation officer with the Queensland Department of Environment and Conservation 
(QDEC). He gave me a long interview, all of which I noted down by hand. I then spoke to more 
officers of QDEC and was invited on one of their surveillance flights over the Reef. 

After I had written the article I showed it to Frazer who disagreed with some of the quotes I 
had attributed to him so it was back to the PCW for a re-write. This produced further problems 
and it was eventually third time lucky when we agreed that the text was satisfactory. 

My next problem was to get photographs, I needed someone with local knowledge and when 
1 mentioned this to Frazer he told me that one of the QDEC officers was a keen amateur photog- 
rapher and he had already had some credits in a similar magazine to GEO. He agreed to take the 
necessary pictures and said that he would negotiate payment directly with the magazine. 

Finally I spent a few hours in the local library educating myself about the history of the 
area and then sent off the article. It was accepted a fortnight later. After this I started at 
the beginning again and wrote a 'Day in the Life' piece featuring the work or the QDEC officers 
and also a natural history piece on the Crown of Thorns starfish thai pose a great ecological 
threat to the Reef. 

All in all not a bad result from a few hours sunbathing. 



L 42 July 90*000 PLUS 



working from there, or collecting 
everyday pieces of trivia and seeing 
what effect they have on my battered 
mind. These are the foundation stones. 

Germination 

The approach of dissecting a favourite 
topic is one of the best stand-bys. For 
instance, if you normally write about 
the inside of a ping-pong ball try and 
find a new slant: look at it from a histor- 
ical point-of-view (who invented it, 
when, why), a sporting one, a technical 
one (how it is made and is it environ- 
ment-friendly), a health and fitness one 
(The Ping- Pong Diet) and 101 other 
different variations. Stan with the 
obvious and then delve into more and 
more obscure corners. If you end up 
with one good idea then it will be worth 
going through this procedure. 

It is also worthwhile, occasionally, 
to try and find article ideas in subjects 
that you are not normally interested in. 
A few weeks ago, when things were 
going rather slowly up in the old grey 
matter I wrote down on a notepad a 
subject I had little knowledge of, the 
Royal Family. Nothing immediately 
sprang to mind. Later in the week I was 
wandering around town, still hoping for 
inspiration to accost me, when 1 saw a 
Royal coat of amis on a shop wall. A 
few enquiries informed me that the shop 
was a Royal Warrant Holder {providing 
goods and services to the Royal 
Household) and so an idea for my 
article on Royalty was born. 

A less reliable method of finding 
ideas is to pick up on all the trivia of the 
day and see what effect it has on your 
mind. In this respect you are working 24 
hours a day - reading snippets in news- 
papers, listening to conversations (not 
only the ones intended for you - over- 
heard conversations on buses and tubes 
are great sources for ideas), playing 
Trivial Pursuit and basically just 
keeping your mind ale n to what is 
going on around you. 

Ideas that are formed in this way 
are likely to strike at any time so always 
carry a notebook and write them down - 
even if it is the middle of the night. A 
word of warning though: it is always 
vital to leave these ideas to ferment for 
a few days to see if they really are as 
good as you originally think. 1 have 
frequently had Pulitzer Prize winning 



Writing 



ideas in Ihe pub on a Friday night, only 
to cringe at the very thought of them in 
the cold, sober, light of day. 

Conception 

Once you have your article idea the plan 
is to develop it into a living, breathing 
piece of prose. Unless you want to write 
the article first, and risk it being an 
unwanted orphan, the best way to 
iniliate this process is through a Query 
Letter. This is a letter to an editor telling 
them about the article. At this point it is 
ihe only card you hold so it has to be 
concise, informative and entertaining, 
leaving the editor enthusiastic about 
adopting your offspring. 

If you are unknown to a magazine 
begin your letter by telling them, briefly, 
a bit about your writing experience and 
then go on to outline your proposed 
article. Include information about 
subject matter, your approach to the 
topic, your personal expertise in that 
field, any people that you will interview, 
approximate length and the availability 
of illustrations and of what type. One 
other thing that is worth mentioning is 
why you think the readers of the maga- 
zine will be interested in the story. If 
nothing else this shows you have 
researched the market. 

Remember, your query letter is 
your sales pitch, the first chance for you 
to attract that all important attention. 
Editors receive hundreds of query 
letters, so work on yours unlil you think 
it is a good piece of writing. While a lot 
of nuts and bolts information is neces- 
sary don't be afraid to include your own 
opinions or a little humour. After all it is 
an example of your own writing style. 

Growing up 

Research is a word that strikes fear and 
loathing into many writers and 1 must 
admit that it is not my favourite part of 
the whole glorious writing process. 
However, it is really a much maligned 
pastime. True, a lot of it includes 
digging around in libraries, all too remi- 
niscent of your schooldays when those 
dreaded exams were looming. Don't be 
disheartened; when you compare this to 
silting behind an office desk for the rest 
of your life it immediately takes on a 
more glamorous appearance. 

Rather than looking at it as a chore 
it should be seen as an asset that 
improves your general knowledge while 
also providing ideas for additional arti- 
cles. When I get to the library I usually 
spend hours there for the simple reason 
that once I get my nose in a reference 
book I get sidetracked by all kinds of 
weird and wonderful pieces of informa- 
tion - all grist to the creative mill. 

But to say that research is all refer- 
ence books and encyclopaedias is like 
saying that politics is all honesty and 
generosity. In many ways it is similar to 
your idea generating in that it is some- 
thing that you should be aware of 
constantly. Be inquisitive and find out as 
much as possible about what is going on 
around you ;tnd in the world in general. 

For example, know who is winning 



TALKING IT OUT 



AS! UK from your own gulden prose the most i in pi in ant words in your article are those obtained 
from other people. In fact, without inlerviewing. your career as a non-fiction writer is likely to 
be extremely short. 

Interviews are carried out for two main reasons in relation to non-fiction: to gain specialist 
information and to pmduce an interesting quote for your article. The first of these is the 
more mundane or Ihe two hut undoubtedly Ihe men useful. As you write more and more 
articles and your range of subject matter expands you will need more people to explain the 
nitty-gritty of each subject. For instance if you are writing about the breeding habits of the 
Lesser Seen Toad it might be a good idea to talk to an expert on the subject instead of putting 
Forward your own wild theories. 

The second type of interview is where you want to get the comments of a person of interest, be 
it a celebrity or the man at the end of the road who says he saw his wife being taken a,way by a 
spaceship in the shape of the Big Itcn. I 

When approaching prospective interviewees write to them or phone, telling them why you 
want to interview them and what your article is going to be about. Stress that you will go to see 
them at a time they find suitable, not vice versa. 

Before you meet your interviewee find out as much as possible about them and prepare the 
questions and topics that you want to cover - you will gel a much better response if you show you 
have done some groundwork beforehand. 

As to the actual interview I prefer to use a dictaphone, if the interviewee is agreeable, since it 
removes any chances of misquoting. However, in view of unexpected gremlins, it is also a good idea 
to take additional notes by hand. While you are doing this also note down the subject's manner- 
isms and their surroundings as this may also be incorporated into the final article. 

Finally, make sure that you keep your own conversation to a minimum: you are there to hear 
someone else's quotes, not your own. 



what in the sporting world, what the top 
films and teenage crazes are of the 
moment, who the latest soap stars are, 
and keep up with current affairs both at 
home and abroad. While you might not 
be interested in all these subjects you 
will be surprised how often you can use 
the information in your writing. 

The cosmetics 

All parents like to send their children 
out looking their best and in the case of 
the writer this means getting illustra- 
tions for their masterpieces, either in the 
forni of colour transparencies or black 
and white prints. While a good illustra- 
tion will not sell a bad article editors are 
much more kindly disposed towards 
material that comes with its own 
photographs and. obviously, the best 
way to get them is to lake them yourself. 
As well as being personally and finan- 
cially rewarding it also ensures that you 
get a picture of exactly what you want in 
relation to your article. 

The first thing to do if you want to 
provide your own photographs is to buy 
a SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera. 
Forget all the models that offer auto- 
load, auto-wind and tea-making devices 
as these are all just additional things to 
go wrong and will do nothing to 
improve the quality of the picture. 
Instead go for a reasonable quality 
machine with auto and manual functions 
and preferably a depth of field preview. 
As for lenses, it is best to have a wide 
angle lens, 28mm, and also a zoom lens 
of some type, depending on the shots 
which you plan to take. For the majority 
of cases a 50- 1 35mm zoom will suffice. 
Choosing good quality film is also 
important - use Kodachrome film for 
colour transparencies and II ford for 
black and white prints. 

II' \ (m decide you don'l warn to. ot 
can't, take photographs yourself then 



you have a few options open to you. 
Vou could try a professional photogra- 
pher or a photograph library, both of 
which would probably produce results 
but which would be very expensive. A 
more realistic idea is to ask a friend who 
is a keen photographer or go along to a 
photography course or evening class and 
ask if anyone would be interested in 
taking your pictures for you. The 
chances are that you will gel an enthusi- 
astic response since the amateur photog- 
rapher is just as keen to see their work 
published a>- ihe amateur writer. V for 
payment you could either pay them a 
mutually agreeable sum or let them 
negotiate their own price with the news- 
paper or magazine. 

Adulthood 

It is always heart-wrenching when 
something you have cherished and loved 
leaves you. but for a writer this is 
usually offset by the joy of seeing it 
transformed into a published piece of 
literature. However, to cast it aside at 
this stage would be a considerable waste 
of time, effort and potential. Just think 
of all those related ideas you had when 
thinking up the article, the mountain of 
research notes, of which you may have 
only used a small proportion, and the 
boxes of unused photographs you now 
have. You will find yourself with a 
wealth of untapped resources, which can 
be stored in a cool compartment of your 
mind for next time. 

Instead of chiding your offspring 
for creating so much unwanted mess, 
adopt a more constructive attitude. Go 
back lo square one and work on another 
idea for the same topic. Search for new 
angles to develop your original idea and 
find more prospective markets, but most 
of all be a ruthless parent and get as 
much mileage as possible out of your 
tender creation. •

Comm and get it 

How would you like to have access to hundreds of free programs to 

run on your PCW? Fancy technical advice, on-tap, all day and 
everyday? Comms offers just this: Tim Smith goes baud walking 



Comms special 



Hundreds of free programs? 
Endless advice? You're 
ill inking that maybe we're 
overstating the case. If anything we're 
doing the opposite, Comms, which is 
short for communications, has the 
ability to open up vast new areas of 
action for you and your faithful PCW. 

Aside from the ability to 'down- 
load* Public Domain software and use 
help-lines, comms also allows you to 
access databases, make friends (they 
need never see the fact that you've not 
shaved or got out of your dressing 
gown!) and learn about your machine. 

The idea that comms is incredibly 
complex and requires technical skills 
should be thrown out of the window 
here and now. Think about it. Do you 
really need to have an in-depth knowl- 
edge of PAL (Phase Alternation Line) 
which is the 'television standard' for the 
UK, in order to watch Blind Date. Do 
you need any knowledge of it at all? 
Equally, how many people know how a 
telephone actually works when they use 
it to 'phone Great Aunt Gwendolen in 
Ulan Bator? 

Comms on the PCW can be as 
simple as word processing, databasing, 
spreadsheeting or any of the other 
programs which you could use. The 
only off-putting element to it is the 
notion that you are communicating with 
the outside world and that one wrong 
press of a key might crash a system. 
This will not happen; the chances of 
accidently logging-on to the NATO 
Intercontinental Missile Launching 
System and triggering off World War Hi 
are less than the chances of winning the 
pools three times running. 

Hackers, the less savoury end of 
the comms world, spend months of eye- 
aching boredom trying to get into the 
local branch of the Bag worth and 
Bamsley building society in order to 
fiddle a few pounds, so don't worry 
about accidents. The benefits far 
outweigh the possible problems. 

Comm hither 

So, what do you need to get started? 
Quite simple really. You will require the 
following four pieces of equipment; an 
RS232, otherwise known as a Serial 
interface to plug into the expansion port 
at the back of your PCW. A 'modem' to 



act as an interpreter between the PCW 
and the outside world. Thirdly, comms 
software. Finally, a serial cable {most 
decent modems will come with one of 
these bundled) to connect the modem to 
the interface. We'll go into the interface, 
modem and software in detail. 

The interface 

This piece of equipment is the single 
most useful addition you can buy for 
your PCW. Interfaces come in the form 
of boxes (about 5 by 4.5 inches - 1 3 by 
1 lcm) of circuit boards with two sockets 
- one for the serial line and one for the 
parallel. An interface fits onto the 
expansion card at the back of your PCW. 
This expansion card is to the left of 
the printer port on the 95 12 and be!ow 
the printer port on the 8000 series, 
interfaces for the PCW are of the RS232 
family. This is an information exchange 
standard and is common to most 
personal computers such as IBM PC 
compatibles, PCWs, the Amstrad CPC, 
Commodore Amiga and Atari ST, (the 
good old Mac of course uses the RS422. 
The command structures are the same, 
but the configuration of the pins in the 
cable heads differ). With comms you 
need an interface in order to connect 
your PCW, via a serial/ RS232c cable, to 
modem. Without it there would be 
nowhere to plug the cable. Simple. 

The modem 

The modem is the piece of equipment 
(hardware or peripheral in compuspeak) 
which translates the data (information) 
sent or received over telephone lines. 

Modems range in price (and 
complexity of functions) from around 
£100 to £1000. The more expensive 
come with facilities such as auto- 
answering, autodialling, number stores 
and the ability to accept many 'baud 
rates' and 'emulations' (see the next 
page for jargon explanation). 

The modem connects to your PCW 
via the serial/RS232c cable and inter- 
face. It then sits on your desk awaiting 
commands from you via the software. 
Most modems come with a range of 
LEDs which tell you that certain signal 
criteria are being met. The affordable 
modems (that is those which come in at 
under £250) basically just sit there, 
waiting to send - they have to be 



prompted to receive. 

The software 

This is an area of much debate in the 
rarified atmosphere of the comms 
'expert'. We, however, only need look at 
it as if it were any other program to run 
on the PCW. Its purpose is to control the 
modem and hence send and receive 
data. He, or she, will spend hours telling 
you that a comms program and modem 
are no good unless they have Viewdata 
Emulation, run at 2400 Baud in 
Asymetric Duplex mode with built-in 
error correction and Analog loop- back 
in just the same way as a hi-fi 'expert' 
will drone on about more woofer up 
your tweeter with cross-over and 
parallax, dual parametrics. Don't listen 
to them; while the latter misses the fact 
that a record player's purpose is to play 
music, the former misses the fact that 
all you want to do is get into contact 
with other people. 

Good comms software can cost 
nothing and be friendly to use (such as 
Mex in the Public Domain). It might 
lack many facilities and options but the 
basic job of telecommunicating will be 
done. Just look at Sage's Chit-Chat (£87 
+ VAT or the Sage Communications 
pack - modem, software and cable for 
£225 + VAT) or PMS Dialup (the 8000 
Plus office's choice of software which 
costs £89.99). It is more than likely that, 
for your first foray into comms, you will 
merely want to browse through the 
various bulletin boards which hold 
cheap software for the PCW. In this case 
you will want a minimum of frills and a 
maximum of efficiency. 

The most important point to look 
for is the fact that the software is 
compatible with your chosen modem, 
that it is capable of handling 1200 baud 
(this is the standard rate for most 
bulletin boards) and that you can under- 
stand the documentation. 

All together now 

Once you are kitted out with modem, 
cable, interface and software it's time to 
log-on. This is where the jargon really 
does step up its efforts to form a jungle 
of almost unrelieved impenetrability. On 
the next page, therefore, we are proud to 
present the definitive 8000 Plus 
English-Comms Dictionary.

comms. So, here are a few useful words and phrases translated: 



Serial 

(as in Serial Port, also RS232c) 

This deals with handling information in 
a series of small electronic packages. 
These are sent and received, one after 
the other, in order. The opposite to this 
is Parallel (as in Parallel Port, also 
Centronix) which deals with handling 
information in a single lump. It should 
be noted that Comms will always be 
carried out from the Serial (RS232) Port 
of the PCW. This means that small pack- 
ages of information (data) can be sent 
down the line. If there is any 'noise' 
(corruption on the line) then using Serial 
transfer ensures that only packets of data 
are corrupted rather than an entire file or 
message. With Error Correction, the 
corrupt parcels are retransmitted so that 
you. the user are not even aware that 
they ever existed. 

Baud Rate 

(pronounced bored or bawd, 
people disagree) 

Named after J M E Baudot (1845-1913) 
a French pioneer in telecommunications. 
Basically, Baud Rale measures the speed 
at which data is transmitted (for the 
more technical among you 1 baud is 
equivalent to I half-dot cycle in Morse 
code). Roughly speaking, in computer 
terms, I Baud is equal to one bit per 
second (BPS). You will find that your 
modem and software can transmit at 
various baud rates such as 75/1 2(XJ 
(which means that you send data at 75 
baud but receive at 1200 which is the 
standard Viewdata rate). Other Baud 



rates are 300, 1200, 1200/75, right up to 
2400. The only thing to bear in mind is 
that you should always synchronise 
your Baud rate settings to those of the 
computer you are in contact with. (For 
the more technical among you, when 
using binary the Baud does not just 
include sending raw data - there are 
also other elements which need to be 
sent - 1 baud is not usually exactly 
equivalent to I bit per second) 

Protocol 

(as in Kermit, XMODEM 
and ISO) 

As the name suggests, a Protocol is a set 
of rules which is understandable to 
computers when communicating data. 
The only thing you really need under- 
stand at this point is that your PCW 
should always operate within the same 
Protocol as the device with which it is 
in contact. 



Parity 

(also Parity Bit) 



Yet again another incredibly complex 
piece of compulerese which basically 
means checking whether or not the 
information sent has been corrupted or 
not. A Parity Bit has a value of I or 0. 
Parity can be set at Even. Odd or None. 
For example, if the setting is Even a 
Parity bit is added to every word sent in 
the following manner: if a chunk of 
information is in the binary form 
00101 1, then a Parity Bit of 1 is added 
to make it Even (00101 1 +1 = 
0+0+ 1 +0+1+1+ 1 = 4 positive bits = 



This, quite simply, is a bit sent at the 
end of a character bit, to tell the 
receiving device that the character has 
'stopped being sent'. 

Emulation 

(also Terminal Emulation) 

Again, as the name suggests, this is a 
method which allows your PCW to 
emulate other devices. Emulations such 
asTTY (code of Teletype) and 
Viewdata arc common. Emulation basi- 
cally means that different kinds of 
computer or device can 'pretend' to be a 
single other device and hence talk to 
each other. If this principle could be put 
into 'real' life, then an Englishman who 
spoke no Spanish could speak to a non- 
English speaking Spaniard by both of 
them pretending to speak Dutch (it's 
easy really). 

Download/Upload 

You can translate these roughly as 
'Take' and 'Give*. Once you have 
togged on to your first bulletin board 
service (BBS) you will want to get hold 
of some of the free Public Domain (PD) 
software which is available. These files 
are stored in an area on most BBSs 
which is defined for Downloading or 
Uploading, Basically, you will be given 
the option to Download files - take files 
'down* from the BBS and save them on 
your PCW, Alternatively, you will be 
given the option to Upload - transmit 
files 'up' from your PCW to the BBS. 
Every piece of comms software comes 
with its own down and uploading proce- 
dure hut generally all you need to do 
when downloading is tell your PCW the 
name of the file you want to save and 
hit the correct key. When you are 
uploading, you tell the BBS the name of 
the file you want to give and press 
another key.

MODEM '-inUJl

EMGDl]3Dj1 MODEM 

□ □ 




Making contact with other computer users really can be very simple once you have the necessary equipment. On the left of this diagram we see a PCW 
linked lo a modem by way of a serial cable. The modem connects 10 the 'phone socket and sends a message over the wires to the receiving machine. 



Accessing a typical bulletin board 



Once you have a rough idea of the 
jargon and you've bought or borrowed a 
modem, software and a cable, you'll 
want to put all the theory into some kind 
of practice. In other words, you'll want 
to log -on. As soon as your PCW is set 
up to communicate with the outside 
world many options will open out to 
you; you can lake out a subscription to a 
full-blown, industrial strength system 
such as Telecom Gold, This entails 
paying out a yearly subscription which 
will secure you a pass number and 
access to the system. Within Telecom 
Gold there are literally hundreds of 



different areas to look at. The only 
unfortunate thing is that each of these 
additional areas will also have a 
subcharge. Another, more popular and 
cheaper option is to log-on to one of the 
many Bulletin Board Services which fill 
the telephone lines and are run by 
enthusiasts. In this case all you will be 
paying out is a telephone bill. Most of 
these boards are run by and logged-on 
to friendly amateurs. The reason for the 
existence of private Bulletin Board 
Services (BBSs) is to provide open 
forums and software exchanges for 
users. A great deal of Public Domain 



software - programs which are free - 
can be found on most boards. People 
bring programs ranging from spread- 
sheets to printer drivers back from the 
US or Europe or even write software 
themselves. This means that when they 
take software (download) from a BBS 
they can also give (upload) and so the 
board grows. So, how do you go about 
joining in and gaining access to the 
information which is out there'? The 
following sequence gives you an idea of 
how easy it can be. In this case we 
decided to log-on to a board known as 
Kybernesis (08 1 6737294). 




The PMS Dialup 'front page'. This shows a number of entries for PCW 

related bulletin board services around the country. Notice the cursor is over 

Kybetnesis. However, before connecting we should check some details

Thl* Silt** rt>n*uirfu Eur It RJWS Jul v. > D*«* » **** 



Creating and amending service details is simple. Once you have the baud 
rate, emulation, 'phone number and protocol you're ready to save the service 
for later use. Bulletin boards usually have no log-on sequence to worry aboul

Once you have entered those details (this is carried out differently by other 

comms software but the principle is the same), then it's time to log on and 

give some details to the Sysop I System Operator) of your chosen BBS 



One of the first areas to look for when you've registered, is the message 

section. This will give you a feel for the board and the people who make use 

of it. Leave a "Hello, I'm here" message to introduce yourself 




The nest thing to look for, from the main menu, is the area spec i Re to your 

PCW, This should be clearly signposted on most boards, but if it is not then 

try looking for Amstrad or CP/M, Failing thai, Iry asking for one!

Having problems or want some more advice on using comms? Then ask the 

experts. Most decent BBSs know that they have new users who might get 

lost and so provide areas for technical help. If in doubt try typing a "?" 



Once you have found your board you mighi like to glance through the avail- 
able Public Domain software. In the case of Kybemesis there is a greal deal 

of useful stuff for PCW users. This can be down-loaded for free 
There we are then, the basics of Comms have, we hope, been 
opened out for you. There is much more to learn but that 
can best he achieved on-line. One point which you should 
always bear in mind is to save reading on-line matter for 
later. Many BBSs will allow you to mark files for retrieval 
and downloading - make use of this. Ideally you should only 
ever need to spend ten minutes actually logged-on. Use this 
time to gather information. This is equally true when 
leaving messages; write these before logging on (save them 
in ASCII form) and when the time comes to leave a message 
all you need do is 'upload' your saved file. Comms is a 
highly rewarding element of your PC Wing experience. It is 
also a community of mutual aid and assistance. So, if in 
doubt, ask; there will be help. • 




Re-viewdata 

You will often see the term 
Viewdata thrown around the 
place. This is a form of 'emota- 
tion' which enables you lo 
acres systems such as Prestd 
and also to get I he most Tram 
some of the more professional 
bulletin hoards or specialised 
databases. Viewdata works on 
a screen of 40 characters by 24 
rows - the FCW's nativt screen 
tsJlnyWIusing 
SETJ4X*0,COM changes the 
screen In. you guessed it, 24 by 
KOi. Consequently you will need 
In have Viewdata emulation 
from your soriwarc. Without it 
all yoo will get on your screen 
is garbage.

m eed to find an auctioneer in 
■ Aucbtenmichty? Or a dry 
* 1 cleaner in Dover? A nursery 
and creche in Nelson and Colne? The 
answer could be to let your fingers do 
the walking over your PCW keyboard, 
and make use of the new Electronic 
Yellow Pages (EYP) service. 

The 66 volumes of the familiar 
Yellow Pages directories together hold 
the names, addresses and phone num- 
bers of almost all ihe businesses in 



Britain. The directories themselves are 
compiled from the central database held 
by Yellow Pages (yet another one of 
British Telecom's many divisions), 
which currently contains about 1.8 mil- 
lion records. 

It's a valuable source of informa- 
tion, and it's now being opened up to 
on-line searches from the public, 
through Electronic Yellow Pages (EYP). 
Provided you've equipped your PCW 
with a modem, an RS232 interface and 



IN THE BEGINNING 

Mike Rowley is the person with the job of 
ensuring that Ihe Electronic Yelluw Pages 
service is safely launched. 

As Head of EYP, based in the Yellow Pages' 
head office in Reading, he has been supervising 
both the technical aspects involved and, 
perhaps, more importantly the business side 
of the project. 

"I've been with Yellow Pages for nearly 
five years, and I've been involved in the project 
throughout that time," he says. He joined the 
EYP team after evperienee in both computing 
and marketing. 

The origins of EYP go back much further 
than Mike's five years with the venture, 
however. "We've been working on on-line 
publishing for many years," he explains. "We 
were on Prestel in the early davs, back in the 
late 1970s." 

The early Prestel experiment didn't continue, but since 19X7 Prestel has been carrying a pilot 
EYP service, covering only parts of London and the Home Counties. "The aim of the trial has 
been to establish what both users and advertisers want, and how they feel about the classified 
advertising," says Mike. 

His aim, he says, is to make EYP easy to operate. "The aim is to be user-friendly. Obviously, 
the first people who will use it will be existing on-line users. We're saying to people, if you're 
currently using this facility, here's a new service for you. We're not trying to stimulate the sale of 
terminals. But we do hope Electronic Yellow Pages will appeal to most people." 

He cheerfully runs through the statistics involved: 1.8 million records are on the database at 
the moment, for example. But fortunately, he hasn't had to arrange for the database itself to be 
set up. "Yellow Pages has that already, as a core database far the local directories. We haven't had 
to have a room full of typists!" 




some comms software, you'll be able to 
dial up direct, or reach ihe database via 
Prestel. 

The launch of EYP was originally 
pencilled in for the end of May this 
year, but last-minute software bugs (yes, 
the usual story) resulted in a delay. At 
the moment, there is still no firm news 
from British Telecom (BT) of their new 
public launch date. However, 8000 Plus 
was able to seek a sneak preview of the 
service. In the words of a spokesman for 
Yellow Pages, "We're in the last stage 
of debugging now, but we don't want to 
launch until everything's perfect.". Bugs 
permitting, EYP should be up and run- 
ning in the very near future. 

Prestel for action? 

There are some people, of course, who 
say that BT should have done some- 
thing like this years ago. BT's videotex 
(viewdata) service, Prestel has had a 
somewhat chequered history since it 
was first launched back in 1979. 

By comparison, Minitel which is 
the equivalent French service, has been 
very successful. The French telecom- 
munications authorities gave away 
many hundreds of thousands of Minitel 
terminals, originally to provide a more 
efficient service for subscribers wanting 
to check other phone numbers. The idea 
was that, instead of consulting the tele- 
phone directory, you could call up the 
information on your Minitel screen. 

Unfortunately, BT are not planning 
to give away any free PCWs and 
modems. However, they are making 
their new EYP service very cheap and 
relatively straightforward to use. In fact, 
EYP marks the arrival of the first major 
on-line database in Britain which won't 
cost you an arm and a leg every time 
you want to consult it. 

Up to now, on-line data searching 



L 48 JuJv«W*fflWi'U'S 



Yellow Pages _, 



has been expensive, especially where 
business information is concerned. It's 
no! unusual to have to pay several 
pounds for just a minute's on-line search 
time, and inevitably, that's meant that 
only commercial users have tended to 
make use of the technology. 

Easy access 

If EYP is sucessful, it could make on- 
line searching a much more familiar part 
of everyday life. It's quite possible, too, 
that in due course BT's ordinary 
database of subscribers (the one which 
Directory Enquiry operators call up 
when you ring in to request a 'phone 
number) may also become publicly 
available on-line - though as Yellow 
Pages are quick to point out, that's the 
responsibility of a separate part of the 
BT beast. 

So how do you get access to the 
Electronic Yellow Pages? There are 
three routes in. The easiest way is sim- 
ply to set up your PCW comms soft- 
ware with the correct details for it to dial 
direct. The number to call is 0345- 
4111 44 . Speeds of up to 2400 baud are 
accepted by the system, as are most nor- 
mal parity settings. It's best to set up 
your software as for a viewdata service 
like Prcstel. Happily, even if you're log- 
ging on (calling) from the Outer 
Hebrides the fact that the system uses 
the 0345 prefix means that you will only 
be charged at the local call rate. 

The second method is only avail- 
able to you if you are a Prestel sub- 
scriber. In this case, you can enter via a 
gateway from PresteS. The relevant front 
page is *3813#. Yellow Pages say that 
the normal Prestel time charges will not 
be levied while you are connected to the 
EYP gateway. So once again, it should 
only cost you the price of the call to 
your local number which in this case 
will be Prestel 'node'. 

The third option is to use BT's own 
dedicated data transmission facility 
called the Packet Switch Stream service 
(PSS). You can call EYP using a special 
Network User Address (NUA) and bet- 
ter still, you can also arrange for your 
use of PSS to be reverse charged. The 
NUA you'll need is 234273402002. 

Search me 

Once you've logged-on to EYP, you'll 
be asked to start a search by typing in 
the location of the service which you 
require. 

The 'location' can be a village, 
town, county or even a postcode. It 
you're imprecise-say, you enter NEW- 
CASTLE - you'll be offered a choice of 
possible, but obviously related, locations 
for you to select. Did you mean 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne? Newcastle- 
under-Lyme? or was it really Newcastle 
Emlyn you had in mind? 

As an added refinement, you'll not 
only be asked whether you're looking 
for suppliers who actually have 
premises in the area you've chosen but 
also whether suppliers who may be 
based elsewhere but who operate in your 
area will do as well.

One of the most obvious ways of popularising the new Electronic 
Yellow Pages (EYP) service is to make it easy to use. With this in 
mind. British Telecom (BT) have produced a glossy, professional- 
looking 12 page ring-bound user manual. It won't drown you in a 
sea of jargon either. Not only does the booklet show you what you 
need in order to access EYP, it also tells you how much it's going 
to cost. A fully annotated screen by screen walkthrough has also 
been included. Call 0734 506506 to order your copy. 




C 1WO British I'di-rom Ltd 



Normally, you'll then enter the type 
of business you're interested in. The 
database will automatically accept about 
2,800 business classifications so that, 
unlike the traditional directories, it 
won't matter if you enter, say, 'lithogra- 
phers' instead of 'printers and lithogra- 
phers'. Alternatively, you can choose to 
search by company name, or product. 

At this stage, you'll be informed 
how many companies have been found 
which actually match your two require- 
ments (location and business type). The 
command ?V allows you to see short 
four-line entries giving the name, 
address and phone number for each of 
your chosen companies. 

You can also decide to increase the 
geographical area of your search by 
using the command ?X (it stands for 
'eXpand location'). In fact, if you still 
can't track down a company offering 
what you want, it's even possible to 
extend your search to the whole of the 
United Kingdom. 

Another method by which to 
extend your search to similar types of 
business is with another command; this 
time it\ ?R (which stands for 'Related 
business types'). 

Read all about it 

These are all helpful features. One prob- 
lem with EYP, however, is that when 
you come to view the companies which 
the database has Found for you the pro- 
cess can lake quite some time. The limi- 
tations of the computer screen mean that 
only three companies can be displayed 
at a time. This means that if you've cho- 
sen a popular business in a large area 
(like PUBLIC HOUSES and BIRM- 
INGHAM, perhaps), you might have to 



be prepared to settle down for a long 
session in front of your PCW. 

EYP may be a useful public service 
but. like its parent directories, it has been 
set up as an advertising-led initiative. In 
other words, British Telecom hope that 
businesses will be as keen to advertise 
electronically as they have been to take 
out display space in the local directories. 

A smart promotional pack has been 
prepared ("...advertising on EYP 
couldn't be easier ... our professional 
team will help you to make the best of 
your advert..."). It comes complete with 
the claim that over 4.7 million people 
have potential access to the service. 

BT have no doubt checked their 
statistics, but the actual number of peo- 
ple using on-line services in this country 
(compared to the United States for 
example) is still very small indeed. It 
appears that BT will have to do some 
adroit marketing work if they are to suc- 
ceed in making the public aware of, and 
keen to use, their new service. 

However, even when people are 
using EYP they won't necessarily want to 
wade through the advertisements. The 
standard advertising package (which inci- 
dentally costs £16.50 a month) provides a 
company with five frames of text in 
which to promote their services. It seems 
more likely in practice that most users 
will drop into the first frame only, before 
returning to the main listings. 

Commercial response might not be 
as enthusiastic as planned. If the adver- 
tisers don't come forward then British 
Telecom may begin to reassess the 
whole service. That would be a pity. 
EYP is a good idea, with enormous 
potential. Unfortunately, however, good 
ideas don't always catch on. •

WHAT TO DO WHEN A MICRO 
LANDS ON YOUR DESK 



by Glyn Moody & Manek Dubush £14.95 
Published bv Computer Weekly Publications 
' Tel : 081 661 8787 

8000 PLUS VALUE VERDICT = Excellent 
ISBN 185384 021 I 

The back of this book carries the rather lofty assurance that 
"The book has been written by computer experts, who 
explain in everyday language how micros work, deliberately 
avoiding confusing computer jargon". If an overwhelming 
sense of deja vu engulfs you, do not be alarmed. Any veteran 
of beginners' guides will be used to this kind of claim, and 
the usual course of action is to read on and decide whether it 
is a valid one. Read Moody and Dubash's offering to the 
uninitiated, and the claim is validated in the extreme. 

Computing is a literary market swamped by machine 
and application-specific publications. How refreshing it is to 
come across a tome that gives a general overview of the 
subject yet maintains enough structure to keep the reader 
entertained and informed. The spontaneity implied by the 
title is borne out throughout the book, which caters for 
anyone new to a computer-dominated environment. 

The first chapter provides a "painless introduction" to 
the main concepts involved in computing. The elements of 
the micro, from discs and printers through to software itself, 
are listed and explained and thechapter rounds off with a 
look at the implications of having a computer in the office or 
at home. Ii is here that the question of data security is raised. 




Software and Hardware enjoy a 
chapter each, and examples of both 
are given where necessary. The 
former explains word processors, 
databases and communications 
programs, and includes screen dumps 
from example products in each case. 
The hardware chapter explores every- 
thing from monitors to mice. 

There is a useful section on 
"Living with your micro" which, as 
the authors advise, is worth re-reading 
several months after the equipment is 
installed. It warns against the dangers 
of conditions such as repetitive strain 
injury, and how such health hazards 
can be avoided. The possibility of 
radiation from the monitor isdealt 
with, and the authors are shrewd in 

pointing out that although this is an area of concern, millions of 
people sit close to a television set without the 'experts' creating 
the slightest outcry. 

This book is a general look at computing, so sections such 
as "Every day with MS-Dos" might bemuse the PCW owner, 
since CP/M is the native operating system for their machine. 
However, it is worth reading the chapter just the same to gain 
knowledge of how other computers work. 

A look at the evolution of business computing rounds off 
what is frankly a superb publication. Chapters are punctuated 
with margin notes, and finished with economical summaries. 
This is the kind of book which every newcomer to computing 
should have close to hand: it is packed with information, intelli- 
gently written, and if the thought of computing brings you out in 
a cold sweat, your worries could soon be over. • 





LOCOSCRIPT 2 WITH LOCOSPELL, 
LOCOMAIL AND LOCOFILE 

by Ian Sinclair £10.95 

Published bv BSP Professional Books 

Tel : 0865 240201 

8000 PLUS VALUE VERDICT = Excellent 
IBSN « 632 02861 

Ian Sinclair has become something of an industry standard 
when it comes to producing tutorials on word processing. 
The popularity of his earlier book, LocoScript 2 on the 
Amstrad PCW 8256/8512 and 9512 first written in 1987, 
has led him to bring out this second edition, with extra 
sections on LocoMail, LocoSpell and LocoFile. 

It is stressed from the outset that the book should be 
used in conjunction with the manual. This eliminates the 
necessity of explaining technical jargon every time it is 
used; it doesn't, however, make the book difficult to under- 
stand. Although the reader might be alarmed at the prox- 
imity of the section on direct printing to the contents page, 
the author has also emphasised the importance of practical 
experience in the learning process. If you follow the 
instructions, you will quickly see how direct printing serves 
as an excellent way to become familiar with the difference 
between the typewriter and the word processor. Screen 
dumps illustrate the stylistic variations which LocoScript 2 
offers (such as italics, line and pitch settings and so on) but 
which are not apparent on the actual screen. 

The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the 
production of a letter (including sub-sections on templates 



and simple editing) and how to print 
that letter using various printer 
options. More advanced editing, 
involving the use of blocks and stock 
phrases is dealt with in a section enti- 
tled 'Boilerplating". The name derives 
from the manner in which a supply of 
phrases can be drafted in to build up a 
document little by little. 

The sections on LocoSpell, 
LocoMail and LocoFile are brief: 
space does not permit a thorough 
exploration of the many capabilities 
which each utility has to boast. As the 
author points out, "a full guide to 
LocoMail would require a book to 
itself. What is on offer though, is an 
outline of the basic functions of each 
'extra' together with illustrated exam- 
ples of how to carry out simple functions. For example, the 
LocoFile section tells you how to to set up an index, and how to 
set up each record in a card form. The method of editing these 
cards is also explained. 

There is an additional chapter given over to LocoFont, the 
utility which allows you to determine the 'design' of the text 
that you produce. The book finishes with a very useful 'Help' 
section. It is set out in terms of a 'how to' guide, with end 
results listed as mini headings, and relevant menu commands 
detailed underneath. As these are arranged in alphabetical order, 
troubleshooting becomes quick and easy procedure. 

Ian Sinclair has produced the kind of manual which will 
always enjoy reader loyalty. With the plethora of LocoScript 
tutorials on the bookshelves, it is encouraging to see one which 
stands out from the crowd. •

Son of LocoScript 

Heralded by prophecy of biblical intensity - now, at last, it's here. 
Steve Patient brings you the word on LocoScript for the PC 



Loco PC _ 




T 

lie PC needs another word 
processor the way a minute needs 
A. eighty seconds. For Locomotive 
in leap into a saturated market smacks nf 
hubris, and yet they claim to be reacting 
to market forces. They say iheir 
customers want LocoScript on the PC: 
well they've got it. 

It's worth stating immediately thai 
LocoScript PC is nol going to win many 
converts from among existing word 
processor users on the PC - and 
Locomotive must know it. Their market 
is the near 1 ,000,000 folk who are 
already familiar with the product via the 
PCW, who, for one reason or another, 
find themselves in front of a PC and 
needing some words processed. 

Most word processor users always 
have a soft spot for their first amour, and 
through many LocoScript lovers will 
have been forced to move into the PC 
world they haven't necessarily become 
reconciled to a second, shotgun 
marriage. 

For these PC users, LocoScript PC 
will be a delight. In almost every way it 
is the same program as LocoScript 2. 
Moreover, it comes complete with 
LocoFile, LocoMail and LocoSpell 
(plus word count) built in. 

Open the box 

For your money, you get an imposing, 
green boxfile with three ringbound 
manuals - tutorial, reference manual, 
database and mailmerge manual - a 175 
page printer manual and an installation 
manual. There are also four 360K 5.25 
inch discs and two 720K 3.5 inch discs. 
Locomotive have gone out of their way 
to make the installation as simple as 
possible, despite the variety of PC 
configurations. 

LocoScript PC can be installed and 
run (from two 360K discs) on a PC with 
a single 360K floppy disc drive - but 
you will hate using it. A 720K disc is 
practical and nice for users of portables 
like the Amstrad PPC. Two-drive 
machines are even belter, but a hard disc 
will make LocoScript PC extremely 
happy. This is coupied with the fact thai 
files created on the PCW with 
LocoScript I or 2, Locomail or 
LocoFile, can all be used without altcr- 
alion once transferred to the PC (see 
margin notes). It's almost fun to change 
machines. 



On a basic XT PC (the least powerful 
and least expensive kind), this version 
of LocoScript isn't much faster than on 
the PCW, This is partly due to the way 
it works internally (Locomotive argue 
that while others are faster, theirs does a 
better job) which has apparently been 
carried over to the PC. The rest is due 
lo the way it handles ihe screen. 

Get the picture 

Rather than run in the fast but inflexible 
text mode of PCs. it runs by default in 
graphics mode. This has been chosen for 
the number of interesting possibilities it 



opens up to the programmers. The most 
spectacular of these is that graphics mode 
allows effects like italics, bold, shadow 
text, inverse text and so on to be shown 
on screen without distracting codes. But 
the effects stop there. Locomotive 
haven't gone all the way and shown 
proportional spacing or different point 
sizes on screen. 

There are other possibilities, too. 
On a PC with a Hercules card and mono 
monitor, it enables LocoScript PC to run 
in 92 columns just as on the PCW. On 
all other graphics adaptors you're 
restricted to 80 columns. However, there

disc structure. The best way to use it is to tell LocoScript nol to look ai most of the disk.

is a trade off: on a PC in graphics mode 
more lines can be shown. With a 
Hercules adaptor you get the choice of 
25 or 43 lines; the same with an EGA 
adaptor. On a VGA system you get 25, 
30, 43, 50 and 60 lines - virtually a 
complete page if you don't mind 
squashed letters. 

The one really obvious difference 
between LocoScript 2 and LocoScript 
PC is in the way the Disc Manager 
works. The PC doesn't have user 
groups, it has a tree directory structure. 
This is more flexible than LocoScript 
2's user groups but it can be harder to 
find your way around. 

Colour coded 

In the edit screen, the PC keyboard is 
less intimidating; like the PCW, it has 
function keys and these serve the same 
purposes. The only really bad decision 
is sticking with the plus and minus keys 
for toggling codes on and off. On the 
PCW these are ideally placed for a 
touch typist. On the PC, they are on 
the far side of the numeric keypad - as 
far from the home keys as possible. 
Alternatives to these (perhaps with the 
|ALTJ or [CTRL] keys) would have 
been useful for real typists. 

There are several good aspects to 



_ 



Badly managed 



In Iheir efforts tu maintain a complete one to one visual relationship 
between LocoScript 2 and LocoScript PC, Locomotive have produced a 
confusing hybrid. The Disc Manager is unsatisfactory. Although it looks 
familiar. It can be slaw and awkward moving around a hard disc. 
Locomotive argue that since you can make directories invisible to 
LocoScript PC this is irrelevant, but what's the point of a disc manager 
that doesn't let you manage discs efficiently unless you make most of it 
invisible? In this one area Locomotive would have been well advised to 
change the look of LocoScript PC to better reflect the way the PC's direc- 
tory structure works. However, at least file-tagging has arrived - groups of 
files can be tagged for moving, copying or deleting en bloc. 

Locomotive are well aware of the directory problem and have made 
some efforts to alleviate it. The Illume) key can be made to return you 
from any directory view to a pre-set one, so you can't gel lost; on hard disc 
machines, LocoScript PC will remember the current directory view 
between sessions. Even so, rinding a barely-remembered file in an unknown 
directory, is easier done outside LocoScript PC. 

Since Ihe PC keyboard is quite different from that on Ihe PCW, there 
is the added confusion of trying to Find unfamiliar keys to do an unfamiliar 
job. II all adds up to an irritating introduction to the product. 



LocoScript PC. For instance, it now 
supports colour. This is on the IF6) 
Settings menu (along with the menu to 
alter the screen mode from various 
graphics displays to real text mode). 
Locomotive have come up with a fun 
colour menu that allows you to interac- 
tively play with the screen colours and

LocoScript PC achieves a new level of integration — but it needs a hard disc to gel the best from it. 



see the effects as the changes are made. 
There are other concessions to the 
PC world. Documents can now be 
imported and exported in Ihe near ubiq- 
uitous WordStar file format as well as 
ASCII and DC A (IBM mainframe revis- 
able- form -text format supported by 
many PC word processors). Locomotive 
are nothing if not thorough. In their 
WordStar conversion they don't just 
convert Ihe main text and embedded 
codes, but add all the page formatting in 
the form of dot commands so that it will 
print out properly. 

Starting over 

The way printers are handled feels 
better than it did on the PCW, where 
support for other primers always 
appeared to be bolted on. Since there is 
no built-in PC printer, the way 
LocoScript PC integrates printer drivers 
now feels a lot more consistent. Adding 
and removing them is simple. 
Moreover, the different abilities of 
printers, fonts and pitches, for example, 
are presented clearly and handled intel- 
ligently when documents created for 
one printer are printed using another. 
PCs are more powerful than the 
PCWs, yet little advantage appears to 
have been taken of this power - while 
the hardware platform is better, you're 
still looking at virtually the same level 
of software functionality. LocoScript 
still appears to spool a 20K document to 
disc when going from top to bottom and 
back again, further slowing things 
down. And most users won't have a 
powerful PC with a fast hard disc. 
Despite the extra space, there's still no 
way to work with two documents at 
once. The backward file compatibility 
with LocoScript I and 2 is good, but it's 
only one way - to the PC. To get them 
back the other way they have to be 
converted to ASCII files. If you find 
you have the use of a PC with a hard 
disc instead of a PCW - and you like 
LocoScript - then go for the PC version. 
But there's little to be gained in 
dumping your PCW in order to run 
LocoScript on a floppy-only PC. •

LISTINGS 



One program to test your 

knowledge and skill and 

another which does nothing 

for hours on end. What is 

the PCW up to? 




.CHOMP.BAS by M.A. Owen 



ho says thai the PCW can't pro- 
duce decent graphics at a fair 
pace? Well lots of people actu- 
ally, and the one thing they have in 
common is the fact they're wrong. Mr 
Owen proves this with a variation on 
the theme of Hangman. This version of 
an old favourite is definitely anti-capital 
punishment however, and sees instead a 
battle between a voracious spider and a 
rather worried looking caterpillar. 

The aim of the player, as it has 
always been with Hangman, is to guess 
a hidden word. Mr Owen has made all 
the words in this version animal related. 
They are all single words as well - there 
are no phrases - although this might not 
be such a bad addition to the program if 
you really wanted to start testing your 
friends or children. 

Every lime a wrong letter is chosen 
you are informed of the fact and a spider 
drops a little further down its thread 
from the top of the left-hand side of the 
screen, ready to split the caterpillar in 
two. Every time a correct letter is cho- 
sen, the caterpillar is one step closer to 



freedom. If the whole word is found, the 
caterpillar rushes off stage only to be 
forced to return whether or not you want 
to play another game. You have seven 
chances to hit on the correct answer - it 
might have been an idea to try and pro- 
vide a skill level with increased or 
decreased numbers of attempts. 

What makes this version of the 
game so appealing is the fact that all the 
options have been considered. You do 
not have to restart CHOMP.BAS every 
time you want a new game; nor do you 
have to play through a set of games 
before you can 
escape. The spider 
moves with great 
smoothness as does 
its prey. Another 
well thought-out 
option is the fact 
that the game 
remembers which 
letters you have 
already picked and 
warns you of the 
fact that you are 



attempting to re-use one. Overall. 
CHOMP.BAS would make a good few 
minutes' break for adults and for the 
children of those adults it would serve as 
an educational tool par excellence.

How to Type in a Listing. 

First you need to get Mallard BASIC up and running. Insert a copy of 
your CP/M disc - not the master, make sure that you are using a copy. 
Ai the A> prompt type BASIC and press [ENTER], BASIC is loaded 
when the A> disappears and a small message is displayed on the screen: 

Maliard-80 BASIC with Jetsam Version 1.29 

(c) Copyright 1984 Locomotive Software Ltd 

All rights reserved 

31597 free bytes 

Some of the details, such as version number, date and bytes might be 
different but essentially the message will be the same. BASIC is fully 
loaded when the CP/M A> is replaced by ok. You're now ready to type 
in the listings. Do this as they appear on the page, line by line. Don't 
type the four figure hex numbers at the end of every line as these relate 
to the Checksum program published in the April 1990 issue. 

Typing errors are quite common so check each line carefully. If 



you find a mistake before pressing [ RETURN | simply cursor back to it 
and make the required correction using the [DEL| keys. If you realise 
that you've made a mistake after pressing [RETURN] you will need to 
type EDIT and the number of the offending line. You can then edit any 
errors in the same way as above. Once you're sure that all is correct 
press [RETURN |. The amended line will be accepted into the program. 

When you've typed in all the lines and made any corrections, type 
LIST 10 print the entire program on the screen. If you want a copy sent 
to the printer you will need to type LLIST. 

After making another line by line check you must save the pro- 
gram. Do this by typing SAVE" followed by a filename such as DRAW. 
You don't need to bother with the .BAS as Basic assumes this. Make 
sure the filename is no longer than eight letters. 

Finally type RUN and wail. The chances arc lhat the dreaded 
'Syntax error' in line so-and-so or some other message will appear. The 
line number might noi be the exact place in which the error occured but 
it will narrow down the search. Edit any errors in the manner we have 
noted and try again. If all else fails - RTFM - or Read the Flipping 
Manual as programmers are wont to say. 



T 



BLANKIT.BAS by John Filsak 



here has been a running argument 
in Ihe Tipoffs and Postscript 
pages as to the value of keeping 
the PCW switched on. One view has it 
that continually switching the PCW on 
and off does nothing for the machine at 
all and. in fact, causes damaging power 
surging. However, keeping the PCW 
switched on all Ihe lime means that 
whatever is on the screen (even if it is 
only the A> prompt) will eventually 
bum into the screen. There has to be a 
happy medium and it is achieving this 
which has fuelled the debate. Many peo- 
ple have come up with screen clearing 
routines which rely on the 
cls$=CHR${27 )+"E"+CHR$(27H-"rT 
system. (There is no built in routine to 
ciear the screen in Mallard BASIC, such 
as the command CLS, which is com- 
mon to oiher versions of the BASIC lan- 
guage like Microsoft BASIC or 
GWBASIC. Infact. there isn't a com- 
mand to find the cursor equivalent to 
LOCATE in MicroSofl BASIC. With 
Mallard you have to use the rather 



lengthy line which defines a user func- 
tion such as FNat$. This is achieved in 
the following manner: 
DEF 

FNatS(x.y)=CHR$(27)+"Y"+CHR$ 
(x+32)+CHR$(y+32). it is used in this 
way; PRINT FNat$(20,20) ;"Hello there 
to you":. 

To get back to the point, this 
reliance on the BASIC clear screen rou- 
tine is all well and good; it does the job, 
bul unsuspecting visitors are left with the 
impression lhai Ihe PCW is in fact 
switched off. Mr Filsak's program pro- 
vides the occasional message and alarm 
as both a reminder and a warning. 

John Filsak's answer is contained in 
this short BASIC listing. What is does is 
to blank the screen for a fixed amount of 
time. At the end of this period (which 
you set), a message warning you that the 
PCW is switched on appears for another 
fixed amount of time (again you get to 
set this). If, during the time that 
BLANKIT.BAS is running, you need to 
return to BASIC, ail you have to do is 



touch a key and ihe program will end - 
you will be relumed lo ihe ok prompt. 
This is a neat way around the problem. 
You could even lum it into a SUB- 
MIT file which could be run directly 
from CP/M. By changing the command 
END in line 290 to the command SYS- 
TEM, you would be returned to the 
CP/M A> prompt. The submit file might 
look like this: BASIC BLANKIT.BAS 
There are many other ways of clearing 
the screen (try typing OUT 248,8 to 
clear it and OUT 248.7 to restore the 
screen), but Mr Filsak's method with 
liming and message is neat and tidy.

SEND LISTINGS 

We don't make up the listings in 8000 Plus. We need you to send us 
programs of general interest. What we are looking for are short pro- 
grams, 50 lines or less, because this means that we can fit more into an 
issue. Longer examples will of course be used, but only if they are 
brain-burstingly brilliant. 

So, if you can wend your way around BASIC and would like to 
see your name printed in 8000 Plus as well as our signatures printed on 
a cheque, send us some lines. 

Along with the listing it seif (replete with REM's please) we 
require the listing to be saved in ASCII form on a disc together with 
documentation saved either as a simple ASCII tile or in Protext format. 



The documentation should include instructions for use and details of 
how the program works. Include a printout of the documentation and a 
stamped addressed padded bag for the return of your disc. Don't forget 
the signed statement confirming that the program is all your own work 
and hasn't been submincd to anyone else. 

Send your work to: Listings, 8000 Plus, Beauford Court, 30 
Monmouth Street, Bath. BAI 2XF. 

We may even consider using the occasional program written in 
other well-known languages such as C or Pascal. These should not be 
too long and should be accompanied by plenty of documentation. Weird 
programs will only usually get printed if they bring out new and won- 
derful facets from the PCW. We would prefer to receive listings which 
have a genuine general interest for our readers.

Dangerous 
corners 



One nice thing about being a 
small computer company is 
that, depending upon whom 
you want to impress, you can legiti- 
mately call yourself Chairman, 
Managing Director, Head of 
Programming, Marketing 
Consultant, Chief Buying Executive, 
and indeed every prestigious title not 
currently wanted by the other 
director. The snag is that you — that 
is, I — have to do the work of all 
these functionaries.... 

It was as Buying Executive that 
1 met a fascinating example of real- 
life logical paradox. One gradually 
gels used to the pitfalls of trade price 
lists, such as having to detect by 
telepathy whether the figures include 
VAT (usually not, except sometimes) 
and whether "5'7i discounl for cash 
with order!" applies to cheques (yes, 
but expect irritating delays while Ihe 
cheque is tested for bounciness). The 



new snag came from bulk discounts. 

We wanted CF2 discs. The 
minimum bulk order from a 
company which shall remain name- 
less worked out at over £ 1 00. Which 
was fine until I noticed that when 
you ordered more than £100-worth, 
the price per disc dropped. Great! 1 
did the sums again, using the lower 
figure. Oops. 

Bertrand Russell would have 
loved this. At the price for orders 
less than £100, my discs cost over 
£ 100. and at Ihe price for orders over 
£100. they were only ninety -odd, 
which raised the price to the higher 
rate for orders below £1 00, so.... 

Perimeter paranoia 

A systems analyst would probably 
suggest, after pocketing a huge fee. 
that the neatest solution here would 
be a flat charge of £100 for every 
disc order in that dodgy region 



where the price keeps oscillating. 
Being a cynic, I suspected that the 
vendors might prefer avarice to 
logical elegance, and played safe 
with a blank cheque marked "not 
more than (the higher price)". 

This is how. in the world of 
computers, it can take half an hour 
of head -scratching to make one 
purchase. It also shows aspiring 
programmers how innocent-looking 
rules may lead to dangerous instabil- 
ities. The places to watch for prob- 
lems are at a situation's edges or 
comers; for the disc purchase, me 
awkwardness comes where the price 
per disc veers in a rather ill-defined 
way to the lower rate. 

Glitches often happen at 
extreme edges, at zero and infinity. 
That zero discs cost zero pounds 
isn't a problem. However, as a book 
reviewer 1 often receive parcels of 
SF costing nothing: when 1 flog the 
unwanted rubbish at 50p a copy, my 
percentage profit per volume is 100 
times 50p cjivided by zero, which is 
guaranteed to boggle any business 
records program. Unless, of course, 
some programmer has incorporated 
the tactful message, "Division by 
zero? You can't do that here." 

It wouldn't happen in real 
calculations. Think of this: a 
company, probably mine, makes 
zero profit in 1990. Whatever profil 
or loss it makes in 1991 will, if 
you're fool enough to express the 
change as a percentage, be infinitely 
better or worse than 1990"s. 

Locostripped 

Another example which rather 
embarrassingly comes from real life: 
wearing my Chief Programmer's 
hat. I wrote some software which 
gulped LocoScript files and did 
nameless things with [hem. It was 
only interested in the text, and 
ignored headers, print controls for 
underlining, and so on. 

But one chap's document made 
it seize up completely, leaving me 
baffled until I realised I'd failed to 
consider the extreme case. There 
was no actual text, and my program 
was no good at processing 
LocoScript files containing zero 
words.... After each word, and only 
then, it checked whether it was at 
the end of the file. The cure was to 
have it check before each word, 

(I stilt haven't allowed for 
awkward folk who produce Loco 



documents of infinite length. Once 
someone announces an add-on hard 
disc with infinite capacity. I'll have 
to rethink that program again,) 

Point of no return 

Another time when 1 had lo worry 
about the treacherous corner at Point 
Zero was in doing the astrophysics 
for an SF story. The easiest way to 
work out certain orbits, and the time 
it took before spaceship A collided 
with massive object B, seemed to be 
to simulate everything on the 
computer and let Newton's taws of 
motion and gravity take their course. 
Unfortunately the program tended to 
blow up shortly before printing out 
its graphs of what had happened. 
The gravitational attraction between 
A and B doubles each time the 
distance between them halves. For 
the first rough simulation, I hadn't 
bothered to allow for these objects 
having any size: as their separation 
shrank to zero the acceleration 
soared towards infinity, the figures 
got vaster than the computer's regis- 
ters could comprehend, and the 
program pointed a last accusing error 
message at me as it died. 

Obviously, if one object is little 
and the other a planet, the program 
should stop calculating and simulate 
a loud bang when the separation 
between their centres drops to what- 
ever the planet's radius happens to 
be. Problem solved — or only 
evaded? Suppose there's a tunnel 
right through the world and our 
spacecraft plunges in... does it meet 
awkward infinities at the centre? 

This is interesting. It turns out 
that, as with the disc price list or the 
difference between water at 99 
degrees and 101 degrees, the rules 
change when you cross an invisible 
line. Once below the surface, instead 
of growing by the in verse -square 
law, the force of gravity now 
decreases sedately with distance 
from the planet's centre, and of 
course reaches a neat zero when you 
gel there. Sanity returns. 

Before turning this corner, the 
calculations had overflowed because 
of dodgy approximations and not 
thinking the problem through. Mea 
culpa. When I'd put it right and 
cranked out my distance/time 
graphs, I went around for days being 
smug and calling myself the 
company's Astrophysics Director. 
No one seemed to believe me. •

Taxins offset 



Just a reminder to anyone who 
uses the lip featured last month 
for addressing envelopes by using 
the [f6| 'Offset' feature and direct 
priming in LocoScript I or 
LocoScript 2. 

After you've finished doing 
envelopes, you should return to 
an offset of zero by pressing [f6] 
and clearing offset or typing in 
- or else all subsequent printing 
will be offset to the right, playing 
havoc with your letter margins 
and paper settings!

Dastardly plot 



Is it possible to use a PCW 
with a plotter such as those 
used to produce technical 
drawings, blueprints, plans and 
designs etc, via computer aided 
design? I want to do an A level 
project on this use of the PCW. 
Christopher Hill, 
Rochester, Kent 

8000 Plus: Never having used 
one I'm afraid I'll have to 
throw that question open. If 
anyone has used a plotter per- 
haps they could tell us if and 
how it's done? 



Marginally faster 



Here's a reminder of the quickest 
way to set margins in LocoScript 
2. Press |fZ] while editing to 
change the layout or make a new 1 
one. Press [+] to move the left 
hand margin to the right, or [-] to 
the left. 



To jump to the right hand 
margin, press [SPACE]. Then 
press [+1 or [-] to move it right 
or left. 

The [+] and [-) are on either 
side of the space bar on an R256 
or 85 1 2, and on the bottom left of 
the keyboard on a 9512.

Memory man 



Is there a way of expanding my 
memory? I use LocoScript 2, 
LoeoMail and LocoFile and find 
that with data files loaded I am 
running out of available memory. 
Dr Diarmaid MaeCulloch. 
Glasgow 



8000 Plus: Yes. SCA Systems' 
"Rampac" is a small ho.x that 
clamps on the bark of your PCW 
(no wiring or soldering, just stick 
it on} and gives you an extra 
5 12K of memory. It worked fine 
with LocoFile el at when we 
tested a mode! and it costs 
£113.85 including VAT from SCA 
on 0903 700288.. 



Top drawer filing 



The solution to R J Wheeler's 
LocoFile problem of getting all, or 
a selection of, LocoFile records 
into a single document, is just the 
creation of a simple loop instruc- 
tion. This is the perfect way of 
making list', from LocoFile. saving 
them as an ordinary LocoScript 
document, and can he used for per- 
sonal organiser lists etc. 

Create a master document of 
the paper size that you want to 
print on and call it, for example, 
L1STMSTR. (You can have a title 
for the first page and/or headers/ 
footers etc. as for a normal docu- 
ment). Then type the following for- 
mula, or equivalent, as text. 

The example given will list 
people's surname, addresses and 
telephone numbers, by order of 
surname. It can be easily changed 
to select the particular item names 
that are in the LocoFile you wish 
to sort or print. You don't enter 
any spaces in the following 
routine except where it says 
ISPACE] - they're just here to 
make it easier to read. 

(+Mail) $="sumame" (-Mail) 

[RETURN1 

(+Mail) % (+Mail) Title (-Mail) 

(SPACE) (+Mail) First_name 

(-Mail) |SPACE1 (+Mail) Surname 

(-Mail) , [RETURN] 

(+Mail) Address (-Mail) 

| RETURN! (+Mail) Telephone 

(-Mail) IRETURNI [RETURN] 

(+Mail) $+ (-Mail) "{©Surname 

(-Mail) [RETURN] 



Remember to check that you have 
an equal number of (+Mail)s and 
(-Mail)s or the process won't work! 
Also for mail merge. item_names" 
must be whole names. If, for exam- 
ple as above, you have called an 
item 'First name' in LocoFile, it 
must be entered as 'First_name*. 

The $="" contains the 
item_name by which order you 
would like the information sorted. 
This name must exist as an Index 
in LocoFile. If this line is omitted, 
or left blank, the information is 
sorted by record number. 

The % sign tells Mail Merge 
to repeat the program contained 
between the next pair of " marks 
until the 'item' named at the end, 
after @, has been exhausted. 

The number of [RETURN] 
s in the next to last line sets the 
amount of space you want between 
each item in the finished listing, 
(You could put [ALT] [RETURN] 
here if you want items separated 
by a page.) 

The $+ tells the program to 
keep the next address etc. on the 
same document. Normally this will 
be the same page, and in this way 
you can sort or print as many items 
as you want per page as the paper 
type will allow. 

Remember when creating the 
document (Document setup, [fl |) 
to ensure that under [f5] 'Page' 
you select 'Page break control* to 
'Do not break paragraphs'. This 
ensures that addresses will not run 
over a page end. 

USING THE ROUTINE: When 
you have typed the loop instruc- 



tion, save the document as a Master. 

Then from the disc manager, 
put the cursor over this document 
and press M for 'Merge'. 

On being asked the data docu- 
ment you wish to use, move the 
highlight over the appropriate 
LocoFile file and [ENTER]. 

Check the two documents are 
the ones you wish to merge and that 
"Manual' is selected. [ENTER] 
again and the document is created 
on screen. 

When the sort is completed you 
are offered options to print, save 
etc. as usual. If you 'save' then you 
can give a name and your document 
has been created. 

A simple little routine, but a 
very useful one. 

Peter Goddard, 
Faversham, Kent 



8000 Plus: Thanks for a neat solu- 
tion to the problem. 

This is much, much more use- 
ful than I thought last month: if you 
want to transfer your LocoFile data 
file to another database - 
Masterfile, for example - you can 
use the above to make up a docu- 
ment containing your name and 
address list, or whatever it is, 
make an ASCII file of it, and import 
thai into Masterfile. See this 
month's Masterfile feature on 
export and import. 

It also enables you, with a bit 
of LoeoMail selection, to make 
selective lists from your LoeoMail 
or LocoFile data: a document con- 
taining names and addresses of just 
your local customers, or just the 
members of your club who haven't 
paid their subs.

Tipoffs 



It drives me B. 



I have learnl from Tipoffs thai I can 
gel rid of the 'Drive is A:' message 
that appears at the bottom right of 
the screen of my 95 1 2 or 8256 by 
typing [EXIT] then Oat the A> 
prompt in CP/M. This works even 
if 1 then go into Pretext. 

But how can I include this 
command in my PROFILE.SUB? 
Marjorie Baker, Swansea 
8000 Plus: PIP is what you want. 
because it can create text files (eg 
PROFILE.SUB) which include 
keypresses like [EXITj. 

Run up CP.'M as usual and 
with the CP/M copy disc in the 
drive type PIP [RETURN]. At the 
* prompt, insert your Protext 



startup disc. Now type 
A:PROFILE.SUB=CON: 
[RETURN! 
and type 

[EXlTjO IRETURNI [ALT! J 
(nothing appears to happen: don't 
worry) and carry on with the 
usual lines of your PROFILE.SUB 
file, except that as well as a 
IRETURNI 1' the end of each line, 
type [ALTj J. For example: 
PROTEXT [RETURN! [ALT] J 
To finish, rype [ALTjZand the 
PROFILE.SUB will be written to 
disc. If you make a mistake, don't 
use the [DEL] keys, but press 
[CAN J. The cursor moves back 
and you can overwrite your error. 
When you start up from this disc, 
the 'Drive is A:' message will be 
blanked out. 



PIPped at the post 



[ want to use PIP's archiving fea- 
ture, which copies all files that 
have been altered since PIP last 
did any copying, to copy files from 
my B drive to the A drive in all 
groups. 1 have tried the command 
PIP A:=B:*,*[Ao| to copy files in 
group but it doesn't seem to 
work. Why? 

WJ Jukes, 
Rugeley, Staffs 
8009 Plus: Basically because 
you're typing a small letter o 
instead of a zero. For those who 
aren't acquainted with PIP's many 
options, here's a quick guide with 
some examples. These illustrate 
copying from the A to M drive, 
though obviously you can do it 
from anv drive to anv other: 
PIPM:=A:*,*[A[ 
copies only those files that have 
been edited or otherwise changed 
since you last issued this command 
- very useful for keeping backup 



copies and clearly much quicker 
than copying all the files regard- 
less 

PIP M:=A:*.*[CJ 
tells you the name of each file in 
turn and asks you to press Y if you 
want it copied and N if you don 't - 
very handy if you only want to 
copy a selection affiles. [STOPj 
stops the copying, 
PIP M:[G5j=A:*.*[G5J 
copies all files in CP/M user area 
5 (LocoScript group 5) to group 5 
of the M drive 
PtPM:=A:*.*[R[ 
copies all files including system 
files (e.g. the LocoScript program 
files) 

PlPM:=A:*.*[Uj 
copies the files and converts them 
alt into upper case I LIKE THIS) 
These can be combined, so that for 
example 

PIP M:[G3I=A: **[ACG5[ 
copies group 3 files changed since 
the last use of PIP on them, and 
asking you to confirm each 
exchange. 



Game for more tips 



Some lips for the Batman game: 

1 . Get backpack, bag, boots and 
belt first. 

2. In the room with the two skin- 
heads, go to the bottom right and 
walk into it. This will allow you 
access to the main part of the maze. 

3. In the room with the batpart 
which is got to through the room 
with two walls and two henchmen, 
simply jump up at the underside of 
ihe block near the door. There is no 
need to try and jump the stairs. 

4. To see if there is a room above 
you. pile everything in ihe room 
and jump off the top. If there is a 
spring then put ii on top. If there is 
a lift, pui everything in the lift. 

5. If you die immediately you walk 
in a room then you get an extra 
"dog's life" at the end. 



And some for Time and Magic: 

1 . In Price of Magic, smash mirror 
and rub the Eyebright flower 
(found outside) in your eyes to see 
in the dark, 

2. In Zone One of Lords of Time, 
gel everything you can find: the 
rucksack lets you carry more. 

3. Chop down the willow with the 
axe in Lords of Time (Zone One) to 
get the diamond teardrop. Give 
looking glass to thing across the 
stream to get magnet and use thai 
to get keys from under the shed. 
Use them to open shed and gel axe. 

4. Dropping the mirror in the cave 
in Lords of Time gets you past the 
cavemen. Give leaves to Bronto. 

5. Throw the net over the gladiator 
in the ring. 

6. And, as in any adventure game, 
map all the time! 

Mark Titchener, 
Dorset 



Good position 



Users of LocoMail (which means 
all 95 1 2 owners) can make their 
letters position the date and ihe 
recipient's name and address in the 
right place automatically. 

Create a document called 
say LETTER.STD as shown 
below putting the 'address', 'date' 
and 'name' slots in the right places 
for your paper. To create a letter, 
put the cursor over LETTER.STD 
and press F for 'Fill', You're 



prompted for the name, address 
and date, which are slotted in the 
righl place for you. When the 
menu shows up, select E for "Edit

letter. You can save the result 
under a name of your choice 
when you finish editing and 
press [EXIT]. 

A similar approach is very 
useful for forms where a lot of 
information has to be entered in 
specific places.

MOPping up 



1 have a database in Mini Office 
that is getting very big (600 plus 
name and addresses) and hence 
slow. 1 want to transfer it to 
Masterfile. which is quicker and 
more powerful. How can I do it? 

Hilary Nurse, 
West Heath, Birmingham 

m00 Plus: If you have Mini 
Office Professional Plus ("Mini 
Office II" ) simply save the file as 
ASCII fin the Load/Save menu, 
cursor down to 'file format' and 
press [ENTER j to get ASCII up. 
then save as usual). Say the result 
is called FILE.ASC. 

If you have the old version of 
Mini Office (with only two master 
discs instead of three) then here is 
what to do, Create a mail merge 
file in Mini Office from your 
database and save, then reset with 
[SHIFTj[EXTRA[[EXlT} and 
insert your LocoScript start of day 
disc. Reinsert your Mini Office 
data disc and press [f7j ([flj in 
LocoScript 1 ). All your Mini Office 
files are there neatly listed in 
group 0. 

Create a new document in a 
suitable group and open it for edit 



ing. From [flj (jJ7[ in LocoScript 
I) select 'Insert text' and on the 
prompt select the mail merge file. 
You will see the database neatly 
insert itself into your new docu- 
ment with (RETURN)s separating 
all the fields. 

Edit the Mini Office hea 
ding text away at the top so that 
the first line is the first line of 
information that would appear in 
the database. Now save the docu- 
ment and from the disc manager 
select 'Make ASCII file' from [flj 
(If?} in LocoScript I) giving a 
suitable name such as FILE.ASC 
and putting the result in group 0, 
Select the 'simple text' option. 
This is the file to import into 
Masterfile. 

Then run up Masterfile and 
make a database with at least the 
same number of fields as the Mini 
Office database. If you have say 
20 fields in the Masteiftle 
database and 15 in the Mini 
Office one, make the first 15 in 
Masterfile identical with the first 
15 in Mini Office. Then go to 
Load/Save and press I for import, 
giving the number of fields in the 
Mini Office database and the 
name of Ihe file such as 
FILE.ASC. 



Game with bugs 



MAIL232 al Ihe A>, all I got was 
MAIL232? How can I locate the 
bacteria? 

Hamlsh Davidson, 
Bromley. Kent 



In Tipoffs in May you described 
the 'Game of Life' hidden on Ihe 
LocoScript master disc. 

Unfortunately when I inserted 8000 Plus: Use your LocoScript 
my LocoScript 2.26 disc and typed 1 disc, not your LocoScript 2 disc.

Tipoffs 



Psion of the times 



For transferring files; from the 
PCW to the AgendA and vice 
versa, MAIL232 (on the CP/M 
disc on the PCW95 1 2 or the 
LoeoScript I disc on an 8512 or 
8256) is the best bel. It avoids use 
ofSETSIOandofPIP. 

Run up CP/M and at the A> 
prompt insen the appropriate 
MAIL232 disc and type MAIL232 
[RETURN |. |fl] allows you to set 
the baud rate - thus avoiding SET- 
SIO - and 2400 for transmit and 
receive is a good option. 1 have set 
the Psion to these as default. Set 
[f3] to SEND, type in the filename, 
set the Psion comms to receive file 
name and press [ENTER] on the 
PCW. At the end of file, the cursor 
will reappear at the bottom left 
corner of the screen indicating suc- 



cessful transfer. Press 
[CLEAR/ONI on the Psion and 
there you are. 

To transfer from the Psion set 
[O] to 'receive file', set the Psion 
to transfer required, press 
[ENTER) on the PCW and 
|EXE| on the Psion. The Psion 
beeps at the end of the transfer. 
Press [ALTHSTOP] and the 
transfer is complete. 

Derek Madge, Exeter, Devon 

8000 Plus: Just a reminder that 
you change the baud rate options 
with (ALT! V. 

MAIL232 is a very under- 
rated little utility, especially as it 
dimes free and with a hidden 
game - see Tipoffs last May. 
Incidentally, the instructions on 
how to use it are not in the CP/M 
handbook . hut in the manual that 
comes with the RS2M interface.

Basic questions 



1. How do you get a 
PROFILE.SUB file to load BASIC 
and then run a BASIC program? 

2. What memory' addresses are 
used to store the current printer 
position? Can they he poked in 
BASIC so I can advance the paper 
to the desired position? 

3. How do 1 change print quality in 
BASIC from draft to high print 
quality and vice versa? 

4. Pressing [EXTRA] (PTR[ gives 
a image of the screen - a "screen 
dump". Is there any way of getting 
this done by a BASIC program, by 
calling or poking some address? 

M Whalley, 

Warrington, Cheshire, 

and John McNaughton, 

Bexhill, E Sussex 

SOOOPlus: l.To load BASIC and 
then immediately run the program 
SPLAT.BAS sav. the line BASIC 



SPLAT should be in your PRO- 
FILE.SUB file. Typing this directly 
at the A> achieves the same effect. 

2. The best you can do is find out 
how far across the print head has 
gone - 1 don't think the number of 
lines travelled vertically is 
counted anywhere. But you don't 
need any poking. The command 
Y=LPQS(X) makes Y equal to the 
current position of the printer 
head. If it's at the extreme left it is 
I: at the extreme right it is 90. 
(Y=POS(X) is similar for the 
screen position). You can then use 
LPRINT SPC(Y-l) to go to that 
position. 

3. This routine should help volt: 
10 LPRINT "This is draft" 

20 LPRINT CHR$(27)+"ml " 
30 LPRINT "This is high quality" 
40 LPRINT CHRS(27)+"m0" 
50 LPRINT "This is draft again" 
(Of course it won't have any effect 
onaPCmsn.) 

4. Sorry, don't know this one 
either -I'm asking for help a gain I 



Phantom printer 



My printer prints on LocoScript 
but not with CP/M, just showing 
'No printer' when I press [PTRJ. 
Why? 

Mrs Pamela McDonald, 
Huddersfield 



8000 Plus: Check the other 
obvious' things like connections 
at the back, and make a new copy 
ofCPIM (it's possible from our 
experience that a corrupted disc 
won't recognise the printer). 
Finally try putting the cursor over 
the message 'No printer' and 
pressing /+/. 



Pin money 



1 seem to be having a little diffi- 
culty with my printer - at a guess, 
misfiring pins in the printer head. 
My computer is outside the period 
of guarantee. How can I clean the 
pins? 

Kenneth ,) Dickson, 
Edinburgh 

8000 Plus: If your printer were 
still under guarantee I'd say take 
it back and change it. but as it 
isn't, you may as well hare a go 
at fixing the dodgy pin (you 
guessed correctly). Here's the 
general procedure for fixing a 
printer that is misfiring. 

The first solution is to adjust 
the pressure of the printer head. 
Lift off the black plate with 
'Amstrad' on it and find the red 
or blue plastic knob at the right 
hand side. Adjust the pressure 
setting until the tops and 
bottoms reappear. 

If your tops and bottoms are 
still faint try printing a wordy 
document with the printer rib- 
bon removed on a sheet of paper 
which has vertical stripes of 
WD40 one inch thick on it. 
The print head picks up WD40 
from the stripes and deposits 
the grime off the head onto the 
bits in between. 

You can try applying WD40 
direct to the printer head to clean 
it. The printer head ran he easily 
removed by gently prising off the 
metal retaining plate lying over 
the flat ribbon cable behind the 
head assembly. The head is then 
slipped away from the roller and 
lifted out. Spray on the WD40. 
wipe off the excess with a tissue 
and if a good dousing of the print 
head with WD40 only resuscitates 
your printer for a short while, the 
only real remedy may well be to 
clean the pins on the printer them- 
selves. Be warned, this is not easy 
and could take a few hours if you 



get your pins mixed up, so don't 
do it unless your printer really is 
getting ropey! 

With the print head still teth- 
ered to the printer by its copper 
braid , lake a small crosshead 
watchmaker's screwdriver (if you 
can't borrow one, they cost 
around £5) and remove the four 
tiny bolts from the printing side of 
the head. Keeping the metal 
striker pan of the print head 
uppermost (black plastic and 
printing face downwards) care- 
fully ease the metal striker part 
away from the black plastic hous- 
ing holding the pins. Put the black 
plastic piece on the table with the 
printing face downwards. 

Note the position of the pin 
tails on a circular diagram - this 
is essential. It's vital to keep the 
pins in exactly the same order as 
you removed them. They all have 
different shaped tails though this 
isn't obvious until after you've 
removed them. With a pair of eye- 
brow tweezers, carefully withdraw 
the pins and lay them on a circle. 
Remove the return leaf springs 
ring. It has a small protrusion 
which slots into a matching slot 
on the plastic case so you can't 
put it hack in the wrong position. 
Beneath the leaf springs ring, 
there's another packer ring which 
exactly matches the leaf springs 
ring. Beneath that is a fibre 
washer to stop dust. 

Douse the plastic printing 
head and particularly the fine 
slots in which the pins slide 
with lots of WD 40 - old printers 
will have an amazing amount of 
muck there. 

Reassembly is the reverse 
procedure. The whole procedure 
can take as little as thirty minutes 
(so long as you don't lose any of 
the pins!). For testing, printing in 
draft makes it easy to see which 
pin is playing up, and after clean- 
ing, printing a few pages in NLQ 
without the ribbon in place will 
work off excess solvent. 



However as yoo Have probably goessed by 
difficulty wttB my printer and; at a gQ 
Read. £11 prtntoat from my macBlne s< 
character, I am enable to find any advice 
magazine m recent issues; one gentlemaf 
nis dealer ween Be wrote in wttn a pro' 
ctnable to do tnis since ny dealer nas 
compoter is now oatwitn its period of j 
pins are dirty ^clogged op? If so; cow 



If your printer is doing this and is out of guarantee, you'] 
have to pin your hopes on fixing it yourself

Tipoffs 



The Loco File 



The two- file editing setup as 
suggested by the Rev, Komor in 
March's Tipoffs provides the 
useful basis for a free text database 
in which to store quotes, notes 
and other variable- length data. 
Since LocoFile can match a 
string anywhere within its records 
- it isn't restricted to serachmg 
within a specified field as are 
many other databases - retrieval 
is simple. Just one key word or 
phrase can be sufficient to locate 
a lengthy quotation. However, 
the FIND facility within 
LocoFile is limited to one match 
per record and so where there are 
several occurrences of the search 
string it may be worthwhile to 
extract lengthy notes and use 
LocoScript's normal FIND to root 
them all out. 

Data entry in LocoFile, even 
on M, can be a very tedious busi- 
ness when entries run to more than 



a sentence or two. It is far quicker, 
and less frustrating, to type 
lengthy items either into a 
LocoScript file which can be 
saved to a block and pasted in, or 
into a LocoMail file and entered 
using LocoFile 's insert data facil- 
ity under [fl]. 

The LocoMail setup for this 
is very simple: a listing of all the 
LocoMail item names, each fol- 
lowed by a [RETURN) or other 
separator, the final name ending 
with a new page ([ALT] 
[RETURN]) or UNIT. For 
instance, if the final layout for a 
LocoFile free-text record card is 
Subject (1 line) Reference (1 line) 
Text (60 lines) then the setup for 
the LocoMail file must be Subject 
(RETURN] Reference [RETURN] 
Text [ALT] [RETURN] 
Remember that colons will con- 
fuse LocoMail and that you 
should enter the appropriate sepa- 
rator for empty fields. 

Mary Warren, 
Stroud, Gloucs 



Ms MOP 



Mini Office's very useful spread- 
sheet program is supposed to have 
a maximum of 255 rows or 
columns per spreadsheet. 

Actually the practical 
maximum seems to be just under 
half of this figure at 1 22. 
However, the default is set at 
100 and with each insertion the 
number increases until a maxi- 
mum of 1 22 is reached, when the 
system locks in both directions: 
you can add rows or columns but 
not insert them. 

The solution is simple: this is 
what to do. Change the setting in 
'Alter spreadsheet' back to 100 
(or whatever value you wish, just 
as long as it's greater than the 
number in use). 

The system is freed and the 
additional lines or columns can be 
inserted. 

Mary Warren, 
Stroud, Gloucs 



Both sides now 



Here's the simplest way of 
printing on both sides of your 
continuous stationery while still 
preserving the page numbers. It 
involves two print runs and gives 
you two copies of the manuscript, 
of course. 

When inserting allow a lead 
run of two blank sheets, then print 
the document. Remove and turn 
over, re- insert and leave just one 
sheet blank The result should be 
like this: 

Sheet A blank/blank 

Sheet B blank/pl 

Sheet C pl/p2 

Sheet D p2/p3 and so on. 

Taking sheets C, E. G etc. 
will give a perfectly paginated set. 
Sheets B, D, F etc. will be cor- 
rectly paged, but with odd pages 
on the left - good enough for most 
purposes 1 

W Lampard, 
Radlett, Herts 



Loads of sheets 



I am being driven crazy by a 
problem in the otherwise excel- 
lent Protext with my PCW9512 
and sheet feeder. When I change 
the ruler line in a document, the 
header on the second and subse- 
quent pages is thrown drasti- 
cally to the right. Why? 

Steve Evans, 
Halesowen, West Midlands 

8000 Plus: Despite a few trials 
I couldn't get this problem (with 
Protext v2.23). It could be a 
bug in your version (ring Arnor 
on 0733 68909) or maybe 
you've done something funny in 
the stored commands. Any 
thoughts, anyone? 



Do you copy 



The use of handwriting (pencil) 
carbon paper, rather than 
typists 's carbon, gives good 
sharp copies with a dot 
matrix printer. 

Mary Warren, 
Stroud, Gloucs 



Sdrawkcab rekciuq 



In LocoScript, if you want to 
cut text from a long document 
by marking out a block and 
using [CUT], it's quickest if you 
do it backwards. 

Mark Titchener, 
Wimborne, Dorset 



Catching BAS 



In BASIC if you save a program 
the extension BAS is assumed: if 
you type SAVE "SAM 
[RETURN] then you end up with 
SAM.BAS on the disc. This can 
be changed by the following 
commands: 
POKE 7542,n 
POKE 7543,n 
POKE 7544,n 

where n is 65 if you want A, 66 
for B and so on. So, if you 
wanted to make every program 
be saved with the extension ZAP 
you'd have the three commands: 
POKE 7542,90 
POKE 7543.65 
POKE 7544,80 

Mark Titchener, Dorset 



Flipping game 



Scrabble is one of the best games 
on the PCW and the implementa- 
tion is very good, but... 

Is there a way of leaving 
Scrabble with [SHIFT] [EXTRA] 
[EXIT] instead of having to turn 
the machine off and on again? 

Further, can I get Flipper to 
work with Scrabble? It seems to 
ignore [SHIFT] [EXTRA] [EXIT1 
so won't 'flip'. I'd like this so 1 
can flip out of Scrabble back to a 
spreadsheet in CP/M when my 
boss comes! 

And why does it insist on 
telling me what it's thinking even 
though 1 told it not to? 

Dave Rogers, 
Shrewsbury 



8000 Plus: Yes. vou can get 
[SHlFTj (EXTRA! [EXITj to work, 
but it's a bit hit and miss. 

In Scrabble, select option I to 
quit a game and print it. Put a 
piece of paper into the printer. 
When the printer status line conies 
up at the bottom it 're-enables the 
interrupts', which in plain English 
means that [SHIFT) [EXTRA} 
[EXIT] works again. Now you can 
reset the machine as usual. 

If you've set Flipper up to run 
two CPlMs you can now flip out of 
Scrabble. But don't blame me if. 
when you try to flip back to 
Scrabble from Flipper, yon get a 
continuous beep! 

The thinking business is a bug 
in Scrabble which, unfortunately, 
we're stuck with. Can any hackers 
out there help us?

Software Guide 





^^^^^ 


^^^^^ 


These pages provide a guide to the best software around 
for the Amstrad PCW. Published in three monthly parts, 
this time it's the turn of Spreadsheets, Games and 
Graphics to face the ultimate test. We've set out to test 
every piece of software we could lay our hands on, and to 
give you enough information to decide which program is 
the one you might be looking for. 

The selection isn't comprehensive, but the software 
listed here represents what we think is the best of that 
currently available. As well as a brief summary of what 
they do, there are the main Plus and Minus points for each 
program - Piuses have a ▲ by them, Minuses a ▼. 

Most of the packages mentioned throughout this guide 
should run on all three models of the PCW - unless, of 
course, we have stated otherwise.

tf a database replaces an address book, 
then a spreadsheet replaces the back of 
an old envelope. It is really an electronic 
piece of paper which allows you to jot 
down numbers, juggle them around and 
analyse the cost benefits of a situation. 
Vital for businesses, spreadsheets can be 
useful to home users too: if you want a 
bank loan you will find that showing your 
bank manager a spreadsheet printout of 
your living expenses answers a lot of 
questions! 

A typical spreadsheet has a grid 
of rows and columns. This grid forms 
a screenful of cells identified by their 
column and row numbers, e.g. A3, 
K36 etc. Each cell can contain a simple 
number, some text to make the page 
easier to read, or a formula telling the 
spreadsheet to work out a number using 
values from elsewhere. The power of 
spreadsheets is in this last category, for- 
mulae. You can make a cell's value 
depend on the value of cells above it, 
or to the left of it, and this value is then 
automatically updated if changes are 
made to the other cells. 

So how do you choose between 
the various spreadsheets? One difference 
is sheet size, i.e. the number of cells 
you are allowed to work with. You'll 
need a few hundred for home 
use, and 1000 or more for business 
use. Another area is the range of formu- 
lae that you can use - all spreadsheets 
allow simple column and row totalling, 
but with some you can get complex 
statistical analyses too. As with all soft- 
ware, think very carefully what you will 
need before choosing. 



Mini Office 
Professional Plus 

£49.95 < Database Software • 0625 878888 

Mint Office is a suite of five integrated programs - 
database, word processor, graphics module, comms 
package, and a very good spreadsheet Broadly similar lo 
SuperCalc in operation with usual features of auto or 
manual recalculation, replicating of rows/columns, powerful 
range of arithmetic functions etc. Printout is a strong 
point - rowsfcolumns can be put into itatic/botd etc, and prints 
draft. NLQ or even sideways! Cant sort end can't just save 
data or structure of a spreadsheet, but maximum size of 
spreadsheet is claimed to be 320k. You can use the data 
from a spreadsheet in the graphics module directly- The 
manual is, however, pretty useless. 

PLUSES ■ MINUSES

firmly in mind, including statistical functions. The screen 
layout is totally defined by the user, and cell value 
calculations can almost be full programs. e.gDO... WHILE. 
ft might prove loo complex if alt you want is simple spread- 
sheet operations. The screen messages are very helpful 
though. Turbo is claimed lo be faster than Cracker 2_though 
sometimes isn't noticeably so.

most out of it 

▼ Free workspace is on the small side (1 7k) although memory 
is used efficiently 




SuperCalc 

£69.95 ■ Amsc 




The best selling spreadsheet officially endorsed by Amstrad. 
SuperCalc 2 is broadly similar to Scratchpad Plus, but it has a 
smaller workspace and is less flexible about the allowed 
spreadsheet dimensions. 
You can store sequences of commands for repetitive 



calculations. Price includes VAT and p&p. 
PLUSES 'MINUSES 

A Excellent manual - sections for beginners 

end experts.

First Calc 

£29.95 ■ Minerva Systems • 0392 437756 

Touted as a quick and simple to use program for the begin- 
ner, this is nevertheless quite a powerful spreadsheet, with a 
large capacity, ability to replicate formulae, expert etc. Really 
it's not vastly more user-friendly than the rest bul £ 
value package all the same. 

PLUSES • MINUSES 



A A lot of program for the moH

ate and store diagrams and drawings on 
disc, to be amended, adjusted or printed 
out at will. 

There are three main types of graph- 
ics package: art, technical drawing and 
graph plotting programs, in art packages 
the emphasis is on designs and pictures, 
with freehand drawing facilities, a selec- 
tion of pretty text fonts and a variety of 
patterns to fill areas with. These are 
made much more effective and easier to 
use if you have a mouse. 

Technical drawing packages concen- 
trate on shapes, such as squares and 
polygons, lines and labels. Finally graph

pictures, sending the digitised result to disc. You can 
then use the pictures in desktop publications or in 
other graphics packages, such as Master Paint. Very 
useful for newtsetter production but the claims for Master 
Scan as a tow-cost tax machine are grandiose - the quality 
of scanned text is poor if the text is anything h 
headline size.

The choice of games for the PCW is far 
from extensive in comparison with what is 
on offer for other machines. However, the 
range is widening, and the split between 
text-only adventures and graphics-based 
games is becoming more even. Text- 
based games rely heavily on the use of 
parsers, which help you navigate an 
adventure by analysing words individually, 
and pointing you in the right direction with 
clues in the results of their findings. The 
ability of a parser is. not surprisingly, 
responsible for the success or failure of a 
game; bad parsing can ruin an adventure. 
Where graphics are concerned, quality, 
originality and speed are on the increase. 
What is on display here represents the 
best of the games currently available for 
the PCW. Each game is given marks out 
of five for its various features.

"The AgendA has

wouldn't be without it!" 

Gunter Wittenberg,

"Microwriter say that you will

Redressing the balance 

[ wrile in reply to your review of 
Cashmaster in the May issue (44). 

While 1 agree on the whole with 
your review, Mr Frost argues that 
Cashmaster will accept non-existent 
dates such as 3 1st February and April, 
but I'm afraid this just isn't true. If his 
copy does, then I'd certainly be inter- 
ested to see it. 1 agree with the point 
about it being rather too easy to delete 
entries and so this has been improved - 
as has the profit and loss report. 

There will also shortly be a save 

and continue option. I'm sorry he had 
such a downer on the manual. Has he 
ever thought of flippancy as a virtue, 
and that life is just too short to be oth- 
erwise. It has, however, often been 
said that the programmer shouldn't 
write the manual - guilty as charged. 
Actually, I even printed it myself too. 

Martin Evans 
Programmer (Intraset Ltd) 

8000 Plus: Thanks for your letter. 



reaches a stage at which it can he con- 
structively reviewed, it remains one of 
the best database options around.

Hard Times 



Sorry folks, 1 don't like your new 
layout style very much. 

I used to mutter about the pink 
printing on purple background style at 
times, then put the blame on middle- 
aged vision, but the font selected for 
many of the articles now is a real 
problem. It has a spidery feel and is 
difficult to read. 

There are some improvements in 
layout: the 'Turf Luck' and 'Big 
Spender' articles are attractive to look 
at. but News Plus in particular is a mess. 

I suspect that someone has told 
you to be more serious; you haven't 
been bought out by Amstrad's accoun- 
tants, have you'.' 

Okay. 1 use my PCW fairly seri- 
ously, but I get enough technical and 
scientific literature to read in the office. 
Your magazine impresses with its con- 
tent; don't change that as well, will you? 
Mike Morrish 
Romsey, Hampshire 



I read with interest your reply to Dr 
Kays of Bristol about a database for 
recording photographic information. 

I totally agree with you about the 
suitability of LocoFile to do the job. 
As a newspaper photographer covering 
on average 1 ,500 jobs a year keeping 
.track of negatives can be a time-con- 
suming job. But with my own trusty 
PCW 8256. with memory upgrade, I 
can. in a flash, find the negative I need. 

Last March I did do a review of 
Fotocall for the publishers but, 
although, there were some good ideas 
in the suite of programs, I did find a 
few bugs in the programs and the 
' database was slow compared with 
LocoFile and not as flexible. 

Thanks for such an informative 
magazine. 1 look forward each month 
to seeing it on the newsagents' shelves. 
Tony Stocks 
Sutton in Vsh field 

8000 Plus: Of course, LocoFile isn't 
the only alternative. But until Fotocall 




Magnifying the problem 

1 dashed back to the office at lunchtime 
to make time for a quick browse 
through my June issue of 8000 Plus 
before the boss returned (I've tried to 
read 8000 Plus when he's around but 
there is a tendency for it to 'walk'). 

Picture my disappointment when I 
discovered that the free gift was miss- 
ing from my copy, I asked my 
newsagent but she just shook her head, 
although she did suggest the optician 
next door might have one. 

No, the optician doesn't take 8000 
Plus ( well, he might do) but he does 
sell magnifying glasses. 

I have been an 8000 Plus reader 
since issue one (about the same time as 
we got our Amstrad at work) and the 
magazine was partly responsible for the 
purchase of my own Amstrad a few 
months later. 

So, as you can imagine, with my 
full-time job and my part-time writing 
aspirations I spend a great deal of lime 
'squinting' between the two machines 
and now the same applies to my 
favourite magazine. 

Joking apart. 8000 Plus is still 
my favourite, and the benefits of a 
smaller typeface are obvious in terms 
of content, but I don't think my eyes 
could stand too much white on black 
in that size. 

Carol Balkham 
Bedfordshire 



8000 Plus: And we thought we were 
doing you all a favour, Still, you may 
have noticed that, although we've 
stayed with the Times serif typeface (ie. 
the letters hai'e little squiggly hits at 
the top and hoi torn I this month we've 
made it bigger in an effort to vanquish 
once and for all those pesky spiders. 

As for your conjectures, Mr 
Morrish, I'm afraid we don't have any- 
thing to do with Amstrad apart from 
the fact that we write about their per- 
sonal computer: and I can assure you 
that we haven't been bought out by- 
anyone, either. Maybe you're confus- 
ing us with another magazine.

Filing system 



Having read your rave review of 
Lindcx (December 1989), I decided to 
invest in a copy of the program. 
Organisation of LocoScript files has 
never been my strong point - 1 rarely 
used the Identify Text facility - but 
now. thanks to Lindex. I no longer 
spend frustrating hours searching for 
the file I need. The program is every- 
thing you said: easy to install and oper- 
ate, absolutely invaluable, and 
extremely good value. I wholeheart- 
edly recommend it to any LocoScript 
user, even to those who think their 
discs are already well -organised. 

PS: Although Festival Software 
Services is also based in Bradford, this 
is an entirelv unsolicited testimonial; I 



85 h\y% 8000 PLUS 



am in no way connected with the Vicar 
of the Church who is raising money for 
Charity through the sale of Lindex. 

Pamela J Hill 
Bradford 

8006 Plus: If you've read la.il month's 
issue, you'll know dial Festival 
Software Services have just released an 
upgrade to Lindex called, funnily 
enough. Super/index. The main differ- 
ence between this program and its pre- 
decessor is that it can handle non- 
LacoScript files as welt. Have a read of 
the June issue for further information. 
AH proceeds continue to go to charity. 



Talking trio 



First of all I do apologise for my poor 
English, as I have no practice since 
ages. I would be very grateful if you 
could let me have some information. Is 
there any possibility of converting 720K 
discs to 1 80K discs? 

I now use a PCW 95 1 2 and my 
sons are using the PCW 8256 and 8512. 
They arc at a boarding school and we 
used to communicate by exchanging 
discs, but with my new 9512 it seems 
not to be possible any more. There is 
only the program copy 80(1) and we 
need it the other way round. 
Many thanks for your kind attention. 

Peter Rohricht 
Railtienhach, Germany 

8000 Plus: What you need is Three Inch 
Software's 9512 Rescue Kit. Put simply, 
what this does is enable the 9512 to for- 
mal and write to low capacity discs 
which can then be read either by an 
8256 or an 8512. In other words, it 
provides the second half of the 8000 
COPY facility you mentioned. The 
Rescue Kit costs £9.95: talk to Three 
Inch Software on 081 5462754. 

Building bricks 

I hope you will be able to help me. Nik 
Holmes of Creative Technology recom- 
mended you. I am a builder and run a 
PCW 8512 using LocoScript, Money 
Manager and McGregor estimating soft- 
ware as advertised in your magazine. 
1 have recently been thinking of 
obtaining software for the purpose of 
drawing building plans. Do you know 
of any that would run on my machine or 
would 1 have to upgrade it. If so, with 
what? Or do I simply have to buy a 
complete new outfit? I have Micro 
Design II but it's not quite what I need. 
A Blackwell 
Salisbury 

8000 Plus: 7>* PCW 'Draw from HTR 
Computing (0794 516279). It costs 
£39.95 and was first reviewed in the 
magazine in the July '89 issue, page 41. 

Exploding myths 



First, let's get the bouquets and brick- 
bats out of the way. 1 must congratulate 



Dave Gregg on his extremely useful 
article demystifying programming and 
making the PCW a time-saver for really 
boring chores. His program for arrang- 
ing appointments and sending memos is 
ideal for anyone who has to run an ama- 
teur theatre company or an orchestra. I 
hope to spot more useful tips in the 
months to come. 

Now a plea for a bit of advice. I 
have a single disc drive 95 1 2 and, in my 
work, it would be useful to have a 
portable of some sort to type upto 
10.000 words of text and then be able to 
load it into my machine at home and 
edit it, so I was interested in the piece on 
the Atari Portfolio. 

Seeking more advice. I went to my 
friendly neighbourhood computer shop 
and they took a deep breath and said: 
"Ooh, can't be done. Impossible that. 
There's nothing on the market that will 
talk to a 95 1 2." 

So is there or isn't there? And if 
there is, who do 1 talk to to find out 
more about it? 

i suppose it's inevitable that 1 sign 
off saying that the magazine is essential 
reading matter.. .Keep up the good work. 
Guy Morgan 
York 

8000 Plus: It rather sounds like you've 
been fed a line of nonsense. You can port 
data files from the AgendA to the 9512 in 
exactly the same way as to an 8000 series 
machine. Read pages 34 and 35 of our 
February issue to find out how. 

Who's sexist now? 

Racism is surely racism, ageism surely 
ageism, baldism surely bald ism and 
sexism surely sexism even when 
practised by blacks, wrinklies, baldies 
or women (Actually. I am male, black, 
bald and 68). 

Your Chauvinist Dig in May's 8000 
Plus gave a boost to 'The World's 
Who's Who of Women." Surely the title 
of this tome is most sexist. Just imagine 
if 'Who's Who' was changed to "Who's 
Who (Women Excluded)', what an out- 
cry there would be! 

Even my name seems to offend 
some people! 

PS: Stanley Baldwin also had trouble 
with the hirsute. 

Manley Whiteman 
Luton 

8000 Plus: Point taken, Mr Whiteman. 
We published this story really just to 
show that a body of people are prepared 
to take some sort of stand against sex- 
ism - regardless of whether it is male or 
female-oriented - in the computer indus- 
try, Naturally, it's a cause that we 
endorse: unfortunately, we can't answer 
for other industries. Maybe you should 
write to the book's publishers.' 

Those of you who would like to 
find out more about OASIS (the 
Organisation Against Sexism in 
Software) should write to them at 3

Accounting to taste 

We have been using a PCW 85 1 2 for the 
past four years and have subscribed to 
8000 Plus since issue 1 in 1986. 

In that time, your software reviews 
have been used to assist in our purchas- 
ing decisions. 

Comix Software are our main 
accounting and invoicing programs. We 
felt that a word or praise from an end 
user of their simple and reliable pro- 
grams might be of benefit to any 
small business that requires an 
uncomplicated and we 1 1 -documented 
accounting system. We have found the 
programs very easy to use with a really 
superb hot line support. 

Perhaps you may find the forego- 
ing of interest when you next look at 
accounting and invoicing software. 

8000 Plus is an invaluable source 
of reliable information for those of us 
who were only dimly aware of what PIP 
and side 2 of the CP/M disc was for. 

Andrew Phillips 
Minehead 

8000 Plus: Thanks very much for your 
letter, Andrew. We've always been very 
impressed with the software that Cor nix 
produce; it's always easy to use, wry 
professionally presented and excellently 
documented. I think you'll find that we 
featured the program you're talking 
about on our 'best in PCW accounting' 
spread on pages IS and 19 of the 
May issue. We agree: it's a cracker. 

Which upgrade? 

With my 8256, 1 got a copy of Mini 
Office Professional which I soon got the 
hang of so I decided to send away for 
llie Spellcheeker upgrade to help with 
my app.. apau.. apiling.. terrible 
spelling. After several weeks of wait- 
ing, my cheque was returned, with a 
message stating that Database Software 
were having technical problems, and s< 
were unable to supply the desired item. 

Not to be put off 1 decided to invest 
in LocoScript 2 with LocoSpell. Having 
received this parcel of goodies not a 
week ago. and reading through the pile* 
of literature that accompanied the discs, 
it seems that if 1 want to be able to use 
the dictionary properly, I will need a 
memory upgrade. 

Here is my question. Having avidly 
scanned your magazines, I have discov- 
ered three possible alternatives: 
I )Fit a new disc drive to create a drive B 
2)Install a memory upgrade 
3)Buy a SCA plug-in Rampac 
I would prefer not to have to take my 
8256 apart, so am leaning towards the 
Rampac. Would, do you think, this be 
the best possible option open to me? 
I would value your advice and help 
on this matter.

Your magazine, 8000 Plus, is excellent 
for PCW owners like me bui, how 
about putting the subscription expiry 
dale on the address label? The first a 
subscriber knows that it has expired is 
when no current copy arrives and up 
here in the frozen north, you can't be 
sure of gelling one on the magazine 
racks of Ihe high street booksellers. 

DM VlacDonald 
Glasgow 

8000 Plus: Why not indeed.' Sounds 
like a good idea: Til pass your letter 
on to the department concerned. 



8000 Plus: Following the publication 
of Ashley's letter last month, we've 
received loads of letters just like yours. 
Consequently, next month sees the start 
of a brand new Cracker II tutorial 
series. Sit light, everybody, and we'll do 
our best to try and answer all of your 
questions. 

Video star 

Regarding the letter by David 
Bylheway (Postscript June 1990) there 
is a way he can use his PCW to put text 
onto videos. The Rombo V1DI 
Dig iiiser offers facilities for taking 
screens designed on a desktop publisher 
and allowing them to be recorded onto 
video via lhc Video In/Out sockets of 
its interface. It is not possible lo just 
write a small portion of the screen leav- 
ing the rest of the picture intact but 
whole title screens can look quite effec- 
tive (even if they are in black and 
while) especially if good quality fonts 
and clip-art are used. 

Rombo VID1 Digitiser available 
for around £79 from Rombo 
Productions, 6 Fairbaim Road, Kirkton 
North, Livinston, Scotland EH54 6TS, 
telephone 0506 414631. 

The digiliser comes complete with 
several software converters to allow 
output from most desktop publishers to 
be converted to VID1 files. 

Peter Whelerlon

8000 Plus: Thanks for the information.

I read the letter from Ashley Hood in 
issue 45 and was prompted by it to 
write with my experience. I bought 
Cracker II from your good selves about 
six weeks ago. As yet, 1 have not man- 
aged to do any of ihe things it purports 
lo be able lo do. Mainly because of the 
way the manual has been written. 
Apart from grammatical errors of 
which we are all al times guilty, it is 
very difficult lo follow, and gives few 

step by step examples. 

What is needed is a book like JM 
Hughes "All in One Business 
Computing" only written with Cracker 

II in mind. Articles in your magazine 
might help, but one has to wail ages lo 

lave the subject covered. 1 have written 
twice to Paperback and gel no replies.

Cross words 



Part of Russel Ntmmo's letter (issue 45, 
June 1990) asked if there was a cross- 
word making program available. 1 have 
recenlly written a program that may be 
what lie is looking for. 

The program allows Ihe user to 
state the height and width of the grid and 
creates an empty grid of thai size with a 
flashing cursor. The cursor can be posi- 
tioned using the arrow keys to anywhere 
in ihe grid. As characters are typed on 
the keyboard, they are entered on the 
grid. The cursor can be commanded to 
move down or across automatically. 
Other functions are included to change 
ihe dimensions of the grid or remove let- 
ters from the grid. The finished grid can 
be saved to disc for later recall. 

1 have also written a program to 
load and print ihe designed crossword 
grid on the doi matrix printer. It auto- 
matically adds the clue numbers. A 
separate program prints the blank grid 
and the list of answers. All programs 
are written in C and compiled to stand- 
alone COM files. 

If anyone sends me a blank disc 
with a stamped self -addressed enve- 
lope, I will dump the programs on one 
side (Ardrive only). 1 hope this answers 
Russel's request. 

Alan Baker 
Bournemouth 

8000 Plus: Thanks for that, Alan. Don't 



forget, as we did last month, that Brian 
Thurston (of Thurston Techniques 
fame) has produced a program called 
XWorder (£14.95) for any PCW, which 
allows you to compile crosswords in 
LocoScript I or 2. For further informa- 
tion, talk to Brian Thurston on 0395 
277496. 

Speaking volumes 

I own an Amstrad PCW 8256 and L 
would like to learn Mallard BASIC. 
But there is a problem with this. The 
BASIC manual is like reading an 
unknown foreign language! Can you 
recommend another manual which 
would be an easier guide to learning 
Mallard BASIC? 

Deanne Lewis 
Essex 

8000 Plus: The two best buys for new 
programmers in Mallard BASIC are /) 
Program Your PCW! by Ian Sinclair 
(£8.50 from Glentop 1071 953 9292}) 
or 2) Mallard BASIC For the Amstrad 
PCW8256/85I2 and PCW95I2from 
Locomotive Software (0306 740606). 
That one costs £9.95. 

Hubble, bubble 

In reply to your comment on the letter 
'Science Report' (page 88, June issue), 
I would like lo remind you of a piece of 
software produced by me. Slickfit is a 
method of drawing diagrams of chemi- 
cal apparatus using clip-art drawn in 
Stop Press. Having said that, at least 
one of my customers uses the clip art 
within MicroDesign. 

Gerald Ponting 
Easlleigh, Hampshire 

8000 Plus: Thanks for your letter. 
Gerald. Slickfit costs £12.50 and can 
be obtained from Mr Pouting at 7 
Weavers Place, Chandler's Ford, 
EastleighS05 ITU.

A 




Fa *w4mM PC* ISfiUfiia 



jjible Society 



nyone who has read lasl month's 8000 
Plus will know just how impressed we 
were with Bible Society Software's new 
software release for the PCW - Bibliotee. The first 
ever New Testament to be committed to two 3 inch 
discs just for the PCW takes its text from The Good 
News Bible; it also has full concordance. This 
means that not only is the bible text easy to read 
and understand (The Good News Bible uses 
everyday modern English), the program can also 
carry out very detailed searches on particular words 
(complete with locational and/or thematic refer- 
ences) very quickly indeed. 

As if that weren't enough, Bible Society 
Software have incorporated into the program an 
unusual but eminently useful graph facility. An 
Absolute bar chart shows you how many times a 
specific word crops up throughout the twenty- seven 
books that make up the New Testament; a Relative 
bar chart, on the other hand, illustrates the relation- 
ship between the number of occurrences of a partic- 
ular word and the size of the book in which they appear. This helps you distinguish 
which books are more closely concerned with a particular word or tenet of faith. 

So knocked out were we with Bibliotee that we awarded the package an almost 
unheard of 20 out of 20, And precisely because we know that so many of you out 
there are involved with bible study of one kind or another, we've decided, in 
conjunction with Bible Society Software, to give away a free Bibliotee program to 
the three lucky winners of this month's competition. Not surprisingly, it's got a 
distinctly biblical feel to it. All you have to do is ring the correct answers and send in 
your offerings on the back of a postcard to Bible Competition. 8000 Plus, 30 
Monmouth Street, Bath BAI 2XF before the 28th July 1990. Good luck! 

1 When was The Good News Bible first issued in the UK? 
A 1976 B 1980 C 1966 

2 What is the name of the Jewish holy book of instruction? 

A The Veda B The Talmud C The Koran 

3 Who wrote East of Eden? 

A Jeffrey Archer B Thomas A Kempis C John Steinbeck 

4 How long was the reign of Pope John Paul I? 

A 12 years B 33 days C 18 years 

5 In what language were the first New Testament manuscripts written? 
A Hebrew B Latin C Greek 



May winners 



Our congratulations go to William Boxley from Bath, PAG Goulborn from Felixstowe and John 
Kim an from London who correctly spotted who said what to win their ready-made library 
of three indispensable PCW titles; Locomotive Software's Mallard BASIC Reference and Introduction, 
erstwhile K(XM) Plus editor Rob Ainsley's Pretext - A PCW User's Guide and, finally. Easily 
into LocoScript by Susan Rogers. 

The answers are as follows: 
Benjamin Disraeli, Sir Richard Steele, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy and, lastly, Francis Bacon. 



Next month 

Hold the line! 

Don't miss the second part of our 
comms special; we will be taking a 
brief look at all the comms software 
available for your PCW and 
working out which represent the 
best value for money. This month 
we've logged on to bulletin boards; 
next month we'll be tackling that 
all-encompassing subject of E-mail. 
What is it exactly and what's in it 
for you? We find out. 

The PCW way to WPM 

Are you interested in tidying up 
your keyboard act? Or maybe 
you're just fed up of hobbling 
your way, two-fingered, across the 
keys. Either way, despair no 
longer. Next month, we will be 
putting the three best typing tutors 
currently available on the PCW 
market through their respective 
paces and working out which one is 
the most guaranteed to have you 
tapping the light fantastic across 
those letters in as short a time as 
possible. Buy next month's issue 
and find out how to go about it. 

Cracking good start 

Well, we asked you what you 
thought of it and you didn't hesitate 
to let us know. Next month sees the 
start of an apparently long-awaited 
Cracker 2 tutorial series. So, if you 
suspect that you may be in need of 
a spreadsheet, but you're not sure 
which one, read all about the PCW 
spreadsheet with the high resolution 
graphics - from the August issue. 

Well, well well 

Interested in calculating your eligi- 
bility for any of the means-tested 
benefits like Family Credit, Income 
Support, Rent Rebate or last, but 
by no means least, the good 
old Community Charge Benefit? 
Well, the good news is that the 
Evesham Welfare Benefits Program 
have recently released their five- 
year-old workhorse - of the same 
name - for use on PCWs. We're, 
warning you now: it's not cheap, 
but it does show you how to work 
out your entitlement for the Poll 
Tax Transitional Relief. Next 
month's review reveals all.
