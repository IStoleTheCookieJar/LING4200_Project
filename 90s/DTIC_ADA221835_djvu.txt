Abstract 

Resonant  multiphoton  ionization  of  laser  desorbed  non-volatile  samples  has  been 
achieved  in  a  Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  mass  spectrometer  (FTICR).  The 
detection  of  iron  at  the  100  parts-per-million  doping  level  in  an  InP  compound 
semiconductor  sample  and  the  production  of  molecular  ions  for  a  hexapeptide  have  been 
observed  in  a  modified  FTICR  analyzer  cell.  A  unique  three  laser  experiment  has  been 
devised  in  which  infrared  multiphoton  dissociation  of  laser  desorbed  dipeptide  ions, 
formed  by  resonant  multiphoton  ionization  of  laser  desorbed  neutrals,  is  performed.

Introduction 

Multiphoton  ionization  (MPI)  (1-3)  of  neutral  molecules  has  been  widely  studied  in 
recent  years  as  high-powered  pulsed  lasers  with  tunable  output  in  the  ultraviolet 
wavelength  range  have  become  commercially  available.  Both  resonant  (REMPI)  and  non¬ 
resonant  MPI  can  be  used  to  ionize  species  of  interest,  with  the  former  yielding 
wavelength-selective  formation  of  (primarily)  parent  ions  at  low  laser  power,  and  increasing 
numbers  of  fragment  ions  as  the  laser  power  is  increased.  At  high  laser  powers  non¬ 
resonant  MPI  can  be  used  to  produce  ionization  from  all  molecules  present  in  the  focal 
volume  of  the  laser,  although  wavelength  selectivity  is  sacrificed  and  far  fewer  parent  ions 
are  usually  formed  (4,5).  The  use  of  MPI  to  ionize  neutral  molecules  which  have  been 
desorbed  from  solid  surfaces  has  been  shown  to  be  a  powerful  analytical  technique  by 
several  groups.  In  this  approach  the  ability  to  separate  the  desorption  and  ionization 
steps  and  the  advantages  of  MPI  outlined  above  have  resulted  in  unique  capabilities  for 
analysis  of  solid  samples. 

All  earlier  experiments  have  utilized  time-of-flight  (TOF)  mass  spectrometers  for 
mass  analysis,  because  these  pulsed  instruments  couple  well  with  the  pulsed  lasers  used 
for  laser  desorption  and  MPI.  The  groups  of  both  Grotemeyer  and  Schlag  (6,  7)  and 
Lubman  (8, 9)  have  used  a  supersonic  expansion  to  entrain  C02  laser-desorbed  neutrals 
before  MPI.  This  approach  helps  to  provide  a  spatially  well-defined  beam  of  neutrals  prior 
to  ionization  (enhancing  sensitivity  and  mass  resolution  when  using  TOF  ion  analysis)  and 
at  least  partially  cools  internal  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  neutral  molecules,  thus 
increasing  the  number  of  molecules  in  the  states  accessed  by  the  MPI  laser.  A  wide 
range  of  compounds,  including  many  of  biological  interest,  have  been  studied  by  these 
groups.  Zare  and  coworkers  (10,11)  tr  recently  used  a  similar  approach,  but  without 
supersonic  expansion  of  the  laser-desorl  neutrals,  to  analyze  carbonaceous  deposits 
in  meteorites. 

Our  laboratory  has  been  actively  engaged  in  coupling  lasers  (12-15)  to  Fourier 
transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  (FTICR)  mass  spectrometers  (16-20)  for  a  number  of 
years.  Of  particular  interest  are  the  direct  formation  of  ions  by  C02  laser  desorption 
(14,21-23),  and  the  use  of  a  second  laser  to  induce  fragmentation  of  these  ions  via 
infrared  multiphoton  dissociation  (IRMPD)  (14,20).  Since  FTICR  utilizes  pulsed  ion 


2 


formation  and  detection,  it  should  couple  with  (pulsed)  laser  desorption  of  neutral 
molecules  followed  by  (pulsed)  multiphoton  ionization  in  as  facile  a  manner  as  do  TOF 
mass  spectrometers. 

At  least  two  additional  advantages  should  be  realized  when  using  FTICR  mass 
analysis  to  study  ions  formed  by  MPI  of  laser-desorbed  neutrals.  The  first  is  much  higher 
resolution  than  is  possible  with  TOF  mass  spectrometers,  even  those  equipped  with 
reflectrons  (24).  The  highest  mass  resolution  of  any  type  of  mass  spectrometer  has  been 
routinely  demonstrated  (25)  by  FTICR  mass  spectrometers,  and  such  high  resolution  can 
often  be  valuable  in  distinguishing  ion  structures  of  the  same  nominal  mass  or  in 
separating  different  isotopes  of  certain  elements  which  overlap  in  mass.  A  second 
advantage  of  FTICR  mass  analysis  is  the  ability  to  subject  trapped  ions  to  further  analysis, 
studying  their  reactivity  in  ion/molecule  reactions  (26),  and/or  inducing  fragmentation  by 
collisional  (27)  or  photon  (28)  activation. 

While  to  our  knowledge  no  group  has  demonstrated  MPI  of  laser  desorbed  neutrals 
in  an  FTICR  mass  spectrometer,  several  have  reported  MPI  of  molecules  introduced  into 
the  ICR  mass  spectrometer  directly  in  the  gaseous  state  (29-31 ).  Laser  desorbed  neutrals 
have  been  ionized  by  methods  other  than  MPI,  such  as  electron  impact  (32)  and  chemical 
ionization  (33).  We  report  here  the  successful  MPI  formation  of  ions  from  laser  desorbed 
neutral  molecules  in  a  FTICR  mass  spectrometer.  Ions  formed  in  this  way  can  be 
detected  using  the  high  mass  resolution  capabilities  of  the  FTICR  technique.  We  have 
also  exploited  the  ability  to  subject  the  ions  produced  and  trapped  in  this  manner  to  laser 
photodissociation  in  a  unique  3-laser  experiment  in  which  a  third  (gated,  continuous- 
wave  (cw)  C02)  laser  has  been  used  to  dissociate  small  oligopeptide  ions. 


Experimental  Section 

The  Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  mass  spectrometer  used  in  this 
work  consisted  of  a  Nicolet  (34)  FTMS-1000  data  system,  a  prototype  Nicolet  2.0  tesla 
magnet  and  a  home-built/assembled  vacuum  system  (this  system  is  described  in  detail 
in  Reference  35).  The  main  vacuum  chamber  was  a  15  cm  inside  diameter  (id)  stainless 
steel  cylinder  which  was  mounted  inside  the  20  cm  bore  of  the  2.0  tesla  superconducting 
magnet.  Two  oil  diffusion  pumps  (36),  with  pumping  speeds  of  700  L/s  and  300  L/s

were  used  to  evacuate  the  vacuum  chamber.  Multiple  windows  were  mounted  on  the  end 
flanges  to  facilitate  various  laser-related  experiments. 

Several  modifications  of  the  existing  FTMS-1000  analyzer  cell  were  necessary  in 
order  to  permit  entry  of  the  beams  from  more  than  one  laser  (see  Figure  1).  In  all 
experiments  an  excimer  laser  (37)  operating  in  the  pulsed  C02  mode  (10.6  /tm 
wavelength,  pulse  length  ca.  1  ns,  approximately  0.75  mJ/pulse  entering  the  vacuum 
chamber)  was  used  to  desorb  a  solid  sample  mounted  on  a  probe  tip  (38).  The  laser 
beam  passed  through  a  ZnSe  window  into  the  vacuum  chamber  and  was  focussed  by  a 
7.62  cm  focal  length  ZnSe  lens.  The  focussed  beam  entered  a  small  hole  in  the  front  trap 
plate  of  the  FTICR  cell,  traversed  the  cell  and  exited  the  back  trap  plate  through  a  1  cm 
diameter  mesh-covered  opening,  then  irradiating  the  sample.  Post-ionization  of  the 
neutrals  desorbed  by  the  first  laser  was  achieved  using  the  fourth  harmonic,  266  nm,  of 
a  Nd:YAG  laser  (39)  or  by  the  tunable  output  of  a  dye  laser  pumped  by  the  second 
harmonic  of  the  Nd:YAG  laser.  The  output  from  rhodamine  dyes  610  and  590  (40)  were 
doubled  to  obtain  wavelengths  between  305  and  280  nm.  The  UV  beam  entered  the 
vacuum  chamber  through  a  1  cm  sapphire  window  and  for  the  majority  of  the  studies 
passed  through  a  90°  fused  quartz  turning  prism  and  was  focussed  by  a  2.54  cm  focal 
length  cylindrical  lens  through  a  cut-out  section  of  the  machinable  ceramic  cell 
support/insulator  at  the  solids  probe  end  of  the  cell.  This  positioned  the  focal  point 
several  millimeters  from  the  probe  tip  and  directly  between  the  tip  and  the  cell. 
Alternatively,  some  early  studies  were  performed  by  passing  the  unfocussed  beam 
through  1  cm  diameter  holes  in  the  excite  plates  (similar  to  the  cw-laser  pathway  shown 
in  Figure  1),  thus  allowing  the  beam  to  travel  through  the  center  of  the  cell.  Typical  UV 
laser  pulse  energies  were  on  the  order  of  50-100  mJ/pulse  at  266  nm  and  5-10  mJ  for  the 
(tuned)  wavelengths  from  280  -  305  nm.  The  output  of  the  third  laser,  a  gated  cw-C02 
laser  (41),  also  entered  the  vacuum  chamber  through  a  ZnSe  window  and  was  turned  by 
a  plated  gold  mirror  mounted  to  one  of  the  excite  plates.  The  beam  entered  the  cell 
through  a  1 .25  cm  hole  and  reflected  from  the  opposite  (parallel)  plate,  giving  a  second 
pass  of  this  laser  beam. 

The  FTICR  pulse  sequence  employed  is  shown  schematically  in  Figure  2.  It  was 
necessary  to  adjust  the  pulse  sequence  to  a  period  of  989.5  ms  in  order  to  conform  to 


4 


the  triggering  requirements  of  the  Nd:YAG  laser.  Coupling  of  the  FTICR  electronics  and 
the  Nd:YAG  laser  was  accomplished  by  a  home-built  microcomputer  interface  (42).  Using 
this  program  it  was  possible  to  trigger  the  laser  q-switch  only  every  ninth  firing  of  the 
flashlamps,  thus  allowing  a  longer  FTICR  pulse  repetition  period  (which  corresponded  to 
a  rate  of  ca.  1  Hz  as  opposed  to  the  normal  10  Hz  laser  firing  repetition  rate)  and 
permitting  greater  freedom  in  designing  the  pulse  sequence  shown  in  Figure  2. 

The  pulsed  C02  laser  was  triggered  directly  after  a  quench  pulse  expelled  all  ions 
from  the  cell,  but  did  not  fire  until  an  additional  44.1  ms  after  triggering  due  to  internal 
timing  constraints.  After  pulsed  laser  desorption  of  neutral  molecules  the  Nd:YAG  was 
fired  a  variable  time  period,  5  to  50  ns,  later.  The  timing  between  the  two  lasers  was 
controlled  by  varying  the  delay  between  the  quench  pulse  ana  the  first  eject  pulse, 
maintaining  a  fixed  length  for  the  entire  sequence.  The  time  between  the  two  laser  pulses 
was  monitored  by  using  the  sync  output  from  the  C02  laser  and  the  signal  from  a  fast 
photodiode  which  picked  up  scattered  light  from  the  Nd:YAG  laser  beam.  Jitter  between 
laser  pulses  was  ±  4  ns. 

Because  of  timing  restrictions  the  Nd:YAG  laser  was  not  triggered  during  the  pulse 
sequence  in  which  it  fired,  but  instead  during  the  preceding  sequence  and  was  "wrapped" 
around  to  the  next  pulse  sequence.  In  the  3-laser  experiments  the  cw-C02  laser  was 
gated  on  for  a  variable  time  after  a  series  of  three  ejection  events,  thus  irradiating  the 
trapped  ions  formed  by  MPI  of  laser-desorbed  neutrals.  Following  this  the  usual  FTICR 
excitation  and  detection  process  took  place. 

For  most  experiments,  the  mass  spectrometer  was  operated  in  its  standard 
broadband  (2.67  MHz  to  10  kHz)  mode  using  frequency  chirp  excitation.  Heterodyne 
detection  of  the  transient  signal  was  used  when  required  for  accurate  mass  analysis  . 
Typically,  10  to  50  transient  signals,  each  consisting  of  16384  data  points,  were  acquired 
and  averaged.  The  averaged  time-domain  transient  was  apodized  (43)  and  zero-filled 
once  prior  to  Fourier  transformation.  The  size  of  the  individual  transient  signal  could  be 
increased  from  16k  to  64k  data  points  as  necessary  to  increase  the  mass  resolution.  Only 
positive  ions  were  observed  following  multiphoton  ionization,  and  a  trapping  voltage  of  2 
volts  was  used  for  most  experiments.  The  trapping  voltage  was  reduced  to  0.5  volts 
during  hetrodyne  detection  experiments.

A  clean  stainless  steel  probe  tip  was  used  to  generate  the  Fe  signal  as  was  an  InP 
wafer  doped  to  the  100  ppm  level.  Coronene  (Aldrich)  and  peptide  samples  (Chemical 
Dynamics  Corporation)  were  used  without  additional  purification.  Sample  purity  was 
assessed  using  broadband  laser  desorption  mass  spectrometry.  The  samples  (0.5  to  5 
mg)  were  mixed  with  methanol  (3  to  5  ml)  and  a  small  portion  of  the  resulting  slurry  was 
deposited  on  a  stainless  steel  probe  tip  using  a  micropipette.  The  sample  coating 
typically  appeared  opaque  and  was  much  thicker  than  that  normally  used  for  laser 
desorption.  The  solids  probe  tip  was  mounted  such  that  rotation  of  the  probe  exposed 
a  fresh  surface  for  laser  desorption  of  neutrals.  Depending  on  sample  preparation,  a 
single  spot  produced  signal  for  100  to  500  laser  pulses. 

Results  and  Discussion 

Post-Ionization  of  Laser  Desorbed  Neutrals  in  the  FTICR.  The  first  attempts  at 
multiphoton  ionization  of  laser  desorbed  neutrals  were  made  with  coronene.  Care  was 
taken  to  use  sufficiently  low  desorption  laser  power  that  no  ions  were  produced  directly. 
Postionization  was  achieved  with  an  unfocussed  (frequency  doubled)  dye  laser  beam  of 
300  nm  wavelength  (solution  of  coronene  is  302  nm)  which  passed  through  the 
center  of  the  cell  in  a  similar  path  as  the  IR  laser  beam  in  Figure  1  .  A  maximum  m/z  = 
300  parent  ion  signal  was  observed  when  the  delay  between  the  desorption  and  ionization 
lasers  was  set  to  60  ns,  but  ions  were  still  formed  with  a  delay  time  of  up  to  150  /is. 

Multiphoton  ionization  of  laser  desorbed  iron  atoms  was  performed  using  a  similar 
procedure  and  experimental  configuration  to  that  for  coronene.  Iron  and  other  neutrals 
were  desorbed  from  a  304  stainless  steel  probe  tip  with  postionization  achieved  by  302.1 
nm  light,  the  first  photon  resonant  with  the  yD^a  D54  transition  and  the  second  exciting 
into  the  ionization  continuum.  Light  of  several  other  wavelengths  cooresponding  to 
transitions  originating  from  the  a  D\  state  (298.4 , 296.7,  and  293.7  nm)  also  produced 
ionization.  However,  no  signal  could  be  produced  from  other  higher  lying  a  DSj  states. 
This  indicates  that  significant  populations  of  even  low-lying  excited  states  (0.05  eV  and 
0.11  eV  above  the  ground  state)  of  the  Fe  atoms  were  either  not  produced  or  were 
quenched  en  route  to  the  cell  center.  These  results  are  quite  different  from  the  resonant 
ionization  lines  observed  in  a  glow  discharge  (44),  where  numerous  examples  of  excitation 


6 


from  the  higher  excited  states  were  observed.  Figure  3  shows  the  Fe+  signal  produced 
by  302.1  nm  resonant,  two  photon  ionization  as  a  function  of  the  velocity  the  neutral  iron 
atoms  would  obtain  if  desorbed  from  the  surface  during  the  desorption  laser  beam  pulse. 
The  experimental  distribution  does  not  fit  Boltzman  velocity  distributions  at  2,700  °C  (the 
boiling  point  of  302  stainless  steel)  or  10,000  °C.  A  substantial  signal  is  observed  at  both 
velocities  much  slower  than  neutrals  desorbed  at  2,700  °C  would  acquire  and  much  faster 
than  those  formed  at  a  temperature  of  10,000  °C.  This  indicates  that  either  the  iron  atoms 
are  desorbed  with  a  wide  distribution  of  kinetic  energies  or  that  the  desorption  process 
proceeds  gradually  with  atoms  emitted  tens  of  microseconds  after  the  laser  energy  has 
been  deposited. 

Significant  iron  signals  were  also  produced  when  the  doubled  dye  laser  beam  was 
focussed  by  the  cylindrical  lens  and  ionization  took  place  quite  close  to  the  probe  tip.  At 
a  distance  between  the  probe  tip  and  ionization  laser  focal  point  of  approximately  2  mm 
the  strongest  ion  signals  were  found  at  a  laser  delay  of  7  ns  and  no  observable  signal  was 
seen  at  either  4  or  10  ns.  Jitter  in  the  timing  prevented  a  detailed  study  of  neutral 
velocities;  however,  the  narrow  distribution  of  desorbed  iron  atoms  found  close  to  the 
probe  tip  (as  opposed  to  a  wide  distribution  seen  at  the  cell  center)  indicates  an  virtually 
instantaneous  desorption  process  with  the  resulting  atoms  desorbed  with  a  wide  range 
of  velocities. 

The  ultimate  intent  of  these  atomic  post-ionization  experiments  with  FTICR  mass 
analysis  was  the  detection  of  trace  impurities  while  taking  advantage  of  the  technique’s 
high  resolution.  Iron  at  a  100  ppm  doping  level  in  an  InP  compound  semiconductor 
substrate  was  observed  using  the  experimental  configuration  discussed  above  and  shown 
in  Figure  1.  The  signal  was  maximized  at  a  10  ns  delay  time  between  the  two  lasers 
(slightly  longer  than  with  Fe  from  the  stainless  steel  substrate)  at  a  2  mm  probe  to  focal 
point  distance,  which  permitted  a  major  portion  of  the  desorbed  neutrals  to  be  intersected 
by  the  focussed  ionization  laser.  A  small  In*  peak  is  also  observed  at  m/z  =  115,  since 
it  was  difficult  to  produce  desorption  without  the  formation  of  ln\  The  FTICR  mass 
spectrum  obtained  is  shown  in  Figure  4.  A  maximum  mass  resolution  of  11,400  using 
64  K  data  points  was  obtained.  This  resolution,  which  is  much  lower  what  is  normally 
experienced  using  FTICR,  may  be  the  result  from  the  high  translational  energy  these  ions 


possess  (in  addition  to  a  wide  distribution  of  energies)  and  the  inability  to  thermalize  the 
ions  with  a  neutral  gas  because  of  resulting  loss  of  signal  strength. 

Infrared  Multiphoton  Dissociation  (IRMPD)  of  Oligopeptide  Ions  Previously  (1 4,21 ) 
we  have  coupled  direct  laser  desorption  with  infrared  multiphoton  dissociation  to  study 
a  wide  variety  of  interesting  chemical  systems.  The  coupling  of  these  two  laser 
experiments  yields  a  technique  that  is  capable  of  producing  molecular  weight  information 
because  of  the  "soft”  ionization  nature  of  laser  desorption  yet  aiso  provides  useful 
structural  information  from  the  fragments  produced  by  IRMPD. 

A  study  of  alkyl-substituted  pyridinium  salts  (21 )  demonstrated  that  laser  desorption 
of  these  compounds  readily  forms  intact  positive  ions  in  the  gas  phase  which  undergo 
fragmentation  following  collisionally  activated  dissociation  (CAD)  (using  argon  as  a 
collision  gas)  or  IRMPD  when  irradiated  by  a  cw  C02  laser.  An  advantage  that 
photodissociation  may  have  over  collisionally  activated  dissociation  is  that  as  the 
molecular  weight  of  the  ion  of  interest  increases  collisional  processes  may  impart 
insufficient  energy  to  the  ion  due  to  the  reduced  momentum  transfer  of  a  massive  ion 
colliding  with  a  small  neutral  molecule.  Further  studies  of  IRMPD  on  ions  in  the  molecular 
weight  range  300  to  1400  (14)  showed  that  these  larger  ions  readily  undergo 
fragmentation  when  "activated"  by  absorption  of  infrared  photons. 

Often  direct  laser  desorption  produces  a  pseudo-molecular  ion  which  is  formed  by 
attachment  of  a  cation  such  as  K+  or  Na*  to  the  intact  neutral  molecule.  Unfortunately, 
the  main  fragmentation  pathway  observed  with  IRMPD  is  quite  often  (the  structurally 
uninformative)  loss  of  the  neutral  molecule. 

(M  +  K)+  +  nhu-  M  +  K* 

Such  behavior  is  not  seen  when  working  with  negative  ions,  where  (M-H)  ions  are  most 
often  formed,  but  it  can  be  quite  limiting  when  examining  positive  ions.  Production  of 
such  pseudo-molecular  ions  is  particularly  undesirable  when  using  laser  desorption  and 
IRMPD  to  study  peptide  ions  where  cleavage  of  amide  linkages  and  not  M  -  K+  bonds  is 
sought. 

Based  on  the  results  of  other  workers  (12)  using  low-powered  laser  desorption  and 
multiphoton  ionization  for  ion  production  in  time-of-flight  investigations  the  laser  desorbed 
neutral  peptide  provides  an  abundance  of  ions  that  are  potentially  useful  for  structural 


8 


identification.  Peptides  containing  a  strongly  UV  absorbing  amino  acid  residue,  such  as 
phenylalanine  =  268  nm),  tyrosine  (A,^  =  272.7  nm),  tryptophan  (A^  =  286.0  nm), 
or  histidine  (A^  =  250.0  nm)  are  easily  ionized  by  resonant  multiphoton  ionization  often 
producing  a  characteristic  molecular  or  pseudomolecular  ion. 

Consider,  for  example,  the  laser  desorption/multiphoton  ionization  spectrum  of  the 
hexapeptide  LeuTrpMetArgPheAla.  This  molecule  undergoes  facile  ionization  when 
irradiated  with  266  nm  light  producing  a  molecular  ion  and  numerous  fragment  ions. 
These  ions  provide  useful  molecular  weight  and  structural  information.  An  abundant 
fragment  peak  is  observed  for  each  of  the  possible  sequence  ions  as  shown  in  Figure  5. 
The  labeled  peaks  represent  fragmentation  from  the  C-terminus  end  of  the  molecule. 
Additional  fragment  ions  resulting  from  N-terminus  cleavages  and  loss  of  side  alkyl  groups 
are  present  in  lesser  abundance. 

Although  the  amount  of  fragmentation  observed  following  MPI  can  sometimes  be 
controlled  by  varying  the  energy  of  the  ionization  laser,  quantitative  control  of  the  amount 
of  fragmentation  is  often  quite  difficult.  One  answer  to  this  problem  is  to  irradiate  ions 
trapped  in  the  FTICR  analyzer  cell  with  infrared  radiation.  The  laser 
desorption/multiphoton  ionization  mass  spectrum  of  the  dipeptide  tryptophanglycine 
(T rpGIy)  is  shown  in  the  top  of  Figure  6  (all  ions,  including  a  large  intensity  ion  at  m/z  = 
130,  below  m/z  =  150  are  ejected  in  this  spectrum).  This  dipeptide  forms  a 
pseudomolecular  ion  m/z  =  244  ([M-OH]+  as  determined  by  accurate  mass  analysis). 
This  ion  dissociates  when  irradiated  with  a  gated  pulse  of  light  from  a  continuous  wave 
carbon  dioxide  laser,  forming  two  fragment  ions  at  m/z  =  200  and  171.  Double 
resonance  experiments  (m/z  =  200  is  ejected  during  the  cw  C02  laser  pulse)  confirm  this 
to  be  a  competing  and  not  a  sequential  (m/z  =  200  -*■  m/z  =  171)  reaction.  The  amount 
of  fragmentation  is  easily  controlled  by  varying  either  the  cw-C02  laser  power  or  the  length 
of  the  irradiation  period.  A  plot  of  the  normalized  abundance  for  the  parent  and  daughter 
ions  as  a  function  of  the  cw-C02  laser  pulse  energy  is  shown  in  Figure  7.  The  daughter 
ion  intensity  increases  smoothly  as  the  amount  of  IR  irradiation  increases. 

TrpGIy  has  been  previously  (45)  shown  to  form  a  cyclo-dipeptide  (with  elimination 
of  water),  but  only  when  a  thick  sample  (ca.  10  ng)  is  subjected  to  laser  desorption  and 
REMPI  in  a  similar  approach  to  this  study  (where  sample  thickness  is  estimated  at  0.5  - 


9 


1  mm).  However,  accurate  mass  analysis  identified  the  loss  of  17  amu  as  OH  (not  H20 
or  NHJ  in  the  FT1CR.  Subsequent  losses  of  44  and  73,  induced  by  IRMPD,  can  be 
explained  by  the  loss  of  CO/NH2  and  NHCH2CO/NH2  from  [TrpGIy]"  shown  in  Figure  8, 
but  would  be  difficult  to  explain  if  a  cyclic  ion  was  formed.  Thus,  by  employing  3-lasers 
and  the  high  resolution  of  FTICR  to  study  the  reaction  mechanism,  a  different 
fragmentation  route  than  that  earlier  predicted  has  been  ascertained. 

The  LD/REMPI  of  several  dipeptides  produced  intact  molecular  ions  which  were 
then  subjected  to  IRMPD.  The  molecular  ion  of  ProPhe  (mw  =  262)  IR  photodissociated 
to  form  m/z  =  70  ([pyrrole  -  1]+  (see  Figure  9)),  and  the  ArgPhe  molecular  ion  (MW  = 
341)  photodissociates  producing  fragment  ions  at  m/z  =  304  (loss  of  neutral  OH),  m/z 
=  245  (loss  of  the  phenyl  group),  m/z  =  263  (loss  of  NHCNHNHJ  and  m/z  =  158  (the 
breaking  of  the  peptide  bond  with  the  charge  remaining  on  the  Arginine  fragment).  These 
fragments  provide  practical  information  which  is  useful  in  structure  determination.  Thus, 
the  promising  results  produced  by  the  LD/REMPI/IRMPD  technique  suggest  that  it  may 
be  extended  to  larger  molecular  weight,  more  biologically  significant  oligopeptides/ 
proteins  in  which  direct  laser  desorption  does  not  produce  useful  information. 

Conclusions 

Multiphoton  ionization  of  neutral  molecules  formed  by  laser  desorption  has  been 
carried  out  successfully  in  a  Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  mass 
spectrometer.  At  least  two  advantages  of  using  FTICR  mass  spectrometric  detection  have 
been  realized:  high  mass  resolution  and  the  ability  to  subject  ions  formed  by  MPI  to 
infrared  laser  dissociation  while  they  are  trapped  in  the  FTICR  cell.  Extensions  of  this 
technique  to  larger  peptides,  other  biological  samples,  and  to  lower  concentrations  of 
dopants  or  contaminants  in  semiconductor  samples  are  in  progress.
