HISTORY 


The  Rural  Electrification  Administration  (REA)  is  a credit  agency  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  which 
assists  rural  electric  and  telephone  organizations  in  obtaining  the  financing  required  to  provide  electric  and 
telephone  service  in  rural  areas.  These  essential  services  help  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  people  who  live, 
work,  or  do  business  throughout  rural  America.  Financial  assistance  may  include  (a)  loans  from  REA,  (b)  guar- 
antees of  loans  made  by  others,  and  (c)  REA  approval  of  security  arrangements  which  permit  the  borrower  to 
obtain  financing  from  other  lendeis  without  a guarantee. 

REA  was  first  established  by  Executive  Order  7037  on  May  1 1 , 1935,  as  part  of  a general  program  of  unemploy- 
ment relief.  It  soon  became  clear,  however,  that  the  task  of  extending  central  station  electric  service  to  rural 
areas  required  very  specialized  skills  (engineering,  management,  etc.)  that  would  be  difficult  to  attract  if  REA 
operated  under  the  constraints  of  the  unemployment  relief  authorization.  REA  was  given  its  own  statutory 
authorization  by  the  Rural  Electrification  Act  of  May  20,  1936.  It  became  a part  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  on  July  1,  1939. 

Federal  support  was  needed  to  electrify  rural  America  because  most  of  the  established  utilities  served  high 
density  areas  and  did  not  extend  lines  to  farmers  and  other  rural  residents  because  such  investments  were  not 
considered  to  be  feasible. 

When  Congress  established  REA,  its  purpose  was  to  assure  that  funds  would  be  available  for  rural  electrification. 
Loans  were  made  at  interest  rates  that  fluctuated  with  the  cost  of  money  to  the  Government.  It  was  not  until  1 944 
that  Congress  established  a fixed  interest  rate  of  2 percent,  which,  at  that  time,  was  the  approximate  cost  of 
money  to  the  Government.  As  time  went  by  and  interest  rates  rose,  the  subsidy  associated  with  REA  loans  grew. 
The  performance  of  the  difficult  tasks  involved  with  the  initial  organizing  and  constructing  of  rural  electric  systems 
was  made  possible  by  the  availability  of  capital  from  REA,  innovative  construction  techniques  and  the  establish- 
ment of  cooperatives — not  by  subsidized  interest  rates. 

The  purpose  of  REA  was  expanded  in  1949  when  REA  was  authorized  to  loan  funds  for  telephone  service  in  rural 
areas.  As  in  the  case  of  electricity,  it  became  clear  that  rural  residents  would  not  have  access  to  adequate  and 
dependable  telephone  service  unless  Federal  support  was  provided.  Both  the  rural  Telephone  and  rural  Electric 
programs  of  REA  have  been  successful  in  achieving  their  goals. 

During  the  late  1960’s  and  early  1970’s,  rural  electric  and  telephone  leaders  came  to  realize  that  (a)  their  capital 
needs  were  growing  at  a very  rapid  rate  and  would  very  likely  continue  to  grow,  (b)  it  was  no  longer  reasonable  to 
expect  the  Government  to  meet  all  of  their  growing  capital  needs,  and  (c)  they  had  developed  sufficient  financial 
strength  to  obtain  a portion  of  their  capital  needs  from  private  sources.  For  these  reasons,  supplemental 
sources  of  financing  were  developed  for  both  rural  electric  and  telephone  utilities. 

The  National  Rural  Utilities  Cooperative  Finance  Corporation  (CFC)  was  formed  in  1969  by  the  rural  electric 
cooperatives.  It  obtains  funds  from  the  private  credit  markets  for  its  loans  to  electric  systems.  As  of  December 
31,  1987,  CFC  had  provided  more  than  $4.0  billion  in  long-term  loans  to  its  membership,  which  includes  889 
systems.  In  addition  to  CFC,  rural  electric  systems  obtain  loan  funds  from  the  Banks  for  Cooperatives  and  other 
private  sources. 

The  Rural  Telephone  Bank  (RTB)  was  established  in  1971  by  Public  Law  92-12  which  amended  the  Rural  Electrifi- 
cation Act.  It  is  the  primary  supplemental  source  of  financing  for  the  growing  capital  needs  of  rural  telephone 
systems.

The  Rural  Telephone  Bank  is  managed  by  a 13-member  board  of  directors.  The  Administrator  of  REA  serves  as 
Governor  of  the  Bank  until  conversion  to  private  ownership,  control,  and  operation.  This  will  take  place  when  51 
percent  of  the  Class  A stock  issued  to  the  United  States  and  outstanding  at  any  time  after  September  30,  1985, 
has  been  fully  redeemed  and  retired.  The  Bank  board  holds  at  least  four  regularly  scheduled  meetings  a year. 
Activities  of  the  Bank  are  carried  out  by  REA  employees  and  the  Office  of  the  General  Counsel  of  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Agriculture. 

In  1973,  a major  amendment  to  the  Rural  Electrification  Act  established  the  "Rural  Electrification  and  Telephone 
Revolving  Fund”  (RETRF)  for  the  purpose  of  making  loans  to  REA  electric  and  telephone  borrowers.  The 
amended  Act  established  that  loans  to  be  made  from  the  RETRF  would  be  at  a standard  rate  of  5 percent  instead 
of  the  2 percent  rate  at  which  REA  loans  had  previously  been  made.  The  2 percent  rate  was  retained  as  a special 
rate  for  borrowers  that  met  criteria  specified  in  the  Act.  It  was  also  available,  at  the  Administrator's  discretion, 
for  hardship  cases. 

In  addition  to  establishing  the  RETRF,  and  increasing  the  interest  rate  of  REA  loans,  the  1973  amendment  author- 
ized REA  to  guarantee  loans  made  by  other  lenders.  Today  these  loan  guarantees  account  for  most  of  the  loan 
funds  obtained  by  electrification  borrowers. 

The  Legislation  adopted  in  1973  contained  a statement  whereby  Congress  declared  that  it  is  its  policy  that  "rural 
electric  and  telephone  systems  should  be  encouraged  and  assisted  to  develop  their  resources  and  ability  to 
achieve  the  financial  strength  needed  to  enable  them  to  satisfy  their  credit  needs  from  their  own  financial  organi- 
zations and  other  sources ” 

In  1981 , Congress  further  amended  the  RE  Act  by  eliminating  the  special  2 percent  interest  rate  on  loans  to  rural 
electric  and  telephone  systems.  Such  utilities  now  receive  loans  at  5 percent  from  the  RETRF,  as  do  other 
borrowers.  Exceptions  to  the  5 percent  rate  may  still  be  made  at  the  discretion  of  the  REA  Administrator  where 
there  is  a finding  of  hardship. 

A 1986  amendment  to  the  RE  Act  authorized,  through  September  30,  1987,  prepayment  of  certain  REA  guaran- 
teed Federal  Financing  Bank  Loans,  as  well  as,  the  sale  or  prepayment  of  REA  direct  or  insured  loans,  at  dis- 
count, by  the  borrower.  Another  1986  amendment  established  a privatization  demonstration  program  which 
allowed  Alaska  borrowers  to  prepay  all  of  their  REA,  RTB  or  REA  guaranteed  borrowings, 

In  1987  Congress  amended  the  RE  Act  to  extend  the  prepayment  of  FFB  loans  through  September  30,  1988,  and 
authorized  the  prepayment  of  RTB  loans  at  face  value  without  a prepayment  premium  during  fiscal  year  1988.  In 
addition  electric  borrowers  were  authorized  to  use  their  own  funds  for  investments  without  prior  Administrator 
approval  for  amounts  not  in  excess  of  1 5 percent  of  their  total  utility  plant.  A new  grant  or  zero  interest  rate  loan 
program  was  established  to  promote  rural  economic  development.  Another  amendment  established  a formula 
for  determining  the  RTB  interest  rate. 

During  fiscal  year  1987,  a total  of  50  rural  electric  and  telephone  borrowers  retired  their  REA  debt  under  the 
prepayment  program  authorized  under  the  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1986.  This  resulted  in  the 
return  to  the  federal  Treasury  $429  million  in  advance  of  loan  payment  due  dates. 

During  fiscal  year  1988,  six  power  supply  borrowers  prepaid  $2  billion  in  long-term  high  interest-rate  loans  held 
by  the  Federal  Financing  Bank.  The  prepayments  were  funded  by  private-sector  loans  with  an  REA  guarantee.

PROGRAM  ACCOMPLISHMENTS 


Extending  and  Improving  Service 

REA's  programs  have  been  very  successful  in  extending  electric  and  telephone  service  to  persons  in  rural  areas. 
By  1953  more  than  90  percent  of  all  farms  in  the  U.  S.  had  electricity;  for  telephone  service,  the  90  percent  mark 
was  passed  in  1976.

In  addition  to  financing  the  extensions  of  electric  and  telephone  service  to  rural  areas,  REA  has  provided  credit  to 
rural  telephone  utilities  for  system  improvements  that  have  dramatically  upgraded  the  quality  of  telephone 
service  in  rural  America. 

Before  the  REA  Telephone  Program,  rural  telephone  service  was  often  antiquated  and  unreliable — even  where  it 
was  available. 

Today  modern  and  reliable  telephone  service  is  available  for  people  who  live,  work,  or  do  business  in  rural  areas. 
The  availability  of  modern  communications  systems  has  improved  the  quality  of  life  of  rural  people  and  has 
strengthened  their  local  economies.  Improvement  continues  as  more  rural  residents  receive  single  party 
service.

Meeting  the  Growing  Demand  for  Service 


Rural  electric  and  telephone  systems  have  been  able  to  meet  an  ever  increasing  demand  for  service.  Each  year 
the  number  of  households  served  by  REA  electric  and  telephone  borrowers  has  increased.  In  the  early  years  this 
growth  was  mainly  due  to  service  being  extended  to  households  that  had  never  before  had  electricity  or  tele- 
phones. More  recently  the  growth  is  primarily  because  of  the  rapid  population  increases  that  have  occurred  in 
rural  America — particularly  in  "sunbelt”  and  western  states.

Today  the  rural  electric  and  telephone  utilities  that  receive  financing  from  REA  have  developed  into  strong  busi- 
ness organizations.  Although  not  large  when  compared  with  many  urban  utilities,  they  are  vital  components  of 
their  respective  industries.

* An  access  line  is  any  line  (or  loop)  terminating  at  the  telephone  company  central  office.  In  prior  years,  estimates  were  based  on 
subscribers  served,  however,  while  REA  borrowers  still  report  subscriber  data,  the  rest  of  the  telephone  industry  does  not.

LOAN  STATISTICS 


REA  telephone  borrowers  have  received  a greater  amount  of  their  financing  needs  from  REA  loans  than  from 
other  sources.  These  REA  loans  are  supplemented  by  loans  from  the  Rural  Telephone  Bank  and  REA  guarantees 
of  loans  from  other  sources — mainly  the  Federal  Financing  Bank.

Until  the  1973  amendment  to  the  Rural  Electrification  Act,  virtually  all  financing  to  REA  electric  borrowers  was 
supplied  by  direct  REA  loans  at  an  interest  rate  of  2 percent.  Beginning  in  1 973  the  amount  of  financing  received 
by  rural  electric  systems  increased  greatly  and  most  of  this  financing  has  been  approved  by  non-REA  sources, 
primarily  the  Federal  Financing  Bank  (FFB),  with  an  REA  guarantee,  at  FFB’s  market  rate  of  interest.  During 
fiscal  year  1989,  less  than  one-half  of  electric  borrowers’  financing  needs  were  supplied  by  non-govern- 
ment sources.

REA  electric  distribution  borrowers  receive  most  of  their  financing  from  REA  at  a 5 percent  interest  rate.  The 
remainder  is  obtained  from  REA  at  interest  rates  as  low  as  2 percent  (a  very  small  amount  since  the  1981 
amendment  to  the  RE  Act)  and  from  non-REA  sources  such  as  the  National  Rural  Utilities  Cooperative  Finance 
Corporation  (CFC)  and  the  Bank  for  Cooperatives.

REA  electric  power  supply  borrowers  receive  most  of  the  financing  approved  by  REA;  almost  all  of  this  is  pro- 
vided by  non-REA  sources,  mainly  the  Federal  Financing  Bank,  with  an  REA  loan  guarantee.  Since  the  1973 
amendment  to  the  Rural  Electrification  Act,  which  gave  REA  the  authority  to  guarantee  loans  made  by  other 
lenders,  REA’s  program  of  financing  for  power  supply  projects  has  grown  from  a modest  one  to  one  of  large 
magnitude.

The  number  of  REA  electric  borrowers  has  not  changed  much  since  about  1950.  The  small  increases  that  have 
occurred  during  the  last  several  years  have  been  mainly  because  of  the  formation  of  new  power  supply  systems 
that  are  wholly  owned  by  REA  electric  distribution  borrowers.  The  number  of  REA  telephone  borrowers  increased 
rapidly  during  the  first  10-15  years  of  the  program.  The  number  of  telephone  borrowers  continues  to  increase 
each  year  mainly  because  of  initial  loans  to  existing  telephone  utilities  to  extend  and  upgrade  telephone  service 
to  rural  subscribers.

Each  year  since  the  Rural  Electrification  and  Telephone  Revolving  Fund  (RETRF)  was  established  in  1973,  REA 
has  paid  out  more  in  advances  to  borrowers  and  in  interest,  than  it  has  received  in  payments  on  loans. 

In  1987  loan  payments  totaling  $428  million  were  received  as  a result  of  the  direct  loan  prepayment  program 
established  by  Congress  in  the  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1986. 

The  RETRF  obtains  the  additional  funds  necessary  to  meet  advances  and  interest  expenses  from  the  U.S.  Treas- 
ury, directly  or  through  the  Federal  Financing  Bank,  at  rates  of  interest  greatly  in  excess  of  the  interest  rates 
charged  borrowers.

Although  the  total  amount  of  financing  provided  or  guaranteed  by  REA  has  increased  over  the  years,  as  has  the 
complexity  of  many  of  the  electric  generation  and  telephone  projects,  REA’s  staff  has  effectively  handled  the 
increased  work  load.

When  Congress  created  the  REA  loan  program  it  did  not  provide  an  interest  rate  subsidy.  Interest  rates  charged 
borrowers  fluctuated  with  the  cost  of  money  to  the  Government.  It  was  not  until  1 944  that  Congress  established  a 
fixed  interest  rate  of  2 percent,  which  at  that  time  was  the  approximate  cost  of  money  to  the  Government.  As 
time  went  by  and  the  interest  rates  rose,  the  subsidy  associated  with  REA  loans  grew.  During  the  late  70’s  and 
early  80's  there  has  been  a significant  widening  of  the  gap  between  the  cost  of  money  to  the  Government  and  the 
interest  rate  charged  borrowers  on  REA  loans.  Although  the  gap  has  narrowed  since  1981,  the  cost  of  money  to 
the  Government  remains  significantly  higher  than  the  REA  rate.

As  of  September  1989,  REA  borrowers  had  received  more  than  $61  billion  from  REA  loans,  loan  guarantee 
commitments,  and  RTB  loans.  Loan  guarantee  commitments  account  for  most  of  this  financing, 
however,  a large  proportion  has  been  provided  by  REA  loans  at  the  2 percent  and  5 percent  interest  rates.

BORROWER  STATISTICS 


Rural  electric  systems  have  historically  had  more  rapid  rates  of  increase  in  electric  demand  than  the  total  electric 
utility  industry.  Since  1973,  growth  in  electric  usage  has  declined  for  both  REA  borrowers  and  the  total  industry.

Except  for  the  slight  decline  in  1988,  consumers  served  by  rural  electric  systems  have  been  charged  increasingly 
higher  prices  for  electricity  since  the  early  1970’s.  These  price  increases  came  after  a long  period  of  steadily 
declining  prices.  However,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  when  inflation  is  adjusted  for,  there  has  been  very  little 
real  increase  in  electricity  prices  to  rural  electric  consumers — electricity  remains  a very  good  buy.  Rural  electric 
consumers  are  paying  far  less  for  electricity  today  in  constant  dollars  than  they  were  in  the  early  days  of  the  rural 
electric  program.

Electric  rates  charged  rural  electric  consumers  have  increased  mainly  because  of  sharp  escalation  in  the  cost  of 
power.  In  most  cases,  increases  in  the  cost  of  distributing  power  have  been  more  moderate.  The  cost  of  power 
has  risen  mainly  because  of  : (a)  increasing  fuel  costs;  and  (b)  expensive  new  generating  units  that  are  coming 
on  line.

Electric  Program 


Most  of  the  power  distributed  by  rural  electric  systems  is  purchased  from  investor-owned  utilities  (lOU's)  and 
publicly-owned  utilities.  However,  there  has  been  a long-term  trend  toward  REA  borrowers  generating  more  of 
their  consumers’  power  needs.

The  financial  ratios  of  REA  electric  borrowers  declined  substantially  during  the  latter  half  of  the  1970’s  and  into 
the  1980's  when  costs  increased  rapidly  and  were  not  matched  by  similar  rate  increases. Financial  ratios  of 
distribution  borrowers  have  improved  in  the  past  few  years,  but  those  of  power  supply  borrowers  have  remained 
very  low. 

Strong  financial  ratios  are  important  because  they  affect  the  cost  at  which  REA  borrowers  are  able  to  obtain  funds 
from  private  sources.

Most  of  the  revenue  collected  by  REA  electric  distribution  borrowers  is  used  to  pay  for  wholesale  power.  This 
component  of  cost  has  increased  rapidly,  and  margins  as  a percent  of  total  revenue  have  declined. 

Interest  expense  represents  only  a small  percentage  of  the  revenue  collected  by  distribution  borrowers.

Most  of  the  revenue  collected  by  REA  power  supply  borrowers  is  used  for  power  production  and  to  purchase 
wholesale  power  from  other  utilities.  Increases  in  power  production  expenses  are  mainly  due  to  increases  in  the 
cost  of  fuel.

The  main  trends  regarding  the  type  of  plant  that  rural  telephone  systems  are  building  to  serve  their  subscribers 
are:  (a)  buried  cable  is  quickly  replacing  aerial  plant;  and  (b)  central  office  equipment  is  increasing  as  a per- 
centage of  the  total.

Note:  Due  to  changes  in  the  Uniform  System  of  Accounts  as  promulgated  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  several 
categories  of  plant  and  expenses  have  been  consolidated  in  1988.  Therefore,  this  chart  is  not  readily  comparable  to  prior  years.

The  major  expenses  of  rural  telephone  borrowers  have  been  relatively  stable  as  a percent  of  their  total  revenue: 
there  have  been  no  dramatic  trends  among  any  of  the  major  expense  items. 

Interest  on  long-term  debt,  like  other  items  has  been  stable — accounting  for  about  10  percent  of  telephone 
borrower  revenue  for  the  past  20  years.

Note:  Due  to  changes  in  the  Uniform  System  of  Accounts  as  promulgated  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  several 
categories  of  plant  and  expenses  have  been  consolidated  in  1988.  Therefore,  this  chart  is  not  readily  comparable  to  prior  years.

Note:  Due  to  changes  in  the  Uniform  System  of  Accounts  as  promulgated  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  several  categories  of 
plant  and  expenses  have  been  consolidated  in  1988.  Therefore,  this  table  is  not  readily  comparable  to  prior  years. 


Most  REA  telephone  borrowers  are  quite  small  businesses,  in  terms  of  the  number  of  subscribers  they  serve.  As 
of  December  31 , 1988,  the  average  REA  telephone  borrower  served  5,582  subscribers  with  an  average  of  7.1 
subscribers  per  route  mile.

as  of  December  31,  1988 

Number  of  Borrowers 


Selected  operating  ratios  of  borrowers  for  1988  and  the  4 prior  years  are  presented  below.  The  ratios  of  total 
operating  revenues  and  net  operating  income  or  margin  to  average  plant  in  service  show  an  increase  from  30.9 
to  31 .7  and  from  6.8  to  7.5  respectively,  in  a comparison  of  1984  with  1988.  The  depreciation  expense  ratio  has 
also  shown  an  increase  in  this  period.  The  accrual  ratio  in  the  5-year  period  has  decreased  slightly  from  86.9  in 
1984  to  84.6  in  1988.
