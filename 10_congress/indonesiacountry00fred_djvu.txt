Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared  by  the 
Federal  Research  Divison  of  the  Library  of  Congress  under  the  Country 
Studies/Area  Handbook  Program,  formerly  sponsored  by  the  Depart- 
ment of  the  Army  and  revived  in  FY  2004  with  congressionally  man- 
dated funding  under  the  sponsorship  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, 
Strategic  Plans  and  Policy  Directorate  (J-5). 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country, 
describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national 
security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelationships  of 
those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  fac- 
tors. Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists. 
The  authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  soci- 
ety, striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular  atten- 
tion is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society,  their  origins, 
dominant  beliefts  and  values,  their  common  interests  and  the  issues  on 
which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and  extent  of  their  involvement  with 
national  institutions,  and  their  attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward 
their  social  system  and  political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not  be 
construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  U.S.  government  position,  pol- 
icy, or  decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards 
of  scholarly  objectivity.  Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for 
changes  from  readers  will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Acknowledgments 


This  edition  supercedes  Indonesia:  A  Country  Study,  published  in 
1993.  The  authors  wish  to  acknowledge  their  use  of  portions  of  that 
edition  in  the  preparation  of  the  current  book. 

Various  members  of  the  staff  of  the  Federal  Research  Division  of 
the  Library  of  Congress  assisted  in  the  preparation  of  the  book.  Sandra 
W.  Meditz  made  many  helpful  suggestions  during  her  review  of  all 
parts  of  the  book  and  managed  the  editing  and  production  of  the  book. 
Catherine  Schwartzstein  edited  the  manuscript,  made  many  very  useful 
suggestions,  and  helped  clarify  obscure  points.  She  also  performed  the 
final  prepublication  editorial  review  and  compiled  the  index.  Vincent 
Ercolano  also  edited  parts  of  the  manuscript  in  its  early  stages.  Sarah 
Ji-Young  Kim  provided  valuable  assistance  in  checking  facts,  review- 
ing and  revising  maps  and  figures,  collecting  illustrations,  and  assisting 
with  updating  the  Country  Profile  and  revising  the  Bibliography.  Janie 
L.  Gilchrist  performed  word  processing  and  formatting  of  text. 

The  authors  also  are  grateful  to  other  individuals  in  the  Library  of 
Congress  who  contributed  to  the  book.  Kathryn  Wellen,  former  Indone- 
sia Reference  Specialist  in  the  Asian  Division,  provided  advice  and  clar- 
ifications on  many  points.  William  Tuchrello,  director  of  the  Library's 
Overseas  Office,  Jakarta,  and  his  staff  assisted  in  providing  photographs 
and  published  information  from  Indonesia. 

Jennifer  Foley  compiled  draft  editions  of  the  maps  and  identified 
many  of  the  photographs  used  in  the  book.  Graphics  support  was  pro- 
vided by  Christopher  Robinson,  who  prepared  the  book's  graphics  and 
also  performed  the  photocomposition  and  preparation  of  the  final  digi- 
tal manuscript  for  the  printer.  Both  he  and  Katarina  David  of  the  Fed- 
eral Research  Division  performed  digital  conversion  of  photographs 
and  illustrations  used  in  the  study. 

Thanks  go  to  Harris  Iskandar,  education  and  cultural  attache  of  the 
Embassy  of  Indonesia  in  Washington,  DC,  for  providing  useful  research 
information  on  his  country.  Finally,  the  authors  acknowledge  the  gener- 
osity of  individuals  and  public  and  private  organizations  who  allowed 
their  photographs  to  be  used  in  this  study;  they  have  been  acknowledged 
in  the  illustration  captions.

Preface 


This  edition  of  Indonesia:  A  Country  Study  replaces  the  previous 
edition,  published  in  1993.  Like  its  predecessor,  this  study  attempts  to 
review  the  history  and  treat  in  a  concise  manner  the  dominant  social, 
political,  economic,  and  military  aspects  of  contemporary  Indonesia. 
Sources  of  information  included  books,  scholarly  journals,  foreign  and 
domestic  newspapers,  official  reports  of  governments  and  interna- 
tional organizations,  and  numerous  periodicals  and  Web  sites  on  Indo- 
nesian and  Southeast  Asian  affairs. 

To  avoid  confusion  over  the  spelling  and  pronunciation  of  Indonesian 
names  and  terms,  the  so-called  new  spelling  (ejaan  yang  disempurna- 
kan — EYD — perfected  spelling)  of  1972,  which  replaced  an  earlier  sys- 
tem based  in  part  on  pre-World  War  II  Dutch  spellings,  has  been  used 
throughout,  even  when  it  differs  from  the  personal  preference  of  individu- 
als. The  usage  and  alphabetization  of  Indonesian  names  may  also  pose 
problems  for  those  familiar  with  Indonesian  cultures  as  well  as  the  prefer- 
ences of  individuals  and  fashions  of  any  given  period.  The  procedure  fol- 
lowed in  this  volume  is  to  alphabetize  according  to  the  last  name  of  the 
individual  when  two  or  more  names  exist.  Thus,  works  by  the  historian 
Sartono  Kartodirjo  are  listed  under  "Kartodirjo,  Sartono."  The  military  fig- 
ure Sarwo  Edhie  Wibowo  is  alphabetized  under  "Wibowo."  This  proce- 
dure is  at  odds  with  some  earlier  Indonesian  practices,  but  it  has  the 
advantage  of  being  easily  understood  internationally  and  is  becoming 
more  common  in  Indonesia  itself.  Some  individuals  are  generally  referred 
to  using  the  first  element(s)  of  their  name — such  as  "Sarwo  Edhie"  rather 
than  Wibowo — and  others  by  the  last  element,  such  as  Ibnu  Sutowo,  who 
is  referred  to  as  "Sutowo"  or  "Colonel  Sutowo"  or  "Colonel  Ibnu  Sutowo" 
but  not  as  "Ibnu."  Some  individuals,  such  as  former  presidents  Sukarno 
and  Suharto,  used  only  one  name,  and  former  president  Megawati  Sukar- 
noputri is  always  referred  to  as  Megawati  and  not  Sukarnoputri,  which  is  a 
contrived  surname.  Thus,  the  late  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid  is 
referred  to  as  President  Wahid  and  President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono 
as  President  Yudhoyono.  In  this  regard,  this  book  follows  the  practices 
observed  in  contemporary  Indonesian  discourse  and  print  media,  even  if 
these  themselves  are,  in  a  few  instances,  inconsistent.  Some  Islamic  terms 
familiar  to  readers  in  transliteration  from  Arabic  are  spelled  here  in  translit- 
eration according  to  EYD. 

The  spelling  of  contemporary  place-names  conforms  in  most  cases  to 
the  system  approved  by  the  U.S.  Board  on  Geographic  Names  (BGN); 


xiii 


spellings  of  some  names,  however,  cannot  be  verified,  as  the  BGN  itself 
notes.  Indonesian  spellings  are  given  for  all  modern  province  names, 
such  as  Jawa  Tengah  (Central  Java).  Similarly,  the  names  Sumatera 
Utara  (North  Sumatra)  and  Papua  Barat  (West  Papua)  are  used  to  refer  to 
provinces  on  the  islands  of  Sumatra  and  Papua,  respectively.  Conven- 
tional spellings  of  names  referring  more  generally  to  portions  of  Java,  for 
example,  are  given  in  lower  case  and  the  form  "eastern  Java,"  "southern 
Sumatra,"  and  so  on. 

Because  of  the  widespread  use  of  acronyms  and  contractions  in 
Indonesia,  the  ones  used  in  this  edition  are  listed  in  a  table  along  with 
an  English  translation  at  the  front  of  the  book  (see  table  A).  A  chronol- 
ogy of  major  historical  events  also  is  provided  (see  table  B).  Measure- 
ments are  given  in  the  metric  system;  a  conversion  table  is  provided  to 
assist  readers  wanting  to  convert  metric  measurements  (see  table  C). 

Readers  are  encouraged  to  consult  the  chapter  bibliographies  at  the 
end  of  the  book,  which  include  a  number  of  general  and  specialized, 
primarily  English-language-source  bibliographies  that  will  lead  read- 
ers to  further  resources  on  Indonesia.  Also,  brief  comments  on  some 
of  the  more  valuable  and  enduring  sources  recommended  for  further 
reading  appear  at  the  end  of  each  chapter.  A  glossary  also  is  included. 

The  body  of  the  text  reflects  information  available  as  of  July  2010. 
Certain  other  parts  of  the  text,  however,  have  been  updated:  the  Chro- 
nology and  Introduction  discuss  significant  events  that  have  occurred 
since  the  completion  of  research,  and  the  Country  Profile  and  portions 
of  some  chapters  include  updated  information  as  available.  Indonesia 
completed  its  decennial  census  in  May  2010,  but  the  full  results  were 
not  available  for  inclusion  in  the  main  text  of  this  book.

both  published  in  Jakarta,  Jakarta  Post  and  Jakarta  Globe,  both  with 
print  runs  of  40,000. 

Government  and  Politics 

Party  and  Government:  Republic  based  on  separation  of  powers 
among  executive,  legislative,  and  judicial  branches.  Constitution  of 
1945  in  force  but  amended  in  1999-2002  to  make  once  powerful,  party- 
centered  presidency  subject  to  popular  election  and  limited  to  two  five- 
year  terms.  President  and  vice  president  elected  on  single  ticket,  usually 
representing  coalition  of  parties;  winning  ticket  must  gain  more  than  60 
percent  of  popular  vote  in  the  first  round  of  voting  and  at  least  20  per- 
cent of  vote  in  half  of  provinces.  If  percentages  not  met,  second-round 
runoff  election  held.  President  both  chief  of  state  and  head  of  govern- 
ment. Legislative  power  vested  in  People's  Representative  Council 
(DPR)  and  less-powerful  upper  house,  Regional  Representative  Council 


xxxv 


(DPD).  People's  Consultative  Assembly  (MPR),  which  formerly  elected 
the  president  and  vice  president,  now  joint  sitting  of  the  DPR  and  DPD 
but  retains  separate  powers  restricted  to  swearing  in  president  and  vice 
president,  amending  constitution,  and  having  final  say  in  impeachment 
process.  Newly  decentralized  power  of  subnational  authorities  en- 
shrined and  delineated  in  amended  constitution.  Numerous  political  par- 
ties; Democrat  Party  (PD),  Partai  Golkar  (Golkar  Party),  and  Indonesian 
Democracy  Party-Struggle  (PDI-P)  gained  largest  number  of  DPR 
seats  in  2009  election. 

Administrative  Divisions:  Thirty-three  provincial-level  units:  30 
provinces  (propinsi),  two  special  regions  (daerah  istimewa;  Aceh  and 
Yogyakarta),  and  one  special  capital  city  region  (daerah  khusus; 
Jakarta).  Provinces  subdivided  into  districts,  called  municipalities 
(koto)  in  urban  areas  and  regencies  (kabupaten)  in  rural  areas;  below 
are  subdistricts  (kecamatan),  with  village  (desa)  at  lowest  tier.  Indone- 
sia in  2009  had  348  regencies,  91  municipalities,  5,263  subdistricts, 
and  66,979  villages. 

Judicial  System:  Complex  system  with  three  inherited  sources  of  law: 
customary  or  adat  law,  Islamic  law  (sharia),  and  Dutch  colonial  law. 
Judicial  branch  independent  and  coequal  with  executive  and  legislative 
branches,  with  Supreme  Court  and  Constitutional  Court  at  apex  of  judi- 
cial system.  Four  different  court  systems  below  Supreme  Court:  courts 
of  general  civil  and  criminal  jurisdiction,  religious  courts,  state  admin- 
istrative courts,  and  military  courts. 

Foreign  Relations:  Founding  member  of  ASEAN  in  1967,  encourages 
regional  solidarity  among  members  while  expanding  relations  with 
other  regional  and  global  powers.  Tenuous  but  slowly  improving  rela- 
tions with  immediate  non- ASEAN  neighbors  (Papua  New  Guinea  and 
Timor-Leste)  and  working  interdependencies  with  Malaysia  and  Singa- 
pore. Mutual  suspicions  color  relations  with  Australia.  Relations  with 
China,  once  poor,  warmer  in  recent  years;  trade  important,  as  it  also  is 
with  Japan  and  South  Korea.  Relations  with  United  States  warm  and 
trade  important. 

National  Security 

Armed  Forces:  Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces  (Tentara  Nasional 
Indonesia — TNI)  had  about  302,000  active-duty  personnel  in  2009, 
with  army  (TNI — Angkatan  Darat),  233,000;  navy  (TNI — Angkatan 
Laut),  45,000,  of  which  20,000  marines  and  1,000  part  of  naval  avia- 


XXXVI 


tion;  and  air  force  (TNI— Angkatan  Udara),  24,000,  of  which  4,000 
"quick-action"  paratroopers. 

Military  Budget:  US$3.4  billion,  just  over  1  percent  of  budget  by 
2009. 

Military  Units:  Army — 12  military  regional  commands  (Kodams), 
each  with  one  or  more  battalions,  one  of  which  is  quick-reaction  bat- 
talion; and  two  centrally  controlled  army  strike  force  commands — 
Army  Strategic  Reserve  Command  (Kostrad)  with  two  divisions  and 
Army  Special  Forces  Command  (Kopassus),  with  three  operational 
groups.  Navy — two  fleet  commands  (Eastern  Fleet  at  Surabaya  and 
Western  Fleet  at  Jakarta),  marine  corps,  air  arm,  and  military  sealift 
command.  Air  Force — three  operational  commands  (Ko-Op  I/West, 
Ko-Op  II/East,  and  National  Air  Defense  Command)  and  two  support 
commands  (Air  Materiel  Command  and  Air  Training  Command);  four 
battalions  of  "quick-action"  paratroopers. 

Military  Equipment:  Army — light  tanks,  armored  reconnaissance 
vehicles,  armored  personnel  carriers  (APCs),  towed  and  self-propelled 
artillery,  air  defense  guns,  surface-to-air  missiles,  fixed-wing  aircraft, 
helicopters.  Navy — submarines,  frigates,  patrol  and  coastal  combat- 
ants, mine  warfare  ships,  amphibious  forces  ships,  non-combatant 
fixed-wing  aircraft,  armed  helicopters,  transport  helicopters;  marines 
have  light  tanks,  anti-infantry  fighting  vehicles,  APCs,  towed  artillery 
pieces,  air  defense  guns.  Air  Force — combat  aircraft,  maritime  recon- 
naissance aircraft,  tankers,  transports,  trainers,  helicopters. 

Auxiliary  Forces:  Many  former  official  and  unofficial  paramilitary 
forces  disbanded  or  integrated  with  TNI  since  1999.  National  Police  of 
Indonesia  (Polri),  since  1999  independent  of  TNI,  numbered  280,000 
in  2009.

Introduction 


ON  THE  EVENING  OF  JUNE  18,  2009,  tens  of  millions  of  Indone- 
sians settled  in  front  of  their  televisions  to  watch  three  candidates — for- 
mer Vice  President  and  President  Megawati  Sukarnoputri,  incumbent 
Vice  President  Muhammad  Yusuf  Kalla,  and  incumbent  President 
Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono — debate  major  issues  prior  to  the  presi- 
dential election  to  be  held  on  July  8.  By  all  accounts,  the  audience  was 
largely  disappointed.  Megawati,  daughter  of  Sukarno,  the  often-radical 
nationalist  and  fiery  orator  who  was  Indonesia's  first  leader,  discussed 
the  national  challenges  of  getting  motorcyclists  to  wear  helmets  and 
government  offices  to  issue  identification  cards  in  a  timely  fashion. 
Yusuf  Kalla,  whose  background  is  in  business,  spoke  about  the  neces- 
sity of  setting  goals  and  deadlines  but  mentioned  no  specifics  or  priori- 
ties. President  Yudhoyono,  a  former  army  general,  emphasized  the 
need  for  the  rule  of  law,  lest  Indonesia  be  compared  unfavorably  to 
countries  with  better  legal  systems,  and  he  proposed  more  online  sys- 
tems for  identification  cards  and  drivers'  licences  so  that  identities 
could  be  checked  and  "people  can  see  what  is  normal  and  what  is  not." 
Many  ordinary  people  who  watched  said  they  were  simply  bored,  miss- 
ing real  clashes  of  opinion  and  discussion  of  large  issues  such  as  the 
economy  and  human  rights.  Some,  while  not  especially  excited,  did  say 
the  debates  changed  how  they  would  vote,  while  others  admitted  that, 
as  a  result  of  watching  the  debates,  they  had  decided  to  abstain  from 
voting  altogether. 

The  next  day,  however,  popular  columnist  and  media  figure  Wimar 
Witular  noted  that  while  he  agreed  the  debate  had  been  "neither  inspir- 
ing nor  exciting,"  that  was  not  the  important  point.  "Eleven  years  ago," 
he  wrote,  "it  would  have  been  a  Star  Trek-like  fantasy  [to  think]  that 
presidential  candidates  would  someday  engage  in  an  open  debate  on 
national  television."  However  "boring"  or  overcautious,  and  despite  the 
failure  of  the  candidates  to  engage  each  other  on  large  and  substantive 
matters,  it  had  been  a  historic  event.  In  contrast  to  a  political  history 
dominated  by  commanding,  larger-than-life  figures  like  Sukarno  and 
Suharto,  Indonesian  political  decisions  were  now  in  the  hands  of  a 
broad  electorate,  voting  for  presidential  candidates  who  were  undeni- 
ably "ordinary"  people.  This  was  an  impressive  step  in  the  nation's  jour- 
ney from  authoritarianism  to  democracy,  and  should  not  be  forgotten. 

It  is  not  entirely  clear  whom  Wimar  Witular  was  intent  on  reminding, 
since  his  article  appeared  in  Indonesia's  foremost  English-language 


xxxix 


newspaper,  The  Jakarta  Post,  and  the  foreign  community,  curiously 
enough,  has  generally  marveled  over  the  changes  of  the  past  decade 
more  than  Indonesians  themselves.  Whatever  the  case,  his  point  was 
well  taken.  Since  the  late  1990s,  Indonesia  has  shifted  politically  from 
being  the  world's  largest  military-dominated  authoritarian  state  to  being 
the  world's  third-largest  civilian  democracy  (after  India  and  the  United 
States)  and  the  largest  Muslim-majority  democracy,  holding  the  world's 
largest  direct  presidential  elections.  It  has  gone  economically  from  the 
heights  of  the  "Asian  miracle"  of  the  1960s  to  the  1990s  to  the  depths  of 
the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1^97-98 — in  which  the  national  currency 
lost  as  much  as  70  percent  of  its  value,  and  income  per  capita  fell  an 
estimated  40  percent — and  back,  by  mid-2009,  to  heights  of  growth  at 
which  it  was  deemed  the  best-performing  Asian  market  for  the  year  and 
third-fastest-growing  economy,  placed  by  some  analysts  in  the  com- 
pany of  the  "emerging  giants"  of  Brazil,  China,  India,  and  Russia. 
Administratively,  Indonesia  has  moved  from  being  one  of  the  world's 
most  centrally  controlled  regimes  to  being  one  of  the  most  decentral- 
ized. Finally,  contrary  to  the  expectations  of  many  careful  observers, 
both  foreign  and  domestic,  Indonesia  has  succeeded  in  the  past  decade 
in  preserving  the  territorial  state  virtually  intact  against  the  considerable 
forces  of  separatist  movements.  The  exception  is  East  Timor — now  the 
Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste — acquired  by  force  in  1976  and 
relinquished  under  pressure  in  1999.  Indonesia  has  also  faced  severe 
ethnic  and  religious  violence,  growing  internationally  influenced 
Islamic  terrorism,  tension  over — and  within — the  armed  services,  and  a 
series  of  natural  disasters  of  which  the  most  devastating  was  the  2004 
tsunami  that  killed  more  than  166,500  Indonesians,  mostly  in  the  trou- 
bled region  of  Aceh,  in  northern  Sumatra. 

Trying  to  account  for  these  enormous  accomplishments  has  for 
some  time  occupied  Indonesia  watchers  ranging  from  serious,  aca- 
demic specialists  to  commentators  with  varied  and  comparatively 
casual  interests  in  the  country  and  its  people,  to  say  nothing  of  Indone- 
sians themselves.  One  result  has  been  a  wave  of  academic  and  journal- 
istic writing,  much  of  it  sharply  divided  ideologically  and  theoretically. 
Indonesians  from  the  political  elite  to  ordinary  citizens  have  also 
plunged  into  a  period  of  unprecedented — and  unprecedentedly  open — 
introspection,  raising  a  vibrant  public  discourse.  There  is  no  broad  con- 
sensus, but  the  principal  analyses  tend  to  fall  into  four  main  types. 

The  first  takes  a  long-term  view.  According  to  this  explanation,  Indo- 
nesia's dramatic  shift  to  a  successful  democratic  political  process  con- 
firms what  some  had  argued  all  along:  democracy  began  to  take  root  in 
the  years  immediately  following  the  National  Revolution  (1945-49),  but 
this  natural,  often  disorderly  development  was  nipped  in  the  bud  by  the 


xl 


imposition  of  Sukarno's  Guided  Democracy  (1957-65)  and  further  sup- 
pressed by  Suharto's  military-backed  New  Order  (1966-98).  Proponents 
of  this  view  dismiss  arguments  that  newly  independent  Indonesians  in 
the  early  1950s  were  not  "ready"  for  representative  democracy,  or  that 
democracy  along  Western  lines  (what  Sukarno  called  "free-fight  liberal- 
ism" and  "50  percent  +  1  democracy")  is  somehow  antithetical  to  both 
Indonesia's  needs  and  its  traditions.  They  also  suggest  that  previous  gov- 
ernments' attempts  to  deal  with  the  specter  of  ethnic  and  religious  con- 
flict by  smothering  the  expression  and  discussion  of  differences  rather 
than  channeling  and  protecting  them  only  made  matters  worse.  The  fall 
of  the  New  Order,  and  with  it  the  fall  from  favor  of  the  old  political  elite 
and  the  military,  made  possible  what  was  in  fact  a  kind  of  "back-to-the- 
fiiture"  movement:  returning  to  what  began  so  promisingly  nearly  two 
generations  earlier,  and  this  time  doing  it  right.  Indonesia's  achievement 
since  1998,  then,  was  as  possible  40  years  ago  as  it  has  now  proven  to  be. 

A  second  explanation  looks  at  matters  from  a  mid-range  perspec- 
tive, focusing  on  the  previous  20  years  or  so.  The  success  of  Indone- 
sia's transformation  thus  appears  due  largely  to  the  influence  of 
internal  dissidents  and  progressives — particularly  educated  young  peo- 
ple— during  the  last  half  of  the  New  Order  and  the  subsequent  period 
of  reformasi  (reform — see  Glossary),  coupled  with  pressure  from  both 
a  general  globalization  and  specific  outside  sources.  Advocates  credit 
this  combination  of  forces  not  only  with  weakening  and  eventually 
bringing  an  end  to  Suharto's  rule,  but  also,  even  more  important,  with 
persisting  during  the  subsequent  period  of  upheaval  in  championing 
and  providing  the  ideas  and  manpower  necessary  for  genuinely  demo- 
cratic reforms.  Seen  in  this  way,  Indonesia's  post-New  Order  achieve- 
ment is  to  a  very  large  degree  a  generational  one,  which,  as  many 
reformers  are  quick  to  point  out,  is  very  much  in  the  tradition  of  Indo- 
nesia's original  struggle  for  independence. 

A  still  shorter  field  of  vision  defines  a  third  perspective,  which 
focuses  for  the  most  part  on  the  past  decade.  This  view  emphasizes  the 
importance  of  the  political  and  military  leadership  after  the  resignation 
of  Suharto  in  May  1998,  arguing  that  without  it  Indonesia  might  easily 
have  continued  as  previously,  under  the  sway  of  an  authoritarian  figure. 
Instead,  as  it  happened,  the  individuals  who  followed  the  New  Order 
president  had  neither  the  inclination  nor  the  opportunity  to  attempt  to 
reassemble  the  strongman  pattern.  Military  leaders  made  conscious 
decisions  to  forego  any  thoughts  of  reinstating — by  force  or  other 
means — the  armed  forces'  self-declared  dual  responsibilities  as  both 
governors  and  enforcers.  However  great  a  role  the  architects  of  reform 
may  have  played,  according  to  this  argument,  their  efforts  could  have 
been  derailed  by  powerful  civilians  and  soldiers  if  they  had  been  so 


xli 


inclined.  But  they  were  not  derailed,  and  it  is  therefore  to  current  mili- 
tary and  political  leaders,  with  all  their  strengths  and  weaknesses,  that 
the  success  of  the  past  decade  must  ultimately  be  attributed. 

A  final  theory  suggests  that  the  great  transformation  at  issue  has  not 
(or  at  least  not  yet)  taken  place,  and  that  the  changes  that  have  occurred 
are  in  many  respects  superficial.  For  example,  a  prominent  analyst  of 
Indonesian  affairs  examined  the  three  pairs  of  candidates  in  the  2009 
presidential  election  and  found  they  were  all  "creatures  of  Indonesia's 
past."  Yusuf  Kalla,  a  "classic  Suharto-esque  businessman"  and  conser- 
vative political  supporter,  was  allied  with  Wiranto,  a  retired  general  who 
was  Suharto's  former  adjutant  and  was  indicted  by  the  United  Nations 
for  crimes  against  humanity  in  East  Timor.  Megawati,  a  "woman  long- 
ing for  a  return  to  the  glory  days  of  her  father,"  had  as  a  mnning  mate 
Prabowo  Subianto,  another  general  (and  former  son-in-law  of  Suharto), 
who  was  dismissed  by  the  military  for  brutal  treatment  of  political  activ- 
ists. Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono,  yet  another  former  general,  although 
one  with  a  reputation  for  liberal  tendencies  and  indecisiveness,  chose  as 
his  vice  presidential  candidate  a  career  government  economist — Budi- 
ono — who  had  most  recently  headed  Bank  Indonesia.  All  of  this  sug- 
gests that  at  best  modest  and  largely  cosmetic  change  has  taken  place 
since  1998,  and  that,  furthermore,  the  prospects  for  deep,  meaningful 
reforms  in  the  immediate  future  are  perhaps  considerably  dimmer  than 
most  enthusiasts  are  willing  to  admit. 

Each  of  these  sorts  of  explanations  has  strengths  as  well  as  obvious 
weak  points,  and  none  can  stand  entirely  on  its  own.  Beyond  the  op-ed 
pieces  and  academic  studies,  in  their  everyday  thinking  most  Indone- 
sians probably  borrow  from  all  of  them  in  assembling  their  own  con- 
clusions. Even  taken  together,  however,  it  is  startling  that  in  their 
combined  field  of  vision,  the  32  years  of  New  Order  governance 
scarcely  figure  except  as  a  source  of  obstacles  to  political  moderniza- 
tion, a  decidedly  negative  force  in  any  effort  to  explain  the  advances  of 
the  past  decade.  Recently,  however,  a  handful  of  commentators  have 
quietly  begun  to  raise  the  possibility  that  a  powerful  explanation  of  the 
undeniably  rapid,  and  apparently  successful,  transformation  since 
1998  may  lie  precisely  where  least  suspected:  in  the  policies  and  reali- 
ties of  the  New  Order  itself. 

A  full  consideration  of  this  fifth  theory  would  require  a  thorough 
reexamination  of  Indonesia's  history  in  the  last  half  of  the  twentieth 
century,  which  has  yet  to  be  undertaken.  For  the  present,  however, 
some  principal  points  of  the  argument  seem  clear  enough.  The  basic 
notion  is  that  the  "amazing"  transformation  after  1998  is  not  quite  as 
amazing  as  has  generally  been  suggested  because  the  New  Order 
regime  was  never  as  powerful  and  monolithic,  in  some  views  even 


xlii 


totalitarian,  as  many  believed,  and  that  its  ability  to  control  the  way 
people  thought  and  behaved  was  overestimated.  (In  the  same  vein,  the 
military  was  never  as  unified  or  free  to  assert  its  will  as  most  assumed.) 
From  this  perspective,  for  example,  the  New  Order  censorship  about 
which  critics  constantly  complained  was  on  the  whole  much  milder 
than  portrayed,  and  at  best  erratic  and  incomplete;  it  certainly  did  not 
entirely  smother  public  debate  or  expressions  of  discontent.  Similarly, 
the  regime's  signature  efforts  to  inculcate  the  ideology  of  Pancasila  (see 
Glossary),  which  critics  decried  as  so  much  self-interested,  statist  pro- 
pagandizing, were  surprisingly  ineffective,  producing  more  cynicism 
and  questioning  than  acquiescence,  and  certainly  not  blind  adherence. 
Individuals'  ability  to  think  or  act  independently  in  political  matters, 
although  indeed  limited  under  the  New  Order  regime,  was  far  less 
severely  damaged  than  imagined,  and  did  not  require  a  miracle  to 
revive. 

This  explanation  also  suggests  that  the  New  Order  may  have  con- 
tributed to  the  post- 1998  transformation  in  a  more  positive  manner.  It 
is  not,  for  example,  quite  so  astonishing  that  Indonesia  was  able  to 
hold  complex  and  reasonably  peaceful  elections  in  1999,  2004,  and 
2009  if  we  recall  that,  in  fact,  the  nation  had  practice  doing  so  for  a 
quarter  of  a  century  under  New  Order  auspices  in  1971,  1977,  1982, 
1987,  1992,  and  1997.  This  notion  may  be  repellent  to  critics  who 
spent  years  pointing  out  how  the  New  Order  political  process  was  any- 
thing but  free,  manipulated  as  it  was  by  numerous  means,  including 
dishonest  management  of  elections,  curtailment  of  party  indepen- 
dence, manipulation  of  parliament  through  large  appointed  member- 
ships, and  the  like.  Nevertheless,  elections  were  routinely  held  and 
order  maintained  until  the  process  became  familiar,  even  taken  for 
granted;  it  was  by  no  means  new  in  1999,  even  though  the  all-impor- 
tant political  context  had  changed.  Furthermore,  it  seems  likely  that 
the  millions  of  Indonesians  who  participated  in  those  New  Order  elec- 
tions came  to  understand  that  process's  shortcomings  and  to  develop 
ideas  about  how  it  could  be  improved.  There  was  no  dearth  of  ideas 
when  the  time  came  to  make  changes,  and  the  journey  to  democracy 
required  modest  hops  rather  than  great  leaps. 

The  larger  implication  of  this  fifth  sort  of  explanation  is  that  what 
took  place  between  roughly  1998  and  2004  in  Indonesia  was  on  the 
one  hand  not  the  revolution  or  near-revolution  some  saw  or  wished 
for,  and  on  the  other  hand  not  the  ephemeral,  surface  phenomenon  oth- 
ers feared.  There  was  neither  miracle  nor  mirage  but  rather  a  complex 
transition  in  which  continuity  figured  as  importantly  as  change,  and 
the  two  were  often  very  closely  intertwined.  This  insight  is  useful  in 
understanding  other  aspects  of  contemporary  Indonesia  beyond  elec- 
tions and  democratic  procedure.

One  illustration  concerns  the  promotion  of  Pancasila  ideology,  a 
widely  criticized  hallmark  of  the  New  Order  that  appeared  to  have 
been  summarily  abandoned  in  1998.  Beginning  in  about  2002,  how- 
ever, there  was  a  revival  of  interest  in  Pancasila  and  in  honoring  it  as  a 
kind  of  national  creed  and  summation  of  national  identity.  Even  prom- 
inent intellectuals  who  had  considered  New  Order  leaders'  interest  in  a 
national  ideology  an  anathema,  and  the  Pancasila  itself  as  shallow  and 
outdated,  appeared  at  symposia  and  on  op-ed  pages  as  advocates  of  a 
"revitalization,"  emphasizing  the  ways  in  which  the  message  of  the 
Pancasila  is  not  only  appropriate  for  post-New  Order  Indonesia,  but 
indeed  even  necessary.  In  2006  President  Yudhoyono  made  a  point  of 
giving  a  major  national  speech  on  the  then-neglected  Birth  of  Pan- 
casila Day  (June  1),  recommending  that  politicized  niggling  over  the 
historical  origins  and  other  details  surrounding  the  Pancasila — which 
he  described  as  the  "state  ideology" — cease  and  that  greater  attention 
be  paid  to  its  precepts.  There  were  numerous  calls  for  making  June  1  a 
national  holiday,  and  the  minister  of  education  said  that  the  Pancasila 
would  remain  part  of  the  curriculum.  It  looked  very  much  as  if  a  key 
element  of  the  New  Order  was  about  to  be  reinstated. 

The  president  made  a  special  effort,  however,  to  emphasize  that  he 
did  not  intend  to  return  to  the  past.  The  authoritarian  Suharto  govern- 
ment had,  he  said,  "twisted  the  ideology  to  promote  conformity  and 
stifle  dissent"  with  what  he  termed  "Pancasila  brainwashing,"  which 
caused  the  populace  to  turn  against  it  and  its  sponsors.  But  in  reality, 
he  said,  the  Pancasila  is  "not  an  absolute  doctrine  but  a  compromise 
reached  by  the  nation's  founding  fathers,"  and  it  should  be  accepted  as 
such,  not  as  a  sacred  document  used  to  enforce  uniformity.  It  is  a  com- 
promise that  sees  all  Indonesians  as  equal  and  protects  pluralism  and 
tolerance;  it  supports  democratic  reform  and  human  rights,  at  the  same 
time  as  it  promotes  a  sense  of  unity  under  a  common  sense  of  social 
justice.  This  is  precisely  what  is  needed,  Yudhoyono  argued,  at  a  time 
when  rapid  political  decentralization  and  vigorously  competing  ethnic 
and  religious  identities  threaten  national  unity.  Whatever  the  degrees 
of  public  trust  in  Yudhoyono 's  message,  it  will,  of  course,  be  some 
time  before  it  is  clear  where  it  will  lead.  Nevertheless,  making  the 
effort  to  see  elements  of  change  where  continuity  is  most  apparent  at 
least  brings  observers  closer  to  the  realization  that  an  easy,  either/or 
reading  is  inadequate. 

A  second  illustration  concerns  contemporary  Indonesian  public  cul- 
ture. By  mid-2009,  after  a  comparatively  short  period  of  growth 
beginning  around  2006,  by  far  the  most  popular  television  genre  in  the 
nation  was  the  reality  show — dating  shows,  talent  contests,  extreme 
home  makeovers,  and  the  like — which  are  widely  seen  as  being  Amer- 


xliv 


ican  in  origin  (although  in  fact  British  and  Dutch  producers  were  the 
true  pioneers);  nearly  80  different  shows  of  this  type  were  being  pro- 
duced by  local  companies.  To  both  outsiders  and  many  Indonesians, 
this  seemed  to  be  a  sign  of  an  abrupt  change.  The  Indonesian  scholar 
and  public  intellectual  Ariel  Heryanto,  for  example,  suggested  that  the 
pendulum  had  swung  away  from  a  post- 1998  interest  in  Islamic  popu- 
lar culture,  and  he  talked  about  American  culture  being  suddenly  "in" 
among  Indonesians  at  all  economic  and  social  levels.  One  reality- 
show  producer  even  suggested  that  what  viewers  consider  American 
values  are  in  fact  universal  ones,  and  that  Indonesians  are  now  part  of 
a  world  in  which  everyone  shares  "the  same  dream,  no  matter  who 
you  are  and  what  nationality  you  are."  Not  surprisingly,  some  Western 
commentators  took  this  as  another  confirmation  that  Indonesia  had 
moved  definitively  into  the  liberal  democratic  camp. 

There  is  an  important  "continuity"  side  to  this  story  as  well.  For  one 
thing,  as  New  York  Times  reporter  Norimitsu  Onishi  pointed  out,  the 
reality  show  is  not  the  first  American  genre  to  attract  attention.  Ameri- 
can sitcoms  ranging  from  "I  Love  Lucy"  to  "The  Golden  Girls,"  as 
well  as  series  such  as  "McGyver,"  filled  Indonesian  television  sched- 
ules beginning  in  the  mid-1970s  but  then  lost  ground  to  shows  with 
Islamic  themes  and  to  telenovelas  from  Latin  America  and  soap 
operas  from  Asia;  the  current  fascination  with  televised  reality  shows 
is  thus  part  of  a  longer  evolution  and  should  be  interpreted  in  that  light. 
The  careful  foreign  viewer  might  also  notice  that  a  number  of  the  most 
popular  Indonesian  reality  shows  focus  on  themes  markedly  not  found 
in  America — for  example,  transplanting  wealthy  or  upper-middle- 
class  Indonesians  into  poor,  rural  settings,  and  vice  versa,  focusing  on 
the  tribulations  each  group  faces  in  making  adjustments  and  attempt- 
ing to  understand  an  altogether  different  way  of  life.  These  produc- 
tions tend  to  validate  the  values  of  modern,  urban  middle-class 
Indonesians  at  the  same  time  as  they  highlight  the  importance  of 
empathy  for  others,  reflecting  in  part  a  longstanding  mainstream 
nationalist  populism  and  in  part  a  Muslim  morality  and  sensitivity  to 
the  plight  of  the  poor.  The  analysis  that  the  popularity  of  such  reality 
shows  is  evidence  of  a  recent  and  dramatic  social  change — "Ameri- 
canization," even — is  neither  as  accurate  nor,  truth  be  told,  as  interest- 
ing as  the  more  complicated  view  that  notices  a  more  complex  story  of 
adaptation. 

Since  the  previous  edition  of  this  volume  in  the  Country  Study 
Series  appeared  in  1993,  Indonesia  has  experienced  enormous  changes 
of  great  significance.  The  purpose  of  this  revised  version  is  not  merely 
to  point  them  out  but  also  to  attempt  to  show  them  in  their  proper  per- 
spective, in  which  changes  are  never  without  roots  and  continuities 


xlv 


never  untouched  by  innovation.  Particularly  for  a  country  as  large, 
diverse,  and  historically  intricate  as  Indonesia,  this  approach  seems 
both  necessary  and  sensible. 

September  16,  2009 

*  *  * 

As  the  manuscript  for  this  book  was  being  completed,  a  number  of 
significant  events  occurred  in  or  concerning  Indonesia,  most  notably 
Indonesia's  third  post-Suharto  presidential  election,  which  was  held  on 
July  8,  2009.  Fifteen  days  later,  the  General  Elections  Commission 
(KPU;  for  this  and  other  abbreviations  and  contractions,  see  table  A) 
declared  the  Democrat  Party  (PD)  coalition  candidates,  incumbent 
president  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  and  former  Bank  Indonesia  head 
Budiono,  the  official  winners  as  president  and  vice  president,  respec- 
tively, for  the  2009-14  term.  They  garnered  60.9  percent  of  the  vote. 
The  election  itself  was  largely  peaceful,  but  not  without  grumbling  in 
some  quarters  about  how  the  KPU  had  managed  the  process.  There 
were  challenges  to  the  results,  particularly  of  massive  fraud  involving 
voter  rosters.  Megawati  Sukarnoputri  and  her  ranning  mate,  former 
army  general  Prabowo  Subianto,  who  placed  second  with  26.8  percent 
of  the  vote,  pressed  the  issue  particularly  hard,  claiming  that  28.5  mil- 
lion of  her  opponent's  votes  had  been  rendered  invalid.  On  August  12, 
however,  the  Constitutional  Court  declared  that  the  claims  of  both 
Megawati  and  the  Golkar  (see  Glossary)  candidate,  Yusuf  Kalla, 
"lacked  legal  basis,"  as  the  court  found  "no  systematic,  structural,  and 
massive  violations  on  the  KPU's  part."  Although  some  observers 
expected  further  difficulties,  such  as  violence  or  new  procedural  chal- 
lenges, the  court's  ruling  appeared  to  have  defused  a  potentially  very 
troublesome  issue. 

Another  development  was  the  ongoing  anticorruption  campaign.  By 
the  time  of  Yudhoyono's  official  inauguration  on  October  20,  2009,  his 
second  administration  was  already  darkened  by  a  storm  of  controversy 
that  had  been  gathering  since  well  before  the  election.  The  central  issue 
was  corruption,  long  considered  by  Indonesians  and  foreign  observers 
alike  as  the  nation's  most  serious  problem,  and  one  Yudhoyono  was 
widely  seen  as  having  had  some  success  combating  by  establishing  in 
2002  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  Corruption 
Crimes  Court  (Tipikor  Court).  The  KPK,  which  had  been  given  extra- 
ordinary powers  of  investigation  (for  example,  into  warrantless  wiretap- 
ping) and  prosecution,  earned  public  respect  for  achieving  a  conviction 
rate  of  100  percent  in  86  graft  cases  involving  mostly  mid-  and  lower-level 


xlvi 


bureaucrats  and  civilians.  But  by  early  2009,  the  KPK  had  begun  to  take 
aim  at  more  important  targets,  especially  in  the  higher  ranks  of  the 
National  Police  of  Indonesia  (Polri)  and  the  Attorney  General's  Office. 
The  KPK  also  became  increasingly  involved  in  investigation  of  the  con- 
troversial US$700  million  bailout  in  2008  of  the  nation's  thirteenth-largest 
bank — Bank  Century — to  which  the  new  Yudhoyono  government's 
finance  minister,  Sri  Mulyani  Indrawati,  and  vice  president,  Budiono, 
were  connected. 

These  initiatives  appear  to  have  persuaded  many  prominent  indi- 
viduals, perhaps  because  they  themselves  were  potential  targets,  that 
the  KPK  was  too  powerful.  Representatives  of  Polri  and  the  Attorney 
General's  Office  and  groups  of  legislators  launched  a  seemingly  con- 
certed effort  to  deflate  the  KPK.  The  first  important  victim  was  the 
KPK  head  himself,  Antasari  Azhar,  who  in  May  2010  was  accused  of 
masterminding  a  bizarre  love-triangle  murder  plot,  for  which  he  was 
later  convicted  and  sentenced  to  1 8  years  in  prison.  (As  of  late  June 
2010,  the  case  was  still  under  appeal.)  The  next  major  erstwhile  targets 
were  two  KPK  commissioners,  Bibit  Samad  Riyanto  and  Chandra 
Hamzah,  arrested  in  October  2009  on  accusations  of  accepting  bribes 
in  what  by  that  time  had  become  a  bitter  feud  between  the  KPK  and 
Polri.  (That  case,  after  an  even  more  tortuous  journey  through  the 
courts,  was  in  limbo  more  than  eight  months  later.)  In  addition,  the 
Bank  Century  case  brought  accusations  of  wrongdoing  and,  implicitly, 
corruption  on  the  part  of  a  range  of  principals  involved,  some  of  whom 
were  connected  to  KPK  and  Polri  scandals.  In  all  of  these  cases,  there 
was  widespread  public  suspicion  that  many  of  the  targets  had  been 
framed  by  police,  as  indeed  several  police  officers  publicly  testified. 

The  long-term  significance  of  these  scandals  is  still  uncertain,  but 
there  is  general  agreement  about  several  consequences.  First,  President 
Yudhoyono 's  standing  in  many  circles  was  at  least  temporarily  weak- 
ened, as  he  appeared  to  vacillate  in  the  face  of  the  legal  disputes  and 
interdepartmental  dissension.  Forced  by  public  pressure  to  take  action, 
he  was  unable  to  fully  fend  off  legislators'  attacks  on  the  authority  of 
the  KBK  and  Tipikor,  which,  despite  the  retention  of  wiretapping  and 
prosecution  rights,  was  in  other  ways  diluted.  Yudhoyono  also  lost  the 
political  battle  to  keep  reform-minded  Minister  of  Finance  Sri  Mul- 
yani, who  resigned  in  May  2010.  (She  soon  accepted  a  high  post  with 
the  World  Bank  and  has  been  mentioned  as  a  likely  future  presidential 
candidate.)  The  president  had  repeatedly  complained  that  the  scandals 
were  being  used  to  discredit  him  personally  and  remove  him  from 
office  (impeachment  was  indeed  being  discussed  in  the  legislature); 
however,  the  broad  public  did  not  appear  to  share  this  conclusion. 

Second,  and  probably  of  more  lasting  importance,  is  the  unprece- 
dented degree  to  which  high-level  corruption  and  the  struggle  against  it 


xlvii 


were  opened  to  public  scrutiny.  Ordinary  Indonesians  devoured  pub- 
lished accounts  and  watched  televised  news  programs  offering,  for 
example,  coverage  of  court  proceedings  and  sensational  whistle-blower 
testimonies,  for  up  to  three  hours  a  day  by  January  2010,  commanding 
more  than  four  times  the  earlier  viewer  share  of  broadcast  news.  And  it 
did  not  escape  the  notice  of  government  bureaucrats  and  politicians  that 
the  Internet  was  quickly  and  skillfully  used  to  mobilize  public  opinion, 
generally  against  government  authorities.  The  most  impressive  mobili- 
zation arose  in  July  2009  when  Polri  commissioner  general  and  head  of 
the  Crime  Investigation  Agency  (Kabareskrim)  Susno  Duaji  com- 
mented derisively  to  a  journalist  that  the  KPK  trying  to  stand  up  to  the 
police  and  Attorney  General's  Office  was  like  a  tiny  house  lizard 
(cicak)  confronting  a  crocodile  (buaya):  opposition  was  foolish  and 
doomed.  Published  by  Tempo,  the  nation's  foremost  news  magazine 
and  online  news  source,  the  remark  was  endlessly  repeated  and  soon 
triggered  an  enormous  public  reaction.  The  Internet,  Facebook,  and 
Twitter  were  used  to  gather  hundreds  of  thousands  of  supporters  of  the 
KPK,  while  T-shirts  and  demonstrators'  banners  appeared  with  slogans 
such  as  "I'm  a  cicak\"  and  "Say  no  to  the  crocodile!"  The  police  were 
especially  humiliated,  but  public  officials  everywhere  took  uneasy 
notice  of  a  newly  powerful  public  that  seemed  to  know  what  corruption 
was  when  they  saw  it  and  that  vigorously  supported  efforts  to  combat 
both  corruption  and  the  types  of  authority  that  allowed  it  to  exist.  Sen- 
sational turns  in  the  case  by  mid-2010  led  to  Susno,  recently  jailed  in  a 
military  facility,  now  being  praised  as  a  heroic  whistle-blower  by  some 
and  even  suggested  as  the  next  head  of  the  KPK.  Some  people,  how- 
ever, accused  him  of  being  deeply  involved  in  graft  and  other  corrupt 
practices. 

How  did  these  developments  affect  public  attitudes  generally? 
According  to  one  respected  polling  source,  in  the  last  quarter  of  2009 
public  distrust  of  the  government  was  lower  overall  (28  percent)  than 
it  had  been  in  the  past  five  years  but  higher  (33  percent)  in  the  cities. 
The  poll  also  found  that  confidence  that  "democracy  is  working"  was 
nearly  as  high  as  it  had  ever  been  (78  percent),  but  that  such  confi- 
dence suffered  slightly  more  in  the  cities.  The  conclusion  that  corrup- 
tion was  the  major  problem  facing  the  nation  was  reached  by  nearly  as 
many  people  as  ever  (86  percent).  Polling  for  the  first  quarter  of  2010 
seemed  likely  to  show  slippage,  which  many  in  the  business  commu- 
nity feared  would,  in  turn,  have  unwelcome  economic  effects. 

The  power  of  the  Internet  was  demonstrated  not  only  in  the  corrup- 
tion scandals  but  also  in  the  case  of  Prita  Mulyasari,  a  young  mother 
whose  e-mailed  complaints  about  a  large  Jakarta  hospital's  services 
circulated  online  beginning  in  mid-2009.  Sued  for  defamation  by  the 


xlviii 


hospital,  she  was  also  taken  to  court  in  civil  and  criminal  suits  under 
the  2008  antipornography  law.  Public  outcry,  organized  via  Facebook, 
Twitter,  and  various  blogs  and  glogs,  resulted  in  her  being  found  not 
guilty  in  the  criminal  suit,  but  Prita  refused  to  settle  the  civil  suit  out  of 
court  because  she  felt  that  doing  so  was  an  admission  of  guilt.  She  lost 
the  case  in  December  2009  and  was  fined  more  than  US$20,000.  An 
online  campaign  raised  several  times  that  amount  in  donated  coins  to 
pay  her  expenses  and  fines.  The  case  underscored  in  several  ways  the 
enormous  potential  power  of  social  networking  in  Indonesia,  where 
the  number  of  Facebook  users  is  said  to  have  increased  from  fewer 
than  1  million  to  more  than  21  million  (compared  with  Britain's  24 
million)  between  early  2009  and  mid-2010. 

One  government  response  came  from  the  conservative  minister  of 
communication  and  information,  Tifatul  Sembiring,  who,  in  February 
2010,  drafted  regulations  widely  seen  as  limiting  freedom  of  expres- 
sion; public  outcry  was  so  immediate  and  forceful  that  President  Yud- 
hoyono  felt  compelled  to  warn  his  minister  to  tone  down  the  proposed 
regulations.  Some  legislators  agreed  with  Tifatul,  however,  calling  for 
strengthened  limitations  in  laws  governing  multimedia  use,  violations 
of  which  are  already  subject  to  greater  penalties  than  those  in  print 
media.  There  has  been  considerable  pushback  on  the  issue  from  a  vari- 
ety of  groups,  among  them  the  Alliance  of  Independent  Journalists, 
and  the  debate  gathered  momentum  in  May  2010.  During  the  follow- 
ing month,  a  sensational  case  developed  around  an  explicitly  sexual 
video  allegedly  showing  the  male  pop  singer  Nazril  (Ariel)  Irham  and 
two  female  media  celebrities  (they  claimed  that  the  individuals 
depicted  simply  looked  like  them),  which  was  widely  circulated  on  the 
Internet.  Police  scrambled  to  find  out  who  uploaded  the  clips  and 
whether  the  photos  were  indeed  of  the  people  everyone  thought  they 
were.  (In  late  June,  Ariel  was  arrested  and  charged  with  violating  the 
2008  antipornography  law.)  Tifatul  commented  that  the  public  debate 
over  these  "sex  tapes"  was  like  the  dispute  between  Muslims,  who 
believe  that  Jesus  Christ  was  not  crucified  but  rather  that  someone 
resembling  him  was,  and  Christians,  who  believe  that  Jesus  Christ  was 
crucified.  He  was  immediately  engulfed  by  a  barrage  of  messages 
from  angry  Twitterers  suggesting,  for  example,  that  he  had  been  drunk 
when  he  made  the  comment;  Tifatul's  response  (via  his  own  Twitter 
account)  was  that  his  accuser  himself  must  have  been  drunk.  The  con- 
troversy escalated  so  rapidly  and  in  such  dangerous  directions  that 
President  Yudhoyono  felt  constrained  to  offer  an  opinion.  In  late  June 
2010,  he  appeared  to  back  Tifatul's  call  for,  among  other  things,  an 
Internet  "black  list"  and  general  regulation  of  Internet  use,  lest  society 
and  the  nation  be  damaged.

The  threat  of  terrorist  attacks  against  Indonesia  continues,  but  gov- 
ernment forces  appear  to  have  successfully  disrupted  some  significant 
sources  of  terror  activity.  On  "Black  Friday,"  July  17, 2009,  a  little  more 
than  a  week  after  the  presidential  election,  explosions  were  detonated  by 
suicide  bombers  at  two  American-owned  hotels  in  Jakarta,  the  JW  Mar- 
riott and  the  Ritz-Carlton,  killing  seven  (one  of  whom  was  Indonesian) 
and  wounding  53.  The  bombings  were  widely  condemned  internation- 
ally and  within  Indonesia  itself,  where  tolerance  for  terrorism  had 
already  been  dropping  noticeably.  President  Yudhoyono  suggested  that 
the  terrorist  acts  were  somehow1  connected  to  the  election  and  directed  at 
him,  an  idea  discounted  by  most  analysts.  (However,  the  police  discov- 
ery in  May  2010  of  a  plot  to  assassinate  Yudhoyono  on  the  coming  Inde- 
pendence Day,  August  17,  lent  the  earlier  suggestion  some  retrospective 
credence.)  Heightened  police  efforts  in  succeeding  months  after  the 
hotel  bombings  paid  off.  In  September  2009,  commandos  killed  Noor- 
din  Muhammad  Top,  the  Malaysian-born  Islamist  militant  thought  by 
police  to  have  been  responsible  for  major  bombings  in  Indonesia  since 
2002,  including  the  recent  JW  Marriott  and  Ritz-Carlton  explosions.  In 
March  2010,  counterterrorism  forces  killed  Dulmatin,  a  Javanese  bomb- 
ing masteirnind  who  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  militant  Jemaah 
Islamiyah  and  was  also  connected  to  the  Abu  Sayyaf  group  in  the  Phil- 
ippines. The  police  received  widespread  approval  for  these  efforts — as 
opposed  to  their  involvement  in  various  corruption  scandals — and  it  was 
clear  that  the  militants  and  their  followers  attracted  little  sympathy.  Two 
Javanese  villages,  whose  native  sons  were  followers  of  Noordin  and 
were  also  killed,  refused  to  have  them  buried  on  village  land.  Finally,  in 
June  2010  police  killed  former  Indonesian  soldier  Yuli  Harsono,  sus- 
pected of  planning,  among  other  things,  an  attack  on  the  Danish 
Embassy  in  Jakarta,  and  arrested  Abdullah  Sunata,  wanted  for  establish- 
ing a  terrorist  training  camp  in  Aceh  and  suspected  of  planning  to  assas- 
sinate President  Yudhoyono. 

Issues  having  to  do  with  the  public  practice  of  Islam  continue  to  fea- 
ture in  national  news,  especially  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh,  where 
implementation  of  sharia  (syariah  in  Bahasa  Indonesia — see  Glossary) 
began  in  2000  and  has  caused  intense  debate  since  then.  During  the 
2009  elections,  Golkar  Party  candidates  attempted  to  make  the  wearing 
of  the  jilbab  (Muslim  woman's  head  covering)  a  political  issue,  in 
which  the  vast  majority  of  Indonesians  seemed  to  show  no  real  interest. 
Polri  announced  a  plan  on  August  21,  2009,  to  monitor  sermons  given 
at  mosques  and  public  gatherings,  presumably  for  their  potential  to 
incite  hatred  or  violence.  There  was,  however,  a  strong  public  outcry, 
and  the  order  was  quickly  rescinded. 

The  most  sensational  development  occurred  in  mid-September 
2009,  when  the  Aceh  legislative  council  introduced  new  Islamic  crimi- 


1 


nal  bylaws  (qanun  jinayat),  calling  for,  among  other  things,  adulterers 
(both  Muslim  and  non-Muslim)  to  be  stoned  to  death.  The  bylaws, 
introduced  before  the  recently  elected,  more  moderate  legislature  could 
officially  be  seated,  drew  condemnation  from  many  sources,  including, 
in  early  October,  a  council  of  80  Muslim  clerics,  who  said  such  laws 
were  foreign  and  called  for  a  presidential  review.  Other  legal  experts 
suggested,  however,  that  the  bylaws  were  reasonable,  in  that  they 
reflected  Indonesia's  effort  to  recognize  diversity  in  legal  sanctions. 
Under  pressure  from  civil  society  and  both  foreign  and  indigenous 
human-rights  groups,  the  provisions  had  not  yet  been  fully  enacted  and 
signed  by  the  provincial  governor  as  of  mid-2010.  The  Department  of 
Home  Affairs  announced  its  intention  of  requesting  a  Supreme  Court 
review  of  Aceh's  Islamic  criminal  code  but  had  not  yet  done  so,  and 
the  law  remained  officially  in  a  suspended  state.  In  the  meantime,  how- 
ever, Aceh's  syariah  police  appear  to  have  been  emboldened,  enforc- 
ing conservative  standards  of  women's  dress  and,  in  several  instances, 
carrying  out  public  and  brutal  punishments  for  suspected  moral  crimes 
such  as  having  premarital  sex,  intrusions  the  majority  of  Acehnese 
appear  to  resent.  The  struggle  between  religious  conservatism  and 
more  moderate  ideas  and  the  search  for  a  less-tense  relationship 
between  Aceh's  autonomy — extended  in  2006  as  part  of  the  settlement 
of  the  armed  conflict  there — and  the  requirements  of  the  Indonesian 
state  and  constitution  seem  likely  to  continue  for  some  time. 

Another  controversial  legal  issue  also  attracted  widespread  attention. 
The  controversy  concerned  Indonesia's  1965  Blasphemy  Law,  a  section 
of  the  Criminal  Code  that  prohibits  both  expression  of  hostility  toward 
or  contempt  of  the  recognized  religions  and  the  advocacy  of  unorthodox 
interpretations  of  those  religions.  The  law  can  be  used  to  hand  down 
sentences  of  up  to  five  years'  imprisonment,  and  to  disband  any  group 
deemed  unorthodox  or  heretical.  In  October  2009,  a  group  of  prominent 
Muslim  intellectuals  (including  former  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid), 
human-rights  activists,  and  civic  leaders  requested  that  the  Constitu- 
tional Court  review  the  Blasphemy  Law,  suggesting  that  it  violates 
guarantees  of  freedom  of  religion  and  threatens  the  tolerance  and  plural- 
ism fundamental  to  maintaining  a  democratic  Indonesia.  In  April  2010, 
after  several  months  of  public  debate  and  demonstrations,  the  court 
refused  to  conduct  a  full  judicial  review  of  the  law,  thereby  upholding  it. 
An  eight-to-one  decision  by  the  court  argued  that,  without  anything  to 
immediately  replace  it,  the  law  is  necessary  in  order  to  maintain  social 
order  and  prevent  religious  conflicts.  Conservative  Muslims,  who 
feared  among  other  things  that  more  liberal  interpretations  of  Islam 
might  be  encouraged,  were  heartened  by  the  decision,  but  an  array  of 
opponents  feared  that  religious  freedom,  especially  of  minority  groups, 


li 


would  be  further  threatened.  While  the  Constitutional  Court's  ruling 
suggests  that  legislative  review  and  modification  of  the  law  might  be 
pertinent,  it  seems  unlikely  that  lawmakers  will  accept  such  a  sensitive 
undertaking  anytime  in  the  near  future. 

Eastern  and  western  Indonesia  have  continued  to  experience 
repeated  earthquakes.  The  largest  of  these  occurred  in  western  Java  in 
early  September  2009  (7.0  magnitude  and  at  least  72  deaths),  in  Sumat- 
era  Barat  later  the  same  month  (7.6  magnitude  with  at  least  1,100 
deaths  and  more  than  2, 1 80  injured),  and  offshore  from  Sumatera  Utara 
in  April  2010  (7.8  magnitude,  ho  deaths).  In  Jawa  Timur,  the  notorious 
Lumpur  Sidoarjo  (Lusi)  mud  volcano,  which  in  2006  killed  13  and 
destroyed  the  homes  of  tens  of  thousands  of  residents,  was  still  oozing 
in  2010.  International  researchers  argued  in  February  that  new  data 
confirmed  the  disaster  was  man-made  and  not  caused  by  an  earthquake 
as  the  gas-exploration  company  Brantas  Lapindo  claimed.  President 
Yudhoyono  reiterated  in  March  2010  that  he  expected  Lapindo  to  ade- 
quately reimburse  all  victims  (the  government  itself  had  allocated  more 
than  US$210  million  for  the  purpose  in  2008  and  2009),  but  the  case 
has  been  increasingly  embroiled  in  legal  and  political  controversy,  and 
protests  by  the  victims  continued. 

In  May  2010,  scientists  announced  the  discovery  of  previously 
unknown  species  of  gecko,  pigeon,  and  bat  in  the  remote  Foja  Moun- 
tains in  Papua  Province,  described  as  "perhaps  the  least  disturbed  ... 
tropical  forest  block  on  earth."  On  the  same  day,  the  government  of 
Norway  announced  a  US$1  billion  grant  to  the  Indonesian  govern- 
ment to  reduce  deforestation  through  a  series  of  ongoing,  verifiable 
projects.  Days  later,  President  Yudhoyono  issued  a  moratorium  on 
new  forest  and  peatland  concessions,  considered  an  encouraging  first 
step  in  an  aggressive,  long-term  campaign. 

Despite  the  many  political  and  social  problems  its  people  face, 
Indonesia's  economy  appeared  to  perform  remarkably  well  in  2009 
and  early  2010.  In  May  2010,  the  International  Institute  for  Manage- 
ment Development  in  Zurich  placed  Indonesia  thirty- fifth  on  its  annual 
list  of  the  most  competitive  economies,  jumping  it  ahead  of  seven 
other  nations  (the  Philippines  was  listed  thirty-ninth,  and  Malaysia  was 
listed  tenth).  The  economy  grew  a  respectable  4.5  percent  in  2009,  and 
it  was  estimated  to  achieve  5.8  to  6  percent  growth  in  2010.  Consumer 
expenditures  were  growing,  but  even  the  top  strata  were  spending  cau- 
tiously; government  spending  was  strong,  offsetting  declining  exports. 
Average  per-capita  income  rose  from  US$1,180  in  2004  to  US$4,200 
in  2010.  Most  important,  statistics  indicated  that  poverty  was  declin- 
ing: the  nation's  poorest  stratum,  earning  US$65  or  less  a  month, 
declined  during  roughly  the  same  period,  from  about  40  percent  of 


In 


society  to  slightly  more  than  20  percent.  According  to  the  latest  Gini 
index  (see  Glossary),  which  measures  inequality  of  wealth,  Indonesia 
enjoyed  considerably  more  equitable  income  distribution  (0.36)  than 
neighboring  Thailand  (0.42),  Singapore  (0.43),  or  Malaysia  (0.46), 
although  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  in  all  those 
countries  was  higher.  As  had  been  the  case  two  decades  earlier,  such 
figures  did  not  go  entirely  unchallenged  but  were  widely  accepted 
among  economists. 

"Culture  wars"  also  were  underway.  In  a  series  of  disputes  with 
neighboring  Malaysia  over  traditional  cultural  heritage,  public  voices — 
many  on  the  Internet — became  surprisingly  shrill,  including  character- 
izations of  Malaysia  as  "a  nation  of  thieves,"  and  threats  of  war.  In  mid- 
2009,  a  Malaysian  Ministry  of  Tourism  advertisement  aired  internation- 
ally on  the  Discovery  Channel  portrayed  a  Balinese  dance  as  part  of 
Malaysia's  cultural  heritage;  the  government  subsequently  withdrew 
the  advertisement  and  apologized  for  what  it  said  had  been  a  production 
error.  But  the  uproar  nevertheless  gathered  steam,  and  by  September, 
despite  some  Indonesian  commentators'  dismissal  of  the  issue  as  trivial 
and  an  indication  of  Indonesian  feelings  of  inferiority,  it  had  become  a 
cause  celebre  threatening  diplomatic  relations.  Some  of  the  sharp  feel- 
ings on  the  Indonesian  side  were  apparently  assuaged  in  October  when 
the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization 
(UNESCO)  declared  batik  to  be  part  of  Indonesia's  intangible  cultural 
heritage,  adding  to  a  similar  declaration  in  2008  for  shadow  puppet  the- 
ater (wayang  kulit)  and  the  keris,  an  asymmetrical  dagger,  which  many 
Malaysians  had  felt  were  at  least  equally  theirs. 

There  also  were  some  prominent  deaths.  W.  S.  Rendra,  major  poet 
and  playwright  who  achieved  fame  during  the  New  Order  for  taking 
stands  against  the  government,  died  at  age  74  on  August  6,  2009.  For- 
mer president  of  Indonesia  Abdurrahman  Wahid,  who  served  from 
1999  to  2001,  died  at  age  69  on  December  30, 2009.  Gesang,  composer 
of  many  keroncong  (songs),  among  them  the  world-famous  "Ben- 
gawan  Solo,"  died  at  the  age  of  92  on  May  20,  2010.  Hasan  di  Tiro, 
best  known  for  founding  the  Free  Aceh  Movement  (GAM),  the  1976— 
2006  movement  aimed  at  achieving  Acehnese  independence,  died  at 
age  84  on  June  3,  2010,  one  day  after  being  officially  reinstated  as  an 
Indonesian  citizen. 

July  1,2010 


liii 


After  the  manuscript  for  this  book  was  completed  in  the  summer  of 
2010,  a  number  of  important  events  took  place.  One  of  the  most  significant 
was  the  ongoing  struggle  against  corruption,  particularly  that  involving  pol- 
iticians and  government  bureaucrats.  Public  opinion  appeared  to  stiffen  fur- 
ther against  corruption.  In  August  2010,  not  long  before  the  traditional  time 
of  forgiveness  at  the  end  of  the  Muslim  fasting  month  of  Ramadan,  Presi- 
dent Yudhoyono  issued  pardons  and  remissions  of  sentences  for  a  number 
of  individuals  convicted  of  graft,  most  of  whom  had  served  75  percent  or 
more  of  their  sentences.  Although  such  pardons  are  generally  seen  as  cus- 
tomary, in  this  instance  Yudhoyono  was  strongly  criticized,  and  the  ques- 
tion was  asked  more  sharply  than  in  the  recent  past  whether  he  was  indeed 
committed  to  the  struggle  against  corruption.  The  Corruption  Eradication 
Commission  (KPK),  which  had  been  viewed  by  many  as  seriously  weak- 
ened in  early  2010  by  legislative  efforts  to  rein  in  its  powers,  appeared  to  be 
holding  its  own.  Despite  a  call  in  July  2011  by  People's  Representative 
Council  (DPR)  speaker  Marzuki  Alie  (from  President  Yudhoyono 's  own 
Democrat  Party)  for  the  dismantling  of  the  agency,  the  People's  Consulta- 
tive Assembly  (MPR)  moved  to  establish  the  KPK  more  firmly  with  a  con- 
stitutional amendment. 

Meanwhile,  the  KPK  itself  continued  to  pursue  suspects  and  attempt 
to  bring  them  to  justice.  The  case  of  former  police  commissioner  Susno 
Duaji,  the  self-proclaimed  whistle-blower  suspected  of  widespread  cor- 
rupt practices,  proceeded  with  many  sensational  twists.  Formally 
charged  in  late  September  2010  as  the  ringleader  in  a  number  of  impor- 
tant graft  cases,  Duaji 's  trials  were  just  beginning  10  months  later  in 
mid-2011.  The  most  important  new  case  was  that  of  Gayus  Halomoan 
Tambunan,  a  midlevel  tax  official  who  said  he  was  a  witness  who  had 
been  prepared  to  testify  against  corrupt  officials  but  was  betrayed  by 
the  KPK.  He  claimed  he  altered  the  tax  forms  of  149  corporations, 
including  Chevron  and  Ford,  and  received  Guyanese  passports  from  a 
U.S.  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (CIA)  agent  working  for  the  KPK. 
Gayus  was  sentenced  to  seven  years  in  prison  in  one  case,  but,  as  of  late 
July  2011,  three  other  cases  against  him  were  still  pending.  Another 
major  suspect  in  multiple  corruption  charges  was  former  Democrat 
Party  treasurer  Muhammad  Nazaruddin,  who  had  spectactularly  eluded 
arrest  and  even  had  the  entire  country  scanning  television  commercial 
jingles  for  clues  as  to  his  whereabouts. 

The  legal  troubles  of  male  pop  singer  Nazril  (Ariel)  Irham,  who  was 
charged  with  violating  the  2008  Information  and  Electronic  Transaction 
Law  for  appearing  in  sexually  explicit  videos  that  were  widely  circulated 
online,  held  the  attention  of  many  Indonesians  in  late  2010  and  2011. 
The  reason  for  the  high  degree  of  interest  was  that  it  revealed  many  lev- 
els of  hypocrisy  in  society's  views  of  sex  and  morality,  and  more  broadly 


liv 


because  it  tested  the  limits  of  openness  and  personal  freedoms  in  the  new 
democracy.  Arrested  in  mid-2010,  Ariel  was  tried  in  January  2011  in  a 
Bandung  court,  where  1,000  police  officers  were  deployed  to  maintain 
security  and  order.  He  was  sentenced  to  three  and  a  half  years  in  prison 
and  a  fine  equivalent  to  US$27,500;  an  appeal  was  rejected  in  April.  The 
case  was  used  by  the  conservative  minister  of  the  Department  of  Com- 
munications and  Information,  Tifatul  Sembiring,  to  garner  support  for 
his  efforts  to  force  Internet  providers  to  filter  out  pornographic  content. 
Providers  complained  that  filtering  would  cost  them  more  than  US$1 10 
million  to  implement  and  was,  in  any  case,  ineffective  technologically. 
Nevertheless,  the  government  persisted,  even  pressing  the  Canadian 
company,  Research  in  Motion,  to  block  porn  from  its  Blackberry  ser- 
vice. The  government  also  attempted  to  enforce  more  widely  a  2008  law 
that  criminalizes  viewing,  owning,  downloading,  and  distributing  por- 
nography, with  sentences  of  up  to  six  years  in  jail  and  fines  of  up  to 
US$115,000. 

But,  by  April  2011,  it  was  unclear  whether  Indonesia's  efforts  to 
control  Internet  usage  and  public  morality  in  this  way  could  be  sus- 
tained. The  government's  attempts — not  least  those  by  Minister  Tifatul 
himself — were  widely  ridiculed,  and  the  department  was  forced  to 
admit  publicly  both  that  filters  did  not  work  very  well  and  that  it  had 
only  40  staff  available  to  monitor  the  issue — a  clearly  inadequate  num- 
ber. Respected  lawmaker  Arifmto  of  the  Prosperous  Justice  Party 
(PKS),  which  had  strongly  supported  the  2008  antipornography  law, 
was  caught  watching  pornography  during  a  legislative  session;  he 
promptly  resigned,  but  columnists  and  others  wondered  aloud  why  an 
entertainer  had  gone  to  jail  but  a  legislator  had  not  been  charged,  and 
they  mused  that  a  high  percentage  of  the  Indonesian  population  was 
now  in  danger  of  being  declared  criminals. 

In  early  2011,  the  aforementioned  Jakarta  housewife,  Prita  Mulya- 
sari,  was  partially  vindicated  by  the  Supreme  Court,  which  overturned 
a  2010  ruling  that,  although  she  was  declared  not  guilty  in  a  criminal 
suit,  she  was  liable  in  a  civil  suit  that  fined  her  more  than  US$20,000. 
In  2009  the  Supreme  Court  had  also  denied  the  hospital's  libel  suit  ask- 
ing US$250,000  in  damages,  but  in  July  201 1  it  granted  a  prosecutor's 
request  for  an  appeal  and  reversed  its  opinion,  finding  Prita  guilty  and 
sentencing  her  to  six  months  in  prison.  Prita  immediately  filed  for  a 
case  review,  but  there  was  such  widespread  condemnation  of  the  deci- 
sion and  of  the  judicial  system  as  a  whole  that  some  editorials  foresaw 
that  the  case  might  eventually  force  both  abandonment  of  the  2008  law 
and  broad  judicial  reform. 

There  is  evidence  that  views  of  the  Suharto  era  are  being  modified 
in  public  memory  and  thinking  about  contemporary  society.  Calls  for 
the  promotion  of  Pancasila,  which  had  become  a  hated  feature  of  the 


lv 


Suharto  era,  continue  to  surface,  and  the  government  has  announced 
its  intention  to  revitalize  the  philosophy,  but  without  saying  how  it 
would  do  so.  The  humanist  thinker  Radhar  Panca  Dahara  acknowl- 
edged that  most  Indonesians  still  do  not  understand  Pancasila,  but  he 
cautioned  that  interpretation  has  to  be  individual  rather  than  codified 
to  be  effective.  A  member  of  the  government  commission  overseeing 
culture  and  education  initiatives  suggested  that  Pancasila  could  best  be 
revived  by  encouraging  exemplary  behavior  rather  than  endless  dis- 
cussion. Youth  activist  Melki  Lakalena  proposed  that,  rather  than  any 
sort  of  rigid  indoctrination,  popular  music  and  other  forms  of  mass 
culture  could  be  used  as  vehicles  for  reawakening  interest  in  Pan- 
casila. He  said  his  suggested  approach  was  a  more  "relaxed"  way  of 
recognizing  "the  political  role  of  culture  in  disseminating  the  value  of 
the  state  ideology,"  a  statement  with  an  oddly  back-to-the-future  ring. 

Another  feature  of  both  the  Old  Order  and  the  New  Order  that,  after 
a  brief  eclipse,  showed  signs  of  returning  was  the  government's  use  of 
book  banning  as  a  tool  of  social  control.  Between  1998  and  2006,  no 
books  had  been  banned,  although  the  Sukarno-era  law  sanctioning 
such  action  remained  in  force.  But  after  2006  the  practice  saw  some 
revival.  In  December  2009,  the  attorney  general  invoked  a  2004  law 
(which  had  replaced  a  1969  law  based  on  a  1963  presidential  decree) 
that  did  not  address  "banning  books"  but  rather  "supervising  the  circu- 
lation of  printed  materials"  to  ban  five  books.  Among  them  was  the 
Indonesian  translation  of  John  Roosa's  Pretext  for  Mass  Murder:  The 
September  30th  Movement  and  Suhartos  Coup  d'etat  in  Indonesia,  a 
publication  that  the  Attorney  General's  Office  deemed  disturbing  to 
public  order,  even  though  it  had  already  been  in  circulation  in  Indone- 
sia for  nearly  two  years.  By  mid-2010,  the  Department  of  Justice  and 
Human  Rights  was  reviewing  about  200  books  considered  potential 
"threats  to  the  country's  unity,"  20  of  them  seriously.  On  October  13, 

2010,  however,  in  a  case  brought  by  a  group  of  prominent  authors,  the 
Constitutional  Court  ruled  against  the  original  1963  decree  that  gave 
the  Attorney  General's  Office  the  authority  to  place  bans  on  specific 
titles  or  on  an  author's  entire  oeuvre,  declaring  instead  that  any  calls 
for  bans  had  to  be  made  through  the  court  system.  The  government 
can  still  proscribe  certain  works  under  a  1966  anticommunist  law,  and 
under  the  2008  antipornography  law,  but  the  practice  of  book  banning 
now  is  far  more  limited  than  in  most  of  the  past  half-century. 

All  of  these  developments  suggest  that  Indonesians  are  busy  adjust- 
ing— and  often  moderating — their  views  of  the  pre- 1998  period, 
reconsidering  some  aspects  and  rejecting  others.  Perhaps  the  most  sur- 
prising evidence  of  this  process  was  the  nomination,  in  mid-October 

201 1,  of  former  President  Suharto  as  a  "national  hero,"  one  of  10  per- 


lvi 


sons  put  forward  by  local  officials.  This  suggestion,  which  was  first 
made  by  a  Jawa  Tengah  district  head  on  the  1,000-day  anniversary  of 
Suharto's  death,  elicited  a  vigorous  debate  in  which  there  was  unex- 
pectedly strong  support  for  Suharto's  rehabilitation  and  recognition. 
Public-opinion  polls  noted  that,  although  the  approval  rating  of  Indo- 
nesia's new  democracy  had  grown  from  42  percent  in  1999  to  70  per- 
cent by  late  2010,  and  few  expressed  any  desire  to  return  to  the  New 
Order,  Suharto  now  seemed  to  command  growing  respect.  In  a  May 
2011  survey,  41  percent  named  him  "Indonesia's  Best  President."  The 
government  finessed  the  national-hero  issue  by  choosing  only  two 
minority  candidates  connected  in  some  way  with  Indonesia's  struggle 
for  independence,  former  cabinet  minister  Johannes  Leimena,  a  Chris- 
tian from  Maluku,  and  military  officer  Johannes  Abraham  Dimara,  a 
Christian  from  Papua. 

The  struggle  against  terrorism  continues  to  occupy  the  government, 
both  within  the  country  and  in  cooperation  with  Asian  neighbors.  In 
March  2011,  for  example,  Indonesian  police  representatives  traveled  to 
Pakistan  with  fingerprints  and  DNA  samples  to  identify  the  recently 
arrested  Umar  Patek,  a  Jemaah  Islamiyah  member  thought  to  be  one  of 
the  masterminds  behind  the  2002  Bali  bombings  and  suspected  of  con- 
nections to  many  other  incidents,  including  an  explosion  in  an  Islamic 
boarding  school  in  Bima,  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat,  on  July  1 1,  201 1 .  As  of 
that  date,  however,  Indonesia  was  still  one  of  three  countries  vying  to 
extradite  him.  The  radical  cleric  Abu  Bakar  Ba'asyir  (also  known  as 
Abu  Bakar  Bashir),  who  was  accused  of  intellectual  leadership  of 
Jemaah  Islamiyah,  charged  in  the  Bali  bombings,  and  served  two  years 
in  prison  before  his  conviction  was  overturned  by  the  Supreme  Court, 
was  again  arrested  in  August  2010  and  later  charged  with  funding  and 
coordinating  a  training  program  for  a  militant  jihadist  group  in  Aceh.  He 
was  tried  in  June  201 1  and  sentenced  to  15  years  in  prison.  Antiterrorist 
forces  maintained  pressure  on  other  suspected  networks  and  individuals, 
but  were  unable  to  prevent  several  local  attacks,  the  most  disturbing  of 
which  probably  was  the  April  2011  suicide  bombing  in  Cirebon,  Jawa 
Tengah  Province,  where  a  young  man  purportedly  angry  at  karaoke  bars 
and  unregistered  places  of  Christian  worship  blew  himself  up  and 
wounded  many  others  in  a  mosque  located  in  a  police  station.  Because  it 
occurred  in  a  place  of  Muslim  worship  and  during  Friday  prayers,  this 
event  is  said  to  have  particularly  shocked  public  opinion. 

News  commentators  and  columnists  agree  that  intolerance  is  on  the 
rise.  The  hardline  group  Islamic  Defenders'  Front  (FPI)  appears 
increasingly  in  reports  of  intimidation  and  often  violent  vigilantism. 
Its  members  have  involved  themselves  in  local  efforts  to  close  down 
"immoral"  businesses,  enforce  fasting  during  Ramadan,  and  protest 


lvii 


against  or  close  down  political  meetings  and  other  activities  sus- 
pected— often  wildly  erroneously — of  being  communist.  Apparently 
spontaneous  outbreaks  of  violence  also  have  occurred,  such  as  a  Feb- 
ruary 201 1  incident  in  Banten,  Jawa  Barat  Province,  in  which  a  crowd 
of  1,500  people  attacked  and  killed  three  members  of  the  unorthodox 
Muslim  group  Ahmadiyah  while  police  stood  by.  In  the  eventual  trial, 
prosecutors  charged  11  participants  jointly  with  inciting  violence  and 
committing  assault  leading  to  death,  but  no  individuals  were  charged 
with  the  actual  killings.  Such  events  pose  a  dilemma  for  both  law- 
enforcement  and  justice  officials,  not  only  because,  as  Muslims,  they 
often  find  it  difficult  to  act  against  "protectors  of  Islam,"  but  also 
because  it  is  often  difficult,  in  Indonesia's  still  relatively  recently 
democratized  society,  to  determine  the  proper  boundary  between  free- 
dom of  expression  and  intolerance. 

Public  reaction  to  violent  and  oppressive  behavior  by  religious  zeal- 
ots appears  to  be  increasingly  negative.  Growing  disapproval  is  most 
notable  where  efforts  to  implement  sharia  are  concerned.  In  Aceh, 
where  in  2010  more  than  800  detentions  were  carried  out  by  the  sharia 
police  and  men  were  forced  to  marry  and  women  to  have  virginity 
tests,  public  dissatisfaction  arose,  and  activists  complained  of  viola- 
tions of  human  rights.  In  the  Bekasi  area  near  Jakarta,  polls  taken 
between  April  2009  and  March  2010  showed  that  individuals  in  favor 
of  the  local  government  implementing  sharia  dropped  from  43  percent 
to  36  percent,  and  those  who  believed  that  thieves  should  have  their 
hands  cut  off  declined  from  38  percent  to  32  percent.  This  and  other 
pieces  of  evidence  may  have  encouraged  police  in  some  areas  to  take 
stronger  stances  with  regard  to  civilian  organizations  such  as  the  FPL 
In  July  2011,  for  example,  the  Jakarta  police  announced  they  would 
take  firm  steps  to  prevent  such  groups  from  attacking  businesses  and 
individuals  who  failed  to  observe  government  regulations  on  certain 
kinds  of  entertainment  during  Ramadan,  emphasizing  that  only  the 
police  are  permitted  to  take  such  action  when  warranted. 

Concerns  over  rising  intolerance  and  the  violence  it  generates  also 
brought  Indonesia's  most  important  Muslim  associations  to  strengthen 
and  better  publicize  their  stands  against  radicalism.  In  its  centennial 
year  and  with  a  membership  of  29  million,  Muhammadiyah  (Followers 
of  Muhammad)  strongly  affirmed  the  ideas  of  former  leader  Ahmad 
Syafii  Maarif,  who  now  promotes  tolerance.  Five  years  earlier, 
Muhammadiyah  appeared  to  be  turning  in  a  more  uncompromising 
direction.  In  July  2011,  Muhammadiyah  announced  that  it  "conveys  an 
Islam  that  says  no  to  conflicts  between  civilizations,  an  Islam  that  fos- 
ters cooperation,  dialog,  a  cosmopolitan  Islam  [that  is]  a  golden  bridge 
for  a  dialog  between  East  and  West."  Barely  a  week  later,  Nahdlatul 


lviii 


Ulama  (Council  of  Scholars),  Indonesia's  largest  Muslim  organization, 
with  80  million  followers,  celebrated  its  eighty-fifth  anniversary  by 
announcing  that  it  would  begin  a  campaign  for  a  peaceful,  tolerant 
Islam,  and  argued  that  "Democracy  is  the  best  tool  to  improve  people's 
welfare  and  to  keep  the  nation  united."  Nahdlatul  Ulama's  youth  orga- 
nization— Ansor  (Helpers  of  Muhammad) — also  announced  that,  in 
response  to  the  Cirebon  mosque  bombing,  it  was  forming  a  special 
antiterrorist  unit  called  Detachment  99,  after  the  antiterrorism  branch 
of  the  national  police,  Detachment  88. 

Neither  unresolved  social  problems  nor  threats  of  turbulence  seem  to 
have  affected  economic  performance.  In  2010  Indonesia's  economy 
grew  6.1  percent,  foreign  investment  rose  52  percent  to  US$16.2  billion, 
the  stock  market  rose  20  percent  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  and  the 
rupiah  (Rp — see  Glossary)  appreciated  nearly  5  percent  against  the  U.S. 
dollar.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2011,  Moody's  and  Standard  and  Poor's 
raised  the  nation's  sovereign  debt  rating  to  BB+,  or  just  one  level  below 
investment  grade.  Strength  within  the  Asian  sphere  was  particularly 
marked.  For  example,  the  largest  share  of  foreign  investment  came  from 
member  countries  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations 
(ASEAN — see  Glossary),  and,  as  of  late  2010,  Indonesia  was  poised  to 
become  the  world's  largest  manufacturer  of  footwear,  as  more  companies 
from  Taiwan  and  South  Korea  relocated  there. 

Still,  15  percent  of  Indonesia's  population  lives  below  the  poverty 
line  of  US$1  per  day.  In  recognition  of  this  disparity,  President  Yud- 
hoyono  began  201 1  by  outlining  the  government's  "growth  with  equity" 
philosophy  of  planning.  Then,  in  a  powerful  and  well-received  special 
address  entitled  "The  Big  Shift  and  the  Imperative  of  21st  Century  Glo- 
balism,"  delivered  at  the  World  Economic  Forum  in  Davos,  Switzer- 
land, on  January  27,  201 1,  he  called  for  a  new  sense  of  globalism  that  is 
"open-minded,  pragmatic,  adaptive  and  innovative,"  a  globalism  in 
which  regional  groupings  play  a  crucial  role  in  supplying  both  dyna- 
mism and  restraint.  The  world  economy,  he  stated,  should  be  managed 
"so  that  it  functions  to  meet  our  needs  rather  than  satisfying  our  greed," 
and  he  repeated  Indonesia's  own  national  goal  of  "growth  with  equity," 
implying  that  the  world  community  could  well  aim  for  something  simi- 
lar. Indonesia  took  up  the  chair  of  ASEAN  in  2011,  and  it  was  clear  on 
the  eve  of  the  organization's  annual  meeting  in  late  July  201 1  that  Indo- 
nesia would  use  that  opportunity  to  emphasize  the  same  themes  and 
enhance  its  growing  international  reputation  as  a  political  and  economic 
power  to  be  reckoned  with. 

The  United  States  has  recognized  the  growing  importance  of  Indone- 
sia, as  well  as  a  deepening  rivalry  with  China  for  influence  there.  In 
November  2010,  the  U.S.  president,  Barack  Obama,  visited  Indonesia  to 


lix 


underscore  the  significance  of  improved  relations  between  the  two  coun- 
tries, and  to  launch  what  was  termed  a  U.S -Indonesian  Comprehensive 
Partnership,  which,  it  was  emphasized,  should  be  a  partnership  of  equals, 
covering,  among  other  things,  a  much-expanded  program  of  educational 
exchange,  expanded  cooperation  in  security  issues,  and  efforts  to 
improve  trade.  President  Obama's  twice-postponed  visit,  although  brief, 
was  special  because  he  was  returning  to  the  place  he  had  lived  for  four 
years  as  a  boy.  His  speech  at  Universitas  Indonesia  included  lofty  ideas 
on  development,  democracy,  and  religious  tolerance  and  was  quickly 
compared  to  his  inspiring  "New  Beginning"  speech  in  Cairo  in  2009.  But 
what  the  majority  of  Indonesians  seemed  to  notice  and  appreciate  most 
was  that  when  Obama  spoke  about  the  changes  that  had  taken  place  in 
Indonesia  since  the  late  1960s,  he  did  so  first-hand  and  in  colorful  detail. 
Above  all,  perhaps,  it  was  noticed  that  he  appeared  to  have  a  genuine 
attachment  to  the  country  and  its  people;  when  he  said  simply,  "Indonesia 
is  a  part  of  me,"  a  great  many  Indonesians,  including  press  and  television 
pundits,  responded  emotionally. 

Indonesia  continued  to  experience  a  high  level  of  volcanic  activity. 
In  late  August  2010,  Mount  Sinabung,  near  Karo,  Sumatera  Utara 
Province,  erupted  for  the  first  time  in  410  years,  and  in  2011  notewor- 
thy eruptions  occurred  in  Java  and  Sulawesi.  The  extended  series  of 
eruptions  at  Mount  Merapi  in  late  2010  caused  evacuations  of  more 
than  135,000  people  and  more  than  300  deaths  near  Yogyakarta.  In 
addition,  there  were  earthquakes,  the  largest  of  which  occurred  in  Octo- 
ber 2010,  when  an  underwater  quake  off  the  Mentawai  Islands,  Suma- 
tera Barat  Province,  registered  a  magnitude  of  7.7  and  produced  a  tsu- 
nami estimated  to  have  killed  more  than  300  people. 

Finally,  several  important  personalities  who  helped  define  modern 
Indonesia  passed  from  the  scene.  Akhdiat  Miharja,  a  key  figure  in  liter- 
ature during  the  1940s  and  1950s,  died  at  age  99  on  July  8,  2010.  Iwan 
Tirta  (also  known  as  Nusyirwan  Tirtaamijaya),  who  had  revitalized 
batik  design  and  brought  Indonesia  batik  international  recognition,  died 
at  the  age  of  75  on  July  31,  2010.  Des  Alwi,  one  of  the  last  figures  of 
the  revolutionary  period  (he  was  the  adopted  son  of  Mohammad  Hatta 
and  a  close  associate  of  Sutan  Syahrir),  and  later  diplomat  and  writer, 
died  just  before  his  eighty-third  birthday  on  November  13,  2010.  Rosi- 
han  Anwar,  legendary  reporter,  columnist,  and  public  intellectual,  was 
88  when  he  died  on  April  14,  201 1.  And  Franky  Sahilatua,  who  played 
an  important  role  in  popularizing  voguish  music  of  social  criticism  dur- 
ing the  Suharto  era,  died  at  57  on  April  20,  201 1.

DEBATE  ABOUT  THE  NATURE  of  Indonesia's  past  and  its  rela- 
tionship to  a  national  identity  preceded  by  many  decades  the  Repub- 
lic's proclamation  of  independence  in  1945,  and  it  has  continued  in 
different  forms  and  with  varying  degrees  of  intensity  ever  since.  But 
beginning  in  the  late  1990s,  the  polemic  intensified,  becoming  more 
polarized  and  entangled  in  political  conflict.  Historical  issues  took 
on  an  immediacy  and  a  moral  character  they  had  not  earlier  pos- 
sessed, and  historical  answers  to  the  questions,  "What  is  Indonesia?" 
and  "Who  is  an  Indonesian?"  became,  for  the  first  time,  part  of  a 
period  of  widespread  public  introspection.  Notably,  too,  this  was  a 
discussion  in  which  foreign  observers  of  Indonesian  affairs  had  an 
important  voice. 

There  are  two  main  views  in  this  debate.  In  one  of  them,  contem- 
porary Indonesia,  both  as  an  idea  and  as  a  reality,  appears  in  some 
degree  misconceived,  and  contemporary  "official"  readings  of  its  his- 
tory fundamentally  wrong.  In  large  part,  this  is  a  perspective  originat- 
ing with  the  political  left,  which  seeks,  among  other  things,  to  correct 
its  brutal  eclipse  from  national  life  since  1965.  But  it  also  has  been, 
often  for  rather  different  reasons,  a  dominant  perspective  among 
Muslim  intellectuals  and  foreign  observers  disenchanted  with  the 
military-dominated  government  of  Suharto's  New  Order  (1966-98) 
or  disappointed  with  the  perceived  failures  of  Indonesian  nationalism 
in  general.  The  foreign  observers,  for  example,  increasingly  empha- 
sized to  their  audiences  that  "in  the  beginning  there  was  no  Indone- 
sia," portraying  it  as  "an  unlikely  nation,"  a  "nation  in  waiting,"  or  an 
"unfinished  nation,"  suggesting  that  contemporary  national  unity  was 
a  unidimensional,  neocolonial,  New  Order  construction  too  fragile  to 
long  survive  the  fall  of  that  government. 

An  alternative  view,  reflecting  government-guided  textbook  ver- 
sions of  the  national  past,  defines  Indonesia  primarily  by  its  long 
anticolonial  struggle  and  focuses  on  integrative,  secular,  and  tran- 
scendent "mainstream"  nationalist  perspectives.  In  this  epic,  linear, 
and  often  hyperpatriotic  conception  of  the  past,  Indonesia  is  the  out- 
come of  a  singular,  inevitable,  and  more  or  less  self-evident  histori- 
cal process,  into  which  internal  difference  and  conflict  have  been 
absorbed,  and  on  which  the  national  character  and  unity  depend. 
Some  foreign  writers,  often  without  fully  realizing  it,  are  inclined  to 
accept,  without  much  questioning,  the  essentials  of  this  story  of  the 
development  of  the  nation  and  its  historical  identity. 

Both  of  these  views  came  into  question  in  the  first  decade  of  the 
twenty-first  century.  On  the  one  hand,  Indonesia's  persistence  for 


3 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

more  than  60  years  as  a  unitary  nation-state,  and  its  ability  to  survive 
both  the  political,  social,  and  economic  upheavals  and  the  natural 
disasters  that  followed  the  New  Order,  have  driven  many  foreign 
specialists  to  try  to  account  for  this  outcome.  Both  they  and  Indone- 
sians themselves  found  reason  to  attempt  a  more  nuanced  reevalua- 
tion  of  such  topics  as  the  role  of  violence  and  the  various  forms  of 
nationalism  in  contemporary  society.  On  the  other  hand,  a  general 
recognition  took  hold  that  monolithic  readings  of  Indonesia's 
(national)  historical  identity  fit  neither  past  facts  nor  contemporary 
sensibilities.  In  particular,  *  Indonesian  intellectuals'  penchant  for 
attempting  to  "straighten  out  history"  (menyelusuri  sejarah)  began 
to  be  recognized  largely  as  an  exercise  in  replacing  one  singular  per- 
spective with  another.  Some  younger  historians  have  begun  to  ques- 
tion the  nature  and  purpose  of  a  unitary  "national"  history,  and  to 
search  for  ways  to  incorporate  more  diverse  views  into  their 
approaches.  Although  it  is  still  too  early  to  determine  where  these 
realignments  and  efforts  at  reinterpretation  will  lead,  it  is  clear  that 
in  contemporary  Indonesia,  history  is  recognized  as  a  key  to  under- 
standing the  present  and  future  nation,  but  it  can  no  longer  be 
approached  in  the  monolithic  and  often  ideological  terms  so  com- 
mon in  the  past. 

Origins 

Early  Inhabitation 

Indonesia  consists  of  parts  of  the  Sunda  Shelf,  extending  from 
mainland  Asia  and  forming  the  world's  largest  submerged  continen- 
tal shelf;  a  deep-water  channel  charting  what  is  known  as  Wallace's 
Line  roughly  running  between  the  islands  of  Kalimantan  and 
Sulawesi,  and  between  the  islands  of  Bali  and  Lombok;  and  parts  of 
the  Sahul  Shelf,  an  extension  of  Australia  (see  The  Geographic  Con- 
text, ch.  2).  Despite  arcs  of  frequent  volcanic  activity  and  patterns  of 
rising  and  falling  sea  levels,  this  has  been  a  favored  region  for  mod- 
ern humans  and  their  hominid  predecessors  for  nearly  2  million 
years.  Today  Indonesia  is  of  crucial  importance  to  the  study  of 
human  origins  and  evolution.  Sites  in  central  Java,  such  as  Sangiran 
and  Ngandong,  now  account  for  about  75  percent  of  the  world's 
examples  of  homo  erectus,  an  early  hominid  type.  Most  recently,  the 
2004  announcement  of  discoveries  on  the  island  of  Flores  (between 
Bali  and  Timor)  created  international  controversy  because  they  sug- 
gested an  entirely  new,  locally  evolved,  and  distinctively  smaller 
hominid  form  overlapping  chronologically  with  both  homo  erectus 
and  modern  humans.

Historical  Setting 


About  800,000  years  ago,  some  early  hominids  of  the  archipelago 
made  stone  tools,  constructed  water  craft  sophisticated  enough  to 
cross  25  kilometers  of  rough  sea  channel,  and  may  have  used  fire 
and  language.  About  600,000  years  ago,  a  fairly  sophisticated  hom- 
inid  culture  was  widely  distributed  throughout  what  is  now  Indone- 
sia. The  earliest  modern  humans  cannot  currently  be  firmly  dated 
before  about  40,000  years  ago,  but  some  specialists  argue  either  that 
they  appeared  much  earlier  (as  much  as  90,000  years  ago)  in  a  rapid 
dispersal  from  Africa,  or  that  they  evolved  independently  in  East  or 
Southeast  Asia  from  existing  hominid  stock.  Whatever  the  case, 
Indonesia's  earliest  modern  humans  did  not  immediately  or  every- 
where displace  their  hominid  relatives  but  coexisted  with  them  for 
tens  of  thousands  of  years.  The  earliest  modes  of  their  existence 
show  little  evidence  of  having  deviated  markedly  from  those  of  their 
predecessors.  A  pattern  evolved  of  small  hunting-fishing-foraging 
communities  depending  on  tools  made  of  shell,  wood,  bamboo,  and 
stone,  adapting  to  a  wide  variety  of  ecological  niches  and  remaining 
in  contact  with  neighboring  peoples  over  land  and  sea. 

One  center  of  these  societies  was  in  the  northern  Maluku  and 
Papua  region,  where  between  20,000  and  about  9,000  years  ago 
there  is  evidence  of  long-distance  trade  (for  example,  in  obsidian, 
used  for  making  cutting  tools),  deliberate  horticulture,  and  the  trans- 
port of  plants  (bananas,  taro,  palms)  and  animals  (wallabies,  flying 
squirrels)  used  as  food  sources.  Possibly  these  communities  also 
used  sails  and  outriggers  on  their  boats. 

Social  and  Cultural  Developments 

About  10,000  years  ago,  the  last  ice  age  began  to  recede  and  seas 
rose,  eventually  creating  from  the  Sunda  Shelf  the  archipelago  we 
know  today.  The  next  six  or  seven  millennia  saw  the  development  of 
cultural  and  social  characteristics  that  have  been  of  lasting  significance 
down  to  the  present.  Examples  include  the  use  throughout  the  archi- 
pelago of  languages  belonging  to  the  same  family  (Austronesian);  the 
spread  of  rice  agriculture  and  sedentary  life,  and  of  ceramic  and  (later) 
metal  technologies;  the  expansion  of  long-distance  seaborne  travel  and 
trade;  and  the  persistence  of  diverse  but  interacting  societies  with 
widely  varying  levels  of  technological  and  cultural  complexity. 

There  is  no  entirely  secure  understanding  of  how  and  why  these 
changes  took  place.  The  most  widely  held  view,  based  heavily  on 
historical  linguistics,  argues  that  about  6,500  years  ago  peoples 
whom  scholars  identify  linguistically  and  culturally  as  "Austrone- 
sians"  dispersed  out  of  present-day  southern  China  and  Taiwan.  In  a 
fairly  rapid  process,  they  spread  throughout  the  archipelago  from  the 


5 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Philippines  (which  they  reached  by  3,000  BC)  to  Indonesia  (2,000- 
500  BC),  and  then  farther  west  as  far  as  Madagascar  and  farther  east 
throughout  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Prehistory  expert  Peter  Bellwood  has 
characterized  this  dispersal  as  "one  of  the  most  astonishing  bouts  of 
colonization  ...  in  early  human  history."  Recent  genetic  and  paleo- 
ecological  research  has  raised  a  number  of  challenges  to  this  model, 
however,  among  them  counterindicative  DNA  configurations  in 
archipelagic  and  Pacific  populations  of  both  humans  and  pigs,  and 
indications  of  forest  clearing  in  Sumatra  as  early  as  5,000  years  ago. 
These  challenges  suggest  a  more  "entangled"  and  complicated  pro- 
cess of  change  in  which  old  and  new  populations,  as  well  as  their  tra- 
ditions and  technologies,  interacted  in  many  different  ways  over  a 
long  period  of  time. 

Evidence  regarding  social  transformations  during  this  period  is  at 
best  indirect  (and  for  Java  and  Sumatra,  virtually  absent),  but  caus- 
ative models  from  European  and  continental  Asian  prehistory  seem 
rarely  to  apply  to  the  archipelago.  Neither  knowledge  of  agriculture 
nor  contact  with  outsiders  always  resulted  in  technological  revolu- 
tion, for  example,  or  rapid  alteration  in  patterns  of  settlement.  Politi- 
cal and  economic  changes  occurred  unevenly,  and  societies — in  all 
likelihood  small,  animist  chieftainships — underwent  no  fundamental 
transformation.  Thus  the  archipelago  came  to  be  marked  by  a  pattern 
of  broad  linguistic  and  cultural  affinities  but,  at  the  same  time,  intri- 
cate diversity.  Virtually  all  of  Indonesia's  subsequent  history  has  been 
played  out  against  the  background  of  this  remarkable  human  web. 

Expanding  Networks 

Many  parts  of  the  archipelago  played  a  role  in  local  and  wider 
trading  networks  from  early  times,  and  some  were  further  connected 
to  interregional  routes  reaching  much  farther  corners  of  the  globe. 
Nearly  4,000  years  ago,  cloves — which  until  the  seventeenth  century 
grew  nowhere  else  in  the  world  except  five  small  islands  in 
Maluku — had  made  their  way  to  kitchens  in  present-day  Syria.  By 
about  the  same  time,  items  such  as  shells,  pottery,  marble,  and  other 
stones;  ingots  of  tin,  copper,  and  gold;  and  quantities  of  many  food 
goods  were  traded  over  a  wide  area  in  Southeast  Asia.  As  early  as  the 
fourth  century  BC,  materials  from  South  Asia,  the  Mediterranean 
world,  and  China — ceramics,  glass  and  stone  beads,  and  coins — 
began  to  show  up  in  the  archipelago.  In  the  already  well-developed 
regional  trade,  bronze  vessels  and  other  objects,  such  as  the  spectacu- 
lar kettledrums  produced  first  in  Dong  Son  (northern  Vietnam),  circu- 
lated in  the  island  world,  appearing  after  the  second  century  BC  from 
Sumatra  to  Bali  and  from  Kalimantan  and  Sulawesi  to  the  eastern  part

Historical  Setting 


of  Maluku.  Around  2,000  years  ago,  Javanese  and  Balinese  were 
themselves  producing  elegant  bronze  ware,  which  was  traded  widely 
and  has  been  found  in  Sumatra,  Madura,  and  Maluku.  In  all  of  this 
trade,  including  that  with  the  furthest  destinations,  peoples  of  the 
archipelago  appear  to  have  dominated,  not  only  as  producers  and  con- 
sumers or  sellers  and  buyers,  but  as  shipbuilders  and  owners,  naviga- 
tors, and  crew.  The  principal  dynamic  originated  in  the  archipelago. 
This  is  an  important  point,  for  historians  have  often  mistakenly  seen 
both  the  trade  itself  and  the  changes  that  stemmed  from  it  in  subse- 
quent centuries  as  primarily  the  work  of  outsiders,  leaving  Indone- 
sians with  little  historical  agency,  an  error  often  repeated  in  assessing 
the  origins  and  flow  of  change  in  more  recent  times  as  well. 

By  the  middle  of  the  first  millennium  BC,  the  expansion  of  wet-rice 
agriculture  and,  apparently  more  importantly,  certain  requirements  of 
trade  such  as  the  control  of  local  commodities,  suggested  new  social 
and  political  possibilities,  which  were  seized  by  some  communities. 
For  reasons  not  well  understood,  most — and  all  of  those  that 
endured — were  located  in  the  western  archipelago.  Already  acquainted 
with  a  wider  world,  these  Indonesians  were  open  to,  and  indeed 
actively  sought  out,  new  ideas  of  political  legitimation,  social  control, 
and  religious  and  artistic  expression.  Their  principal  sources  lay  not  in 
China,  with  which  ancient  Indonesians  were  certainly  acquainted,  but 
in  South  Asia,  in  present-day  India  and  Sri  Lanka,  whose  outlooks 
appear  to  have  more  nearly  reflected  their  own.  This  process  of  adop- 
tion and  adaptation,  which  scholars  have  somewhat  misleadingly 
referred  to  as  a  rather  singular  "Hinduization"  or  "Indianization,"  is 
perhaps  better  understood  as  one  of  localization  or  "Indonesianization" 
of  multiple  South  Asian  traditions.  It  involved  much  local  selection 
and  accommodation  (there  were  no  Indian  colonizations),  and  it 
undoubtedly  began  many  centuries  before  its  first  fruits  are  clearly  vis- 
ible through  the  archaeological  record.  Early  Indonesia  did  not  become 
a  mini-India.  Artistic  and  religious  borrowings  were  never  exact  repli- 
cations, and  many  key  Indie  concepts,  such  as  those  of  caste  and  the 
subordinate  social  position  of  women  were  not  accepted.  Selected 
ideas  filled  particular  needs  or  appealed  to  particular  sensibilities,  yet 
at  the  same  time  they  were  anything  but  superficial;  the  remnants  of 
their  further  elaboration  are  still  very  much  in  evidence  today. 

Early  Hegemonies 

The  Earliest  Historical  Records 

Although  some  Indonesian  peoples  probably  began  writing  on  perish- 
able materials  at  an  earlier  date,  the  first  stone  inscriptions  (in  Sanskrit 


7 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

using  an  early  Pallava  script  from  southern  India)  date  from  the  end  of 
the  fourth  century  AD  (in  the  eastern  Kalimantan  locale  of  Kutai)  and 
from  the  early  or  mid-fifth  century  AD  (in  the  western  Java  polity 
known  as  Taruma).  These  inscriptions  offer  a  glimpse  of  leaders  newly 
envisioning  themselves  not  as  mere  chiefs  (datu)  but  as  kings  or  over- 
lords {raja,  maharaja),  taking  Indie  names  and  employing  first  Brah- 
manical  Hindu,  then  Buddhist,  concepts  and  rituals  to  invent  new 
traditions  justifying  their  rule  over  newly  conceived  social  and  political 
hierarchies.  In  addition,  Chinese  records  from  about  the  same  time  pro- 
vide scattered,  although  not  always  reliable,  information  about  a  number 
of  other  "kingdoms"  on  Sumatra,  Java,  southwestern  Kalimantan,  and 
southern  Sulawesi,  which,  in  the  expanding  trade  opportunities  of  the 
early  fifth  century,  had  begun  to  compete  with  each  other  for  advantage, 
but  we  know  little  else  about  them.  Historians  have  commonly  under- 
stood these  very  limited  data  to  indicate  the  beginnings  of  the  formation 
of  "states,"  and  later  "empires"  in  the  archipelago,  but  use  of  such  terms 
is  problematic.  We  understand  that  small  and  loosely  organized  commu- 
nities consolidated  and  expanded  their  reach,  some  a  great  deal  more 
successfully  than  others,  but  even  in  the  best-known  cases  we  do  not 
have  sufficient  specific  knowledge  of  how  these  entities  actually  worked 
to  compare  them  confidently  with,  for  example,  the  states  and  empires  of 
the  Mediterranean  region  during  the  same  period  or  earlier.  More  gener- 
alized terms,  such  as  "polities"  or  "hegemonies,"  are  suggestive  of  social 
and  political  models  that  are  more  applicable. 

Srivijaya  and  Mataram 

Srivijaya 

Two  great  hegemonies  dominate  the  period  from  about  the  mid- 
sixth  to  eleventh  centuries.  The  first  is  known  as  Srivijaya,  a  Bud- 
dhist trading  kingship  centered  on  the  region  of  today's  city  of 
Palembang,  on  the  Musi  River  in  present-day  Sumatera  Selatan 
Province.  At  its  zenith  in  the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries,  Srivijaya 
extended  its  commercial  sway  from  approximately  the  southern  half 
of  Sumatra  and  the  Strait  of  Malacca  to  western  Java  and  southern 
Kalimantan,  and  its  influence  as  far  away  as  locations  on  the  Malay 
Peninsula,  present-day  southern  Thailand,  eastern  Kalimantan,  and 
southern  Sulawesi  (see  fig.  2).  It  probably  arose  out  of  policies  of 
war  and  alliance  applied,  perhaps  rather  suddenly,  by  one  local  entity 
to  a  number  of  trading  partners  and  competitors.  The  process  is 
thought  to  have  coincided  with  newly  important  direct  sea  trade  with 
China  in  the  sixth  century,  and  by  the  second  half  of  the  seventh  cen- 
tury Srivijaya  had  become  a  wealthy  and  culturally  important  Asian

power.  The  Chinese  pilgrim  Yijing  (635-713),  who  briefly  visited 
Srivijaya  in  671  and  687  and  then  lived  there  from  687  to  695,  rec- 
ommended it  as  a  world-class  center  of  Buddhist  studies.  Inscrip- 
tions from  the  680s,  written  in  Pallava  script  and  the  indigenous  Old 
Malay  language  (forerunner  of  contemporary  Bahasa  Indonesia — 
see  Glossary),  identified  the  realm  and  its  ruler  by  name  and 
demanded  the  loyalty  of  allies  by  pronouncing  elaborate  threats  and 
curses. 

Srivijaya's  preeminence  depended  in  part  on  exercising  a  degree 
of  control  over  the  burgeoning  commerce  moving  through  the  Strait 
of  Malacca.  This  it  accomplished  by  mobilizing  the  policing  capabil- 
ities of  small  communities  of  seafaring  orang  laut  (Malay  for  sea 
people),  providing  facilities  and  protection  in  exchange  for  reason- 
able tax  rates  on  maritime  traders,  and  maintaining  favorable  rela- 
tions with  inland  peoples  who  were  the  source  of  food  and  many  of 
the  trade  goods  on  which  commerce  of  the  day  was  built.  But  Srivi- 
jaya also  promoted  itself  as  a  commanding  cultural  center  in  which 
ideas  from  all  over  Buddhist  Asia  circulated  and  were  redistributed 
as  far  as  away  Vietnam,  Tibet,  and  Japan. 

Mataram 

The  second  great  hegemony,  known  as  Mataram,  arose  as  Srivi- 
jaya began  to  flourish  in  the  early  eighth  century,  in  south-central 
Java  on  the  Kedu  Plain  and  southern  slopes  of  Mount  Merapi 
(Gunung  Merapi).  Mataram's  early  formation  is  obscure  and  compli- 
cated by  the  rivalry  of  two  interrelated  lines  of  aspiring  paramount 
rulers,  one  supporting  Shivaist  Hinduism  (the  Sanjaya)  and  the  other 
supporting  Mahayana  Buddhism  (the  Sailendra,  who  had  commer- 
cial and  family  connections  with  Srivijaya).  At  some  point  between 
824  and  856,  these  lines  were  joined  by  marriage,  probably  as  part  of 
a  process  by  which  the  leaders  of  local  communities  (rakai  or 
rabyan)  were  incorporated  into  larger  hierarchies  with  rulers,  pal- 
aces, and  court  structures.  In  this  process,  the  construction  of  elabo- 
rately carved  stone  structures  (candi)  connecting  local  powers  with 
Buddhist  or  Hindu  worldviews  played  an  important  role.  The  best 
known  and  most  impressive  of  these  are  the  Borobudur,  the  largest 
Buddhist  edifice  in  the  ancient  world  (constructed  between  about 
770  and  820  and  located  northwest  of  present-day  Yogyakarta)  and 
the  magnificent  complex  of  Hindu  structures  at  Prambanan,  located 
east  of  Yogyakarta  and  completed  a  quarter-century  later.  These  and 
hundreds  of  other  monuments  built  over  a  comparatively  short 
stretch  of  time  in  the  eighth  and  ninth  centuries  suggest  that  Javanese 
and  Indie  (Buddhist  and  Hindu)  ideas  about  power  and  spirituality

both  competed  and  intermingled  in  a  dynamic  political  and  religious 
atmosphere. 

Scholars  have  generally  identified  a  highly  productive  irrigated 
rice  agriculture  as  the  principal  source  of  Mataram's  power,  seeing  it 
as  a  kind  of  inland,  inward-looking  antithesis  to  an  outward-oriented, 
maritime  Srivijaya,  but  such  a  distinction  is  overdrawn.  Central  Java

was  linked  from  a  very  early  date  to  a  larger  world  of  commerce  and 
culture,  through  connections  with  ports  not  far  away  on  Java's  north 
coast.  Like  Srivijaya,  Chinese,  Indian,  and  other  students  of  Buddhist 
and  Hindu  thought  visited  Mataram,  and  Javanese  ships  traded  and 
made  war  against  competitors  in  the  archipelago  (including  Srivijaya) 
and  as  far  away  as  present-day  Cambodia,  Vietnam,  and  probably  the 
Philippines.  Mataram  was  certainly  not  isolated  from  the  wider 
world,  and  in  some  respects  its  commercial  life  may  have  been  more 
sophisticated  than  that  of  its  Sumatran  contemporary,  as  it  made  com- 
mon use  of  gold  and  silver  monetary  units  by  the  mid-ninth  century, 
some  200  years  earlier  than  Srivijaya.  Politically,  the  two  hegemonies 
were  probably  more  alike  than  different.  The  rulers  of  both  saw  them- 
selves and  their  courts  {kedatuan,  keratuan,  or  kratori)  as  central  to  a 
land  or  realm  (bhumi),  which,  in  turn,  formed  the  core  of  a  larger, 
borderless,  but  concentric  and  hierarchically  organized  arrangement 
of  authority.  In  this  greater  mandala,  an  Indic-influenced  representa- 
tion of  a  sort  of  idealized,  "galactic"  order,  a  ruler  emerged  from  con- 
stellations of  local  powers  and  ruled  by  virtue  of  neither  inheritance 
nor  divine  descent,  but  rather  through  a  combination  of  charisma 
(semangat),  strategic  family  relationships,  calculated  manipulation  of 
order  and  disorder,  and  the  invocation  of  spiritual  ideas  and  supernat- 
ural forces.  The  exercise  of  power  was  never  absolute,  and  would-be 
rulers  and  (if  they  were  to  command  loyalty)  their  supporters  had  to 
take  seriously  both  the  distribution  of  benefits  (rather  than  merely  the 
application  of  force  or  fear)  and  the  provision  of  an  "exemplary  cen- 
ter" enhancing  cultural  and  intellectual  life.  In  Mataram,  overlords 
and  their  courts  do  not,  for  example,  appear  to  have  controlled  either 
irrigation  systems  or  the  system  of  weekly  markets,  which  remained 
the  purview  of  those  who  dominated  local  regions  (watak)  and  their 
populations.  This  sort  of  political  arrangement  was  at  once  fragile  and 
remarkably  supple,  depending  on  the  ruler  and  a  host  of  surrounding 
circumstances. 

Very  little  is  known  about  social  realities  in  Srivijaya  and  Mataram, 
and  most  of  what  is  written  is  based  on  conjecture.  With  the  exception 
of  the  religious  structures  on  Java,  these  societies  were  constructed  of 
perishable  materials  that  have  not  survived  the  centuries  of  destruc- 
tive climate  and  insects.  There  are  no  remains  of  either  palaces  or 
ordinary  houses,  for  example,  and  we  must  rely  on  rare  finds  of  jew- 
elry and  other  fine  metalworking  (such  as  the  famous  Wonosobo 
hoard,  found  near  Prambanan  in  1991),  and  on  the  stone  reliefs  on  the 
Borobudur  and  a  handful  of  other  structures,  to  attempt  to  guess  what 
these  societies  may  have  been  like.  (The  vast  majority  of  these 
remains  are  Javanese.)  A  striking  characteristic  of  both  Srivijaya  and 
Mataram  in  this  period  is  that  neither — and  none  of  their  smaller 


11

rivals — appear  to  have  developed  settlements  recognizable  as  urban 
from  either  Western  or  Asian  traditions.  On  the  whole,  despite  evi- 
dence of  socioeconomic  well-being  and  cultural  sophistication,  insti- 
tutionally Srivijaya  and  Mataram  remained  essentially  webs  of 
clanship  and  patronage,  chieftainships  carried  to  their  highest  and 
most  expansive  level. 

The  Rise  and  Fall  of  Majapahit 

Successor  Kingdoms  of  Java 

During  the  first  decades  of  the  tenth  century,  Java's  center  of 
political  gravity  shifted  decisively  from  the  island's  south-central 
portion  to  the  lower  valley  and  delta  regions  of  eastern  Java's  Bran- 
tas  River.  The  move  reflected  the  Sanjaya  line's  long-term  interest  in 
eastward  expansion,  a  reaction  to  increasingly  frequent  volcanic 
activity  in  central  Java  between  the  880s  and  920s,  and  economic 
rivalry  with  Srivijaya.  Eastern  Java  was  a  rich  rice-growing  region 
and  was  also  closer  to  the  source  of  Malukan  spices,  which  had 
become  trade  items  of  growing  importance.  By  the  early  eleventh 
century,  Srivijaya  had  been  weakened  by  decades  of  warfare  with 
Java  and  a  devastating  defeat  in  1025  at  the  hands  of  the  Cola,  a 
Tamil  (south  Indian)  maritime  power.  As  Srivijaya's  hegemony 
ebbed,  a  tide  of  Javanese  paramountcy  rose  on  the  strength  of  a 
series  of  eastern  Java  kingdoms  beginning  with  that  of  Airlangga  (r. 
1010^2),  with  its  kraton  at  Kahuripan,  not  far  from  present-day 
Surabaya,  Jawa  Timur  Province.  A  number  of  smaller  realms  fol- 
lowed, the  best-known  of  which  are  Kediri  (mid-eleventh  to  early 
thirteenth  centuries)  and  Singhasari  (thirteenth  century),  with  their 
centers  on  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Brantas  River,  on  the  west  and 
east  of  the  slopes  of  Mount  Kawi  (Gunung  Kawi),  respectively. 

In  this  region,  continued  population  growth,  political  and  military 
rivalries,  and  economic  expansion  produced  important  changes  in 
Javanese  society.  Taken  together,  these  changes  laid  the  groundwork 
for  what  has  often  been  identified  as  Java's — and  Indonesia's — 
"golden  age"  in  the  fourteenth  century.  In  Kediri,  for  example,  there 
developed  a  multilayered  bureaucracy  and  a  professional  army.  The 
ruler  extended  control  over  transportation  and  irrigation  and  culti- 
vated the  arts  in  order  to  enhance  his  own  reputation  and  that  of  the 
court  as  a  brilliant  and  unifying  cultural  hub.  The  Old  Javanese  liter- 
ary tradition  of  the  kakawin  (long  narrative  poem)  rapidly  devel- 
oped, moving  away  from  the  Sanskrit  models  of  the  previous  era  and 
producing  many  key  works  in  the  classical  canon.  Kediri 's  military 
and  economic  influence  spread  to  parts  of  Kalimantan  and  Sulawesi.

In  Singhasari,  which  defeated  Kediri  in  1222,  there  arose  an  aggres- 
sive system  of  state  control,  moving  in  new  ways  to  incorporate 
local  lords'  rights  and  lands  under  royal  control  and  fostering  the 
growth  of  mystical  Hindu-Buddhist  state  cults  devoted  to  the  powers 
of  the  ruler,  who  came  to  be  accorded  divine  status. 

Founding  and  Growth  of  Majapahit,  1268-1389 

The  greatest  and  most  controversial  of  these  kings  was  Kertanagara 
(r.  1268-92),  the  first  Javanese  ruler  to  be  accorded  the  title  of  dewa- 
prabu  (literally,  god-king),  largely  by  force  or  threat,  Kertanagara 
brought  most  of  eastern  Java  under  his  control  and  then  carried  his 
military  campaigns  overseas,  notably  to  Srivijaya's  successor,  Melayu 
(then  also  known  as  Jambi),  with  a  huge  naval  expedition  in  1275,  to 
Bali  in  1282,  and  to  areas  in  western  Java,  Madura,  and  the  Malay 
Peninsula.  These  imperial  ambitions  proved  difficult  and  expensive, 
however:  the  realm  was  perennially  troubled  by  dissent  at  court  and 
rebellion  both  at  home  and  in  the  subjugated  territories.  Much  farther 
afield,  Kertanagara  had  provoked  the  new  Mongol  rulers  of  Yuan 
Dynasty  (1279-1368)  China  to  attempt  to  check  his  expansion,  which 
they  considered  a  threat  to  the  region.  But  before  their  fleet  of  alleg- 
edly 1,000  ships  and  100,000  men  could  land  on  Java,  Kertanagara 
had  been  assassinated  by  a  vengeful  descendent  of  the  Kediri  kings, 
and  in  the  convoluted  events  that  followed,  Kertanagara's  son-in-law, 
Raden  Wijaya,  succeeded  in  defeating  both  his  father-in-law's  princi- 
pal rival  and  the  Mongol  forces.  In  1294  Wijaya  ascended  the  throne 
as  Kertarajasa,  ruler  of  the  new  kingdom  of  Majapahit. 

Majapahit  is  generally  regarded  as  having  been  the  largest  pre- 
modern  state  in  the  archipelago,  and  perhaps  the  most  extensive  in  all 
of  Southeast  Asia.  At  its  zenith  under  the  fourth  ruler,  Hayam  Wuruk 
(known  posthumously  as  Rajasanagara,  r.  1350-89),  and  his  chief 
minister,  the  former  military  officer  Gajah  Mada  (in  office  1331-64), 
Majapahit 's  authority  appears  to  have  extended  over  20  eastern  Java 
polities  as  direct  royal  domain;  tributaries  extending  beyond  those 
claimed  by  Singhasari  on  Java,  Bali,  Sumatra,  Kalimantan,  and  the 
Malay  Peninsula;  and  trading  partners  or  allies  in  Maluku  and 
Sulawesi,  as  well  as  present-day  Thailand,  Cambodia,  Vietnam,  and 
China.  Majapahit's  power  was  built  in  part  on  military  might,  which 
Gajah  Mada  used,  for  example,  in  campaigns  against  Melayu  in  1340 
and  Bali  in  1343.  Its  reach  by  force  was  limited,  as  in  the  failed  cam- 
paign in  1357  against  Sunda  in  western  Java,  however,  making  the 
kingdom's  economic  and  cultural  vigor  perhaps  more  important  fac- 
tors. Majapahit's  ships  carried  bulk  goods,  spices,  and  other  exotic 
commodities  throughout  the  region  (cargoes  of  rice  from  eastern  Java

significantly  altered  the  diet  of  Maluku  at  this  time),  spread  the  use  of 
Malay  (not  Javanese)  as  a  lingua  franca,  and  brought  news  of  the 
kingdom's  urban  center  at  Trowulan,  which  covered  approximately 
100  square  kilometers  and  offered  its  inhabitants  a  remarkably  high 
standard  of  living.  Majapahit's  writers  continued  the  developments  in 
literature  and  wayang  (see  Glossary)  begun  in  the  Kediri  period.  The 
best-known  work  today  is  Mpu  Prapanca's  Desawarnana,  often 
referred  to  as  Nagarakertagama,  composed  in  1365,  which  provides 
us  with  an  unusually  detailed  view  of  daily  life  in  the  kingdom's  cen- 
tral provinces.  Many  other  classic  works  also  date  from  this  period, 
including  the  famous  Panji  tales,  popular  romances  based  on  the  his- 
tory of  eastern  Java  that  were  loved  and  borrowed  by  storytellers  as 
far  away  as  Thailand  and  Cambodia.  Many  of  Majapahit's  administra- 
tive practices  and  laws  governing  trade  were  admired  and  later  imi- 
tated elsewhere,  even  by  fledgling  powers  seeking  independence  from 
Javanese  imperial  control. 

The  image  of  Majapahit  as  a  glorious  empire  united  under  a  pow- 
erful ruler  has  captured  the  imagination  of  many  Indonesian  nation- 
alists since  the  1920s.  The  modern  national  motto  Bhinneka  Tunggal 
Ika  (roughly,  "Unity  in  Diversity")  was  drawn  from  Mpu  Tantular's 
poem  "Sutasoma,"  written  during  Hayam  Wuruk's  reign;  indepen- 
dent Indonesia's  first  university  took  Gajah  Mada's  name,  and  the 
contemporary  nation's  communication  satellites  are  named  Palapa, 
after  the  oath  of  abstinence  Gajah  Mada  is  said  to  have  taken  in  order 
to  achieve  unity  throughout  the  archipelago  (nusantara).  Construc- 
tion of  a  "Majapahit  Park"  (Taman  Majapahit)  on  the  Trowulan  site 
began  in  2008,  with  the  purpose  of  raising  pride  in  the  nation's  past. 
(Some  Indonesians  interpret  things  rather  differently  and  see  the 
park  as  an  unwelcome  reminder  of  Javanese  dominance  over  the  rest 
of  the  archipelago,  historically  as  well  as  in  more  recent  times.) 

Majapahit  did  not  unify  the  archipelago  in  any  modern  sense,  how- 
ever, and  its  hegemony  proved  in  practice  to  be  fragile  and  short- 
lived. Beginning  shortly  after  Hayam  Wuruk's  death,  an  agricultural 
crisis;  civil  wars  of  succession;  the  appearance  of  strong  trading 
rivals,  such  as  Pasai  (in  northern  Sumatra)  and  Melaka  (on  the  Malay 
Peninsula);  and  restive  vassal  rulers  eager  for  independence  all  chal- 
lenged the  political-economic  order  from  which  Majapahit  had  drawn 
much  of  its  legitimacy.  Internally,  the  ideological  order  also  began  to 
falter  as  courtiers  and  others  among  the  elite,  perhaps  following  pop- 
ular trends,  abandoned  Hindu-Buddhist  cults  centered  on  a  supreme 
kingship  in  favor  of  ancestral  cults  and  practices  focused  on  salvation 
of  the  soul.  In  addition,  new  and  often  intertwined  external  forces 
also  brought  significant  changes,  some  of  which  may  have  contrib- 
uted to  the  dissolution  of  Majapahit's  paramountcy.

Outside  Influences 

China 

One  of  these  external  forces  was  the  growing  influence  of  China. 
After  the  Mongol  incursions,  the  early  Majapahitan  state  did  not 
have  official  relations  with  China  for  a  generation,  but  it  did  adopt 
Chinese  copper  and  lead  coins  (pisis  or  picis)  as  official  currency, 
which  rapidly  replaced  local  gold  and  silver  coinage  and  played  a 
role  in  the  expansion  of  both  internal  and  external  trade.  By  the  sec- 
ond half  of  the  fourteenth  century,  Majapahit's  growing  appetite  for 
Chinese  luxury  goods  such  as  silk  and  ceramics,  and  China's 
demand  for  such  items  as  pepper,  nutmeg,  cloves,  and  aromatic 
woods,  fueled  a  burgeoning  trade.  China  also  became  politically 
involved  in  Majapahit's  relations  with  restless  vassal  powers 
(Palembang  in  1377)  and,  before  long,  even  internal  disputes  (the 
Paregreg  War,  1401-5).  At  the  time  of  the  celebrated  state-sponsored 
voyages  of  Chinese  Grand  Eunuch  Zheng  He  between  1405  and 
1433,  there  were  large  communities  of  Chinese  traders  in  major  trad- 
ing ports  on  Java  and  Sumatra;  their  leaders,  some  appointed  by  the 
Ming  Dynasty  (1368-1644)  court,  often  married  into  the  local  popu- 
lation and  came  to  play  key  roles  in  its  affairs. 

Islam 

Another  external  force  of  great  importance  was  Islam,  which  had 
been  known  in  the  archipelago  since  the  eighth  century  but  does  not 
appear  to  have  begun  to  take  hold  until  the  beginning  of  the  thirteenth 
century  at  the  earliest.  The  first  Indonesian  Islamic  ruler  in  the  archi- 
pelago for  whom  we  now  have  clear  evidence  was  Sultan  Sulaiman 
of  Lamreh  (northern  Sumatra),  who  died  in  1211;  several  other 
Sumatran  kings,  probably  influenced  by  traders  and  intellectuals 
arriving  from  Gujarat  and  elsewhere  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  became 
Muslims  later  in  the  thirteenth  century.  Javanese  do  not  appear  to 
have  begun  conversion  until  well  into  the  fifteenth  century,  despite 
several  centuries'  presence  there  of  foreign  Muslims.  Much  of  this 
story  may  not  yet  be  clear  to  historians,  however,  for  graves  at 
Trowulan  and  Tralaya  near  the  eastern  Java  heart  of  Hindu-Buddhist 
Majapahit  strongly  suggest  that  some  members  of  that  state's  elite, 
perhaps  even  of  the  court,  had  converted  to  Islam  as  early  as  1368,  a 
time  when  Majapahit  and  its  state  orthodoxies  were  still  very  much  in 
the  ascendent.  The  small  trading  port  states  on  the  Pasisir — Java's 
north  coast — many  of  which  later  broke  away  from  Majapahit's  con- 
trol, do  not  appear  to  have  begun  to  convert  to  Islam  until  at  least  the 
mid-fifteenth  century.  This  probably  developed  from  the  influence  of

Chinese,  Cham,  and  Chinese-Javanese  Muslim  merchants  and  later  as 
a  result  of  the  efforts  of  the  so-called  Nine  Saints  (wali  songo),  some 
of  whom  were  probably  Chinese- Javanese  and  others  connected  with 
Indian  and  Persian  Islam.  The  conversion  of  the  eastern  archipelago 
began  with  the  king  of  Ternate  in  1460,  but  that  region  was  not 
widely  Islamized  until  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries. 

The  spread  of  Islam  in  the  archipelago  is  not  well  understood  his- 
torically, and,  especially  regarding  this  early  period,  scholars  con- 
tinue to  disagree  on  many  fundamental  points,  such  as  the  precise 
sources  and  nature  of  Muslim  influence  and  the  attractions  the  new 
religion  held  for  those  who  eventually  adopted  it.  It  is  not  clear,  for 
example,  whether  individuals — rulers,  elites,  or  commoners — con- 
verted for  essentially  practical  considerations  (such  as  the  often  very 
real  economic  and  political  advantages  of  joining  the  ummah,  or 


17

community  of  believers),  because  of  alienation  from  existing  social 
and  political  values  (in  the  Hindu-Buddhist  kingdoms,  for  example), 
or  out  of  an  intrinsic  interest  in  the  new  spiritual  and  cultural  ideas 
Islam  brought  with  it.  Nor  is  it  always  obvious  why  some  conver- 
sions appear  to  have  been  peaceful  and  others  coercive  and  even  vio- 
lent, or  why  some  indigenous  histories  emphasize  "miraculous"  or 
magical  elements  in  conversions  and  others  do  not.  Whatever  the 
case,  Islamization  was  not  an  event,  or  even  a  series  of  events,  but 
rather  a  long,  variegated,  and  evolutionary  process  best  understood 
in  terms  of  local,  rather  than  universal,  patterns. 

Portugal 

A  third  external  force  came  into  play  with  the  arrival  of  the  Portu- 
guese in  the  archipelago.  They  reached  the  rich  and  expanding 
Melaka,  on  the  Malay  Peninsula,  in  1509  and  sought  trading  rights 
there.  Some  in  Melaka's  cosmopolitan  trading  community  wanted  to 
accept  them  (perhaps  as  a  counterweight  against  Sultan  Mahmud's 
controversial  imperial  policies),  but  others  did  not,  heightening  exist- 
ing political  tensions.  When  the  Portuguese  returned  in  1511  com- 
manded by  the  more  demanding  Alfonso  de  Albuquerque,  they 
defeated  Melaka  militarily,  soon  establishing  themselves  in  the  trad- 
ing ports  of  Banten  (western  Java)  and  Ternate  (Maluku),  and  con- 
tacting the  much  reduced  Majapahit  kingdom  at  Kediri  in  eastern 
Java.  These  events  do  not,  as  is  sometimes  suggested,  mark  the  begin- 
ning of  Western  colonial  rule,  or  even  European  primacy,  in  Indone- 
sia; that  lay  far  in  the  future.  Rather,  the  "Western  intrusion"  was  at 
this  stage  merely  one  dynamic  bound  up,  in  often  unpredictable  ways, 
with  many  others.  Thus,  the  final  days  of  Majapahit,  weakened  by 
internal  division,  were  determined  by  Trenggana,  the  half-Chinese 
Muslim  ruler  of  its  former  vassal  port  Demak,  who  in  1527  con- 
quered Kediri  for  reasons  that  had  as  much  to  do  with  economic  and 
political  rivalry  (with  Banten,  the  Portuguese,  and  Majapahit's  rem- 
nants) as  they  did  with  religious  struggle  (with  both  Christianity  and 
Hindu-Buddhist  ideology). 

The  Early  Modern  Era 

Commercial  Developments 

The  period  between  the  mid-fifteenth  century  and  the  end  of  the 
eighteenth  century  was  a  time  of  turbulence  and  profound  change  for 
the  archipelago.  Java  lost  much  of  its  commanding  position  as  new 
states,  some  great  and  some  small,  also  raced  to  acquire  wealth  and 
exercise  power.  Urban  populations  grew  rapidly,  and  with  them  the

influence  of  expanding  commercial  elites.  New  technologies,  for 
example  in  weaponry  and  ship  design,  changed  the  face  of  trade. 
And  Islam  extended  its  reach  at  the  same  time  as  a  wide  variety  of 
influences  diversified  and  secularized  culture.  It  was  also  a  time  in 
which  Europeans  began  to  play  a  direct  role  in  the  archipelago's 
affairs,  although  they  did  not  rule  it,  and  Chinese  merchants  and 
laborers  became  more  important.  All  of  this  took  place  in  the  context 
of  a  commercial  boom  that  greatly  expanded  prosperity  but  also 
greatly  heightened  competition  and  exposed  Indonesia  directly  to  the 
swift  and  often  dangerous  currents  of  what  might  justifiably  be 
called  the  "first  globalization"  (see  fig.  3). 

This  early  modern  age  of  commerce  was  initially  fueled  by  the 
buying  and  selling  of  Indonesian  spices,  the  production  of  which  was 
limited  and  the  sources  often  remote.  Nutmeg  (and  mace)  come  from 
the  nut  of  the  tree  Myristica  fragrans,  which,  until  the  late  eighteenth 
century,  grew  almost  exclusively  on  six  tiny  islands  in  the  Banda 
Archipelago,  some  300  kilometers  west  of  the  Papua  coast.  Cloves 
are  the  dried  flower  buds  of  the  tree  Syzygium  aromaticum,  the  culti- 
vation of  which  until  the  mid-seventeenth  century  was  largely  lim- 
ited to  a  handful  of  small  islands  off  the  west  coast  of  Halmahera  in 
the  Maluku  Islands.  These  spices  had  long  been  distributed  in  mod- 
est quantities  via  the  trade  networks  of  the  archipelago.  After  about 
1450,  however,  demand  and  the  ability  to  pay  for  them  climbed  rap- 
idly in  both  China  and  Europe.  In  the  century  between  the  1390s  and 
the  1490s,  for  example,  European  imports  of  cloves  rose  nearly 
1,000  percent,  and  of  nutmeg  nearly  2,000  percent,  and  continued  to 
rise  for  the  next  120  years.  Another  product,  black  pepper  (Piper 
nigrum),  was  grown  more  easily  and  widely  (on  Java,  Sumatra,  and 
Kalimantan),  but  it  too  became  an  object  of  steeply  rising  worldwide 
demand.  These  changing  global  market  conditions  lay  at  the  bottom 
of  fundamental  developments,  not  only  in  systems  of  supply  and  dis- 
tribution but  in  virtually  all  aspects  of  life  in  the  archipelago. 

Westerners  and  Indigenous  Powers 

Until  the  challenge  of  direct  traders  from  Europe  (first  the  Portu- 
guese and  Spanish  at  the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century,  then  the 
Dutch,  English,  and  others  at  the  end  of  it)  and  renewed  interest  from 
the  Chinese  (after  the  Ming  government  relaxed  prohibitions  on  pri- 
vate overseas  trade  in  the  mid-sixteenth  century),  Indonesians  held 
virtually  exclusive  control  of  the  spice  trade,  and  decisive  power  in 
the  extensive  exchange  of  luxury  and  bulk  goods  that  accompanied 
it.  Over  a  period  of  about  250  years,  however,  they  gradually  lost 
their  commercial  primacy  and,  in  some  cases,  much  of  their  political

independence.  This  crucial  process  was  far  too  complex  to  be  under- 
stood simply  as  a  struggle  between  East  and  West,  or  Christianity 
and  Islam,  or  "modern"  and  "traditional"  technology.  Europeans  not 
only  warred  vigorously  among  themselves,  but  they  routinely  allied 
themselves  with  local  powers,  many  of  them  Muslim,  and  became 
participants  in  local  rivalries;  they  also  frequently  found  that  their 
weaponry  did  not  give  them  obvious  superiority  over  indigenous 
powers,  who  purchased  both  light  and  heavy  firearms  and  some- 
times, as  in  Java  well  into  the  eighteenth  century,  were  able  to  manu- 
facture serviceable  copies  of  European  models.  Europeans  found 
their  position  fluctuated  as  a  result  of  a  multitude  of  factors,  some  of 
them  well  beyond  their  control. 

Some  of  these  complexities  can  be  glimpsed  in  a  brief  history  of 
Ternate,  Maluku,  in  the  sixteenth  and  early  seventeenth  centuries.  In 
1512  seven  Portuguese  arrived  in  Ternate  as  the  guests  of  Sultan 
Abu  Lais  (r.  7-1522),  having  been  rescued  by  fishermen  from  a  ship- 
wreck of  their  locally  built  vessel  (their  original  ship  had  become  too 
unreliable  to  continue  in  service)  loaded  with  spices  purchased  in 
Banda.  The  sultan  sought  an  alliance  with  the  Portuguese,  of  whom 
he  had  already  heard,  and  was  eager  to  exchange  cloves  for  assis- 
tance against  the  rival  sultanate  of  Tidore.  When  Spanish  ships 
arrived  in  Maluku  in  1521,  Sultan  Mansur  of  Tidore  sealed  a  similar 
agreement  with  them,  to  which  the  Portuguese  soon  responded  by 
building  a  large  stone  fortress  on  Ternate.  This  act  touched  off 
decades  of  warfare  among  Europeans  and  their  local  allies,  in  which 
political  control,  economic  ascendancy,  and  religious  identity  all 
were  contested.  But  it  also  brought  change  in  Ternate  itself,  for  the 
ruler  there  became  essentially  a  prisoner  of  the  Portuguese,  whose 
increasingly  arbitrary  and  oppressive  interference  in  local  affairs, 
including  spice  production  and  harvesting,  eventually  turned  their 
former  allies  against  them.  Under  the  leadership  of  Sultan  Babullah 
(r.  1570-83),  Islam  became  a  powerful  tool  with  which  to  create  alli- 
ances and  gather  widespread  opposition  to  the  Portuguese.  After  a 
siege  in  1575  against  the  Ternate  fort,  he  ousted  the  Portuguese 
forces.  Babullah  allowed  a  limited  contingent  of  Portuguese  mer- 
chants to  continue  trading  in  Ternate,  but  the  fort  became  the  royal 
residence,  and  the  sultanate  rapidly  expanded  its  reach  to  key  trading 
ports  as  far  away  as  northern  and  southern  Sulawesi  until  the  arrival 
of  the  Dutch  touched  off  new  and  even  more  complex  struggles. 

Elsewhere  in  the  archipelago  over  the  course  of  the  seventeenth 
century,  indigenous  and  outside  powers  engaged  in  a  multifaceted 
struggle  for  control  of  maritime  trade.  Rapidly  rising  profits  from 
this  trade  fueled  the  growth  of  ambitious  states,  the  most  important 
of  which  were  Aceh  (northern  Sumatra),  Banten  (western  Java), 


21 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 


Makassar  (southern  Sulawesi),  and  Mataram  (central  and  eastern 
Java).  The  most  important  outside  power  was  the  Dutch-run  United 
East  Indies  Company  (VOC;  for  this  and  other  acronyms,  see  table 
A).  Each  of  the  indigenous  states  experienced  a  slightly  different  tra- 
jectory during  this  period,  but  the  essential  contest  was  between  a 
pattern  of  heavily  state-controlled  trade  on  the  one  hand  and,  on  the 
other,  a  still  tentatively  oligarchical  pattern,  in  which  the  so-called 
orang  kaya  or  merchant  elite,  and  often  allied  religious  and  tradi- 
tional elites,  played  significant  political  and  economic  roles. 

The  best-known  example  is  Aceh,  which  arose  in  the  middle  of 
the  sixteenth  century,  partly  as  an  effort  to  control  dissension  among 
northern  Sumatran  and  Malay  polities  and  partly  to  control  the 
Malay  trade,  which  had  dispersed  after  1511.  (Although  Aceh's  rul- 
ers were  often  serious  about  promoting  Islam,  their  major  military 
efforts  were  over  commercial  rather  than  religious  affairs,  and  were 
directed  against  Muslim  as  well  as  Christian  rivals.)  Aceh  reached  its 
apogee  under  Sultan  Iskandar  Muda  (r.  1607-36).  He  pursued  an 
aggressive  military  policy  against  neighboring  powers,  including 
Portuguese  Melaka;  he  presided  over  a  centralized  and  increasingly 
authoritarian  state;  he  exercised  arbitrary  power,  including  attempt- 
ing to  establish  royal  monopolies,  over  the  trading  activities  and 
even  the  private  property  of  the  orang  kaya.  He  invested  in  huge, 
heavily  armed  seagoing  ships — one,  called  Terror  of  the  Universe, 
was  more  than  90  meters  long  and  carried  more  than  700  men — of 
new  design  to  compete  with  European  and  Chinese  vessels.  The  sul- 
tan also  practiced  an  assertive  foreign  policy,  playing  European  and 
Asian  powers  against  each  other. 

The  ruthlessness  of  Iskandar  Muda's  regime  made  many  enemies, 
however,  and  nearly  caused  a  civil  war.  Its  economic  gains,  rather 
than  bringing  about  a  permanent  transformation  of  the  political  and 
economic  structure  of  Aceh,  proved  ephemeral.  The  orang  kaya 
reasserted  themselves  and  sought  ways  to  restrict  royal  power.  Until 
the  end  of  the  seventeenth  century,  for  example,  they  successfully 
sponsored  a  succession  of  female  rulers,  perhaps  because  they  con- 
sidered women  to  be  either  more  moderate  or  more  easily  manipu- 
lated than  men.  But  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries,  both 
their  influence  and  that  of  the  court  declined  as  that  of  hereditary  dis- 
trict chiefs  (uleebalang)  and  Muslim  leaders  rose.  The  Acehnese 
state  thus  lost  its  imperial  authority  and  much  of  its  political  coher- 
ence. Nevertheless — and  unlike  most  of  its  contemporary  regional 
states — Aceh  remained  an  important  local  power  and  continued  to 
be  an  economic  force  to  be  reckoned  with,  for  example  producing 
more  than  half  the  world's  pepper  supply  as  late  as  about  1820.  Aceh 
did  not  hesitate  to  ally  itself  with  Dutch  forces  in  an  attack  on  Portu-

guese  Melaka  in  1641,  but  in  subsequent  years  it  alone  among  the 
great  nascent  states  of  the  early  modern  archipelago  managed  to 
avoid  entanglement  with  the  VOC,  retaining  its  independence  until 
the  late  nineteenth  century. 

The  Role  of  the  Dutch  United  East  Indies  Company, 
1602-19 

A  common  historical  perspective  on  the  seventeenth  and  eigh- 
teenth centuries  is  to  portray  the  VOC  as  a  uniquely  powerful  military 
and  economic  juggernaut  that  steadily  and  deliberately  constructed 
the  empire  that  came  to  be  known  as  the  Netherlands  East  Indies.  In 
the  twentieth  century,  such  a  view  was  frequently  shared  by  Dutch 
colonial  officials  and  Indonesian  nationalists,  who  spoke  of  "350 
years  of  Dutch  rule"  in  the  archipelago.  The  truth,  however,  was  more 
modest.  The  VOC  was  neither  the  "first  (modern)  multinational  cor- 
poration," as  has  sometimes  been  claimed,  nor  the  instrument  of  a 
state  policy  of  colonial  expansion.  It  was  founded  in  the  Netherlands 
in  1602  as  an  effort  to  manage  the  competition  and  risk  of  the  growing 
number  of  Dutch  expeditions  to  the  Indonesian  archipelago  (10  com- 
panies, 10  voyages,  and  65  ships  between  1595  and  1601),  and  to 
compete  with  the  East  India  Company,  formed  by  the  English  two 
years  earlier,  for  control  of  the  Asian  trade.  The  VOC's  initial  charter 
established  its  sole  right  among  Dutch  enterprises  to  do  business  in 
Asia  and  gave  it  exceptional  powers,  such  as  those  of  keeping  an 
army  and  using  military  force,  making  treaties  with  local  rulers,  build- 
ing fortifications,  and  issuing  coinage.  In  addition,  it  called  for  little 
government  oversight  and  did  not  require  the  new  company  to  pay 
dividends  to  investors  at  the  end  of  each  voyage  (as  had  been  the  prac- 
tice), allowing  it  to  amass  large  sums  of  money  over  longer  periods  of 
time.  The  purpose  of  this  state-supported  enterprise  was  primarily  to 
make  a  profit.  At  home  the  directors,  known  as  the  Heeren  XVII 
(Seventeen  Gentlemen),  recognized  that  fighting  wars,  establishing 
colonies  (rather  than  simple  trading  posts  and  fortifications),  and 
becoming  involved  in  local  disputes  diminished  profits,  and  they  gen- 
erally warned  against  such  activities. 

Far  away  in  the  archipelago,  VOC  representatives,  appointed  after 
1610  as  governors  general,  tended  to  see  the  warring  and  political 
involvement  as  necessary  and  pursued  them  anyway,  often  vigor- 
ously. Even  the  more  ambitious  of  their  efforts,  however,  were 
restrained  by  certain  realities.  Above  all,  the  VOC  was  never  big 
enough  or  strong  enough  to  dominate  the  entire  archipelago  and  its 
people,  and  indeed  the  company  found  it  impossible  to  enforce  its 
will  in  local  affairs  without  Indonesian  allies,  who  frequently  exacted 


23 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

a  high  price  for  their  assistance  and  whose  loyalty  could  never  be 
taken  for  granted.  It  was  also  the  case  that  even  when  it  had  its  way — 
for  example,  by  gaining  control  of  specific  trading  ports  or  routes,  or 
of  the  main  areas  in  which  particular  spices  were  produced — inter- 
ventions by  the  VOC  often  had  unintended  short-  and  long-term  con- 
sequences that  it  could  do  little  to  control.  Finally,  of  course,  the 
VOC's  fortunes  were  subject  to  the  vagaries  of  a  trading  system  that 
stretched  far  beyond  the  archipelago,  including  the  rise  and  fall  in 
world  demand  for  spices  and,  later,  for  other  products  on  which  it 
came  to  depend,  such  as  coffee.  In  the  course  of  nearly  two  centuries, 
the  company  failed  to  control  the  spice  trade  and  establish  the  stable 
conditions  necessary  for  mercantile  growth,  and  came  to  rule  over 
only  minute  patches  of  territory,  except  for  small  areas  in  Maluku  in 
the  seventeenth  century  and  Java  in  the  eighteenth. 

Nevertheless,  the  VOC  had  a  shaping  influence  in  the  archipelago. 
In  what  today  is  eastern  Indonesia,  the  company — with,  it  is  important 
to  reiterate,  the  help  of  indigenous  allies — between  1610  and  1680 
fundamentally  altered  the  terms  of  the  traditional  spice  trade  by  forci- 
bly limiting  the  number  of  nutmeg  and  clove  trees,  ruthlessly  control- 
ling the  populations  that  grew  and  prepared  the  spices  for  the  market, 
and  aggressively  using  treaties  and  military  means  to  establish  VOC 
hegemony  in  the  trade.  One  result  of  these  policies,  exacerbated  by 
the  late-seventeenth-century  fall  in  the  global  demand  for  spices,  was 
an  overall  decline  in  regional  trade,  an  economic  weakening  that 
affected  the  VOC  itself  as  well  as  indigenous  states,  and  in  many 
areas  occasioned  a  withdrawal  from  commercial  activity.  Others  were 
the  rise  of  authoritarian  rulers  dependent  on  VOC  support  and  unrest 
among  groups — traditional  leaders,  merchants,  religious  and  military 
figures — who  opposed  one  or  the  other  or  both.  Among  the  most 
prominent  examples  are  those  found  in  the  histories  of  Ternate  in  the 
time  of  Sultan  Mandar  (r.  1648-75)  and  the  wars  against  Hitu  and 
Hoamoal  (1638-56),  and  of  southern  Sulawesi  in  the  era  of  the  ambi- 
tious Buginese  (Bone)  prince  Arung  Palakka  (1634-96)  and  the  wars 
against  the  Makassarese  (Gowa)  and  others.  By  the  end  of  the  seven- 
teenth century,  the  glories  of  the  spice  trade  had  faded,  and  the  vitality 
of  the  large  and  small  states  of  the  post-Majapahit  era  had  been 
sapped;  the  weight  of  affairs  had  again  begun  to  shift  west,  to  Java. 

The  Javanese  and  the  VOC,  1619-1749 

In  1619  the  VOC  had  seized  Jayakerta  (Sunda  Kelapa),  a  small  but 
well-protected  west  Javanese  port  it  had  originally  contracted  from  a 
disgruntled  vassal  of  the  sultanate  of  Banten,  renaming  it  Batavia, 
forerunner  of  today's  Jakarta.  The  resolute  Governor  General  Jan

Pieterszoon  Coen  (in  office  1619-23  and  1627-29)  had  conceived  of 
this  port  as  a  kind  of  fulcrum  of  the  company's  far-flung  Asian  enter- 
prise, and  he  defended  it  vigorously  against  both  Banten  (allied 
briefly  with  England's  East  India  Company)  and,  in  1628-29,  the 
powerful  land  and  sea  forces  of  the  expanding  central  Javanese  state 
that  had  taken  the  name  of  Mataram,  after  the  ninth-century  kingdom. 
Mataram's  ruler,  Sultan  Agung  (r.  1613^6),  was  Java's  greatest  war- 
rior king  since  Kertanagara  nearly  four  centuries  earlier.  Using  iron 
force  and  a  keen  sense  of  traditional  diplomatic  opportunities,  Sultan 
Agung  assembled  a  realm  that  consisted  of  all  of  Java  and  Madura 
(including  the  powerful  kingdom  of  Surabaya)  except  Banten  in  the 
far  west  and  the  Hindu-Buddhist  kingdom  of  Blambangan  in  the  far 
east.  Sukadana  and  Banjarmasin  on  Kalimantan  also  fell  under  his

sway.  He  was  not,  however,  able  to  dislodge  the  VOC,  and  after  the 
failed  campaign  of  1628-29  he  appears  to  have  accepted  the  Dutch 
presence  as  a  minor  irritant.  Contemporaneous  Javanese  historical 
works  treated  the  company  more  as  a  potential  ally  than  as  a  serious 
threat,  a  view  that  persisted  among  many  in  court  circles  for  another 
century  or  more.  And,  indeed,  at  the  time  the  VOC  was  neither  inter- 
ested in  nor  capable  of  tackling  the  full  force  of  Mataram,  which 
despite  the  destruction  and  political  tensions  wrought  by  nearly  40 
years  of  expansion  remained,  a  formidable  military  power.  The  com- 
pany saw  itself  as  a  maritime  power,  a  rival  for  the  control  of  produce 
and  trade  rather  than  territory,  and  it  sought  stable  conditions  for  its 
activities  rather  than  upheaval  (see  fig.  4). 

Conditions  began  to  change,  however,  during  the  disastrous  reign 
of  Sultan  Agung's  son,  Amangkurat  I  (r.  1646-77),  who  lacked  his 
father's  talents  but  sought  to  further  strengthen  the  realm  by  central- 
izing authority,  monopolizing  control  of  resources,  and  destroying 
all  real  or  imagined  opposition.  His  misguided  efforts  to  control 
trade  revenues  by  twice  closing  the  ports  of  the  Pasisir,  and  even 
destroying  Javanese  trading  vessels  and  forbidding  Javanese  travel 
overseas,  had  the  opposite  effect,  in  addition  to  alienating  the  com- 
mercial community  and  damaging  the  wider  economy  of  producers. 
His  obsessive  fear  of  opposition  led  him  to  kill  more  than  5,000 
Muslim  leaders  and  their  families  in  a  single,  well-planned  massa- 
cre, and  to  murder  hundreds  of  court  officials  and  members  of  the 
aristocracy,  including  his  own  family,  actions  that  of  course  only 
increased  the  hatred  and  intrigues  aimed  at  removing  him.  His  atti- 
tude toward  the  VOC  was  ambivalent,  for,  on  the  one  hand,  he 
admired  its  apparent  wealth  and  power  and  considered  it  a  potential 
ally  and  protector,  yet  on  the  other  hand  he  sought  to  bend  it  to  his 
will  and  to  extract  all  he  could  from  its  representatives  in  Batavia. 
Beginning  in  the  early  1670s,  rebellions  began  to  rise,  the  most  pow- 
erful of  which  was  led  by  Raden  Trunajaya  (ca.  1649-80),  a 
Madurese  aristocrat  conspiring  with  a  disaffected  son  of  Amangku- 
rat I  and  allied  with  Makassarese  and  other  forces.  Trunajaya's 
armies  won  a  decisive  victory  in  1676  and  looted  the  capital  the  fol- 
lowing year.  Mataram  was  disintegrating. 

In  the  course  of  this  conflict,  both  sides  requested  assistance  from 
the  VOC,  which  now  faced  a  momentous  decision.  The  company 
sought  political  stability  and  a  reliable  supply  of  such  key  products 
as  rice  and  teak,  and  it  determined  for  the  first  time  in  more  than  a 
half-century  that,  in  order  to  obtain  them,  intervention  in  Mataram's 
internal  affairs  was  necessary.  Company  officials  viewed  Javanese 
kingship  through  a  European  lens  as  a  relatively  absolutist,  central- 
ized form  of  rule  that  legitimated  succession  by,  if  not  strict  primo-

geniture,  then  something  very  close  to  it.  This  was  a  misreading  of 
Javanese  (and,  indeed,  other  Indonesian)  cultural  custom,  but  none- 
theless the  VOC  gradually  came  to  see  itself  as  the  upholder  of  order 
(tradition)  and  to  justify  its  actions  in  terms  of  favoring  continuity 
rather  than  change.  It  made  its  choices  accordingly,  often  with  the 
ironic  result  of  creating  rather  than  solving  discord  and  of  weakening 
rather  than  strengthening  the  sorts  of  order  it  hoped  to  achieve.  In 
any  case,  the  VOC  decided  in  1676  to  back  the  forces  of  Amangku- 
rat  I,  who  died  soon  after  having  fled  to  VOC-controlled  territory  on 
the  Pasisir,  and  then  to  support  his  rebellious  son  as  successor,  a 
project  requiring  five  more  years  of  warfare  to  complete.  The  com- 
pany gained  treaties  promising,  among  other  things,  access  to  the 
products  and  trading  rights  it  sought,  as  well  as  repayment  of  all  its 
military  costs.  That  these  treaty  obligations  proved  difficult  to  fulfill 
did  not  negate  the  fact  that  the  VOC  had  now  embarked  on  a  course 
that  slowly  and  expensively  intertwined  its  own  fate  with  that  of 
Mataram.  The  dark  legacy  of  Amangkurat's  tyrannical  misrule  thus 
lay  not  only  in  80  years  of  turbulence  in  Javanese  life,  punctuated  by 
three  destructive  wars  of  succession,  but  also  in  the  establishment  of 
patterns  of  Dutch  entanglement  in  indigenous  affairs  that  were  to 
outlive  the  VOC  itself. 

Decline  of  the  VOC,  1749-1816 

By  the  mid-eighteenth  century,  the  VOC  and  the  court  of  Mataram, 
at  the  same  time  rivals  and  allies,  were  exhausted  by  war.  The  dying 
ruler,  Pakubuwana  II  (r.  1726-49),  with  his  kingdom  still  threatened 
by  rebellion  from  within  and  his  court  deeply  divided  over  the  proper 
course  for  the  future,  ceded  Mataram  to  the  company,  perhaps  think- 
ing in  this  way  to  save  it.  The  treaty  was  of  little  importance  because 
it  could  not  be  enforced  and  the  VOC  was  incapable  of  ruling  Java, 
but  it  was  followed  in  1755  by  the  Treaty  of  Giyanti,  which  imposed  a 
different  solution.  Mataram  was  to  be  ruled  by  two  royal  courts,  one 
at  Surakarta  (also  known  as  Solo)  and  one  at  Yogyakarta,  out  of 
which  the  junior  courts  of  Mangkunegaran  (1757)  and  Pakualaman 
(1812),  respectively,  later  evolved  by  apportioning  appanage  rights 
among  them.  This  division  produced  an  extended  period  of  peace 
lasting  well  into  the  nineteenth  century,  from  which  the  Javanese  pop- 
ulace benefited  economically.  The  courts,  particularly  that  of  Yogya- 
karta, made  use  of  their  considerable  autonomy  and  grew  in 
prosperity  and  power,  while  the  VOC  consolidated  its  control  over  the 
Pasisir  and  pursued  its  commercial  ventures.  Although  clearly  recog- 
nized (and  often  resented)  as  the  paramount  power,  the  company 
interested  itself  in  the  courts'  affairs  and  played  a  role  in  choosing

who  reigned  but  refrained  from  meddling  too  deeply.  It  was  a  strange 
conquest. 

The  peace  was  in  many  respects  also  strange,  for  rather  than  set- 
tling Java  into  a  calm  "traditional"  existence,  it  provided  the  setting 
for  ongoing  social  and  cultural  ferment  as  Javanese  reassessed  not 
only  their  past  but  also  their  present.  The  literary  reflections  of  this 
crisis  have  been  insufficiently  studied,  but  works  ascribed  to  the  Sura- 
karta  court  poets  Yasadipura  I  (1729-1803)  and  his  son  Yasadipura  II 
(?  -1844),  for  example,  suggest  that  efforts  to  reexamine  and  revital- 
ize old  histories  failed,  not  least  because  the  ability  to  read  them  accu- 
rately had  been  lost,  and  that  attempts  to  understand  the  Java — and, 
we  might  say,  "Javaneseness" — of  their  own  day  led  frequently  to 
searing  critiques  of  their  own  social  hierarchy  and  customs,  as  well  as 
those  of  foreigners  and  Islam.  This  sort  of  questioning  and  restless- 
ness was  not  necessarily  fatal,  however,  and  might  under  different  cir- 
cumstances have  permitted  a  continuation  of  the  equilibrium  already 
achieved  or  even  conceivably  have  led  to  a  kind  of  Javanese  renais- 
sance and  a  different,  more  advantageous  relationship  with  the  Dutch. 
But  changes  in  the  larger  world  determined  otherwise. 

In  the  early  1780s,  the  last  in  a  series  of  wars  with  the  British  cost 
the  Netherlands,  including  the  VOC  and  its  far-flung  interests, 
dearly.  Nearly  half  the  company's  ships  were  lost,  and  much  of  their 
valuable  cargoes;  enormous  debts  accumulated,  which,  despite  state 
loans,  could  not  be  repaid.  While  the  company  certainly  was  bur- 
dened with  other  fiscal  and  administrative  problems,  among  them  a 
high  level  of  corruption  among  its  employees,  the  British  war  seems 
to  have  been  the  critical  factor  in  its  fiscal  collapse.  In  1796  the  VOC 
was  placed  under  the  direction  of  a  national  committee  until  the  end 
of  1799,  when  it  was  liquidated,  its  debts  and  possessions  absorbed 
by  the  Dutch  government. 

By  this  time,  however,  the  Napoleonic  wars  had  brought  the  Neth- 
erlands under  French  control,  and  in  rapid  succession  the  former 
VOC  territories  fell  under  the  direction  of  leaders  appointed  by 
France — the  military  officer  Herman  Willem  Daendels  from  1808  to 
1811 — and,  after  Napoleon's  defeat,  by  Britain,  which  appointed  an 
East  India  Company  official,  Thomas  Stamford  Raffles,  for  the 
period  1811-16.  Daendels  and  Raffles  saw  themselves  as  liberal 
reformers,  enemies  of  feudal  privilege  and  practices  such  as  forced 
labor  and  delivery  of  produce,  proponents  of  the  welfare  of  the  com- 
mon folk,  and  opponents  of  corruption  and  inefficiency.  Raffles 
sought  to  "free"  Javanese  laborers  by  instituting  a  system  of  land 
rent,  in  which  farmers  grew  cash  crops  and  sold  them  in  order  to  pay 
the  government  for  the  use  of  the  land.  But  the  sharpest  break  with 
VOC  practice  lay  in  the  assumption  by  the  new  powers  of  sovereign 


29

rights  over  the  Javanese  courts,  treating  rulers  and  courtiers  not  as 
allies  but  as  clear  subordinates,  and  their  representatives  not  as  local 
lords  but  as  mere  bureaucratic  officeholders.  Both  men  interfered 
directly  in  court  affairs.  Daendels  replaced  Yogyakarta's  ruler  (on 
suspicion  of  rebellion)  and  annexed  territory  by  force  of  arms.  Raf- 
fles actually  bombarded  and  looted  the  Yogyakarta  court  (for  the 
same  reason),  establishing  the  Pakualaman  from  some  of  its  appa- 
nage lands,  and  exiled  an  unruly  Surakarta  prince.  These  acts,  and 
the  attitudes  behind  them,  foreshadowed  nothing  less  than  a  new  age 
for  the  archipelago,  an  age  of  Dutch  colonial  rule. 

Development  of  European  Colonial  Rule 

End  of  the  Ancien  Regime  in  Java,  1816-34 

In  1816  the  Netherlands  regained  responsibility  for  the  East 
Indies — actually  a  welter  of  mostly  coastal  territories,  some  con- 
trolled directly  and  many  others  engaged  through  varying  treaties — 
but  the  way  forward  was  uncertain  (see,  for  example,  fig.  5).  The 
growth  of  trade  with  Sulawesi  and  the  establishment  of  plantation 
economies,  especially  those  producing  sugar  (eastern  and  central 
Java)  and  coffee  (western  Java  and  western  Sumatra)  had  begun  to 
loosen  customary  ties  and  introduce  elites  to  new  sources  of  both 
riches  and  indebtedness.  In  Java,  the  general  population  increased 
and  grew  more  prosperous  but,  on  the  other  hand,  fell  victim  to 
increasing  crime,  heavier  taxation,  and  exploitation  by  local  Chi- 
nese, especially  in  their  roles  of  tax  farmers,  tollkeepers,  and  leasers 
of  plantation  lands.  The  legitimacy  of  ruling  elites  was  questioned 
more  widely.  Both  traditionalists  and  Muslims  felt  their  ways  of  life 
threatened  by  changes  they  tended  to  identify  with  growing  Euro- 
pean influence.  A  Dutch  decision  in  1823  to  end  what  it  viewed  as 
the  abusive  leasing  of  land  and  labor  among  central  Java's  aristoc- 
racy alienated  many  who  had  begun  to  adjust  to  the  new  circum- 
stances and  pushed  them  to  support  rebellion.  The  general 
atmosphere  of  restlessness  in  a  time  of  change  that  few  understood 
also  became  charged  with  superstition  and  millennial  expectations  in 
reaction  to  crop  failures,  outbreaks  of  disease,  and,  near  Yogyakarta, 
a  destructive  eruption  of  the  Mount  Merapi  volcano. 

The  struggle  known  as  the  Java  War  (1 825-30)  was  led  by  a  disaf- 
fected prince  of  the  Yogyakarta  court,  Diponegoro  (1785-1855).  He 
was  a  complex  figure  who  opposed  rule  by  both  the  Dutch  and  the 
complicit  Javanese  ruler  and  aristocracy,  and  whose  rebellion  must 
therefore  be  seen  as  a  Javanese  civil  war — although  not  one  primar- 
ily concerned  with  questions  of  succession,  as  in  the  eighteenth  cen-

tury — at  least  as  much  as  an  anticolonial  one.  Despite  his  modern 
Indonesian  status  as  a  national  hero,  Diponegoro  appears  to  have 
sought  merely  to  have  relations  with  the  Dutch  return  to  the  form 
they  had  assumed  in  late  VOC  times,  and  certainly  had  no  concep- 
tion of  a  broader  Indonesian  nation. 

Diponegoro  was  able  to  attract,  for  a  time,  the  loyalty  of  those 
who  felt  the  crumbling  of  the  previous  order  in  different  ways  and 
had  a  variety  of  social  and  moral  expectations.  He  was  seen  vari- 
ously as  a  protector  of  the  general  populace,  as  both  a  Muslim  and  a 
traditionalist  messianic  figure,  a  Ratu  Adil  (just  king),  and  as  an 
upholder  of  social  hierarchy  under  a  reformed  or  purified  aristoc- 
racy. These  alliances  proved  fragile,  however.  There  were  obvious 
internal  tensions,  for  example,  disagreements  between  those  who 
had  fought  for  religious  reasons  (responding  to  Diponegoro's  decla- 
ration of  a  Muslim  holy  war,  or  jihad)  and  those,  especially  among 
the  court  elite,  who  had  done  so  for  essentially  secular  reasons.  The 
difficulty  of  the  war  itself,  for  which  the  Dutch  devised  new  military 
strategies  and  which  spread  destruction  on  a  scale  unseen  in  genera- 
tions, was  extreme:  about  two-thirds  of  Java  was  affected,  a  quarter 
of  its  cultivated  land  was  laid  waste;  and  approximately  200,000 
Javanese  and  15,000  government  troops  (8,000  of  whom  were  Euro- 
peans) were  killed.  Backed  initially  by  about  half  of  Yogyakarta's 
ruling  elite,  by  early  1830  Diponegoro  had  lost  most  of  their  support, 
as  well  as  that  of  both  his  chief  military  commander  and  his  most 
influential  Muslim  patron  and  his  followers.  Abandoned  by  all  but  a 
few  loyal  comrades,  he  attended  a  peace  discussion  with  the  Dutch 
commander  of  government  forces  at  which  he  was  arrested  and  sent 
into  exile.  He  died  imprisoned  in  the  government  fort  in  Makassar. 

The  conclusion  of  the  Java  War  marked  the  end  of  Java's  old  social 
and  political  order.  The  government  in  Batavia  sharply  reduced  the 
lands  under  the  courts'  control,  and  the  fiction  of  Mataram  finally  gave 
way  to  what  were  now  termed  merely  the  vorstenlanden  (principalities) 
and  seen  as  comparatively  minor  vestigial  powers.  The  Javanese  elites 
acquiesced,  although  not  without  some  resentment,  in  part  because 
another  war  was  inconceivable  and  in  part  because  they  calculated  that 
acquiescence  was  necessary  if  they  were  to  retain  anything  at  all  of 
their  privileged  socioeconomic  status.  At  the  same  time,  the  end  of  the 
war  made  equally  clear  that  a  new  era  had  begun — not  only  for  Java, 
but  for  the  broader  archipelago — an  era  in  which  the  government  of  the 
Netherlands  assumed  full  sovereignty.  It  began  to  oversee  its  territories 
through  the  new  Ministry  of  Colonies  (established  in  1834),  and  took  a 
strikingly  different  attitude  toward  indigenous  peoples.  As  J.  C.  Baud 
(1789-1859),  the  first  governor  general  of  the  Netherlands  East  Indies 
with  full  executive  authority  (1834-36),  stated  succinctly,  "We  are  the

suddenly  into  existence,  however,  but  developed  in  stages,  from  hybrid 
arrangements  of  convenience  to  a  modernizing  administrative  struc- 
ture, over  the  course  of  more  than  a  century.

Historical  Setting 


Establishment  of  the  Colonial  State 

The  Dutch  colonial  state  had  its  foundation  in  conquest.  Unlike  the 
violence  used  earlier  by  the  VOC,  the  military  expansion  of  the  nine- 
teenth century  was  deliberately  territorial  and  penetrated  far  beyond 
the  coastal  areas.  It  generally  had  as  its  goal  fundamental  regime 
change  and — although  in  truth  this  was  often  beyond  Batavia's  capa- 
bility— the  establishment  of  control  by  a  centralized  authority.  Quite 
different  from  the  eighteenth  century,  too,  colonial  forces  enjoyed  a 
degree  of  technological  superiority  over  most  of  their  adversaries,  a 
result  of  the  industrial  revolution.  And,  whereas  the  VOC  had  fought 
with  an  assortment  of  indigenous  allies,  now  the  colonial  state  fought 
for  its  own  interests,  engaging  indigenous  men  as  soldiers.  The  colo- 
nial government's  separate  fighting  force,  known  as  the  Royal  Nether- 
lands Indies  Army  (KNIL),  was  founded  only  a  few  weeks  before 
Diponegoro's  surrender  in  1830.  Although  assigned  the  task  of  main- 
taining rust  en  orde  (tranquillity  and  order)  throughout  the  colonial 
state's  territories,  the  KNIL  became  best  known  for  its  role  in  the  colo- 
nial wars  of  expansion.  Dominated  by  ethnic  Dutch,  and  later  Eurasian, 
officers,  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  about  two-thirds  of  KNIL 
troops  were  Indonesians,  predominantly  Javanese  and  Ambonese,  and 
the  rest  "European,"  a  confusing  category  that  included  not  only  white 
Europeans  but  also  a  small  number  of  black  Africans  and  others. 

Modern  military  intrusions  began  at  about  the  same  time  as  the 
Java  War  and  lasted  into  the  early  twentieth  century.  Their  circum- 
stances varied.  In  some  instances,  such  as  that  of  the  Padri  Wars 
(1821-37)  in  Minangkabau  in  western  Sumatra,  the  military  assis- 
tance of  the  colonial  government  was  sought  by  indigenous  factions, 
in  this  case  members  of  the  aristocracy  and  some  village  clan  leaders 
beleaguered  by  Wahhabi-influenced  Muslim  reformers.  The  reformers 
were  defeated,  but  the  aristocracy  and  clan  leaders  eventually  surren- 
dered their  powers  to  the  colonial  state.  In  other  examples,  such  as 
those  of  Banjarmasin  (southern  Kalimantan,  1857-59)  and  Palem- 
bang  (southern  Sumatra,  1 823^9),  the  government  imposed  and  then 
deposed  rulers  without  invitation,  but  with  similar  results.  The  war 
against  the  great  power  of  Aceh  (northern  Sumatra,  1873-1903)  was 
the  most  extensive  and  costly  of  all  these  conflicts.  The  Dutch  pursued 
it  because  of  the  imperial  designs  of  other  Western  powers,  commer- 
cial and  military  competition  from  the  Acehnese,  and  the  spread  from 
Aceh  of  anti-Western,  anticolonial  Muslim  movements.  For  a  time, 
Batavia  appeared  to  take  up  the  cause  of  the  uleebalang,  or  traditional 
and  more  secular  elite,  as  had  been  the  case  in  Minangkabau,  but  this 
was  a  temporary  tactic,  and  in  any  case  the  uleebalang  too  ended  up 
subservient  to  the  colonial  state,  which  finally  annexed  Aceh  outright.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Among  the  last  conflicts  were  those  in  Bali  and  Lombok,  where 
the  intervention  of  colonial  forces  after  1840  had  been  limited,  in 
part  by  fierce  Balinese  resistance.  After  the  mid- 1880s,  however, 
warfare  and  rebellion  in  a  number  of  Balinese  kingdoms,  and  Dutch 
interest  in  controlling  the  important,  ongoing  local  trade  in  slaves 
and  opium,  led  the  colonial  state  to  apply  increasing  military  pres- 
sure. It  conquered  Lombok  in  1894,  and,  between  1906  and  1908, 
the  last  independent  Balinese  rulers  submitted.  In  the  kingdoms  of 
Badung,  Tabanan,  Klungkung,  and  others,  the  rajas  and  their  fami- 
lies and  followers  sacrificed*  themselves  in  dramatic  frontal  assaults 
on  the  KNIL  guns.  These  puputan,  or  ritual  suicides,  killed  hundreds 
of  men,  women,  and  children,  decimating  the  aristocracy  and  obliter- 
ating all  meaningful  further  resistance  to  the  expansion  of  colonial 
rule  in  Bali.  With  smaller  campaigns  to  establish  claims  of  colonial 
sovereignty  in  Timor  and  Flores  between  1908  and  1910,  the  Nether- 
lands East  Indies  reached,  at  least  in  outline,  its  final  extent,  includ- 
ing far-off  territories  such  as  the  Kai  Islands  (in  southeastern 
Maluku)  and  Papua  (on  the  island  of  New  Guinea). 

The  Cultivation  System 

A  colonial  state  aimed  at  managing  the  territories  and  people 
acquired  as  a  result  of  these  conquests — or  "pacifications,"  as  some 
preferred  to  describe  them — emerged  gradually  and  piecemeal.  It 
first  began  to  take  shape  around  the  time  of  Diponegoro's  defeat, 
with  the  inauguration  in  Java  of  policies  that  came  to  be  known  as 
the  Cultivation  System  (Cultuurstelsel).  This  was  the  brainchild  of 
Johannes  van  den  Bosch,  a  military  man  and  social  reformer  who 
became  governor  general  (1830-34)  and  later  minister  of  colonies 
(1834-39).  He  sought  to  solve  the  fiscal  problems  of  Batavia  and  the 
Netherlands,  both  of  which  were  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy,  as  well 
as  those  of  a  populace  devastated  by  warfare  on  Java.  Van  den  Bosch 
believed  that  Java  was  a  rich  but  underproductive  land,  primarily 
because  Javanese  farmers,  even  when  their  own  prosperity  was  at 
stake,  would  not  or  could  not  produce  beyond  a  subsistence  level 
unless  guided,  even  compelled,  to  do  so.  "Force,"  he  wrote,  "is 
everywhere  the  basis  of  industry  ...  where  it  does  not  exist  there  is 
neither  industry  nor  civilization." 

Van  den  Bosch's  plan  forced  Java's  farmers  either  to  use  existing 
agricultural  lands  or  open  new  ones  in  order  to  cultivate  crops  for 
export,  deliver  them  to  the  government  at  fixed  prices,  and  utilize  the 
income  to  offset  or  pay  the  government  taxes  on  their  land.  The 
crops  first  targeted  were  sugar  and  indigo,  but  coffee  and  pepper 
were  soon  added,  followed  by  newer  crops,  such  as  tea,  tobacco,  and

cinnamon.  Unlike  the  system  that  Raffles  had  contemplated,  van  den 
Bosch  proposed  dealing  with  whole  villages  rather  than  individuals, 
and  using  government  officials  and  local  authorities  (who  received  a 
percentage  of  revenues  their  areas  generated)  to  regulate  which 
crops  would  be  grown,  on  which  and  how  much  land,  with  which 
and  how  much  labor,  and  at  what  prices.  Bringing  the  produce  to  the 
world  market  through  the  Netherlands  became  the  monopoly  of  the 
Netherlands  Trading  Association  (NHM),  a  private  company  in 
which  the  Dutch  king  was  a  major  stockholder.  Entrepreneurs  in 
general  were  locked  out  of  the  state-run  system.  This  approach,  van 
den  Bosch  argued,  would  assure  production  and  profits  great  enough 
not  only  to  subsidize  the  colonial  administration  and  contribute 
handsomely  to  the  treasury  of  the  Netherlands  but  also  to  substan- 
tially improve  the  well-being  of  the  Javanese.  Scholars  and  politi- 
cians alike  have  been  arguing  ever  since  over  what  exactly  the 
results  were. 

There  is  little  doubt  that  fiscally,  and  from  a  government  perspec- 
tive, the  Cultivation  System  was  an  enormous  success.  Between  1830 
and  1870,  Java's  exports  increased  more  than  tenfold,  and  profits 
nearly  sevenfold;  the  colonial  government  regained  solvency  almost 
immediately  and  between  1 832  and  1 877  remitted  a  budgetary  surplus

(batig  slot)  totaling  823  million  Dutch  guilders  to  the  treasury  of  the 
Netherlands,  on  average  about  18  million  guilders  annually,  about  a 
third  of  the  national  budget.  It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  nine- 
teenth-century Dutch  prosperity  rested  very  largely  upon  these  funds. 

Whether  the  Javanese  benefited  from  or  were  impoverished  by  the 
Cultivation  System,  however,  is  much  less  clear.  Generalization  about 
this  question  is  made  particularly  difficult  by  the  fact  that  the  system 
as  actually  implemented  was  not  very  systematic  and  varied  consider- 
ably according  to  time,  place,  and  circumstance.  In  some  regions,  for 
example,  40  percent  of  the  adult  population  labored  for  the  system 
and  in  others,  100  percent;  in  some  areas,  less  than  4  percent  of  agri- 
cultural land  was  used  and  in  others,  15  percent.  Abuses  of  the  sys- 
tem's provisions,  including  official  corruption,  also  varied  sharply  by 
locale.  The  principal  criticisms  were,  and  continue  to  be  today,  moral 
ones.  The  Cultivation  System  was  portrayed  as  having  been  founded 
on  greed  and  as  being  not  only  coercive  and  exploitative  but  also 
prone  to  a  range  of  abuses,  all  of  which  produced,  for  the  average  vil- 
lager, only  impoverishment.  This  view  was  put  forth  most  memorably 
in  the  1860  Dutch  novel  Max  Havelaar  by  Eduard  Douwes  Dekker 
(1820-77),  an  embittered  former  colonial  official  who  wrote  under 
the  pseudonym  Multatuli  ("I  have  suffered  much").  Douwes  Dekker 's 
account  was  widely  understood,  probably  not  entirely  accurately,  as  a 
thoroughgoing  indictment  of  colonial  rule  in  general  and  the  Cultiva- 
tion System  in  particular,  which  he  accused  of  having  created  a  uni- 
formly desperate,  destitute  peasantry.  This,  or  something  much  like  it, 
became  the  received  view.  Recent  studies,  however,  based  on  reread- 
ings  of  old  evidence  as  well  as  on  archival  information  that  became 
available  only  in  the  mid-twentieth  century,  suggest  a  far  more  com- 
plex picture.  While  acknowledging  that  the  burdens  of  the  Cultivation 
System  fell  on  the  laboring  Javanese  populace,  they  also  argue  that 
the  majority  probably  saw  at  least  limited  economic  improvement  and 
took  advantage  of  new  economic  opportunities,  although  at  the  cost 
of  a  more  regimented  and  government-controlled  existence,  and  with 
the  added  risk  of  dependency  on  world  markets.  This  was  a  form  of 
circumscribed  change  that  shaped  Java's  village  world  far  into  the 
future. 

The  Cultivation  System  had  not  required  an  elaborate  state  appa- 
ratus. It  was  deliberately  a  form  of  indirect  rule  using  an  existing 
hierarchy  of  the  Javanese  priyayi  (see  Glossary)  elite,  especially  the 
upper  ranks  of  traditional  local  officeholders  known  as  the  pangreh 
praja  (rulers  of  the  realm)  and  village  heads.  As  late  as  the  mid- 
18508,  European  officials  and  regional  supervisors  numbered  fewer 
than  300  for  an  indigenous  population  of  more  than  10  million.  A

small  number  of  freelance  European  engineers  and  locally  requisi- 
tioned laborers  undertook  the  construction  of  roads  and  irrigation 
works  needed  for  the  new  plantations.  This  began  to  change,  how- 
ever, as  the  system  grew,  underwent  reform,  and  then,  especially 
after  the  Sugar  Act  and  Agrarian  Act  of  1 870,  gradually  gave  way  to 
private  enterprise.  The  responsibilities  of  the  colonial  government 
burgeoned,  and  in  order  to  meet  them,  it  expanded  pangreh  praja 
ranks  by  dividing  and  standardizing  their  administrative  territories 
and  tightened  control,  by  rescinding  their  traditional  rights  to  sym- 
bols of  status  and  access  to  villagers'  labor  and  services,  tying  them 
to  government  salaries  and  procedures.  Alongside  the  pangreh  praja 
now  served  a  growing  parallel  hierarchy  of  European  officials — 
ostensibly  functioning  as  advisers  or  "elder  brothers"  of  their  native 
counterparts  but  increasingly  directing  them — whose  reach,  by 
1882,  extended  as  far  down  as  the  subdistrict  level,  just  above  the 
village  head.  In  addition,  more  specialized  government  offices  came 
into  being:  a  Bureau  of  Public  Works  (with  its  own  corps  of  engi- 
neers and  an  irrigation  division),  as  well  as  departments  of  agricul- 
ture, education,  finance,  justice,  and  religion,  all  with  their  own 
structures  and  technical  staffs. 

The  Ethical  Policy 

In  1901  Queen  Wilhelmina  of  the  Netherlands  announced  the  gov- 
ernment's acceptance  of  the  idea  that  it  owed  a  "debt  of  honor"  to  the 
East  Indies  because  of  the  profits  generated  by  the  Cultivation  System, 
and  its  intention  of  henceforth  basing  its  colonial  policies  on  a  "moral 
duty"  to  them.  This  new  direction,  commonly  referred  to  by  historians 
as  the  Ethical  Policy,  called  for  new  and  extensive  government  initia- 
tives to  expand  public  schooling,  improve  health  care,  modernize 
infrastructure  (communications,  transportation,  and  irrigation),  and 
reduce  poverty.  The  administrative  system  was  to  be  overhauled  in 
favor  of  a  more  modern,  efficient  structure.  Colonial  authorities  began 
decentralizing  fiscal  and  administrative  responsibilities  (in  1903  and 
1922,  respectively),  forming  local  and  colony- wide  semirepresenta- 
tive  political  bodies  (among  them  the  Peoples'  Council,  or  Volksraad, 
in  1918),  and  ending,  or  at  least  modifying,  the  dualism  inherent  in  the 
interior  administrative  service  with  its  parallel  lines  of  European  and 
indigenous  officials.  In  addition,  for  the  first  time,  the  colonial  state 
attempted  to  simplify  and  standardize  the  administrative  features  of  its 
rule  in  the  Outer  Islands  (see  Glossary),  using  what  was  being  done  on 
Java  (and  Madura  and  Bali)  as  a  rough  template. 

Although  Ethicists,  as  supporters  of  the  policy  were  called,  may 
sometimes  have  been  seen  as  arguing  for  a  weakening  of  colonial

rule  and  lessening  of  European  influence,  this  was  not  the  case.  They 
aimed  at  modernizing  the  imperial  state,  which  also  meant  Europe- 
anizing,  or  at  least  Westernizing,  it.  It  is  fair  to  say  that  in  technical 
matters  the  Ethicists  were  more  successful  than  with  social  and  polit- 
ical questions:  food  production  generally  kept  pace  with  population 
growth,  and  distribution  improved;  efforts  to  combat  the  plague  and 
other  diseases  were  moderately  effective;  and  irrigation  and  trans- 
portation facilities  (roads,  railroads,  and  shipping  lines)  grew  rap- 
idly. The  problem  of  administrative  dualism  could  not  be  resolved, 
however,  largely  because  European  officialdom  was  unwilling  to 
surrender  its  position.  Political  decentralization  and  the  introduction 
of  some  form  of  representation  for  Europeans  and  indigenes  edu- 
cated in  Europe  were  limited  by,  among  other  things,  the  central 
government's  reluctance  to  surrender  its  ultimate  control  of  budget- 
ary and  legal  affairs.  Likewise,  legal  standardization  foundered  on 
the  increasingly  heated  debate  over  whether  non-Europeans  should 
be  subject  to  Western  law  or  to  other  legal  principles  such  as  those  of 
local  unwritten  custom  (adai)  or  the  sharia  (see  Glossary),  Islamic 
law,  called  syariah  in  Bahasa  Indonesia. 

The  Racial  Issue 

The  unresolved  issue  of  greatest  importance  was  that  of  racial  classi- 
fication, which  the  modern  Dutch  historian  Cees  Fasseur  has  identified 
as  both  the  "cornerstone  and  stumbling  block"  of  the  colonial  state. 
Under  the  VOC,  people  were  classified  mainly  on  the  basis  of  religion 
rather  than  race,  Christianized  indigenes  generally  falling  under  the 
same  laws  as  Protestant  Europeans.  In  the  early  nineteenth  century, 
however,  "enlightened"  ideas  began  to  emphasize — often  on  "humani- 
tarian" grounds  that  sought  protection  of  indigenous  peoples — a  separa- 
tion between  native  and  European  rights,  and  the  Cultivation  System, 
with  its  clear  distinction  between  rulers  and  ruled,  emphasized  that 
divide.  In  practice,  if  not  yet  in  law,  non-Europeans  were  treated  very 
differently  from  Europeans  in  judicial  and  penal  matters,  and  in  1 848 
legal  and  commercial  codes  appeared  that  were  applicable  to  Europeans 
only.  Statutes  of  1 854  made  a  formal  (but  not  very  specific)  distinction 
between  Europeans  and  natives  {inlanders),  at  the  same  time  as  offering 
them  "equal"  protection.  Everyday  understanding  and  practice,  how- 
ever, was  that  "equal"  did  not  mean  "the  same,"  and  that,  in  particular, 
Europeans  and  Asians  occupied  separate  legal  spheres.  Almost  immedi- 
ately, however,  there  were  difficulties.  The  category  of  Asians  was  fur- 
ther divided  into  "natives"  and  "foreign  orientals,"  among  whom  the 
Chinese,  ostensibly  for  business  reasons,  in  1885  were  determined  to 
fall  under  European  commercial  law.  The  category  "European"  did  not 


39 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

distinguish  between  full-blooded  Europeans — the  so-called  totok 
Dutch — and  those  of  mixed  European  and  indigenous  parentage — the 
Eurasians,  or  so-called  Indos.  In  1899,  for  political  reasons,  the  Japanese 
were  accorded  European  public  and  private  legal  status,  and  in  1925  the 
same  was  done  for  those  whose  country  of  origin  adopted  Western  fam- 
ily laws,  such  as  Turkey  and  Siam  (after  1939,  Thailand).  "Natives" 
remained  a  separate,  and  lower,  category. 

One  might  think  that  these  circumstances  would  soon  have  led  to 
the  abandonment  of  all  racial  or  national  distinctions  and  a  unifica- 
tion of  colonial  law  and  policy  in  general,  but  instead  a  fundamental 
dualism — native  and  European — remained.  This  outcome  is  all  the 
more  remarkable  because  it  was  at  odds  with  important  realities  in 
colonial  life.  In  the  early  twentieth  century,  Europeans  increasingly 
married  across  racial  categories.  In  1905  about  15  percent  were  in 
interracial  marriages,  rising  to  27.5  percent  by  1925.  And,  although 
by  the  mid- 1920s  the  older  mix  of  dress  and  sensibilities  known  as 
"Indies"  (Indische)  culture  was  rapidly  giving  way  to  more  modern, 
urbanized,  European-  and  American-influenced  forms,  numerous 
memoirs  of  Europeans,  Eurasians,  Chinese,  and  Indonesians  make  it 
clear  that,  despite  obvious  racial  tensions  and  divisions,  a  new  sort  of 
Dutch- speaking,  racially  mixed,  and  culturally  modern  society  was 
coming  into  being,  mostly  in  the  largest  cities  and  mostly  among  the 
upper  and  upper-middle  economic  classes. 

A  powerful  countercurrent  was  also  developing,  however.  In  part, 
this  was  the  result  of  the  stubborn  refusal  of  the  colonial  state  either 
to  surrender  the  formal  dualism  on  which  it  had  been  built,  or  to  face 
squarely  the  many  anomalies  created  by  its  insistence  on  legal  classi- 
fication. Especially  as  the  specters  of  nationalism  and  communism 
came  into  focus  after  1918,  the  idea  of  emancipation  for  all  simply 
could  not  be  accepted,  either  in  the  abstract  or  for  practical  reasons. 
Other  factors  included  the  greater  numbers  of  newcomer,  full- 
blooded  Europeans,  including  women,  arriving  in  the  colony,  most 
of  whom  had  the  notion  that  colonial  life  there  should  adjust  itself  to 
their  standards,  not  the  other  way  around.  The  resentment  that 
resulted  among  Eurasians  and  indigenes,  already  chafing  against  the 
effects  of  both  formal  and  informal  discrimination,  the  Great 
Depression  of  the  1930s,  and  the  approach  of  World  War  II  (1939— 
45)  in  different  ways  deepened  existing  fears.  After  1930,  racism 
became  more  visible  in  all  coiners  of  colonial  society.  To  all  of  this 
the  colonial  government  remained  strangely  cold,  taking  merely  an 
attitude  of  watchfulness  and  determination  to  "keep  the  peace." 
When,  in  1 940,  the  governor  general  appointed  the  Visman  Commis- 
sion to  determine  what  the  public  really  thought  about  issues  con- 
nected with  the  constitutional  development  of  the  colony,  the 


40 


Historical  Setting 


clearest  finding  was  that  discrimination  was  universally  considered  a 
serious  problem,  and  that  all  other  groups  wished  to  hold  legal 
equality  with  Europeans.  The  commission's  own  suggestions  for 
solving  the  problem  by  replacing  racial  criteria  with  education, 
financial,  and  other  measures  were  unworkable,  and  in  any  case  time 
had  run  out.  On  December  7,  1941,  two  days  after  the  commission 
submitted  its  report,  Japan  attacked  the  United  States  naval  base  at 
Pearl  Harbor. 

Modernism  and  Nationalism  in  the  Colonial  Age 

The  Rise  of  Education  and  Student  Associations,  1900- 
1920 

At  the  dawn  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  young  daughter  of  a  Java- 
nese pangreh  praja,  Raden  Ajeng  (R.  A.)  Kartini  (1879-1904), 
expressed  in  letters  to  Dutch  friends  her  enthusiasm  for  the  "Spirit  of 
the  Age  ...  [before  which]  solid  ancient  structures  tottered,"  and  her 
joy  at  witnessing  the  "transition  from  old  to  new"  that  was  going  on 
around  her.  Her  main  concern,  however,  was  how  her  own  people, 
whom  she  described  as  "grown-up  children,"  might  progress — not 
precisely  on  a  European  model,  but  certainly  with  Dutch  assistance — 
and  concluded  that  the  only  way  forward  was  through  Dutch  educa- 
tion. Kartini  was  only  in  part  echoing  ideas  close  to  the  hearts  of  the 
Ethicists  who  befriended  and  later  lionized  her  and  her  efforts  to  pro- 
mote modern  education  for  women  as  splendid  examples  of  their 
cause;  it  is  clear  that  she  rebelled  against  her  traditional  environment 
early  on,  and  also  did  not  always  agree  with  her  Ethicist  friends.  She 
was  not  alone.  At  roughly  the  same  time,  young  male  contemporaries 
from  the  Javanese  privileged  classes  who  attended  government 
schools  were  coming  to  similar  conclusions,  and  were  in  a  better  posi- 
tion to  take  more  public,  activist  positions.  Like  Minke,  the  hero  of 
the  1980  novel  set  in  Kartini's  day  by  Pramudya  Ananta  Tur  (1925- 
2006)  in  his  Bumi  Manusia  (This  Earth  of  Mankind),  they  were  alien- 
ated from  their  parents'  generation,  saw  no  future  in  aristocratic  status 
or  careers  as  pangreh  praja,  and  felt  drawn  to  all  that  was  new,  scien- 
tific, and  modern.  They  did  not  yet  have  the  idea  of  a  nation  in  mind, 
but  they  were  busy  trying  to  imagine  a  modern  society  of  their  own, 
and  how  to  make  it  a  reality.  In  the  process,  they  began  to  coalesce  as 
a  new  priyayi  class — a  class  based  on  achievement  rather  than  birth, 
devotion  to  modernity  rather  than  tradition — that  would  determine  the 
course  of  their  country's  history  for  the  remainder  of  the  century. 

That  was  not,  of  course,  exactly  what  the  Ethicists  had  in  mind 
when  they  promoted  Western  education.  They  had  hoped  to  create  a 


41 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

broad  new  priyayi  class,  which,  thanks  to  a  modern  Western  educa- 
tion, would  take  a  cooperative,  associationist  path.  Such  was  the  goal 
behind  the  extensive  education  reforms  that,  beginning  in  1900,  over- 
hauled the  limited  training  available  for  medical  personnel,  vernacu- 
lar primary  school  teachers,  and  prospective  pangreh  praja.  The  most 
important  institutions  to  appear  were  the  School  for  Training  Native 
Government  Officials  (OSVIA)  and  the  School  for  Training  Native 
Doctors  (STOVIA),  both  established  in  1900,  and  the  Dutch-Native 
Schools  (HIS),  established  in  1914,  which  were  Dutch-language  pri- 
mary schools  for  the  upper  classes.  There  was  also  a  significant 
expansion  of  vernacular  primary  village  schools  {sekolah  desa). 

Looking  at  the  colony  as  a  whole,  these  advances  may  seem  negli- 
gible. As  late  as  1930,  about  10,000  sekolah  desa  enrolled  roughly 
1.6  million  students,  or  2.8  percent  of  a  population  estimated  at  60 
million.  Dutch-language  education  enrolled  far  fewer  indigenous 
students:  about  85,000  or  roughly  0.14  percent  of  the  total  popula- 
tion. General  literacy  was  estimated  at  7.5  percent  and  in  Dutch, 
about  0.3  percent.  The  Dutch-language  schools  with  Western-style 
curricula  created  a  small  but  motivated  group,  however,  who 
emerged  with  a  changed  outlook.  The  schools  were  located  princi- 
pally on  Java,  where  they  gathered  together  students  from  all  over 
the  archipelago  and  gave  them  a  shared  experience.  More  convinced 
than  ever  of  the  power  of  Western  education,  they  also  grew  dissatis- 
fied. Although  Dutch-language  schools  above  the  HIS  enrolled 
Europeans  as  well  as  indigenes,  the  latter  were  a  comparatively 
small  minority,  and  they  often  felt  the  sting  of  prejudice,  both  real 
and  perceived.  Equal  in  education,  indigenous  students  began  to 
chafe  under  obvious  inequalities:  legal,  economic,  and  social.  They 
also  quickly  became  aware  of  what  a  tiny  minority  they  were  in  their 
own  society,  and  that  the  demand  for  Dutch-language  education, 
widely  seen  as  key  to  social  and  economic  advancement,  was  far 
beyond  the  colonial  government's  ability  or  willingness  to  provide. 
Rather  than  generations  of  grateful  and  subservient  graduates,  the 
colonial  schools  quickly  produced  a  significant  number  of  malcon- 
tents, whose  most  common  message  was  not  that  the  colonial  state 
was  modernizing  indigenous  society  too  quickly,  but  precisely  the 
opposite.  They  believed  they  could,  and  had  the  duty  to,  do  better. 

Students  from  Dutch-language  schools  founded  the  first  indige- 
nous groups  organized  along  Western-influenced  lines  and  aimed  at 
modernization  and  education.  Probably  the  first  person  to  do  this  was 
the  pangreh  praja  son,  ex- STOVIA  student,  and  pioneer  journalist 
Raden  Mas  Tirtoadisuryo  (1880-1918),  who  in  1906  established  the 
Serikat  Priyayi  (Priyayi  Association),  aimed  at  convincing  the  colo- 
nial authorities  to  expand  educational  opportunities  for  priyayi.  The

best-known  and  officially  recognized  organization,  however,  was 
Budi  Utomo  (Noble  Endeavor),  founded  in  1908  by  Wahidin  Sudiro- 
husodo  (1857-1917),  also  a  pangreh  praja  son,  graduate  of  a 
STOVIA  predecessor  school,  and  journalist.  Wahidin's  goal  was  to 
organize  financial  support  that  would  allow  more  priyayi  to  attend 
Dutch-medium  schools;  he  discovered  his  most  enthusiastic  support- 
ers were  found  among  STOVIA  students,  who  formed  the  core  of 
Budi  Utomo.  In  1909  a  Surakarta  batik  merchant,  Samanhudi  (1868- 
1956),  asked  Tirtoadisuryo  to  organize  native  businessmen,  appar- 
ently in  response  to  Chinese  competition  in  the  trade.  The  result  was 
the  Sarekat  Dagang  Islam  (Islamic  Trade  Association),  which  in  1912 
became  the  Sarekat  Islam  (Islamic  Association).  Now  under  the  lead- 
ership of  Haji  Umar  Said  (H.  U.  S.)  Cokroaminoto  (1882-1934),  an 
OSVIA  graduate  who  had  left  government  service,  the  Sarekat  Islam 
had  as  one  of  its  major  goals  the  expansion  of  education  of,  especially, 
lower  priyayi,  and  as  a  result  the  colonial  government  initially  reacted 
approvingly,  as  it  had  done  with  Budi  Utomo. 

Cokroaminoto's  personal  charisma,  and  his  ability  to  use  religion 
to  attract  wide  public  interest,  helped  the  organization  expand  rap- 
idly— perhaps  to  2  million  members  in  1919 — and  this  mass  base  in 
turn  attracted  those  with  quite  different  political  interests.  Founded 
in  1913  by  the  Dutch  radical  socialist  Hendrik  Sneevliet  (1883- 
1942),  the  Indies  Social-Democratic  Association  (ISDV),  a  small 
leftist  party  that  had  at  first  sought  an  audience  in  Eurasian  groups 
and  among  laborers  in  modern  industries,  turned  to  Sarekat  Islam. 
The  young  Javanese  railway  worker  Semaun  (1899-1971)  and  the 
Minangkabau  journalist  Abdul  Muis  (1890-1959)  propagated  radi- 
cal Marxist  ideas  among  followers  of  Sarekat  Islam,  which  eventu- 
ally split  over  political  issues.  The  ISDV  in  1920  became  the 
Communist  Association  of  the  Indies  (PKH),  which  after  1924  was 
known  as  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party  (PKI — see  Glossary). 
The  Muslim  organization  Muhammadiyah  (Followers  of  Muham- 
mad) was  founded  in  Yogyakarta  in  1912  by  Kiyai  Haji  Muhammad 
Dahlan  (1869-1933),  a  reforming  "modernist"  who  had  joined  Budi 
Utomo  three  years  earlier  and  had  been  encouraged  by  its  members 
to  establish  modern  Muslim  schools.  Muhammadiyah,  and  its  "tradi- 
tionalist" counterpart  Nahdlatul  Ulama,  founded  in  Surabaya  in  1926 
by  Kiyai  Haji  Hasyim  Asyari  (1871-1947),  became  very  large  and 
important  associations,  but  their  focus  was  primarily  on  educational 
and  social  affairs.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Formation  of  Political  Parties,  1911-27 

All  of  these  organizations,  and  the  myriad  student  groups  that 
sprang  up  after  1915  under  names  such  as  Young  Java  (Jong  Java), 
the  Young  Sumatrans'  Association  (Jong  Sumatranen  Bond),  and 
Minahasa  Students'  Association  (Studerende  Vereniging  Minahasa), 
had  similar  Western-oriented,  upper-class,  younger-generation,  new 
priyayi  outlooks  and  expressed  similar  dissatisfactions  with — and 
sought  one  or  another  degree  of  emancipation  from — the  colonial 
state.  Initially  none  of  theih  articulated  a  national  idea.  Then  one 
organization  ventured  down  that  path:  the  Indies  Party  (Indische 
Partij),  founded  in  1911  by  the  radical  Eurasian  E.  F.  E.  Douwes 
Dekker  (1879-1950),  grandson  of  Multatuli's  brother  Jan.  The 
younger  Douwes  Dekker  was  later  joined  by  two  Javanese,  Cipto 
Mangunkusumo  (1886-1943),  a  STOVIA  graduate  and  charter 
member  of  Budi  Utomo,  and  Raden  Mas  Suwardi  Suryaningrat 
(1889-1959),  an  aristocrat  of  the  Pakualaman,  STOVIA  student,  and 
journalist.  After  1922,  under  the  name  Ki  Hajar  Dewantara,  Suwardi 
became  an  important  leader  in  the  field  of  education  by  establishing 
the  private  Taman  Siswa  (Student  Garden)  schools. 

Douwes  Dekker  and  the  Indies  Party  not  only  called  for  indepen- 
dence of  the  colony  but  argued,  using  Austria-Hungary,  Switzerland, 
and  the  United  States  as  supporting  examples,  that  all  those  who 
called  the  archipelago  home  should  be  citizens  regardless  of  race.  He 
called  for  a  nation  and  nationalism  that  were  modern  and  multiethnic. 
In  1913  Suwardi  published  an  article  entitled  "Als  ik  eens  een  Neder- 
lander  was"  (If  I  were  a  Dutchman),  which,  with  famously  acid 
humor,  suggested  that,  if  he  were  a  Dutch  person  celebrating  the  cen- 
tennial of  liberation  from  Napoleonic  rule  in  that  year,  he  would  not 
let  the  natives  of  the  colony  know  about  it,  as  they  might  get  ideas 
about  freedom,  too.  This  was  too  much  for  the  colonial  government, 
which  promptly  banned  the  party  and  exiled  its  three  leaders  to  the 
Netherlands  for  six  years. 

It  was  precisely  there  and  at  that  time,  however,  that  the  idea  of 
Indonesia  (from  the  Greek  indos — for  India — and  nesos — for  island) 
was  taking  shape.  The  term  was  coined  by  mid-nineteenth-century 
English  observers,  who  meant  it  in  a  general  ethnographic  or  geo- 
graphic sense.  Europeans,  including  the  Dutch,  found  the  word 
descriptively  handy,  and  it  was  used  in  learned  circles  in  the  early 
twentieth  century.  That  is  when  the  small  number  of  indigenous  stu- 
dents who  came  from  the  Netherlands  Indies  encountered  it.  Austra- 
lian historian  Robert  E.  Elson  reports  that  the  first  recorded  uses  of 
the  words  "Indonesia"  and  "Indonesians"  by  an  indigenous  speaker 
were  in  1917  public  talks  by  the  musicologist  Raden  Mas  Sonder

Suryaputra  in  The  Hague  and  Baginda  Dahlan  Abdullah  in  Leiden. 
They  used  the  phrase  "we  Indonesians"  and  spoke  of  the  right  of 
Indonesians  "to  share  in  the  government  of  the  country."  In  1922  the 
organization  of  Indonesian  students  in  the  Netherlands  changed  its 
name  from  the  Indies  Association  (Indische  Vereniging)  to  Indone- 
sian Association  (Indonesische  Vereniging),  the  first  organization  to 
use  the  word  "Indonesia"  (in  Dutch)  in  its  name.  When  Suwardi 
gave  a  speech  at  Leiden  University  using  the  term  a  few  months 
later,  it  was  clear  that  both  the  idea  and  name  of  Indonesia  had  taken 
hold,  and  the  struggle  to  give  it  intellectual  and  practical  meaning 
had  truly  begun. 

It  has  become  customary  to  describe  Indonesia's  formative  nation- 
alist discourse  in  terms  of  three  distinct  streams  of  thought  (aliran), 
and  to  emphasize  the  discord  among  the  "secular"  or  "territorial," 
Marxist,  and  Muslim  streams;  a  further  division  sometimes  referred 
to  is  between  "radical"  and  "moderate"  followers.  This  sort  of  cate- 
gorization is  not  entirely  beside  the  point,  for  it  indeed  reflects  many 
of  the  tensions  and  debates  that  filled  the  air.  The  colonial  state, 
which  founded  the  Political  Intelligence  Service  (PID)  in  1916  in  an 
effort  to  understand  the  burgeoning  political  activity  among  Indone- 
sians, borrowed  these  categories  from  the  writings  and  speeches  of 
those  whom  they  watched  and  used  them  to  organize  their  reports. 
The  separation,  however,  was  in  some  respects  artificial.  For  one 
thing,  Indonesians  began  rather  early  to  speak  of  the  movement 
(pergerakan),  by  which  they  meant  all  efforts  that  aimed  at  or  pre- 
supposed obtaining  freedom  (merdeka,  kemerdekaan)  from  Dutch 
rule.  Among  both  sophisticates  and  more  ordinary  folk,  membership 
in  two  or  more  organizations  that  straddled  categories  was  not 
uncommon,  and  leaders  made  a  variety  of  attempts  to  bridge  them, 
for  example  Muslim  and  Marxist  ideas  by  the  Javanese  "Red  Haji," 
Mohamad  Misbach  (7-1926),  or  Marxist  and  nationalist  principles 
by  the  Minangkabau  Tan  Malaka  (1897-1949).  Still,  there  was  some- 
thing thrilling  about  both  the  discord  and  the  struggle  to  find  a  way 
out  of  it,  something  that  suggested  not  just  an  intellectual  world  in 
motion  but  physical  action. 

Already,  in  1919  bloody  uprisings  in  Tolitoli,  Manado  (northern 
Sulawesi),  and  Cimareme,  Garut  (western  Java),  Sarekat  Islam  had 
been  implicated  and  the  specter  of  a  radical,  activist  Islam  raised. 
The  colonial  state  moved  in  quickly  with  investigations  and  arrests. 
In  1925  PKI  labor  organizers  led  strikes  in  the  principalities  and  in 
the  cities  of  Semarang  and  Surabaya,  and  in  1926  and  1927  local 
PKI  leaders  prompted  sabotage  and  rebellion  in  western  Java  and 
western  Sumatra,  respectively.  The  colonial  state  responded  by 
arresting  more  than  13,000  people,  of  whom  4,500  were  given  prison

sentences,  and  nearly  one-third  of  these  were  sent  to  a  newly  con- 
structed prison  camp  in  remote  Boven  Digul  known  as  Tanah  Merah 
(Red  Earth),  in  Papua. 

The  Rise  of  Sukarno,  1921-26 

At  the  same  time  as  the  colonial  government  was  repressing  Mus- 
lim- and  Marxist-tinted  movements,  the  "secular"  stream  was  under- 
going significant  change.  This  was  principally  the  work  of  Sukarno 
(1901-70),  son  of  a  Javanese  lower  priyayi  school  teacher  and  a 
middle-class  Balinese  woman.  He  attended  Dutch-language  schools 
in  Surabaya,  where  he  boarded  in  the  home  of  Cokroaminoto,  and  in 
Bandung,  western  Java,  where  he  graduated  as  an  architect  from  the 
new  Technical  College,  one  of  the  best  and  most  expensive  schools 
in  the  colony.  Well-read  and  acquainted  with  many  of  the  most 
prominent  Indonesian  political  figures  of  the  day,  Sukarno  first 
established  a  political  study  club  on  the  model  begun  in  Surabaya  by 
the  early  Budi  Utomo  leader  Dr.  Sutomo  (1888-1938),  an  ophthal- 
mologist, and  then,  in  1927,  a  political  group  which  a  year  later 
became  known  as  the  Indonesian  Nationalist  Party  (PNI).  The  funda- 
mental idea  that  Sukarno  invested  in  the  PNI  was  that  achieving  the 
nation — acquiring  independence  from  Dutch  rule — came  before  and 
above  everything  else,  which  meant  in  turn  that  unity  was  necessary. 
Quarrels  about  the  role  of  Islam  or  Marxist  ideas  or  even  democracy 
in  an  eventual  Indonesia  were  at  the  moment  beside  the  point.  Social 
class  was  beside  the  point.  All  differences  dissolved  before  the  need 
for  unity  in  reaching  the  goal  of  merdeka. 

In  1921  Sukarno  had  fashioned  the  idea  of  marhaen,  the  "ordinary 
person"  representing  all  Indonesians,  as  a  substitute  for  the  Marxist 
concept  of  proletariat,  which  he  found  too  divisive,  and  argued  that 
developing  a  mass  following  among  ordinary  folk  was  the  key  to 
defeating  colonial  rule.  And  in  1926  he  published  a  long  essay  enti- 
tled "Nationalism,  Islam,  and  Marxism,"  in  which  he  laid  the  foun- 
dation for  a  new  nationalism,  one  that  was  neither  Muslim  nor 
Marxist  but  comprised  its  own — national — ideology,  largely  by  sug- 
gesting that  significant  differences  could  not  exist  among  those  who 
were  serious  about  struggling  for  freedom.  This  extravagant  inclu- 
siveness  did  not,  however,  extend  to  race.  Sukarno  pitched  the  strug- 
gle as  between  us  (Indonesians)  and  others,  sini  or  sana  (literally, 
here  or  there),  a  "brown  front"  against  a  "white  front."  With  respect 
to  the  colonial  state,  one  was  either  ko  or  non-Are?  (cooperative  or 
not).  Sukarno  specified  in  the  PNI  statutes  that  non-Indonesians — 
Eurasians,  Chinese,  whites — could  aspire  only  to  associate  member- 
ship at  best.  In  his  1930  defense  oration  when  on  trial  by  the  colonial

Historical  Setting 


authorities,  entitled  "Indonesia  Menggugat!"  (Indonesia  Accuses!), 
Sukarno  also  depicted  the  Indonesian  nation  as  not  merely  an  inven- 
tion of  the  present  but  rather  a  reality  of  the  historical  past  now  being 
revived.  It  was  a  glorious  (racial)  past  leading  through  a  dark  present 
to  a  bright  and  shining  future. 

These  ideas,  delivered  in  Sukarno's  famously  charismatic  style, 
were  both  radical  and  seductive.  Part  of  their  attraction  was  that  they 
stirred  deep  emotions;  in  part,  too,  they  permitted,  even  encouraged, 
the  denial  of  genuine  differences  among  Indonesians,  and  the  high- 
lighting of  those  between  Indonesians  and  others.  Not  everyone 
agreed  with  the  PNI  program,  even  among  those  who  joined.  Moham- 
mad Hatta  (1902-80)  and  Sutan  Syahrir  (1909-66),  Sumatrans  who 
were  among  Sukarno's  closest  associates  and  later  served  him  as  vice 
president  and  prime  minister,  respectively,  both  had  misgivings  about 
the  "mass  action"  approach  and  warned  as  early  as  1929  against  dem- 
agoguery  and  the  growth  of  an  intellectually  shallow  nationalism. 
Syahrir  also  was  scathing  about  the  sini  or  sana  concept,  especially 
for  the  way  it  implied  an  unbridgeable  gap  between  East  and  West,  a 
concept  Syahrir  thought  both  mythical  and  dangerous.  Hatta  was  per- 
haps more  equivocal,  for  in  the  Netherlands  in  1926,  as  president  of 
the  Perhimpunan  Indonesia  (Indonesian  Association),  which  had  suc- 
ceeded the  Indonesische  Vereniging,  he  had  specifically  prohibited 
Eurasians  from  membership. 

The  encompassing,  driving  sense  of  national  unity  and  the  defiant 
stand  against  colonial  rule  were,  nevertheless,  widely  appealing  and 
influenced  Indonesians  everywhere.  They  were  clearly  an  inspiration 
behind  the  decisions  of  the  Second  Youth  Congress  in  1928,  which 
adopted  the  red-and-white  flag  and  the  anthem  "Indonesia  Raya"  (Great 
Indonesia)  as  official  national  icons,  and  on  October  28,  1928,  passed 
the  resolution  known  as  the  Youth  Pledge  (Sumpah  Pemuda),  which 
proclaimed  loyalty  to  "one  birthplace/fatherland  (bertumpah  darah  satu, 
tanah  air):  Indonesia;  one  people/nation  (satu  bangsa):  Indonesia;  and 
one  unifying  language  (bahasa  persatuan):  Indonesian."  Little  matter 
that,  for  example,  the  Malay  language  on  which  this  new  "Indonesian" 
was  to  be  based  was  at  the  time  little  spoken  among  the  Dutch-educated 
students  who  proclaimed  it  the  national  language;  they  would  learn  and 
develop  it  as  they  developed  the  nation  itself. 

Colonial  Government  Reactions,  1927-40 

The  colonial  government  found  this  new  Indonesian  nationalism  at 
least  as  revolutionary,  and  at  least  as  frightening,  as  it  had  the  prospects 
of  Muslim  or  Marxist  revolution.  In  1927-28  Hatta  and  several  other 
Perhimpunan  Indonesia  members  were  arrested  in  the  Netherlands  and 


47 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

charged  with  fomenting  armed  rebellion,  but  acquitted.  In  the  East 
Indies,  after  his  arrest  and  trial  in  1929-30,  Sukarno  served  two  years 
in  prison.  Taken  into  custody  again  in  1933,  he  was  held  under  house 
arrest,  first  in  remote  Ende,  Flores,  then  in  Bengkulu,  western  Sumatra, 
until  the  Japanese  occupation  (see  The  Japanese  Occupation,  1942-45, 
this  ch.).  Hatta  and  Syahrir  were  arrested  in  1934  and  sent  to  Boven 
Digul,  and  two  years  later  to  Banda  Neira,  Maluku,  also  for  the 
remainder  of  Dutch  rule.  These  and  other  arrests  of  leaders,  along  with 
ever-tighter  political  surveillance,  crippled  noncooperating  parties  and 
curbed  public  anticolonial  expression  but  did  not  halt  the  spread  of 
nationalist  sentiment. 

In  1932  the  government,  convinced — with  some  justification — 
that  privately  run  Indonesian  schools  (for  example,  Ki  Hajar  Dewan- 
tara's  Taman  Siswa  schools  and  schools  supported  by  Muhammadi- 
yah  and  by  various  political  parties  like  the  PNI)  were  nationalist 
breeding  grounds,  attempted  to  subject  them  to  strict  state  control  in 
a  so-called  Wild  Schools  Ordinance.  The  outcry  was  so  loud  and  so 
unequivocal,  even  among  the  most  cooperative  groups,  that  the  ordi- 
nance had  to  be  modified,  and  in  the  following  decade  the  number  of 
Indonesian-run  and  -financed  private  schools  grew  rapidly.  Far  more 
Indonesians,  particularly  those  from  an  expanding  urban  middle 
class,  sought  a  modern  education  than  the  colonial  government  was 
able  or  willing  to  satisfy;  the  Indonesian  intelligentsia  took  the  initia- 
tive themselves,  and  effectively  used  the  opportunity  to  further  a 
nationalist  agenda.  History  lessons,  for  example,  did  not  follow  the 
colonial  curriculum  but  emphasized  the  glories  of  Majapahit  and 
made  national  heroes  of  all  those  who  had  fought  Dutch  forces,  such 
as  Diponegoro.  These  schools  had  a  significant  impact.  By  the  end 
of  the  1930s  in  the  city  of  Surabaya,  for  instance,  they  enrolled  four 
times  as  many  students  as  the  government  schools. 

The  attempts  of  the  colonial  government  during  the  1930s  to 
repress  Indonesian  nationalism  were  associated  particularly  with 
Governor  General  B.  C.  de  Jonge  (in  office  1931-36),  infamous  for 
his  remark  that  the  Dutch  had  already  ruled  the  Indies  for  350  years 
and  were  going  to  do  so  for  350  years  more.  Not  everyone  in  the 
European  community  agreed  with  these  hardline  views,  and  some 
supported  greater  autonomy  from  The  Hague  so  that  they  could  run 
the  Indies  as  they  wished.  Some  voted  in  favor  of  the  Sutarjo  Peti- 
tion of  1936,  which  modestly  sought  approval  for  a  conference  to 
consider  dominion  status  for  the  Netherlands  East  Indies  in  10  years' 
time  (it  was  later  rejected  by  the  Dutch  government);  others  com- 
plained aloud  that  the  East  Indies  had  become  a  police  state.  But  the 
approaching  war  made  the  thought  of  change  even  less,  not  more,

likely.  The  Netherlands  fell  to  Hitler's  forces  on  May  10,  1940,  leav- 
ing the  colony  more  or  less  to  its  own  devices.  Six  months  later,  the 
colonial  government  made  it  clear  that  it  was  unalterably  opposed  to 
Indonesia  merdeka — a  free  Indonesia — and  therefore  to  the  Indone- 
sian national  idea  as  it  had  developed  to  that  time;  no  real  accommo- 
dation was  possible.  Little  wonder  that  by  that  time  a  great  many 
thoughtful  Indonesians,  even  the  most  moderate,  had  concluded  that 
only  the  shock  and  dislocation  of  war  in  the  archipelago  might — 
possibly — bring  about  changes  favorable  to  them. 

War  and  Early  Independence 

The  Japanese  Occupation,  1942-45 

Japan's  decision  to  occupy  the  Netherlands  East  Indies  was  based 
primarily  on  the  need  for  raw  materials,  especially  oil  from  Sumatra 
and  Kalimantan.  Shortly  after  the  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor,  Japanese 
forces  moved  into  Southeast  Asia.  The  occupation  of  the  archipelago 
took  place  in  stages,  beginning  in  the  east  with  landings  in  Tarakan, 
northeastern  Kalimantan,  and  Kendari,  southeastern  Sulawesi,  in 
early  January  1942,  and  Ambon,  Maluku,  at  the  end  of  that  month. 
At  the  beginning  of  February,  Japanese  forces  invaded  Sumatra  from 
the  north,  and  at  the  end  of  the  month,  the  Battle  of  the  Java  Sea 
cleared  the  way  for  landings  near  Bantam,  Cirebon,  and  Tuban,  on 
Java,  on  March  1 ;  Japanese  forces  met  with  little  resistance,  and  the 
KNIL  announced  its  surrender  on  March  8,  1942. 

The  occupation  was  to  last  for  42  months,  from  March  1942  until 
mid- August  1945,  and  this  period  properly  belongs  to  Indonesia's 
colonial  era.  Indonesians  who  had  cautiously  welcomed  the  idea  of  a 
Japanese  victory  because  it  might  advance  a  nationalist  agenda  were 


49 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

disappointed  by  Japan's  initial  actions.  The  idea  that  the  colony 
might  form  a  national  unit  did  not  appeal  to  the  new  power,  which 
divided  the  territory  administratively  between  the  Japanese  Imperial 
Army  and  the  Japanese  Imperial  Navy,  with  the  Sixteenth  Army  in 
Java,  the  Twenty-fifth  Army  in  Sumatra  (but  headquartered  until 
1943  in  Singapore,  afterwards  in  Bukittinggi,  western  Sumatra),  and 
the  navy  in  the  eastern  archipelago.  As  late  as  May  1943,  these  areas 
were — unlike  the  Philippines  and  Burma — slated  to  remain  perma- 
nent imperial  possessions,  colonial  territories  rather  than  autono- 
mous states,  within  the  Greater  East  Asia  Co-Prosperity  Sphere. 
Some  Japanese  pan-Asianists  and  national  idealists  did  have  notions 
that  Japan's  true  duty  was  to  bring  independence  to  Indonesia,  but 
they  had  little  real  influence  on  imperial  policy.  And  less  than  two 
weeks  after  the  Dutch  surrender,  the  Japanese  military  government 
on  Java  not  only  banned  all  political  organizations  but  prohibited  the 
use  of  the  red-and-white  flag  and  the  anthem  "Indonesia  Raya."  Sim- 
ilar restrictions  were  enforced  even  more  stringently  in  the  other 
administrative  areas. 

Generalizing  about  Indonesia  during  the  1942^5  occupation 
period  is  extraordinarily  difficult,  not  only  because  of  varying  poli- 
cies and  conditions  in  the  separate  administrative  divisions,  but  also 
because  circumstances  changed  rapidly  over  time,  particularly  as  the 
war  turned  against  Japan,  and  because  Indonesians'  experience  var- 
ied widely  according  to,  among  other  things,  their  social  status  and 
economic  position. 

The  occupation  is  remembered  as  a  harsh  time.  Japanese  military 
rule  was  severe,  and  fear  of  arrest  by  the  Kenpeitai  (military  police) 
and  of  the  torture  and  execution  of  those  who  defied  or  were  sus- 
pected of  defying  the  Japanese  was  widespread.  Particularly  after 
mid- 1943,  economic  conditions  worsened  markedly  as  a  result  of  the 
wartime  disruption  of  transportation  and  commerce,  as  well  as  mis- 
guided economic  policies.  Most  urban  populations  were  protected 
from  extremes  by  government  rationing  of  necessities,  but  severe 
food  shortages  and  malnutrition  developed  in  some  areas,  and  cloth 
and  clothing  became  so  scarce  by  1 944  that  villagers  in  some  regions 
were  reduced  to  wearing  crude  coverings  made  of  old  sacking  or 
sheets  of  latex.  The  unrelenting  mobilization  of  laborers — generally 
lumped  under  the  infamous  Japanese  term  romusha  (literally,  man- 
ual workers  but  in  Indonesia  always  taken  to  mean  forced  labor) — 
came  to  represent  in  both  official  and  public  Indonesian  memory  the 
cruelty  and  repression  of  Japanese  rule.  Exact  numbers  are  impossi- 
ble to  determine,  but  the  Japanese  drafted  several  million  Javanese 
for  varying  lengths  of  time,  mostly  for  local  projects.  As  many  as 
300,000  may  have  been  sent  outside  of  Java,  nearly  half  of  them  to

Sumatra  and  others  as  far  away  as  Thailand.  It  is  not  known  how 
many  actually  returned  at  the  end  of  the  war,  although  about  70,000 
are  recorded  as  being  repatriated  from  places  other  than  Sumatra  by 
Dutch  services;  nor  is  it  clear  how  many  romusha  died,  were  injured, 
or  fell  ill.  But  the  casualties  were  undoubtedly  very  high,  for  in  most 
cases  the  conditions  were  extremely  grim. 

The  new  priyayi  and  the  urban  middle  classes,  however,  were 
often  shielded  from  these  extremes  and  often  took  a  more  equivocal 
attitude  toward  Japanese  rule.  They  filled  many  of  the  positions  left 
vacant  by  Dutch  civil  servants  interned  by  the  Japanese,  and  also  vied 
for  pangreh  praja  positions  dominated  by  members  of  the  traditional 
elite  or  those  who  had  attended  government  schools.  They  also 
applauded  the  Japanese  policies  that  ended  dualism  in  education  and 
the  courts,  and  were  receptive  to  Japanese  pan-Asian  East-versus- 
West  sensibilities  ("Asia  for  the  Asians"  as  opposed  to  white  suprem- 
acy, and  "Asian  values"  as  opposed  to  "Western  materialism").  The 
priyayi  and  the  middle  classes  also  recognized  the  enormous  advan- 
tages nationalist  leaders  had,  however  much  the  Japanese  sought  to 
control  them,  when  they  appeared  before  huge  crowds  and  were  fea- 
tured in  the  newspapers  or  on  the  radio.  Few  expected  much  from  the 
obviously  propagandistic  Japanese  efforts  to  mobilize  public  support 
through  a  series  of  mass  organizations,  such  as  the  Center  of  the  Peo- 
ple's Power  (Putera)  and  the  Jawa  Hokokai  (Java  Service  Associa- 
tion), or  from  the  "political  participation"  promised  through  advisory 
groups  formed  at  several  administrative  levels,  including  the  Chuo 
Sangi-In  (Central  Advisory  Council)  for  Java.  Observers  began  to 
notice,  however,  that  Sukarno  and  Hatta,  both  of  whom  had  been 
released  from  Dutch  internment  by  the  Japanese  in  1942,  managed  to 
slip  nationalist  language  into  their  speeches,  and  the  formation  of  the 
volunteer  army  known  as  Defenders  of  the  Fatherland  (Peta)  in  late 
1943  was  seen  as  an  enormous  step  in  furthering  nationalist  goals, 
one  that  of  course  could  never  have  taken  place  under  the  Dutch. 

Both  Sukarno  and  Hatta  agreed  to  cooperate  with  the  Japanese  in 
the  belief  that  Tokyo  was  serious  about  leading  Indonesia  toward 
independence;  they  were,  in  any  case,  convinced  that  outright  refusal 
was  too  dangerous.  (Syahrir  declined  to  play  a  public  role.)  Their 
cooperation  was  a  dangerous  game,  which  later  earned  both  leaders 
criticism,  especially  from  the  Dutch  and  the  Indonesian  political  left, 
for  having  been  "collaborators."  Sukarno's  role  in  recruiting 
romusha  became  a  particularly  sore  issue,  although  he  later  stub- 
bornly defended  his  actions  as  necessary  to  the  national  struggle. 
Some  Muhammadiyah  and  Nahdlatul  Ulama  leaders  followed 
Sukarno's  cooperative  lead,  seeing  no  reason  why,  if  the  Japanese 
were  trying  to  use  them  to  mobilize  Muslim  support,  they  should  not 


51

use  the  Japanese  to  advance  Muslims'  agenda.  They  saw  some 
advantage  in  the  formation  of  the  Consultative  Council  of  Indone- 
sian Muslims  (Masyumi),  which  brought  modernist  and  traditionalist 
Muslim  leaders  together,  and  of  its  military  wing,  the  Barisan  His- 
bullah  (Army  of  God),  intended  as  a  kind  of  Muslim  version  of  Peta. 
But  on  the  whole,  Muslim  enthusiasm  for  cooperation  with  the  Japa- 
nese did  not  match  Sukarno's. 

Another  group  that  was  initially  enthusiastic  about  the  Japanese 
victory  was  made  up  of  somewhat  younger  (mostly  under  30),  less 
established,  but  educated,  urban,  and  mostly  male,  individuals. 
Many  had  been  jailed  or  under  surveillance  in  the  late  Dutch  period 
for  their  political  activism.  They  were  courted  by  the  Japanese  and 
filled  positions  in  news  agencies,  publishing,  and  the  production  of 
propaganda.  Referred  to  loosely  as  pemuda  (young  men),  they  rap- 
idly developed  nationalist  sentiments,  eventually  turning  bitterly 
against  Japanese  tutelage  and  coming  to  play  an  important  role  in 
events  after  the  occupation. 

In  April  1944,  U.S.  forces  occupied  the  town  of  Hollandia  (now 
called  Jayapura)  in  Papua,  and  in  mid-September  Australian  troops 
landed  on  Morotai,  Halmahera  (Maluku);  toward  the  end  of  the 
month,  Allied  planes  bombed  Jakarta  (as  Batavia  had  been  renamed) 
for  the  first  time.  Mindful  of  this  new,  critical  stage  of  the  conflict, 
Japan's  new  prime  minister,  Koiso  Kuniaki,  announced  on  September 
7,  1944,  that  the  Indies  (which  he  did  not  define)  would  be  prepared 
for  independence  "in  the  near  future,"  a  statement  that  appeared  at 
last  to  vindicate  Sukarno's  cooperative  policies.  Occupation  authori- 
ties were  instructed  to  further  encourage  nationalist  sentiments  in 
order  to  calm  public  restlessness  and  to  retain  the  loyalty  of  cooperat- 
ing nationalist  leaders  and  their  followers.  Their  response  was  com- 
paratively slow,  but  spurred  perhaps  by  evidence  of  growing  anti- 
Japanese  sentiment — in  mid-February  1945,  for  example,  a  Peta  unit 
in  Blitar  (eastern  Java)  revolted — the  authorities  on  Java  announced 
on  March  1,  1945,  their  intention  to  form  the  Commission  to  Investi- 
gate Preparatory  Measures  for  Independence  (BPUPK);  the  term 
"Indonesia"  was  initially  not  used.  Its  membership — 54  Indonesians, 
four  Chinese,  one  Arab,  and  one  Eurasian,  plus  eight  Japanese  "spe- 
cial members" — was  announced  on  April  29.  Meetings  began  on 
May  28. 

The  BPUPK  took  up  questions  such  as  the  philosophy,  territory, 
and  structure  of  the  state.  Sukarno's  speech  on  June  1  laid  out  what 
he  called  the  Pancasila  (see  Glossary)  or  Five  Principles,  which  were 
acclaimed  as  the  philosophical  basis  of  an  independent  Indonesia.  In 
the  original  formulation,  true  to  Sukarno's  prewar  thinking,  national 
unity  came  first,  and  while  religion  ("belief  in  a  One  and  Supreme 


52 


Historical  Setting 


God")  was  recognized  in  the  fifth  principle,  one  religion  was  point- 
edly not  favored  over  another,  and  the  state  would  be  neither  secular 
nor  theocratic  in  nature.  Thirty-nine  of  60  voting  members  of  the 
BPUPK  voted  to  define  the  new  state  as  comprising  the  former 
Netherlands  East  Indies  as  well  as  Portuguese  Timor,  New  Guinea, 
and  British  territories  on  Borneo  and  the  Malay  Peninsula.  Spirited 
debate  on  the  structure  of  the  state  led  finally  to  the  acceptance  of  a 
unitary  republic.  An  informal  subcommittee,  in  a  decision  subse- 
quently dubbed  the  Piagam  Jakarta  (Jakarta  Charter),  suggested  that 
Muslim  concerns  about  the  role  of  Islam  in  the  new  state  be 
addressed  by  placing  Sukarno's  last  principle  first,  requiring  that  the 
head  of  state  be  a  Muslim,  and  adding  a  phrase  requiring  all  Muslim 
citizens  to  follow  the  sharia.  This  declaration  was  to  be  the  source  of 
continuing  misunderstanding. 

The  United  States  dropped  atomic  bombs  on  Hiroshima  and  Naga- 
saki, respectively,  on  August  6  and  8,  1945,  and  the  Japanese  rushed 
to  prepare  Indonesian  independence.  Vetoing  the  "Greater  Indonesia" 
idea,  military  authorities  required  that  the  new  state  be  limited  to  the 
former  Netherlands  East  Indies  and  called  for  the  establishment  of  an 
Indonesian  Independence  Preparatory  Committee  (PPKI)  with 
Sukarno  as  chairman.  This  group  was  established  on  August  12, 
1945,  but  Japan  surrendered  three  days  later,  before  it  had  an  opportu- 
nity to  meet.  The  established  Indonesian  leadership,  led  by  Sukarno 
and  Hatta,  greeted  the  surrender  with  initial  disbelief  and  caution,  but 
some  pemuda,  many  of  them  followers  of  Sutan  Syahrir,  took  a  more 
radical  stance,  kidnapping  Sukarno  and  Hatta  on  the  night  of  August 
15-16  in  an  effort  to  force  them  to  declare  independence  immediately 
and  without  Japanese  permission.  Their  efforts  may  actually  have 
delayed  matters  slightly,  as  Hatta  later  accused,  but  in  any  case,  in  a 
simple  ceremony  held  before  a  small  group  in  the  front  yard  of  his 
home  at  10:00  AM  on  August  17,  1945,  Sukarno,  after  a  brief  speech, 
delivered  a  two-sentence  statement  officially  proclaiming  indepen- 
dence and  noting  that  "details  concerning  the  transfer  of  authority, 
etc.,  would  be  worked  out  as  quickly  and  thoroughly  as  possible." 

The  next  day,  the  PPKI  met  for  the  first  time  to  adopt  a  constitu- 
tion. Some  key  stipulations  of  the  Jakarta  Charter  were  cancelled, 
with  the  suggestion  that  such  issues  be  revisited  later,  but  the  version 
of  Pancasila  that  now  became  the  official  creed  of  the  Republic  of 
Indonesia  began  with  the  principle  of  "belief  in  [one  supreme]  God," 
followed  by  humanitarianism,  national  unity,  popular  sovereignty 
arrived  at  through  deliberation  and  representative  or  consultative 
democracy,  and  social  justice.  Such  was  the  idealistic  vision  of  a 
national  civic  society  with  which  Indonesia  began  its  independent  life.

The  National  Revolution,  1945-49 

The  struggle  that  followed  the  proclamation  of  independence  on 
August  17,  1945,  and  lasted  until  the  Dutch  recognition  of  Indonesian 
sovereignty  on  December  27,  1949,  is  generally  referred  to  as  Indo- 
nesia's National  Revolution.  It  remains  the  modern  nation's  central 
event,  and  its  world  significance,  although  often  underappreciated,  is 
real.  The  National  Revolution  was  the  first  and  most  immediately 
effective  of  the  violent  postwar  struggles  with  European  colonial 
powers,  bringing  political  independence  and,  under  the  circum- 
stances, a  remarkable  degree  of  unity  to  a  diverse  and  far-flung  nation 
of  then  70  million  people  and  geographically  the  most  fragmented  of 
the  former  colonies  in  Asia  and  Africa.  Furthermore,  the  Revolution 
accomplished  this  in  the  comparatively  short  period  of  slightly  more 
than  four  years  and  at  a  human  cost  estimated  at  about  250,000  lives, 
far  fewer  than  the  several  million  suffered  by  India  or  Vietnam,  for 
example.  Representatives  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  were  the  first 
former  colonial  subjects  to  successfully  use  the  United  Nations  (UN) 
and  world  opinion  as  decisive  tools  in  achieving  independence,  and 
they  carried  on  a  sophisticated  and  often  deft  diplomacy  to  advance 
their  cause.  At  home,  it  can  certainly  be  argued  that  Republican 
forces  fought  a  well-armed,  determined  European  power  to  a  stand- 
still, and  to  the  realization  that  further  colonial  mastery  could  not  be 
achieved.  Finally,  although  this  point  is  much  debated,  it  can  be 
argued  that  the  National  Revolution  generated  irreversible  currents  of 
social  and  economic  change  marking  the  final  disappearance  of  the 
colonial  world  and — for  better  or  worse — serving  as  the  foundation 
for  crucial  national  developments  over  the  next  several  generations. 
These  were  no  mean  achievements. 

The  new  Republic's  prospects  were  at  best  uncertain,  however. 
The  war  had  ended  very  suddenly,  and  the  Dutch — themselves  only 
recently  freed  from  Nazi  rule — were  unable  to  reestablish  colonial 
authority,  a  task  that  in  Sumatra  and  Java  fell  to  British  and  British 
Indian  troops,  the  first  of  which  did  not  arrive  until  September  29, 
1945.  In  the  interval  of  nearly  six  weeks,  the  Republic  of  Indonesia 
was  able  to  disarm  a  great  many  Japanese  troops  and  form  a  govern- 
ment with  Sukarno  as  president  and  Hatta  as  vice  president.  The 
Central  National  Committee  (KNIP)  was  established  as  the  principal 
decision-making  body.  It  had  regional  and  local  subcommittees, 
based  largely  on  the  structure  and  personnel  of  the  Jawa  Hokokai.  A 
comparatively  smooth  transition  to  an  Indonesian-controlled  bureau- 
cracy and  civil  service  took  place  in  most  areas,  especially  of  Java. 
Australian  troops  continued  occupying  the  eastern  archipelago  in 
late  1944  and,  in  1945,  accompanied  by  Dutch  military  and  civilian

personnel  of  the  Netherlands  Indies  Civil  Administration  (NICA), 
which  had  formed  in  Australia  during  the  war. 

At  the  same  time,  however,  tensions  arising  in  part  from  conflict 
with  Japanese  troops,  now  charged  by  Allied  commander  Earl  Louis 
Mountbatten  (1900-79)  with  keeping  the  peace  until  his  own  troops 
could  arrive,  and  in  part  from  the  release  of  Europeans  who  had  been 
imprisoned  by  the  Japanese  and  now  sought  to  resume  their  lives, 
exploded.  Radical  pemuda  initiated,  and  encouraged  others  to  take 
part  in,  violence  against  all  those — not  only  Dutch  and  Eurasians  but 
also  Chinese  and  fellow  Indonesians — who  might  be  suspected  of 
opposing  independence.  Sukarno's  government  was  powerless  to 
stop  this  bloodletting,  which  by  the  end  of  September  was  well 
underway  on  Java.  It  grew  in  intensity  and  spread  to  deadly  attacks 
on  local  elites  as  Allied  troops  moved  to  secure  the  main  cities  of 
Java  and  Sumatra.  This  sort  of  violence  did  not  endear  the  Revolu- 
tion to  the  outside  world  or,  for  that  matter,  to  many  Indonesians,  but 
at  the  same  time  it  was  clear  that  closely  allied  to  it  was  a  fierce 
determination  to  defend  independence.  When  Allied  troops  landed  in 
Surabaya  in  late  October  1945,  their  plans  to  occupy  the  city  were 
thwarted  by  tens  of  thousands  of  armed  Indonesians  and  crowds  of 
city  residents  mobilized  by  pemuda,  resulting  in  the  death  of  the 
British  commander  and  hundreds  of  his  men.  The  ferocious  British 
counterattack  that  began  on  November  10,  enshrined  in  Indonesian

nationalist  history  as  Heroes'  Day,  is  estimated  to  have  killed  6,000 
Indonesians  and  others,  a  terrible  defeat  that  nevertheless  convinced 
the  British  that  they  must  plan  for  eventual  withdrawal.  A  year  later, 
the  British  turned  military  affairs  over  to  the  Dutch,  who  were  deter- 
mined to  restore  their  rule  throughout  the  archipelago. 

In  general,  the  Dutch  view  in  late  1945  had  been  that  the  Republic 
of  Indonesia  was  a  sham,  controlled  largely  by  those  who  had  collab- 
orated with  the  Japanese,  with  no  legitimacy  whatsoever.  A  year  later, 
this  outlook  had  been  modified  somewhat,  but  only  to  concede  that 
nationalist  sentiment  was  more  widespread  than  they  had  at  first 
allowed;  the  complaint  grew  that,  whatever  its  nature,  the  Republic 
could  not  control  its  violent  supporters  (especially  pemuda  and  com- 
munists), making  it  unfit  to  rule.  Attempts  to  broker  a  peaceful  settle- 
ment of  this  postcolonial  conflict  were  unsuccessful.  The  first,  the 
Linggajati  Agreement  of  November  12,  1946,  acknowledged  Repub- 
lican control  on  Sumatra,  Java,  and  Madura,  as  well  as  a  federation  of 
states  under  the  Dutch  crown  in  the  eastern  archipelago.  The  agree- 
ment also  called  for  the  formation,  by  January  1,  1949,  of  a  federated 
state  comprising  the  entire  former  Netherlands  Indies,  a  Netherlands- 
Indonesian  Union,  or  the  so-called  United  States  of  Indonesia,  which 
was  also  to  be  part  of  a  larger  commonwealth  (including  Suriname 
and  the  Dutch  Antilles)  under  the  Dutch  crown.  The  Linggajati 
Agreement  was  not  popular  on  either  side  and  was  not  ratified  until 
months  later.  Among  many  Indonesian  nationalists  of  various  politi- 
cal stripes,  the  agreement  was  seen  as  a  capitulation  by  the  Republi- 
can government.  Pemuda  of  both  left  and  right  championed  the  idea 
of  "100  percent  Independence"  (Seratus  Persen  Merdeka),  and  the 
communist-nationalist  Tan  Malaka  coupled  this  with  accusations  that 
both  Sukarno  and  Hatta  had  betrayed  the  nation  once  with  their  col- 
laboration with  the  Japanese,  and  were  doing  so  once  again  by  com- 
promising with  the  Dutch.  Tan  Malaka  formed  a  united  front  known 
as  the  Struggle  Coalition  (Persatuan  Perjuangan),  which  used  the  idea 
of  total  opposition  to  the  Dutch  to  gather  support  for  his  own  political 
agenda. 

Less  than  two  months  after  the  KNIP  had,  following  bitter  debate 
and  maneuvering,  approved  the  agreement,  Dutch  forces  launched 
what  they  euphemistically  called  a  "police  action"  against  the 
Republic,  claiming  it  had  violated  or  allowed  violations  of  the  Ling- 
gajati Agreement.  They  secured  most  of  the  large  cities  and  valuable 
plantation  areas  of  Sumatra  and  Java  and  arbitrarily  established 
boundaries  between  their  territories  and  the  Republic,  known  as  the 
Van  Mook  Line,  after  Lieutenant  Governor  General  H.  J.  van  Mook. 
The  Republican  military,  the  Indonesian  National  Army  (TNI),  and 


56 


Historical  Setting 


its  affiliated  militia  (laskar)  were  humiliated,  and  yet  greater  criti- 
cism of  the  government  arose,  now  even  from  within  the  military 
itself  and  from  Muslim  leaders. 

The  Republic  had  from  the  start  of  the  Revolution  pursued  a  vig- 
orous if  informal  diplomacy  to  win  other  powers  to  its  side,  efforts 
that  now  bore  fruit.  The  UN  listened  sympathetically  to  Prime  Min- 
ister Syahrir's  account  of  the  situation  in  mid- August  1947,  and  a 
month  later  announced  the  establishment  of  a  Committee  of  Good 
Offices,  with  members  from  Australia,  Belgium,  and  the  United 
States,  to  assist  in  reaching  a  settlement.  The  result  was  the  Renville 
Agreement,  named  for  the  U.S.  Navy  ship — considered  neutral  terri- 
tory— on  which  it  was  negotiated  and  signed  between  January  17 
and  19,  1948.  But  this  accord  proved  even  less  popular  in  the  Repub- 
lic than  its  predecessor,  as  it  appeared  to  accept  both  the  Van  Mook 
Line,  which  in  fact  left  numbers  of  TNI  troops  inside  Dutch-claimed 
territories,  requiring  their  withdrawal,  and  the  Dutch  notion  of  a  fed- 
eration rather  than  a  unitary  state  pending  eventual  plebiscites. 
Republican  leaders  reluctantly  signed  it  because  they  believed  it  was 
essential  to  retaining  international  goodwill,  especially  that  of  the 
United  States.  In  the  long  run,  they  may  have  been  correct,  but  the 
short-term  costs  were  enormous. 

Internally  the  Republic  was  threatening  to  disintegrate.  Public 
confidence  in  the  Republic  began  to  erode  because  of  the  worsening 
economic  situation,  caused  in  part  by  the  Dutch  blockade  of  sea  trade 
and  seizure  of  principal  revenue-producing  plantation  regions,  as 
well  as  by  a  confused  monetary  situation  in  which  Dutch,  Republi- 
can, and  sometimes  locally  issued  currencies  competed.  Conflict 
became  more  frequent  between  the  TNI  and  laskar  and  among 
laskar,  as  they  competed  for  territory  and  resources  or  argued  over 
tactics  and  political  affiliation.  The  KNIP  initiated  a  reorganization 
and  rationalization  program  in  December  1947,  seeking  to  reduce 
regular  and  irregular  armed  forces  drastically  in  order  the  better  to 
supply,  train,  and  control  them.  To  patriots  as  well  as  those  with  other 
motives,  this  move  seemed  no  better  than  treason,  and  the  result  was 
chaos.  In  addition,  tensions  mounted  rapidly  and  at  all  levels  between 
Muslims  and  both  the  government  and  leftist  forces.  Local  clashes 
were  reported  in  eastern  and  western  Java  after  early  1948,  but  the 
most  immediate  challenge  to  the  Republic  was  the  movement  led  by 
S.  M.  Kartosuwiryo  (1905-62),  a  foster  son  of  H.  U.  S.  Cokroamin- 
oto,  who  had  supported  the  1928  Youth  Pledge  and  pemuda  national- 
ists in  1945  but  later  felt  betrayed  by  the  Renville  Agreement  and 
took  up  arms  against  the  Republic,  with  himself  at  the  head  of  an

western  Java  in  May  1948,  Kartosuwiryo  declared  a  separately 
administrated  area,  Darul  Islam  (Abode  of  Islam),  which  in  1949  he 
called  the  Islamic  State  of  Indonesia  (Nil).  He  was  captured  and  exe- 
cuted in  1962  by  units  of  the  armed  forces. 

Most  serious  of  all,  however,  was  the  upheaval  precipitated  in 
September  1948  by  the  return  from  the  Soviet  Union  of  the  prewar 
communist  leader  Muso  (1897-1948),  and  his  efforts  to  propel  the 
PKI  to  a  position  of  leadership  in  the  Revolution.  He  berated  the 
Sukarno-Hatta  leadership  for  compromising  with  the  Dutch  and 
called  for,  among  other  things,  an  agrarian  revolution.  Driven  by 
these  new  tensions,  and  animosities  generated  by  the  reorganization 
of  the  TNI,  fighting  broke  out  in  Surakarta,  central  Java,  between 
forces  sympathetic  to  the  PKI  and  the  Republic.  On  September  18, 
PKI-affiliated  laskar  took  over  the  eastern  Java  city  of  Madiun, 
where  they  murdered  civil  and  military  figures,  announced  a 
National  Front  government,  and  asked  for  popular  support.  The 
Republic  responded  immediately  with  a  dramatic  radio  speech  by 
Sukarno  calling  on  the  masses  to  choose  between  him — and  the 
nation — or  Muso.  The  TNI,  especially  western  Java's  Siliwangi 
Division  under  Abdul  Haris  Nasution  (1918-2001),  mounted  a  bru- 
tally successful  campaign  against  the  rebel  forces.  Muso  and  other 
PKI  leaders  were  killed,  and  all  told  approximately  30,000  people 
lost  their  lives  on  both  sides  in  the  conflict. 

The  Madiun  Affair  remains  controversial  today,  but  its  outcome 
strengthened  the  Republican  government's  efforts  to  control  those 
who  opposed  it  and  changed  the  way  in  which  Sukarno  and  the 
Republic  were  seen  overseas,  especially  in  the  United  States,  where  in 
the  Cold  War  paradigm  Indonesia  now  appeared  as  an  anticommunist 
power.  In  the  months  after  Madiun,  the  Dutch  grew  increasingly  frus- 
trated. Their  negative  portrayal  of  the  Republic  had  lost  international 
credibility,  and  on  the  ground  their  military  position  was  deteriorat- 
ing. Intelligence  indicated  as  many  as  12,000  Indonesian  troops  oper- 
ating inside  the  Van  Mook  Line.  On  December  19,  1948,  Dutch  forces 
launched  an  attack — styled  a  second  "police  action" — designed  to 
destroy  the  Republic,  occupying  its  capital  of  Yogyakarta  and  captur- 
ing and  imprisoning  Sukarno,  Hatta,  five  other  cabinet  members,  and 
Syahrir  (then  an  adviser).  In  response  to  this  outright  defiance,  the 
UN  Security  Council  demanded  the  reinstatement  of  the  Republican 
government,  and  a  full  transfer  of  sovereignty  to  Indonesia  no  later 
than  July  I,  1950.  International  pressure,  which  included  a  U.S.  threat 
to  withdraw  Marshall  Plan  aid  from  the  Netherlands,  was  too  great  for 
The  Hague  to  withstand.  At  the  same  time,  the  Republic  had  initiated 
a  guerrilla  war  (gerilya)  against  Dutch  forces  immediately  after  the

fall  of  Yogyakarta.  The  significance  of  this  gerilya  has  been  generally 
underestimated,  largely  because  it  involved  TNI  struggles  against 
armed  internal  opposition  (for  example,  by  the  Nil  in  western  Java 
and  by  those  loyal  to  Tan  Malaka,  who  was  captured  and  killed  in 
eastern  Java  in  February  1949)  as  well  as  Dutch  forces.  But  Indone- 
sian resistance  was  sufficiently  effective  to  convince  Dutch  com- 
manders that  this  was  a  war  that  could  not  be  won  on  the  ground. 

After  two  efforts  at  cease-fires  between  May  and  August  1949, 
the  Round  Table  Conference  met  in  The  Hague  from  August  23  to 
November  2  to  reach  the  final  terms  of  a  settlement.  The  Round 
Table  Agreement  provided  that  the  Republic  and  1 5  federated  terri- 
tories established  by  the  Dutch  would  be  merged  into  a  Federal 
Republic  of  Indonesia  (RIS).  The  Dutch  recognized  the  sovereignty 
of  Indonesia  on  December  27,  1949.  Because  of  widespread  fear  by 
nationalists  in  the  Republic  and  in  some  of  the  federated  territories 
that  the  structural  arrangements  of  the  RIS  would  favor  pro-Dutch 
control,  and  because  the  TNI  also  found  it  unthinkable  that  they 
should  be  required  to  merge  with  the  very  army  and  police  forces 
they  had  been  fighting  against,  there  was  considerable  sentiment  in 
favor  of  scrapping  the  federal  arrangement.  This,  and  often  heavy- 
handed  pressure  from  within  the  Republican  civilian  bureaucracy

and  army,  produced  within  five  months  a  dissolution  of  the  RIS  into 
a  new,  unitary  Republic  of  Indonesia,  which  was  officially  declared 
on  the  symbolic  date  of  August  17,  1950.  Only  the  breakaway 
Republic  of  South  Maluku  (RMS)  resisted  this  incorporation.  TNI 
forces  opposed  and  largely  defeated  the  RMS  in  the  second  half  of 
1950,  but  about  12,000  of  its  supporters  were  relocated  to  the  Neth- 
erlands, and  there  and  in  Maluku  itself  separatist  voices  were  heard 
for  the  next  half-century. 

The  Road  to  Guided  Democracy,  1950-65 

Recovery 

Developments  during  the  first  15  years  of  Indonesia's  indepen- 
dent history  have  been  comparatively  little  studied  in  recent  years 
and  tend  to  be  explained  in  rather  simple,  dichotomous  terms  of,  for 
example,  a  struggle  between  "liberal  democracy"  and  "primordial 
authoritarianism,"  between  pragmatic  "problem  solvers"  and  idealis- 
tic "solidarity  builders,"  or  between  political  left  and  right.  These 
analyses  are  not  entirely  wrong,  for  Indonesia  was  indeed  polarized 
during  these  years,  but  they  tend  to  oversimplify  the  poles,  and  to 
ignore  other  parts  of  the  story,  such  as  the  remarkable  flourishing  of 
literature  and  painting  that  drew  on  the  sense  of  personal  and  cultural 
liberation  produced  by  the  National  Revolution.  The  new  govern- 
ment also  had  extraordinary  success,  despite  a  lack  of  funds  and 
expertise,  in  the  field  of  education:  in  1930  adult  literacy  stood  at 
less  than  7.5  percent,  whereas  in  1961  about  47  percent  of  those  over 
the  age  of  10  were  literate.  It  was  a  considerable  achievement,  too, 
that  Indonesia  in  1955  held  honest,  well-organized,  and  largely 
peaceful  elections  for  an  eligible  voting  public  of  nearly  38  million 
people  scattered  throughout  the  archipelago,  more  than  91  percent  of 
whom  cast  a  ballot.  Still,  it  is  fair  to  characterize  the  period  as  one  of 
heavy  disillusion  as  well,  in  which  the  enormously  high  expectations 
that  leaders  and  the  public  had  for  independence  could  not  be  met, 
and  in  which  the  search  for  solutions  was  both  intense  and  frag- 
mented. While  it  may  be  true,  as  historian  Anthony  Reid  has  sug- 
gested, that  the  Revolution  succeeded  in  "the  creation  of  a  united 
nation,"  in  1950  that  nation  was  still  no  more  than  a  vision,  and  it 
remained  to  be  seen  whether  the  same  ideas  that  had  brought  it  to  life 
could  also  be  used  to  give  it  substance. 

Perhaps  the  greatest  expectation  of  independence,  shared  by  mid- 
dle and  lower  classes,  rural  as  well  as  urban  dwellers,  was  that  it 
would  bring  dramatic  economic  improvement.  This  hope  had  been 
embedded  in  the  nationalist  message  since  at  least  the  1 920s,  which 


60 


Historical  Setting 


had  played  heavily  on  the  exploitative  nature  of  the  colonial  econ- 
omy and  implied  that  removal  of  colonial  rule  would  also  remove 
obstacles  to  economic  improvement  and  modernization.  But  the  con- 
ditions Indonesia  inherited  from  the  eras  of  occupation  and  Revolu- 
tion were  grim,  far  grimmer  than  those  of  neighboring  Burma  or  the 
Philippines,  for  example,  despite  the  fact  that  unlike  them  it  had  not 
been  a  wartime  battlefield.  The  Japanese  had  left  the  economy  weak 
and  in  disarray,  but  the  Revolution  had  laid  waste,  through  fighting 
and  scorched-earth  tactics,  much  of  what  remained.  In  1950  both 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  and  rice  production 
were  well  below  1939  levels,  and  estimated  foreign  reserves  were 
equivalent  to  about  one  month's  imports  (and  only  about  three  times 
what  they  had  been  in  1945).  In  addition,  provisions  in  the  Round 
Table  Agreement  had  burdened  Indonesia  with  a  debt  to  the  Nether- 
lands of  US$1,125  billion  dollars  and  saddled  it  with  the  costs  of 
integrating  thousands  of  colonial  administrative  and  military  person- 
nel. (No  other  ex-colony  in  the  postwar  era  was  faced  with  such  a 
debt,  80  percent  of  which  Indonesia  had  paid  when  it  abrogated  the 
agreement  in  1956.) 

Economic  Pressures 

In  the  early  1950s,  Indonesia's  economy  experienced  a  boomlet, 
principally  as  a  result  of  Korean  War  (1950-53)  trade,  especially  in 
oil  and  rubber;  taxes  on  this  trade  supplied  nearly  70  percent  of  the 
government's  revenues.  Between  1950  and  1955,  the  gross  national 
product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  is  thought  to  have  grown  at  an  annual 
rate  of  about  5.5  percent,  and  it  increased  23  percent  between 
1953 — when  real  GDP  again  reached  the  1938  level — and  1957.  In 
retrospect,  economists  seem  agreed  that,  against  heavy  odds,  the 
immediate  postcolonial  economy  was  not  hopeless.  Nevertheless, 
what  most  Indonesians  saw  and  felt  did  not  seem  like  economic 
progress  at  all:  wages  rose,  but  prices  rose  faster,  and  the  growing 
ranks  of  urban  workers  and  government  employees  were  especially 
vulnerable  to  the  resulting  squeeze.  The  government  also  was 
squeezed  between  falling  trade-tax  revenues  and  rising  expenses, 
especially  those  required  to  support  a  bureaucracy  that  nearly  dou- 
bled in  size  between  1950  and  1960.  Infrastructure,  badly  needing 
rehabilitation,  was  neglected,  adversely  affecting  production  and 
trade.  Corruption  and  crime  spread.  In  1956  rice  made  up  13  percent 
of  Indonesia's  imports,  compared  to  self-sufficiency  in  1938;  by 
1960  only  10  percent  of  the  national  income  derived  from  manufac- 
turing, compared  to  12  percent  in  1938.  In  economists'  terms  this 
was  "structural  regression,"  but  in  everyday  experience  it  meant  that 


61 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

the  economy  was  not  modernizing,  and  it  was  increasingly  unable  to 
provide  for  a  population  estimated  to  have  grown  from  77  million  in 
1950  to  97  million  a  decade  later. 

In  order  to  solve  these  problems,  the  government  at  first 
embarked  on  plans — many  of  which  had  been  initiated  by  the  Dutch 
in  the  late  1930s  and  again  in  territories  they  held  in  the  immediate 
postwar  years — for  large-  and  small-scale  industrialization,  import- 
substitution  manufacturing,  and  private  and  foreign  capitalization.  It 
was  not  long,  however,  before  policies  more  familiar  to  the  prewar 
generation  of  nationalists,  now  firmly  in  power,  took  precedence. 
These  were  already  visible  in  the  Benteng  (Fortress)  Program 
(1950-57),  one  aspect  of  which  was  discrimination  against  ethnic 
Chinese  and  Dutch  entrepreneurs  in  order  to  foster  an  indigenous 
class  of  businessmen. 

The  Benteng  Program  failed,  leading  instead  to  more  corruption, 
but  the  call  for  "Indonesianization"  of  the  economy  was  very  strong. 
Policies  increasingly  favored  a  high  degree  of  centralization,  govern- 
ment development  of  state  enterprises,  discouragement  of  foreign 
investment,  and,  at  least  for  a  time,  the  encouragement  of  village 
cooperatives,  all  of  which  harkened  back  to  provisions  of  the  1 945 
constitution  and  had  been  pursued  in  a  limited  fashion  during  the 
National  Revolution.  Gradual  nationalization  of  some  Dutch  enter- 
prises, the  central  bank,  the  rail  and  postal  services,  and  air  and  sea 
transport  firms  began  in  the  early  1950s,  but  the  pace  quickened  after 
1955  because  of  the  continuing  dispute  over  West  New  Guinea,  con- 
trol of  which  had  not  been  settled  in  1949.  In  1957  and  1958,  nearly 
1 ,000  Dutch  companies  were  nationalized  and  seized  by  the  armed 
forces  or,  less  frequently,  by  labor  groups;  in  a  corresponding  exo- 
dus, nearly  90  percent  of  remaining  Dutch  citizens  voluntarily  repa- 
triated. A  year  later,  a  decree  banning  "foreign  nationals"  resulted  in 
100,000  Chinese  repatriating  to  mainland  China.  A  victory  from  a 
nationalist  perspective,  this  was  from  an  economic  standpoint — not 
least  of  all  because  Indonesia  lacked  capital  and  credit,  as  well  as 
modern  management  and  entrepreneurial  skills — a  setback  from 
which  recovery  would  be  difficult. 

Political  Developments  and  Divisiveness 

Independence  had  also  brought  with  it  expectations  of  a  modern 
political  framework  for  the  nation.  The  Republic's  founders  had 
rejected  colonialism,  of  course,  and  monarchy,  settling  on  a  vaguely 
defined  democracy  that  leaned  heavily  on  presidential  authority.  The 
constitution  of  the  RIS  and  a  third  (provisional)  constitution  adopted 
in  1950  by  the  unitary  state  called  for  a  prime  ministerial,  multiparty, 


62 


Historical  Setting 


parliamentary  democracy  and  free  elections.  When  voters  went  to 
the  polls  in  September  1955,  there  was  considerable  hope  that  such  a 
system  would  provide  solutions  to  the  political  divisiveness  that, 
freed  from  the  limitations  of  the  common  anticolonial  struggle,  had 
begun  to  spread  well  beyond  the  mostly  urbanized  educated  elite. 

In  the  event,  however,  the  national  elections  proved  disappointing. 
The  four  major  winners  among  the  28  parties  obtaining  parliamen- 
tary seats  were  the  secular  nationalist  PNI  (22  percent,  with  86  per- 
cent of  that  from  Java),  the  modernist  Muslim  Masyumi  (21  percent, 
with  5 1  percent  from  Java),  the  traditional  Muslim  Nahdlatul  Ulama 
(18  percent,  with  86  percent  from  Java),  and  the  PKI  (16  percent, 
with  89  percent  from  Java).  After  the  PKI,  the  next  most  successful 
party,  the  Indonesian  Islamic  Union  Party  (PSII),  received  less  than  3 
percent  of  the  vote,  and  18  of  28  parties  received  less  than  1  percent 
of  the  vote.  Both  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  the  PKI,  which  had  especially 
strong  fallowings  in  central  and  eastern  Java,  dramatically  increased 
their  representation  compared  with  what  they  had  held  in  the  provi- 
sional parliament  (8  to  45  seats,  and  17  to  39  seats,  respectively).  In 
eastern  Java,  the  vote  was  split  almost  evenly  among  the  PNI,  PKI, 
and  Nahdlatul  Ulama.  The  elections  thus  exposed  and  sharpened 
existing  divides  between  Java  and  the  other  islands,  raising  fears  of 
domination  by  Jakarta,  and  between  the  rapidly  rising  PKI  and,  par- 
ticularly, Muslim  parties,  raising  fears  of  communist  (interpreted  as 
antireligious)  and  populist  ascendancy. 

To  make  matters  worse,  there  was  a  general  perception  that  in  the 
30-month  run-up  to  the  elections,  the  political  process  had  polarized 
villages  as  parties  sought  votes.  There  were  many  reports  of  villagers 
being  pressured  and  even  threatened  to  vote  for  one  or  another  party, 
and  of  clashes  between  Muslim  and  communist  adherents.  More- 
educated  voters  tended  to  take  hardened  ideological  positions.  On 
the  eve  of  the  elections,  Sukarno  had  declared  that  anyone  who 
"tried  to  put  obstacles  in  the  way  of  holding  them  ...  is  a  traitor  to  the 
Revolution."  Barely  six  months  later,  he  was  urging  the  new  parlia- 
ment to  avoid  "50  percent  +  1  democracy,"  and  in  October  spoke  of 
"burying"  the  political  parties  and  of  his  desire  to  see  Guided 
Democracy  (demokrasi  terpimpin,  a  term  Sukarno  had  been  using 
since  1954)  in  Indonesia. 

Military  Involvement  and  Rebellion 

Into  this  deteriorating  situation,  the  military  increasingly  inserted 
itself.  During  the  Revolution,  the  armed  forces  had  developed  a 
strong  distrust  for — indeed,  taken  up  arms  against — both  communist 
and  Muslim  movements  that  had  opposed  the  central  government. 


63 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  military  had  also  itself  exhibited  a  resistance  to  control  by  the 
central  government  and,  especially  after  the  second  "police  action" 
and  subsequent  gerilya,  a  high  level  of  disapproval  of  civilian  poli- 
tics and  politicians  in  general.  Further,  the  armed  forces  had  never 
been  united,  even  on  these  issues,  which  made  for  extremely  com- 
plex struggles  in  which  military  leaders  often  ended  up  opposing 
each  other.  These  tensions  surfaced,  for  example,  when  a  dispute 
over  demobilization  plans  resulted  in  a  dangerous  confrontation 
between  some  army  commanders  and  parliament  in  Jakarta  on  Octo- 
ber 17,  1952. 

In  1956,  in  reaction  to  Jakarta's  continued  efforts  to  curb  TNI- 
supported  smuggling  of  oil,  rubber,  copra,  and  other  export  products, 
commanders  in  Sumatra  and  Sulawesi  bolted  from  both  government 
and  central  TNI  control,  arguing  that  their  regions  were  producing 
more  than  their  share  of  exports  but  receiving  too  little  in  return  from 
the  central  government.  The  army  was  also  growing  increasingly 
concerned  about  the  PKI's  rise  to  power.  PKI  membership  had  leapt 
from  about  100,000  in  1952  to  a  purported  1  million  at  the  end  of 
1955,  and,  more  successfully  than  any  other  party,  it  had  cultivated 
village  interests  with  community  projects  and  support,  particularly 
on  Java.  At  the  end  of  1956,  a  dissident  TNI  commander,  Zulkifli 
Lubis  (1923-94?),  wrote  that  Sukarno  himself,  recently  returned 
from  a  visit  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  had  chosen  that  coun- 
try as  a  political  model.  On  February  21,  1957,  Sukarno,  supported 
by  army  chief  Nasution,  proposed  instituting  a  system  of  Guided 
Democracy,  which  he  now  conceptualized  as  based  on  a  politics  of 
mutual  cooperation  (gotong  royong)  and  deliberation  with  consensus 
(musyawarah  mufakat)  among  functional  groups  (golongan  karya) 
rather  than  political  parties,  which  he  believed  was  more  in  keeping 
with  the  national  character.  This  seemed  to  many  dissidents  to  signal 
both  the  end  of  any  hope  of  improving  regional  prospects,  and  the 
beginning  of,  at  the  very  least,  a  communist-tinted  authoritarian  rule. 

In  early  March  1957,  the  TNI  commander  of  East  Indonesia 
announced  Universal  Struggle  (Permesta)  and  declared  martial  law  in 
his  region,  claiming  a  goal  of  completing  the  National  Revolution. 
Nasution  then  proposed  that  Sukarno  declare  martial  law  for  all  of 
Indonesia,  which  he  did  on  March  14.  In  the  repression  of  suspected 
dissidents  in  Java,  especially  of  Masyumi  leaders,  who  had  vigorously 
opposed  the  institution  of  Guided  Democracy,  a  number  of  these 
prominent  figures  fled  to  Sumatra.  They  included  the  former  prime 
minister  from  1950-51,  Mohammad  Natsir  (1908-93);  former  central 
bank  president  Syafruddin  Prawiranegara  (191 1-89);  and  former  min- 
ister of  finance  Sumitro  Joyohadikusumo  (1917-2001),  who  joined 
army  dissidents  in  Sumatra,  eventually  declaring,  in  mid-February

Historical  Setting 


1958,  the  Revolutionary  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia 
(PRRI).  They  were  immediately  joined  by  the  Permesta  rebels,  and 
also  attracted  the  clandestine  support  of  the  United  States  (revealed  in 
May  when  an  American  pilot  was  shot  down  during  a  rebel  attack  on 
government  forces).  The  central  government  acted  swiftly,  and  TNI 
forces  broke  the  rebellion  in  no  more  than  two  months,  although  spo- 
radic guerrilla  fighting  continued  until  the  early  1960s. 

It  has  been  pointed  out  many  times  that  the  PRRI  did  not  repre- 
sent a  true  separatist  movement  and  sought  instead  what  today 
would  be  termed  "regime  change."  Be  that  as  it  may,  the  revolt  was  a 
watershed  of  some  importance.  Official  figures  estimate  that  at  least 
30,000  people  lost  their  lives  in  the  fighting,  and  Indonesian  political 
life,  far  from  being  improved  and  stabilized  as  so  fondly  hoped,  was 
instead  gripped  by  regional,  religious,  and  ideological  turmoil  and 
bitterness  made  worse  by  economic  decay. 

Political  Paralysis 

Symbolic  of  the  paralysis  that  gripped  political  life  at  the  time,  the 
Constituent  Assembly  (Konstituante),  which  had  been  elected  in  late 
1955  and  began  meeting  a  year  later,  by  mid- 1959  had  failed  to 
reach  agreement  on  major  issues  that  had  troubled  the  BPUPK  and 
PPKI  a  decade  earlier:  whether  the  form  of  the  state  should  be  feder- 
ative or  unitary  and  whether  the  state  should  be  based  on  Islam  or 
Pancasila.  In  May,  Jakarta  granted  the  northern  Sumatra  province  of 
Aceh  semiautonomous  status  (and  thus  the  freedom  to  establish  gov- 
ernment by  Islamic  law)  as  the  price  of  at  last  ending  the  struggle 
there  with  Darul  Islam  forces.  The  way  seemed  open  for  a  dissolu- 
tion of  the  unitary  state.  Sukarno's  response  on  July  5,  1959,  was 
unilaterally  to  dismiss  the  Constituent  Assembly  and  to  declare  that 
the  nation  would  return  to  the  constitution  of  August  18,  1945,  point- 
edly without  the  Jakarta  Charter  and  its  Islamic  provisions.  Illegal 
although  it  may  have  been,  this  was  not  an  entirely  unwelcome 
move.  Many,  although  by  no  means  all,  Indonesians  believed  that 
their  nation  had  lost  its  way,  and  a  return  to  first  principles  and  senti- 
ments— now  rather  romantically  misimagined — sounded  in  many 
ways  attractive. 

What  followed,  however,  was  the  rapid  development  of  an  authori- 
tarian state  in  which  tensions  were  not  reduced  but  greatly  exacerbated. 
On  August  17,  1959,  Sukarno  attempted  to  give  Guided  Democracy 
some  precise  content  by  announcing  his  Political  Manifesto  (Manipol), 
which  included  the  ideas  of  "returning  to  the  rails  of  the  Revolution" 
and  "retooling"  in  the  name  of  unity  and  progress.  Manipol  was  sup- 
plemented with  the  announcement  of  a  kind  of  second  Pancasila 
describing  the  foundations  of  the  new  state:  the  1945  constitution,

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesian  Socialism,  Guided  Democracy,  Guided  Economy,  and 
Indonesian  Identity,  expressed  in  the  acronym  USDEK.  These  two  for- 
mulations were  followed  in  mid- 1960  with  a  third,  known  by  the  con- 
traction Nasakom,  in  which  Sukarno  returned  to  his  1920s  attempts  to 
work  out  a  synthesis  of  nationalism  (nasionalisme),  religion  (agama), 
and  communism  (komunisme).  These  ideas  formed  the  basis  of  what 
was  increasingly  seen  as  a  state  ideology,  printed  up  in  fat,  red-covered 
books  to  be  used  in  obligatory  indoctrination  sessions  for  civil  servants 
and  students,  and  expressed  in  a  rising  rhetoric  that  excoriated  the 
nation's  internal  and  external  enemies. 

What  was  once  Sukarno's  gift  for  effecting  conciliation  and  work- 
able synthesis  now  turned  sour,  and,  even  to  many  of  its  earlier  sup- 
porters, the  promise  of  Guided  Democracy  seemed  empty.  The 
economy  worsened  and  fell  into  a  spiral  of  uncontrolled  inflation  of 
more  than  100  percent  annually.  The  army,  after  1962  part  of  a  com- 
bined Armed  Forces  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (ABRI),  and  the 
PKI  confronted  each  other  increasingly  aggressively  for  control  of 
state  and  society.  Sukarno,  although  casting  himself  as  the  great 
mediator  and  attempting  to  balance  all  ideological  forces,  appeared 
to  grow  more  radically  inclined,  drawing  closer  to  the  PKI  and  its 
leader,  D.  N.  Aidit  (1923-65),  and  away  from  Nasution's  army. 
Widespread  arrests  of  dissidents,  censorship  of  media,  and  prohibi- 
tion of  "unhealthy"  Western  cultural  influences  (for  example,  danc- 
ing the  Twist  and  listening  to  the  Beatles)  darkened  Indonesia's 
social  and  intellectual  world. 

Worldview 

Indonesian  nationalists  had  the  strong  expectation  that  indepen- 
dence would  also  bring  Indonesia  international  recognition  and  a 
place  in  the  family  of  nations.  Admission  to  the  UN  in  September 
1950  was  a  first  step,  and  Indonesia  quickly  adopted  an  "indepen- 
dent and  active"  foreign  policy,  first  articulated  in  1948  by  then  Vice 
President  Mohammad  Hatta,  who  wished  to  steer  a  course  between 
the  Cold  War  powers  but  to  do  so  in  a  way  that  was  not  merely  "neu- 
tral." The  first  fruit  of  this  outlook  was  the  Asia-Africa  Conference 
held  in  Bandung,  Jawa  Barat  Province,  in  April  1955.  This  gathering 
of  29  new  nations  sought  to  avoid  entanglement  in  the  Cold  War  and 
to  promote  peace  and  cooperation;  to  many  it  represented  the  sudden 
coming  of  age  of  the  formerly  colonized  world.  It  is  generally  con- 
sidered the  beginning  of  the  Nonaligned  Movement  (see  Glossary), 
although  the  movement  itself  was  not  formalized  until  1961. 

Sukarno  was  in  his  element  at  Bandung,  speaking  eloquently 
about  ex-colonial  peoples  "awakening  from  slumber"  and  propos-

ing — true  to  his  homegrown  pattern — an  ideology  of  neither  capital- 
ism nor  communism  but  one  that  merged  the  nationalism,  religion, 
and  humanism  of  Asia  and  Africa.  As  at  home,  however,  this  grand 
attempt  at  balance  and  synthesis  did  not  hold.  The  failure  of  Indone- 
sian nonalignment  policies  during  the  Cold  War  came  about  in  part 
because  of  the  unwillingness  of  the  superpowers,  perhaps  especially 
the  United  States,  to  view  the  decolonized  world  in  anything  but 
friend-or-foe  terms.  Sukarno's  willingness  to  use  Cold  War  rivalries 
for  what  he  viewed  as  Indonesia's  national  interests,  which  was  not 
precisely  in  the  spirit  of  Bandung,  also  led  to  the  abandonment  of 
neutrality. 

In  the  ongoing  dispute  with  the  Dutch  over  West  New  Guinea,  for 
example,  Sukarno  had  tentatively  used  the  support  of  the  Soviet  Union 
and  China,  and  of  the  PKI  at  home,  to  encourage  the  United  States  to 
pressure  the  Dutch  to  abandon  the  territory,  implicitly  in  hopes  of 
forestalling  an  Indonesian  slide  toward  the  communist  bloc.  A  U.S.- 
and  UN-brokered  agreement  turned  over  control  to  Indonesia  in  May 
1963,  which  was  confirmed  in  the  much-disputed  Act  of  Free  Choice 
in  1969.  In  the  issues  that  arose  over  the  formation  of  Malaysia — an

idea  that  had  surfaced  in  1961  as  a  solution  to  British  decolonization 
problems  involving  Malaya,  Singapore,  and  British  Borneo,  but  which 
appeared  in  Jakarta's  eyes  to  be  a  neocolonial  plot  against  the  republic 
and  its  ongoing  revolution — Sukarno  at  first  merely  meddled  and 
then,  when  the  new  state  was  formed  in  1963,  declared  Confrontation 
(see  Glossary),  or  Konfrontasi  as  it  was  called  in  Indonesian,  a  step 
that  led  the  nation  to  the  brink  of  war.  Confrontation  had  support  from 
both  China  and  the  Soviet  Union  (by  then  themselves  estranged)  as 
well  as  the  PKI  but  was  opposed  by  Britain  and  the  United  States,  and, 
surreptitiously,  by  elements*  of  ABRI.  Sukarno  was  now  faced  with 
increasing  isolation  from  the  Western  powers,  and  the  deepening 
unpredictability  of  interlocking  power  struggles  on  both  international 
and  domestic  fronts.  This  was  not  the  "joining  the  world"  for  which 
most  nationalists  had  hoped. 

Years  of  Crisis 

These  tensions  had  escalated  by  late  1964,  to  the  point  that  gov- 
ernment was  paralyzed  and  the  nation  seethed  with  fears  and  rumors 
of  an  impending  explosion.  In  the  countryside,  especially  in  Java  and 
Bali,  the  "unilateral  actions"  the  PKI  began  a  year  earlier  to  force- 
fully redistribute  village  agricultural  lands  had  resulted  in  the  out- 
break of  violence  along  both  religious  and  economic  class  lines. 
Especially  in  Jawa  Timur  Province,  Nahdlatul  Ulama  mobilized  its 
youth  wing,  known  as  Ansor  (Helpers  of  Muhammad),  and  deadly 
fighting  began  to  spread  between  and  within  now  thoroughly  polar- 
ized villages.  ABRI  increasingly  revealed  divisions  among  pro-PKI, 
anti-PKI,  and  pro-Sukarno  officers,  some  of  whom  reportedly  began 
to  involve  themselves  in  rural  conflicts.  In  the  big  cities,  demonstra- 
tions against  the  West  reached  fever  pitch,  spilling  over  into  intellec- 
tual and  cultural  affairs  as  poets  and  artists  confronted  each  other 
with  diametrically  opposed  views  on  the  nature  and  proper  social 
role  of  the  arts.  The  domestic  economic  crisis  deepened  as  the  price 
of  rice  soared  beyond  the  means  of  most  urban  residents,  especially 
those  of  the  middle  classes  on  government  salaries,  and  the  black- 
market  rate  of  exchange  exceeded  the  official  rate  by  2,000  percent. 

Sukarno  was  furious  that  the  newly  formed  Malaysia  had  been 
granted  a  temporary  seat  on  the  United  Nations  Security  Council,  and 
on  January  1,  1965,  he  withdrew  Indonesia  from  the  UN,  and  later 
from  other  world  bodies  such  as  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF)  and  the  World  Bank.  In  April,  China  announced  that  it  sup- 
ported the  idea,  proposed  earlier  by  Aidit,  of  arming  a  "fifth  force"  of 
peasants  and  workers  under  PKI  leadership  to  balance  the  power  of 
AB  Ill's  four  armed  services,  and  that  it  could  supply  100,000  small 


68

arms  for  the  purpose.  Then  on  August  17,  1965,  Sukarno,  who  two 
weeks  earlier  had  collapsed  during  a  public  appearance  and  was 
thought  to  be  gravely  ill,  delivered  an  Independence  Day  speech, 
which  addressed  joining  a  "Jakarta-Phnom  Penh-Beijing-Hanoi- 
Pyongyang  Axis"  and  creating  an  armed  fifth  force  in  order  to  com- 
plete Indonesia's  revolution.  It  seemed  to  many  that  the  PKI  was 
poised  to  seize  power,  at  the  same  time  that  the  whole  constellation 
of  competing  forces  swirling  around  Sukarno  was  about  to  implode, 
with  consequences  that  could  only  be  guessed.  On  September  27,  the 
army  chief  of  staff,  Ahmad  Yani  (1922-65),  who  was  close  to 
Sukarno  and  shared  his  anti-neo-imperialist  outlook,  nevertheless 
informed  him  that  he  and  Nasution  unequivocally  refused  to  accept  a 
"fifth  force,"  a  stand  that  brought  them  in  direct  opposition  to  the 
PKI,  Sukarno,  and  even  some  ABRI  officers.  Air  Force  Vice  Marshal 
Omar  Dhani  (1924-2009),  for  example,  had  begun  to  offer  paramili- 
tary training  to  groups  of  PKI  civilians,  apparently  at  Sukarno's  urg- 
ing. The  balancing  act  was  over. 

The  "Coup"  and  Its  Aftermath,  1965-66 

In  the  early  morning  hours  of  October  1,  1965,  troops  from  four 
ABRI  companies,  including  one  from  the  Cakrabirawa  Presidential 
Guard,  deployed  in  air  force  motor  vehicles  through  the  streets  of 
Jakarta  to  the  homes  of  Nasution,  Yani,  and  five  other  generals 
known  to  be  opposed  to  the  PKI.  Three  were  killed  resisting  capture, 
and  three  were  later  murdered  at  the  nearby  Halim  Perdanakusuma 
Military  Air  Base,  where,  it  was  later  learned,  their  bodies  were 
thrown  into  an  abandoned  well  in  an  area  known  as  Lubang  Buaya 
(Crocodile  Hole).  The  remaining  general,  then-Minister  of  Defense 
Nasution,  narrowly  escaped,  but  his  adjutant  was  captured  instead 
and  also  murdered  at  Lubang  Buaya,  and  Nasution's  daughter  was 
injured  in  the  intrusion  and  later  died.  Not  long  thereafter,  Jakartans 
awoke  to  a  radio  announcement  that  the  September  30  Movement 
(Gerakan  September  Tiga  Puluh,  later  referred  to  by  the  acronym 
Gestapu  by  opponents)  had  acted  to  protect  Sukarno  and  the  nation 
from  corrupt  military  officers,  members  of  a  Council  of  Generals 
that  secretly  planned,  with  U.S.  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (CIA) 
help,  to  take  over  the  government.  The  announcement  stressed  that 
the  action  was  an  internal  ABRI  affair.  At  noon  a  Decree  No.  1  was 
broadcast,  announcing  the  formation  of  a  Revolutionary  Council  as 
the  source  of  all  authority  in  the  Republic  of  Indonesia. 

Faced  with  the  news  of  this  apparent  coup  attempt,  the  com- 
mander of  the  Army  Strategic  Reserve  Command  (Kostrad),  General 
Suharto  (1921-2008),  who  had  not  been  on  the  list  of  those  to  be 


69 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

captured,  moved  swiftly,  and,  less  than  24  hours  after  events  began, 
a  radio  broadcast  announced  that  Suharto  had  taken  temporary  lead- 
ership of  ABRI,  controlled  central  Jakarta,  and  would  crush  what  he 
described  as  a  counterrevolutionary  movement  that  had  kidnapped 
six  generals  of  the  republic.  (Their  bodies  were  not  discovered  until 
October  3.)  When  the  communist  daily  Harian  Rakjat  published  an 
editorial  supportive  of  the  Revolutionary  Council  on  October  2, 
1965,  it  was  already  too  late.  In  Jakarta,  the  coup  attempt  had  been 
broken,  and  anti-PKI,  anti-Sukarno  commanders  of  ABRI  were  in 
charge.  Within  a  few  days,  the  same  was  true  of  the  few  areas  out- 
side of  the  capital  where  Gestapu  had  raised  its  head. 

These  momentous  events,  which  triggered  not  only  a  regime 
change  but  also  the  destruction  of  the  largest  communist  party  out- 
side the  Soviet  Union  and  China,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  deaths, 
and  a  generation  of  military  rule  in  what  was  then  the  world's  fifth 
(now  fourth)  most  populous  country,  have  long  eluded  satisfactory 
explanation  by  scholars.  Debate  over  many  points,  both  in  and  out- 
side of  Indonesia,  continues  to  be  stubborn,  polarized,  and  domi- 
nated by  intricate  and  often  improbable  tales  of  intrigue.  The 
circumstances  and  available  data  are  such  that  a  wide  variety  of 
explanations  are  equally  plausible.  Scholarly  opinion  has  been  espe- 
cially skeptical  of  the  conclusion  drawn  almost  immediately  by 
Suharto  (and  later  the  government  he  headed)  and  the  CIA,  that  the 
PKI  was  to  blame  for  Gestapu.  Experts  have  offered  numerous  sce- 
narios instead,  suggesting  that  the  (anti-PKI)  military,  and  perhaps 
even  Suharto  himself,  were  in  fact  the  real  masterminds. 

More  recently,  however,  a  view  that  has  gained  credence  (origi- 
nally posited  in  an  early  CIA  report  and  raised  by  captured  PKI  lead- 
ers) is  that  Gestapu  was  in  fact  the  result  of  highly  secret  planning — 
secret  even  within  the  PKI  leadership  structure — by  party  head  D.  N. 
Aidit  and  his  close  friend  since  pemuda  days  in  1945,  "Syam" 
Kamaruzaman  (ca.  1924-86),  head  of  the  party's  supersecret  Special 
Bureau.  For  reasons  that  are  not  entirely  clear  but  were  probably 
connected  with  Aidit 's  fears  that  Sukarno  was  near  death  and  that 
without  his  protection  the  party  could  not  survive,  Syam  was  given 
responsibility  for  constructing  a  plot  to  neutralize  army  opposition.  It 
is  generally  acknowledged  that  the  plans  were  ill-conceived  and  so 
poorly  executed  that  investigators  often  found  comparatively  simple 
errors  unbelievable,  taking  them  instead  as  clues  to  hidden  conspira- 
cies. The  movement  collapsed  almost  instantaneously,  more  from  its 
own  weaknesses  than  as  a  result  of  any  brilliance  or  preparation  that 
might  be  ascribed  to  Suharto's  response. 

Whether  or  not  the  Aidit-Syam  thesis  is  accepted,  there  remains 
the  very  important  question  of  who,  or  what  factors,  should  bear 


70 


Historical  Setting 


responsibility  for  the  mass  killings  that  took  place,  mostly  between 
October  1965  and  March  1966  and  then  in  occasional  outbursts  for 
several  years  thereafter.  Although  there  are  no  satisfactory  data  on 
which  reliable  national  calculations  can  be  made,  and  Indonesian 
government  estimates  have  varied  from  78,500  to  1  million  killed,  a 
figure  of  approximately  500,000  deaths  was  accepted  in  the  mid- 
1970s  by  the  head  of  the  Operational  Command  for  the  Restoration 
of  Security  and  Order  (Kopkamtib)  and  is  widely  used  in  Western 
sources.  As  many  as  250,000  persons  may  have  been  imprisoned  as 
well.  As  to  who  carried  out  these  killings,  the  available  evidence  is 
meager  and  mostly  anecdotal  and  suggests  a  complex  picture.  In 
some  areas,  clearly  Muslim  (in  central  and  eastern  Java,  predomi- 
nantly Nahdlatul  Ulama)  vigilantes  began  the  murders  spontane- 
ously and,  in  a  few  places,  even  had  to  be  reined  in  by  army  units.  In 
others,  army  contacts  either  acquiesced  to  or  encouraged  such 
actions,  and  in  a  number  of  these  there  was  a  clear  coordination  of 
efforts.  In  what  seems  to  have  been  a  smaller  number  of  places,  army 
units  alone  were  responsible.  People  participated  in  the  killings,  or 
looked  the  other  way,  for  a  wide  variety  of  reasons,  personal,  com- 
munity-related, and  ideological. 

Whatever  the  case,  the  mass  killings  amounted  to  a  cataclysmic 
ideological  cleansing  in  which  not  only  communists  but  also  sus- 
pected communists  (and  in  some  areas  miscellaneous  other  per- 
ceived enemies,  including  Chinese)  lost  their  lives.  Violence  of  this 
type  and  on  this  scale,  although  perhaps  foretold  in  episodes  of  the 
National  Revolution,  was  new  to  Indonesia.  It  is  perhaps  true,  as  his- 
torian Robert  B.  Cribb  has  suggested,  that  after  the  disillusionment 
of  the  struggle  for  independence,  and  the  deprivations  and  hostilities 
of  Guided  Democracy,  Indonesians  were  "ready  for  a  culprit,"  but 
the  fury  unleashed  seems  too  intense  and  too  broad  to  be  explained 
in  this  way  alone.  Similar  questions  about  the  origins  of  extreme  vio- 
lence in  Indonesia  were  to  arise  a  generation  later,  at  the  end  of  the 
regime  that  in  1965-66  was  just  beginning  to  take  hold. 

The  abrupt  narrative  break  of  the  violent  events  that  immediately 
followed  Gestapu  gives  the  impression  that  the  transition  from  the 
Old  Order  to  the  New  Order  (as  they  came  to  be  called,  first  by  anti- 
PKI,  anti- Sukarno  student  protesters)  was  swift.  In  reality,  Sukarno's 
power  and  Guided  Democracy  policies  dissolved  more  slowly, 
despite  fierce  opposition  in  some  circles  to  his  continued  defense  of 
the  PKI  and  his  refusal  to  concede  that  Guided  Democracy  had 
failed.  Suharto  and  his  supporters  were  aware  that  Sukarno  contin- 
ued to  have  loyal  followers,  and  they  did  not  wish  to  risk  more 
upheaval,  much  less  a  backlash  against  the  army.  Military  tribunals 
began  holding  well-managed  trials  of  PKI  figures,  and  a  gradual

removal  began  of  ABRI  officers  and  troops  thought  to  be  strong  PKJ 
or  Sukarno  loyalists. 

In  early  1966,  Sukarno,  still  the  acknowledged  president,  was 
pressured  into  signing  the  Letter  of  Instruction  of  March  1 1  (Surat 
Perintah  Sebelas  Maret,  later  known  by  the  acronym  Supersemar — 
see  Glossary),  turning  over  to  Suharto  his  executive  authority,  for 
among  other  reasons,  to  keep  law  and  order  and  to  safeguard  the 
Revolution.  The  next  day,  the  PKI  was  officially  banned  and  its  sur- 
viving leaders,  as  well  as  prominent  pro-Sukarno  figures,  arrested 
and  imprisoned.  Over  the  next  few  months,  the  new  government 
largely  dismantled  Sukarno's  foreign  policy  as  Jakarta  broke  its  ties 
with  Beijing,  abandoned  confrontation  with  Malaysia,  rejoined  the 
UN  and  other  international  bodies,  and  made  overtures  to  the  West, 
especially  for  economic  assistance.  The  Inter-Governmental  Group 
on  Indonesia  (IGGI — see  Glossary)  was  formed  to  coordinate  this 
aid.  In  mid- 1966,  the  Provisional  People's  Consultative  Assembly 
(MPR(S))  demanded  that  Sukarno  account  for  his  behavior  regard- 
ing Gestapu,  but  he  stubbornly  refused;  only  early  the  next  year  did 
he  directly  claim  that  he  had  known  nothing  in  advance  of  those 
events.  But  by  then,  even  many  of  his  supporters  had  lost  patience. 
On  March  12,  1967,  the  MPR(S)  formally  removed  Sukarno  from 
power  and  appointed  Suharto  acting  president  in  his  stead.  The  New 
Order  thus  officially  began  as  the  Old  Order  withered  away.  Alone 
and  bitter,  Sukarno  lived  under  virtual  house  arrest  in  the  presiden- 
tial palace  in  Bogor,  Jawa  Barat  Province,  until  his  death  in  1970, 
and  he  was  buried  far  from  the  nation's  capital  in  his  home  town  of 
Blitar  in  Jawa  Timur  Province. 

Contemporary  Indonesia 

Rise  of  the  New  Order,  1966-85 

On  the  surface,  and  particularly  through  a  Cold  War  lens,  the  New 
Order  appeared  to  be  the  antithesis  of  the  Old  Order:  anticommunist 
as  opposed  to  communist-leaning,  pro-Western  as  opposed  to  anti- 
Western,  precapitalist  rather  than  anticapitalist,  and  so  on.  As  new 
head  of  state,  Suharto  seemed  to  reflect  these  differences  by  being, 
as  historian  Theodore  Friend  put  it,  "cold  and  reclusive  where 
Sukarno  had  been  hot  and  expansive."  And  certainly  many  Indone- 
sians saw  the  change  of  regime  as  representing  a  great  deal  more 
than  a  mere  shift  or  transition.  Separated  from  the  Old  Order  by  a 
national  trauma,  the  New  Order  was  unabashedly  dominated  by  the 
military,  focused  on  economic  development  (pembangunan),  and 
determined  to  create  stability.  The  promoters  of  the  New  Order  saw 


72 


Historical  Setting 


themselves  as  pragmatic  and  realistic,  generally  apolitical  and 
opposed  to  all  ideologies,  characteristics  that,  in  the  wake  of  the 
Guided  Democracy  years,  were  by  no  means  unpopular  even  among 
those  who  were  nervous  about  the  prospects  of  military  rule. 

It  became  obvious  in  time,  however,  that  alongside  the  differences 
there  were  a  number  of  important  similarities  between  the  two 
regimes.  For  example,  both  Sukarno  and  Suharto  developed  into 
authoritarian  rulers,  compared  by  critics  to  ancient  Javanese  kings 
and  seen  as  unique  and  uniquely  potent  figures — the  sole  dalang 
(puppet  master) — on  whom  everything  depended.  Both  men  believed 
in  a  strong,  highly  centralized,  and  religiously  neutral  state,  and  both 
found  established  political  parties  and  organized  public  opposition 
difficult  to  tolerate.  Both  searched  for  and  hoped  to  define  an  appro- 
priate national  identity,  looking  back  to  Indonesia's  beginnings  as  an 
independent  nation  for  inspiration  in  so  doing.  Both  men  overesti- 
mated their  own  powers  and  were  in  the  end  forced  from  office  and 
publicly  disgraced  in  ways  and  for  reasons  they  could  not  grasp.  The 
two  "orders,"  like  the  two  individuals  who  epitomized  them,  are  best 
viewed  not  in  either/or  terms,  but  in  the  light  of  nuance  and  an  aware- 
ness of  similarities  and  differences,  changes  and  continuities. 

It  was  still  far  from  clear  in  1966,  either  to  Suharto  himself  or  to 
his  civilian  and  military  supporters,  what  the  New  Order  was  actually 
going  to  look  like.  At  a  seminar  entitled  "In  Search  of  a  New  Path" 
held  at  Jakarta's  Universitas  Indonesia  in  May  that  year,  students  and 
intellectuals  grappled  primarily  with  problems  associated  with  the 
economy,  focusing  on  the  role  that  could  be  played  by  those  with  spe- 
cialized training  in  economic  development  and  finance,  so-called 
technocrats.  Three  months  later,  the  armed  forces,  under  Suharto's 
leadership,  held  their  own  seminar  in  Bandung,  entitled  "Broad  Pol- 
icy Outlines  and  Implementation  Plans  for  Political  and  Economic 
Stability."  There  was  extended  discussion,  with  civilian  leaders  in 
attendance,  of  the  appropriate  role  of  the  military  in  rebuilding  Indo- 
nesia. They  settled  on  "safeguarding  the  Revolution,"  and  exercising 
dwifungsi  (dual  function)  of  national  defense  and  participation  in  the 
nation's  political  and  social  affairs,  twin  responsibilities  said  to  be 
rooted  in  the  army's  experience  during  the  struggle  for  independence 
(see  Suharto's  New  Order,  1965-98,  ch.  5). 

There  were  vague  references  at  this  time  to  elections,  but  it  was  rea- 
sonably clear  that  there  would  be  no  return  to  the  open  party  politics  of 
the  early  1950s,  which  military,  and  many  civilian,  leaders  considered 
divisive  because  they  either  tapped  into  "primordial"  loyalties  and 
identities  or  created  such  loyalties  on  the  basis  of  inappropriate  ideolo- 
gies. On  the  other  hand,  Sukarno's  Guided  Democracy  had  proven 


73 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

unworkable.  The  New  Order  solution  was  to  attempt  an  apolitical, 
nonideological,  quasi-  or  pseudo-democratic  system  that  would  pro- 
mote unity,  prevent  both  internal  conflict  and  the  obstruction  of  eco- 
nomic development,  and  satisfy  some  of  the  basic  requirements  of 
world  opinion. 

Political  Structure 

What  came  to  be  called  Pancasila  Democracy  appears  to  have 
been  constructed  principally  by  Ali  Murtopo  (1924-84),  a  long-time 
army  associate  of  Suharto.  Of  modest  social  and  educational  back- 
ground, Ali  Murtopo  rose  to  prominence  in  the  military,  primarily  as 
an  "operator"  with  strategic  sense  and  a  "can  do"  attitude.  His  role  as 
a  leading  military  intelligence  officer  earned  him  a  reputation  as  an 
unscrupulous  and  rather  mysterious  manipulator,  but  in  some 
respects  he  mirrored  views  held  far  beyond  a  small  group  of  military 
leaders  and  shared  among  the  civilian  middle  classes,  and  his  activi- 
ties were  widely  known.  His  plan  had  three  key  elements.  First,  gov- 
ernment control  of  the  parliamentary  process  would  be  achieved  by 
stipulating  that  a  certain  percentage  of  the  membership  of  the  chief 
legislative  body,  the  People's  Representative  Council  (DPR),  and  the 
chief  representative  body,  the  People's  Consultative  Assembly 
(MPR),  were  to  be  government  civilian  appointees,  with  an  addi- 
tional group  of  appointed  members  from  the  armed  forces.  Second, 
control  of  the  electoral  process  would  come  by  limiting  the  number 
of  political  parties  and  prying  them  away  from  ethnic,  religious, 
regional,  or  personal  identities,  as  well  as  by  establishing  a  govern- 
ment-backed parliamentary  representative  group  (pointedly  not  a 
"political  party")  of  government  employees  and  other  groups,  such  as 
Golkar  (see  Glossary),  an  organization  of  functional  groups,  to  partic- 
ipate in  elections.  Third,  control  over  the  majority  of  the  voting  pub- 
lic would  result  from  limiting  the  periods  of  political  campaigning 
and  restricting  such  activities  to  the  district  level.  The  inhabitants  of 
villages  and  small  towns — the  majority  of  Indonesians — were  to  be 
"freed"  from  mass  political  mobilization,  manipulation,  and  polariza- 
tion, becoming  instead  a  more  or  less  depoliticized  "floating  mass." 
They  would  be  encouraged  to  vote  for  whichever  party  or  group  they 
thought  might  best  answer  their  needs  at  the  moment,  but  not  to  make 
their  choices  on  the  basis  of  "primordial"  or  personal  identifiers. 

An  additional  component,  designed  initially  under  the  direction  of 
Ruslan  Abdulgani  (1914-2005),  who  had  served  as  Sukarno's  chief 
ideological  adviser  a  decade  earlier,  was  a  national  indoctrination 
program  intended  to  give  Pancasila  clarity  and  application,  and  to 
ensure  that  all  Indonesians  uniformly  understood  and  accepted  it.  The

military,  the  extraconstitutional  Kopkamtib,  and  the  civilian  National 
Intelligence  Coordinating  Board  (Bakin)  all  exerted  degrees  of 
watchfulness  and  enforcement. 

These  arrangements,  which  came  to  characterize  the  New  Order,  did 
not  emerge  suddenly  and  fully  formed  but  rather  were  the  product  of 
gradual  change  and,  generally,  pragmatic  adjustment.  The  consolida- 
tion of  political  parties,  for  example,  did  not  take  place  until  1973,  two 
years  after  the  first  elections  (in  which  Golkar  won  nearly  63  percent  of 
the  vote).  Government  strategists  seem  to  have  thought  consolidation 
might  be  preferable  to  the  direct  but  clumsy  manipulation  of  party 
leadership  attempted  before  the  elections.  A  strong  fear  persisted  that, 
even  with  communism  outlawed,  potential  threats  to  order  remained  in 
the  form  of  religiously  identified  parties  and  the  former  followers  of 
Sukarno.  Islamic  parties  had  to  combine,  for  this  reason,  in  a  govern- 
ment-created Development  Unity  Party  (PPP),  and  other  parties, 
including  Sukarno's  old  PNI,  amalgamated  in  the  Indonesian  Democ- 
racy Party  (PDI).  Where  Pancasila  was  concerned,  the  government 
attempted  to  introduce  draft  bills  on  the  subject  in  1969  and  1973,  but 
nothing  came  of  them.  It  was  only  in  1978  that  moral  instructions,  the 
so-called  Guide  to  Realizing  and  Experiencing  the  Pancasila  (P4),  took 
shape,  and  Pancasila  education  began  to  enter  school  curricula  and 
civil  service  training  in  earnest.  Not  until  1985  did  all  organizations, 


75 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

including  political  groups,  have  to  adopt  the  Pancasila  as  their  asas 
tunggal  (underlying  principle). 

Particularly  after  its  first  decade  and  down  until  its  final  years,  the 
New  Order's  political  design  gave  the  impression  that  it  had  produced 
a  tight,  highly  centralized,  and  closely  managed  system,  and  one  that 
depended  to  an  extraordinary  degree  on  the  political  genius  of  one 
individual,  Suharto.  Scholars  and  others,  especially  those  who  opposed 
the  rise  of  the  New  Order,  struggled  to  find  an  appropriate  term  with 
which  to  describe  it — autocratic,  militarist,  neofeudal,  patrimonial, 
paternalist,  neofascist,  corporatist,  military-bureaucratic,  developmen- 
talist,  or  command-pragmatist — and  periodically  announced  that  its 
demise  was  imminent.  None  of  the  terms  proved  altogether  satisfac- 
tory, but  even  so  the  New  Order  lasted  for  32  years. 

The  continuity  of  the  New  Order  was  not  achieved  solely,  or  per- 
haps even  largely,  by  force  or  the  threat  of  force.  For  one  thing,  Indo- 
nesia was  far  too  large  and  too  diverse  to  be  ruled  entirely  uniformly 
by  a  single  institution,  much  less  a  single  person.  As  political  scien- 
tist Donald  K.  Emmerson  noted  in  1999,  '"Suharto's  Indonesia'  had 
never  been  more  than  a  metaphor."  Further,  the  military  itself  was 
neither  monolithic  nor  a  caste  apart  from  civilian  society.  The  actual 
practice  of  dwifungsi,  which  by  1969  had,  for  example,  placed  mili- 
tary men  as  governors  in  nearly  70  percent  of  the  nation's  provinces 
and  as  mayors  and  district  heads  in  more  than  half  of  all  cities  and 
districts,  did  more  to  "civilianize"  the  military  than  to  militarize  civil 
society.  And  it  was  under  "military  rule"  that  the  civilian  bureau- 
cracy ballooned,  between  1975  and  1988  more  than  doubling  to  3.5 
million.  It  is  also  true  that  the  New  Order  was  founded,  and  contin- 
ued to  depend  upon,  a  rough  and  largely  unspoken  consensus  among 
the  middle  classes,  military  as  well  as  civilian,  that  economic  devel- 
opment came  before  everything  else.  The  New  Order  government 
had  a  great  deal  of  leeway  as  long  as  it  could  make  good  on  promises 
of  economic  growth. 

None  of  this  meant,  however,  that  government  policies  and  actions 
went  unopposed.  Indeed,  the  period  of  greatest  political  structural 
change  and  economic  expansion  saw  serious  outbursts  of  dissent:  the 
1974  Malari  riots  over  big  business  and  the  burgeoning  Japanese  eco- 
nomic presence  were  followed  in  1 976  by  the  Sawito  Affair  accusing 
Suharto  and  the  government  of  corruption.  In  1980  came  the  Petition 
of  50  in  which  notables,  many  of  them  former  ABRI  officers  and 
close  allies  of  Suharto,  protested  that  the  New  Order  had  misinter- 
preted Pancasila  and  misunderstood  the  proper  mission  of  the  armed 
services,  and  in  1984  the  Tanjung  Priok  riots  protested  corruption  and 
ABRI's  handling  of  Islam.  These  upheavals  were  handled  in  coarse, 
often  coercive,  ways.  But  they  could  be  weathered  because  a  broad 


76

public  feared  unrest  and  had  made  a  certain  peace  with  the  supposi- 
tion, long  nursed  in  both  military  and  some  civilian  circles,  that 
potential  enemies  to  national  order  included  not  only  communism  and 
Islam  but  also  unfettered  Western-style  liberal  democracy. 

Economic  Growth 

The  New  Order's  primary  goal  and  justification  was  rapid  economic 
growth,  to  be  achieved  not  by  a  thorough-going  reversal  from  Guided 
Democracy's  state-centered  socialist  ideals  to  liberal  capitalism,  but  by 
finding  a  realistic,  flexible  way  to  deliver  results  without  entirely  aban- 
doning those  ideals.  This  was  a  formidable  task.  Economic  historian 
Pierre  van  der  Eng  has  estimated  that  at  the  start  of  the  New  Order, 
Indonesia's  per  capita  GDP  was  below  what  it  had  been  in  1940,  and 
probably  below  the  level  of  1913.  The  country  was  also  saddled  with 
an  enormous  foreign  debt  and  crippling  inflation  (see  The  Role  of 
Government,  ch.  3).  The  strategy  drawn  up  and  managed  by  a  team  of 
Western-educated  economists  headed  by  Wijoyo  Nitisastro  (1927— 
2005)  was  ambitious  but  fiscally  cautious  and  uninterested  in  eco- 
nomic nationalism  or  dogma.  Beginning  in  1969,  Repelita  (see  Glos- 
sary)— five-year  plans  that  were  really  more  guidelines  than  economic 
plans — laid  out  broad  priorities  but  left  much  room  for  policy  maneu- 
vering and  adjustment  to  changing  conditions.  The  focus  was  squarely 
on  alleviating  poverty,  and  in  the  simplest  terms  the  approach  was  to 
improve  agricultural  productivity  and  rural  incomes.  Successes  there 
would  then  provide  the  dynamic  for  industrialization,  which  would  in 
turn  bring  the  nation  to  a  point  of  "takeoff'  to  full  and  self-sustaining 
modernization. 

Remarkably,  and  despite  widespread  skepticism,  the  New  Order 
did  succeed  in  bringing  about  a  rapid  transformation  of  Indonesia's 
economy.  During  the  roughly  30-year  period,  for  example,  Indonesia 
averaged  a  real  GDP  growth  of  roughly  5  percent,  and  real  per  capita 
GDP  trebled.  Average  caloric  intake  increased  by  70  percent,  aver- 
age life  expectancy  rose  from  about  47  to  67  years,  and  the  manufac- 
turing and  industrial  sectors'  combined  share  of  GDP  rose  from  19 
percent  to  roughly  65  percent  while  agriculture's  share  dropped  from 
53  percent  to  19  percent.  The  incidence  of  poverty  dropped  from  61 
percent  to  10  percent  on  Java,  and  from  52  percent  to  7  percent  else- 
where in  the  country.  In  1993  the  World  Bank  placed  Indonesia 
among  the  highest-performing  developing  economies  and  pointed  to 
its  success  in  achieving  both  rapid  growth  and  improved  equity. 

This  was  an  astounding  performance,  and  understanding  it  has 
occasioned  heated  and  continuing  academic  debate.  Some  scholars 
point  out  that  Indonesia's  accomplishments  must  be  evaluated  in  a 


77 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

broader,  comparative  context.  Surpassing  Nigeria  in  virtually  all 
macroindicators,  and  India  and  China  in  some  of  them,  Indonesia 
nevertheless  lagged  behind  neighboring  Malaysia,  Thailand,  and  the 
Philippines  in  others.  Especially  considering  the  point  from  which  it 
began,  Indonesia  performed  remarkably  well,  but  on  a  world  scale  in 
a  long  generation  of  economic  improvement,  it  is  important  to  iden- 
tify both  comparative  strengths  (sustained  growth  rate,  structural 
change)  and  weaknesses  (inflation,  terms  of  trade,  and  debt  service). 

Other  writers  have  questioned  the  accuracy  of  the  statistical  data 
used  to  support  many  of  the  findings  about  New  Order  economic 
development,  suggesting  among  other  things  that  the  ways  poverty 
was  measured  were  flawed  and  that  methods  of  gauging  inequality 
simply  did  not  match  up  with  either  observation  or  public  commen- 
tary. Between  the  early  1970s  and  the  mid-1990s,  for  example,  there 
was  a  common  assumption  that  the  gap  between  rich  and  poor  in 
Indonesia  grew  fairly  rapidly,  although  during  the  same  period  the 
nation's  Gini  index  (see  Glossary),  based  on  household  expenditure, 
remained  relatively  steady  at  about  0.34,  well  below  Thailand  (0.45), 
the  Philippines  (0.48),  and  Malaysia  (0.50).  It  seems  likely,  however, 
that  the  divergence  is  best  explained  not  by  flawed  methods  of  mea- 
surement, but  by  changing  perceptions.  New  Order  Indonesians 
were  the  first  to  acquire  wealth  in  significant  numbers,  and  to  a 
vastly  better-informed  society  with  rising  expectations  it  appeared 
that  the  rich  were  getting  richer  and  the  poor  poorer  even  though  this 
was  not  statistically  the  case. 

Some  critics  have  also  characterized  Indonesia's  economic  prog- 
ress during  the  New  Order  as  ephemeral  because  it  was  dependent  on 
foreign  aid,  state  investment  (and  control),  and/or  the  exploitation  of 
nonrenewable  resources,  especially  oil  and  gas.  Such  arguments  are 
difficult  to  support  with  real  data.  Oil  revenues,  for  instance,  supplied 
much  of  Indonesia's  budgetary  income  during  the  boom  years 
between  1973  and  1981,  but  agriculture  did  so  before  that  time,  and 
by  the  end  of  the  New  Order,  non-oil  revenues,  bolstered  largely  by 
industrial  and  manufacturing  growth,  accounted  for  nearly  70  percent 
of  the  budget.  Oil  and  oil  prices  did  not  determine  growth  throughout 
the  period,  and  the  New  Order  is  widely  credited  among  economists 
for  managing  the  oil  windfall  more  wisely  than  other  newly  oil-rich 
nations,  such  as  Nigeria  and  Venezuela,  in  order  to  head  off  depen- 
dency on  that  source. 

Economic  development  during  the  New  Order  was  more  than  a 
mere  facade  or,  as  one  of  Indonesia's  most  prominent  public  intellec- 
tuals, Gunawan  Mohammad,  once  characterized  it,  an  "epic  illusion." 
The  gains  were  real  and  widely  shared,  and  there  can  be  no  doubt  that 
the  average  Indonesian  was  economically  better  off  toward  the  end  of 


78 


Historical  Setting 


the  New  Order  than  at  its  start.  (Nor  were  these  gains  entirely  erased 
by  the  economic  crisis  of  the  late  1990s,  as  some  predicted.)  Several 
problems,  however,  rooted  as  much  in  the  development  program's 
successes  as  in  its  failures,  were  of  great  long-term  significance.  The 
most  obvious  was  corruption,  the  scale  of  which  burgeoned  as  the 
economy  grew.  A  notorious  harbinger  of  things  to  come  was  the  fis- 
cal scandal  surrounding  Colonel  Ibnu  Sutowo  (1914-2001),  head  of 
the  State  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Mining  Company  (Pertamina),  who  by 
1975  had  sunk  the  corporation  into  enormous  international  debt  while 
personally  enjoying  a  luxurious  lifestyle  that  reportedly  included  a 
US$1  million  wedding  for  his  daughter.  By  the  early  1990s,  the  finan- 
cial dealings  of  Suharto's  own  children,  particularly  his  eldest  daugh- 
ter, Siti  Hardiyanti  Rukmana,  better  known  as  Tutut  (born  1949),  and 
youngest  son,  Hutomo  Mandala  Putra,  nicknamed  Tommy  (born 
1962),  attracted  widespread  attention  because  of  their  scale  and  their 
family  conglomerates'  dependence  on  privilege.  And,  well  beyond 
financial  circles,  corruption  extended  far  into  the  bureaucracy,  the 
courts,  and  the  police.  Despite  numerous  campaigns  proposing  to 
deal  with  corruption  in  various  corners  of  society,  government  task 
forces  and  investigations  made  little  headway;  corruption  ate  corro- 
sively at  the  New  Order  from  the  inside. 

Other  difficulties  were  less  straightforward.  For  example,  New 
Order  technocrats  had  sought  to  address  the  economic  imbalance 
between  Java  and  the  Outer  Islands,  whose  natural  resources  had 
contributed  disproportionately  to  the  national  income,  a  source  of 
rebellion  in  the  1950s  and  early  1960s.  New  Order  industrialization 
policies,  depending  heavily  on  the  relatively  cheap  labor  available  in 
densely  populated  Java,  changed  this.  By  the  mid-1990s,  Java  pro- 
duced 40  percent  of  the  country's  exports,  double  the  figure  of  only  a 
decade  earlier  and,  for  the  first  time  since  independence,  contributed 
a  portion  of  the  national  economic  output — roughly  60  percent — 
equivalent  to  its  share  of  the  population.  But  this  shift  produced  its 
own  imbalance  as  the  economy  of  the  Outer  Islands  slipped  compar- 
atively and  some  regions  began  to  see  widening  poverty,  a  new 
source  of  heightened  tension  between  the  regions  and  Jakarta.  A 
similar  irony  can  be  seen  in  the  changing  role  of  the  private  sector  of 
the  economy,  a  goal  sanctioned  by  the  New  Order  government  and 
pushed  especially  hard  by  the  IMF  and  World  Bank.  During  the  first 
four  Repelita  (1969-88),  private  investment,  foreign  as  well  as 
domestic,  provided  a  very  modest  percentage  of  national  investment 
funding,  but  by  the  end  of  Repelita  V  in  1993,  it  made  up  more  than 
70  percent  of  the  total,  a  rapid  shift.  The  change  was  particularly  sig- 
nificant, however,  because  it  went  unaccompanied  by  appropriate 
reforms  in  fiscal  regulation.  The  economy  became  increasingly 


79 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

driven  by  the  market,  and,  among  other  things,  private  entrepreneurs 
began  to  make  decisions  not  always  in  the  best  interests  of  the 
national  economy,  for  example  by  greatly  increasing  risky  borrow- 
ing from  overseas  sources  and  from  loosely  regulated  domestic 
banks,  factors  that  contributed  in  a  major  way  to  the  economic  crisis 
of  1997-98. 

Challenges  to  the  State 

Underlying  these  New  Order  initiatives  for  political  and  eco- 
nomic change  was  an  important  but  largely  undiscussed  continuity 
in  some  fundamental  ideas  about  the  nature  of  both  the  nation  and 
the  state.  Consistent  with  the  ideas  of  the  founders  of  independent 
Indonesia,  New  Order  architects  viewed  the  state  as  necessarily  uni- 
tary and  powerful,  having  little  patience  with  notions  of  federalism 
or  decentralization  of  powers.  Indeed,  civilian  and  military  leaders 
alike  appear  to  have  assumed  that  only  this  highly  centric  form  of 
state  authority  could  bring  about  the  political  stability  and  economic 
growth  they  sought.  The  same  leaders  also  inherited  assumptions 
about  the  extent  and  unity  of  a  national  territory  generally  accepted 
as  comprising  the  former  Netherlands  East  Indies  and  did  not  find 
other  suggestions  tolerable. 

These  convictions  led  among  other  things  to  raising  an  enlarged, 
more  centralized  bureaucratic  structure  for  the  New  Order  state,  and 
requiring  administrative  authorities  to  apply  centrally  developed  pol- 
icies on  matters  ranging  from  taxes  to  traditional  performances,  edu- 
cation to  elections,  firmly  and  uniformly  throughout  the  nation.  Seen 
from  the  government  perspective,  the  effort  represented  a  rational, 
modern  approach,  while  to  critics  it  often  appeared  narrow,  oppres- 
sive, and  self-serving.  Resentment  and  debate,  as  well  as  legal  and 
physical  struggles,  over  such  issues  were  a  regular  feature  of  life 
under  New  Order  governance. 

Inherited  sensitivity  to  potential  challenges  to  national  unity  also 
led  to  military  involvement — and  long-term  enmities — in  several 
corners  of  the  archipelago.  The  first  of  these  took  place  in  West  New 
Guinea  (later  called  Irian  Jaya,  now  the  provinces  of  Papua  and 
Papua  Barat).  During  the  1949  Round  Table  Conference,  the  Dutch 
had  refused  to  discuss  the  status  of  this  territory,  which,  upon  recog- 
nition of  Indonesian  independence,  was  still  unresolved.  Conflict 
over  the  issue  escalated  during  the  early  1960s,  as  the  Dutch  pre- 
pared to  declare  a  separate  state,  and  Sukarno  responded  with  a  mili- 
tary campaign.  In  August  1962,  the  Dutch  were  pressed  by  world 
opinion  to  turn  over  West  New  Guinea  to  the  UN,  which  permitted 
Indonesia  to  administer  the  territory  for  a  five-year  period  until  an

unspecified  "Act  of  Free  Choice"  could  be  held  (see  Local  Govern- 
ment, ch.  4). 

Thus  it  fell  to  the  New  Order  to  complete  a  project  begun  by  the 
Old  Order.  Ali  Murtopo — with  the  military  support  of  troops  com- 
manded by  Sarwo  Edhie  Wibowo  (1927-89) — arranged  the  cam- 
paign that,  in  mid- 1969,  produced  a  consensus  among  more  than 
1,000  designated  local  leaders  in  favor  of  integration  with  the  Indo- 
nesian state.  This  decision  was  soon  approved  by  the  UN,  and  the 
territory  became  Indonesia's  twenty-sixth  province  before  the  end  of 
the  year. 

The  integration  process  did  not  go  unopposed,  however.  Initial 
bitterness  came  from  Papuans  who  had  stood  to  benefit  from  a 
Dutch-sponsored  independence  and  who  formed  the  Free  Papua 
Organization  (OPM)  in  1965.  But  resentment  soon  spread  because  of 
Jakarta's  placement  of  thousands  of  troops  and  officials  in  the  terri- 
tory, exploitation  of  natural  resources  (for  example,  by  signing  con- 
tracts for  mining  rights  with  the  U.S.  corporation  Freeport- 
McMoRan  Copper  and  Gold  in  1967),  encouragement  of  settlers 
from  Java  and  elsewhere,  and  interference  with  local  traditions  such 
as  dress  and  religious  beliefs.  OPM  leaders  declared  Papua's  seces- 
sion in  1971  and  began  a  guerrilla  resistance.  Despite  internal  splits, 
OPM  resistance  continued  throughout  the  New  Order  era,  peaking  in 
the  mid-1980s  and  again  in  the  mid-1990s,  attracting  a  significant 
ABRI  presence. 

In  Aceh,  northern  Sumatra,  resistance  to  Jakarta's  extension  of 
authority  arose  in  the  mid-1970s.  This  area,  known  for  its  30-year 
struggle  against  Dutch  rule  in  the  nineteenth  century,  had  also  found 
it  necessary  to  fight  for  its  autonomy  after  independence,  in  a  move- 
ment led  by  the  Muslim  political  figure  Muhammad  Daud  Beureueh 
(1899-1987)  and  affiliated  with  Darul  Islam.  Aceh  won  status  as  a 
separate  province  in  1957  and  as  a  semiautonomous  special  territory 
with  greater  local  control  of  religious  matters  in  1959.  In  the  early 
1970s,  however,  the  discovery  of  natural  gas  in  Lhokseumawe, 
Aceh,  and  the  fact  that  this  location  could  be  more  readily  developed 
than  other  deposits  found  in  eastern  Kalimantan  and  the  Natuna 
Islands,  meant  that  for  Jakarta  Acehnese  autonomy  was  now  less  tol- 
erable. By  1976  armed  resistance  to  the  central  government  began 
under  the  banner  of  a  Free  Aceh  Movement  (GAM),  led  by  Hasan  di 
Tiro  (1925-2010),  a  former  Darul  Islam  leader  who  claimed  descent 
from  a  hero  of  the  1873-1903  Aceh  war  against  the  Dutch.  Jakarta 
responded  with  limited  military  force  that  crushed  the  small  move- 
ment, but  a  decade  later,  when  GAM  reappeared  with  greater  local 
support  and  funding  from  Libya  and  Iran,  both  the  movement  and 
the  Jakarta  response  were  far  more  extensive  and  brutal:  estimates

were  of  between  2,000  and  10,000  deaths,  mostly  civilian.  In  the 
mid-1990s,  Jakarta  claimed  to  have  defeated  GAM's  guerrilla 
forces,  but  resentment  ran  deep,  and  thousands  of  government  troops 
remained  posted  in  Aceh. 

The  military  involvement  of  greatest  significance  during  the  New 
Order,  however,  was  that  in  East  Timor.  The  status  of  this  small 
imperial  remnant  changed  when  a  radically  new,  democratic  govern- 
ment came  to  power  in  Lisbon  in  1974,  and  Portugal  soon  decided  to 
shed  its  colonial  holdings.  Local  political  parties  quickly  formed  in 
favor  of  different  visions  of  the  future,  the  most  prominent  being  the 
leftist  Revolutionary  Front  for  an  Independent  East  Timor  (Freti- 
lin— see  Glossary)  and  the  Timorese  Popular  Democratic  Associa- 
tion (Apodeti),  which  sought  integration  with  Indonesia  as  a  semi- 
autonomous  province.  By  mid- 1975,  it  appeared  that  Fretilin  would 
be  the  likely  winner  in  an  upcoming  general  election,  a  prospect  that 
brought  internal  political  violence  as  well  as  escalating  concern  in 
Jakarta  that  a  "communist"  government  (a  designation  generally 
considered  inaccurate)  might  plant  itself  in  the  midst  of  the  Indone- 
sian nation.  On  November  28,  1975,  Fretilin  announced  the  indepen- 
dence of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  East  Timor  (as  of  2002,  the 
Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste),  which  it  controlled.  Driven 
by  ideological  fears  rather  than  a  desire  for  national  expansion, 
Jakarta  reversed  its  earlier  avowed  policy  of  noninterference  and, 
with  the  implicit  consent  of  Australia  and  the  United  States,  on 
December  7  launched  an  assault  on  East  Timor  and  soon  began  a 
brutal  "pacification"  requiring  more  than  30,000  ABRI  troops.  On 
July  15,  1976,  East  Timor,  as  Timor  Timur,  became  the  twenty-sev- 
enth province  of  Indonesia,  and  Jakarta  began  both  exploiting  the 
limited  natural  resources — coffee,  sandalwood,  marble,  and  pros- 
pects for  vanilla  and  oil — and  undertaking  rebuilding  and  develop- 
ment programs. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  province  opened  to  foreign  observers,  and  in 
1990  ABRI  finally  captured  the  charismatic  Fretilin  leader  Jose 
Alexandre  "Xanana"  Gusmao  (born  1946),  but  widespread  resent- 
ment of  the  occupation  festered.  Then,  in  November  1991,  Indone- 
sian soldiers  fired  on  a  crowd  of  demonstrators  at  the  Santa  Cruz 
Cemetery  in  Dili,  the  capital,  and  dramatic  video  footage  of  this 
event,  in  which  between  50  and  250  civilians  were  killed,  was  dis- 
tributed worldwide.  The  majority  of  Indonesians  knew  and  cared  lit- 
tle about  East  Timor  and  had  not  basically  disagreed  with  New  Order 
policies  there,  but  the  outside  world  felt  very  differently.  Indonesia 
found  itself  increasingly  pressured — for  example,  by  the  United 
States,  the  European  Union  (EU),  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  and 
the  UN — to  change  course.  Indonesia  resisted,  and,  indeed,  military

pressures  in  East  Timor  tightened,  and  Muslim  migration,  especially 
from  Java,  increased  rapidly  in  this  largely  Catholic  and  animist 
area.  Not  surprisingly,  indigenous  opposition  increased,  especially 
among  a  younger  generation  born  in  the  1970s.  Jakarta  did  not  rec- 
ognize this  response  as  either  legitimate  protest  or  nascent  national- 
ism, which  it  had  unwittingly  done  much  to  foster. 

Decline  and  Fall  of  the  New  Order,  1985-98 

The  New  Order  probably  reached  the  peak  of  its  powers  in  the 
mid-  to  late  1980s.  The  clear  success  of  its  agricultural  strategy, 
achieving  self-sufficiency  in  rice  in  1985,  and  its  policies  in  such  dif- 
ficult fields  as  family  planning — Indonesia's  birthrate  dropped 
exceptionally  rapidly  from  5.5  percent  to  3.3  percent  annually 
between  1967  and  1987 — earned  it  international  admiration.  Eco- 
nomic progress  for  the  middle  and  lower  classes  had  seemed  to  bal- 
ance any  domestic  discontent.  In  retrospect,  however,  signs  of 
serious  weakness  were  discernible  by  about  the  same  time.  Although 
there  had  always  been  a  certain  level  of  public  and  private  dissension 
under  New  Order  rule,  by  the  early  1 990s  it  had  grown  stronger,  and 
the  government  appeared  increasingly  unable  to  finesse  this  opposi- 
tion with  force  (veiled  or  otherwise)  or  cooptation.  In  addition, 
intense  international  disapproval,  particularly  over  East  Timor, 
proved  increasingly  difficult  to  deflect. 

Several  important  shifts  had  taken  place,  which  in  turn  altered  the 
New  Order  in  fundamental  ways.  One  was  international:  the  collapse 
of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991  and  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  both  pro- 
vided New  Order  leaders  with  frightening  examples  of  political 
upheaval  and  religious  and  ethnic  conflict  following  in  the  wake  of  a 
relaxation  of  centralized  power,  and  these  events  also  left  Indonesia 
more  vulnerable  to  pressures  from  the  West.  An  important  result  was 
a  new  uncertainty  in  domestic  policy,  for  example,  toward  public  crit- 
icism, Islam,  and  ethnic  and  religious  conflict.  In  the  military,  opin- 
ions grew  more  varied,  many  of  them  frankly  disapproving  of  certain 
government  policies,  including  those  toward  the  armed  services.  A 
second  important  change  took  place  as  the  advice  of  "technocrats" 
responsible  for  the  successfully  cautious  economic  strategizing  of  the 
1970s  and  1980s  began  to  give  way  to  that  of  "technicians"  such  as 
Suharto  protege  Bacharuddin  J.  (B.  J.)  Habibie  (born  1936),  who 
became  a  technology  czar  favoring  huge,  risky  expenditures  in  high- 
technology  research  and  production,  for  example  by  attempting  to 
construct  an  indigenous  aeronautics  industry. 

Some  observers  detected  a  third  area  of  change  in  the  attitude  of 
Suharto  himself.  He  grew  more  fearful  of  opposition  and  less  tolerant 


83 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

of  criticism,  careless  in  regard  to  the  multiplying  financial  excesses 
of  associates  and  his  own  children,  and  increasingly  insensitive  to 
pressures  to  arrange  a  peaceful  transition  of  power  to  new  leadership. 
And,  by  the  late  1990s,  he  seemed  to  lose  the  sense  of  propriety  he 
had  professed  earlier.  Circumventing  all  normal  procedures,  Suharto 
had  himself  appointed  a  five-star  general,  a  rank  previously  accorded 
only  the  great  revolutionary  leader  Sudirman  (1916-50)  and  his  suc- 
cessor, Nasution.  Further,  he  not  only  ignored  his  own  earlier  advice 
against  running  for  a  seventh  term  but  also  placed  daughter  Tutut, 
son-in-law  General  Prabowd  Subianto  (born  1952,  and  married  at  the 
time  to  Suharto's  second  daughter,  Siti  Hediati  Hariyadi — known  as 
Titiek,  born  1959),  and  a  host  of  individuals  close  to  the  family  in 
important  civilian  and  military  positions.  These  and  other  transgres- 
sions lost  Suharto  and  many  of  those  around  him  the  trust  of  even  his 
most  loyal  supporters,  civilian  as  well  as  military. 

The  changes  of  greatest  long-term  significance,  however,  may 
have  been  social  and  cultural.  New  Order  architects  had  planned  on 
controlling  the  nation's  politics  and  transforming  its  economy,  but 
they  had  given  comparatively  little  consideration  to  how,  if  they  suc- 
ceeded, society — their  own  generation's  and  their  children's — might 
change  as  a  result.  If  economic  improvement  expanded  the  middle 
classes  and  produced  an  improved  standard  of  living,  for  example, 
would  these  Indonesians  begin  to  acquire  new  outlooks  and  expecta- 
tions, new  values?  What  might  be  the  cultural  results  of  much 
greater  openness  to  the  outside,  especially  the  Western,  world? 
Although  the  New  Order  became  infamous  for  efforts  to  inculcate  a 
conservative,  nationalist  Pancasila  social  ideology,  and  to  promote  a 
homogenized,  vaguely  national  culture,  these  endeavors  were  far 
from  successful.  Despite  a  penchant  for  banning  the  works  of  those 
considered  to  be  influenced  by  communism  (author  Pramudya 
Ananta  Tur  became  the  world-famous  example)  and  an  undisguised 
distaste  for  "low,"  popular  culture  (a  high  government  official  once 
disparaged  dangdut,  a  new  and  wildly  popular  music  style  blending 
modern  Western,  Indian,  Islamic,  and  indigenous  influences,  as 
"dog-shit"  music),  the  New  Order's  leaders  turned  a  comparatively 
blind  eye  to  cultural  developments  and  seemingly  had  little  idea 
what  such  changes  might  reflect  of  shifting  social  values. 

Indonesianist  Barbara  Hatley  has  pointed  to  "a  vigorous  process 
of  reinterpretation"  of  tradition  during  the  New  Order  period,  as  well 
as  new  reflections  of  the  present.  For  example,  in  a  series  of  four 
novels  about  the  lives  of  young,  urban,  middle-class  Indonesians  in 
the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  Yudhistira  Ardhi  Nugraha  (born 
1954)  satirized  the  world  of  their  pompous,  hypocritical  parents,

civilian  as  well  as  military.  Playwright  Nobertus  "Nano"  Riantiarno 
(born  1949)  used  mocking  language  and  absurdist  humor  to  make 
fun  of  the  world  of  politicians  and  government  bureaucrats  in  his 
1985  Cockroach  Opera,  which  was  finally  banned  five  years  later. 
By  the  late  1980s,  many  of  the  older  generation  had  begun  to  ques- 
tion the  implicit  bargain  they  had  struck  with  the  New  Order;  their 
children,  who  had  little  or  no  memory  of  the  Sukarno  period  or  the 
dark  days  of  the  mid-1960s,  merely  saw  the  limitations  and  injus- 
tices around  them  and  resisted,  often  with  humor  and  cynicism. 

More  openly  and  widely  challenged  than  ever  before,  the  New 
Order  was  in  1997  confronted  with  economic  collapse  in  the  wake  of 
a  wider  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  government's  response  was  slow 
and  inadequate,  pleasing  neither  liberals  nor  nationalist  conserva- 
tives. Over  an  eight-month  period,  the  value  of  the  rupiah  (see  Glos- 
sary) fell  70  percent.  Over  the  course  of  a  year,  the  economy  as  a 
whole  shrank  nearly  14  percent,  40  percent  of  the  nation's  businesses 
went  bankrupt,  per  capita  income  fell  an  estimated  40  percent,  and 
the  number  of  people  living  in  poverty  catapulted,  by  some  accounts, 
to  as  much  as  40  percent  of  the  population.  By  March  1998,  when 
Suharto  and  his  chosen  running  mate,  Habibie,  became  president  and 
vice  president,  respectively,  it  was  clear  that  a  line  had  been  crossed. 
Public  calls  for  reform  turned  angry,  and  within  weeks  bitterly  anti- 
government,  anti-Suharto  student  demonstrations  spilled  out  of  cam- 
puses across  the  nation.  On  May  12,  at  Trisakti  University  in  Jakarta, 
members  of  the  police  force,  then  under  ABRI  command,  fired  on 
demonstrating  students,  killing  four  (and  two  bystanders)  and 
wounding  at  least  20  others.  This  event,  which  created  instant  mar- 
tyrs and  removed  any  lingering  hesitancy  for  a  broad  spectrum  of 
Indonesians,  launched  several  days  of  horrific  violence,  which  ABRI 
could  not  or  would  not  control.  In  Indonesia  as  a  whole,  an  estimated 
2,400  people  are  said  to  have  died;  as  much  as  US$1  billion  in  prop- 
erty was  damaged;  and  tens  of  thousands  of  foreign  residents  and 
Indonesian  Chinese  fled  the  country.  The  government  that  had  come 
to  power  promising  stability  and  economic  growth  now  demonstra- 
bly could  deliver  neither,  and  its  leader  was  precipitously  abandoned 
by  even  his  closest  associates.  In  a  simple  ceremony  held  on  May  21 
at  9:00  a.m.,  Suharto  resigned,  bringing  a  symbolic  end  to  the  now 
jaded  and  discredited  New  Order  leadership. 

Reformasi  and  the  Post-New  Order  Era,  1998-2009 

Suharto's  departure,  however,  brought  neither  relief  nor  calm  to 
Indonesia,  instead  ushering  in  an  extended  period  of  upheaval  and 
escalating  violence.  This  took  many  forms — interethnic,  interreligious, 


85

political,  both  neighborhood  and  military-organized  vigilantism,  and 
even  bizarre  mob  attacks  on  "ninjas"  and  sorcerers — and  was  spread 
throughout  the  country,  most  notably  in  Kalimantan,  Maluku,  central 
Sulawesi,  and  eastern  Java.  Everywhere  sensational  examples  of  sav- 
agery were  recorded  in  the  media:  piles  of  human  heads  in  Kaliman- 
tan, suspected  sorcerers  dragged  through  the  streets  by  motorcycles  in 
eastern  Java,  petty  thieves  beaten  and  burned  alive  in  many  places,  and 
killers  in  Kalimantan  and  Ambon  reportedly  drinking  their  victims' 
blood  and  eating  their  organs.  As  many  as  20,000  people  may  have 
been  killed  between  1998  and  2001  and  more  than  200,000  displaced 
from  their  homes.  There  was  vigorous  debate  over  the  causes  of  the 
violence,  and  widespread  talk  of  revolution,  civil  war,  and  the  disinte- 
gration of  the  nation  as  it  descended  into  a  surreal  and  barbarous  chaos 
(see  Violence,  Vengeance,  and  Law,  ch.  2). 

These  paroxysms  did  not  deter,  and  remarkably  indeed  may  have 
done  much  to  propel,  movement  in  the  direction  of  dismantling  the 
political  structure  built  by  the  New  Order.  Even  before  it  began,  the 
post-Suharto  era  had  been  called  a  time  of  reformasi  (see  Glossary) 
by  a  broad  spectrum  of  activists,  and  the  name  stuck  despite  uncer- 
tainty over  exactly  what  it  might  mean.  Perhaps  the  greatest  surprise 
in  the  early  days  of  this  reformasi  proved  to  be  Habibie,  Suharto's 
constitutional  successor  and  by  virtually  all  sides  considered  politi- 
cally suspect,  incompetent,  or  both.  During  his  brief  interim  presi- 
dency (May  1998  to  October  1999),  however,  Habibie  oversaw  the 
start  of  fundamental  change  in  Indonesia's  political  and  economic 
structure  and  attempted  conciliatory  solutions  to  the  conflicts  in 
Papua,  Aceh,  and  most  notably  East  Timor,  to  which  he  offered  the 
option  of  voting  for  independence.  He  reduced  many  powers  of 
ABRI  (which  was  separated  from  the  police  in  April  1999  and 
became  known  again  as  the  TNI);  began  decentralizing  civilian  gov- 
ernment; and  countermanded  discriminatory  laws  aimed  at  Chinese 
Indonesians  (see  Political  Dynamics,  ch.  4). 

None  of  these  fundamental  changes  was  completed  without  diffi- 
culty. East  Timor,  for  example,  passed  through  an  agony  of  civil  con- 
flict and  military-backed  violence  after  voting  to  separate  from 
Indonesia  in  August  1999;  independence  as  Timor-Leste  finally  came 
in  May  2002  after  a  long  and  difficult  transition  under  UN  auspices. 
Genuine  reform  measures  had  been  launched,  however,  and,  for  the 
most  part,  the  nation  responded  positively  to  them.  The  scheduled 
general  elections  from  June  to  October  1999  occurred  amidst  conflict, 
but  under  the  circumstances  it  was  remarkable  that  they  could  be  held 
at  all.  In  the  end,  a  politically  intricate  but  reasonably  peaceful  transi- 
tion was  made  to  the  presidency  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama  leader  and 
prominent  intellectual  figure  Abdurrahman  Wahid  (1940-2009),  who 


86

maneuvered  to  have  his  main  opponent,  Sukarno's  daughter  Mega- 
wati Sukarnoputri  (born  1948),  selected  as  his  vice  president. 

During  the  interelection  period  1999-2004,  Indonesia  seemed  in 
danger  of  losing  its  way  as  the  pace  of  reformasi  slackened  and  new 
problems  arose.  Wahid,  known  familiarly  as  Gus  Dur,  was  the  dar- 
ling of  many  liberal  Muslims  and,  particularly,  Western  Indonesia- 
watchers,  many  of  whom  knew  him  personally  and  saw  him  as  an 
exponent  of  liberal  democracy,  pluralism,  openness,  and  informality, 
the  antithesis  of  everything  they  had  despised  about  New  Order  gov- 
ernment. To  some  degree,  he  was  all  those  things,  but  both  he  and 
those  around  him  proved  managerially  and  politically  inept,  unable 
to  satisfy  a  diverse  following.  Many  conservative  Muslims  had 
expected  him  to  further  their  agenda  of  an  Islamic  state,  and  were 
appalled  by  Wahid's  insistence  on  religious  tolerance  and  visiting 
Israel.  Military  leaders  were  shocked  to  discover  that  he  intended  to 
follow  through  on  plans  to  hold  them  accountable  for  violence  the 
armed  forces  had  sponsored  in  East  Timor,  and  they  joined  with 
some  Muslim  politicians  in  bitter  opposition  to  his  effort  to  open  the 
long-silenced  trauma  of  1965-66  to  public  scrutiny  and  reconcilia- 
tion. In  July  2001,  a  special  session  of  the  MPR  voted  Wahid  out  of 
office  and  recognized  Megawati  as  his  successor. 

This  second  interim  presidency  in  three  years  suggested  to  many 
that,  whatever  reformasi  was  going  to  amount  to  would  be  limited 
and  slow  in  coming.  Some  declared  it  dead  altogether,  for  not  only 
did  Megawati  lack  her  father's  charisma  (which  might  have  been 
harnessed  to  promote  change),  she  possessed — irony  of  ironies — 
more  of  a  New  Order  outlook  than  many  of  her  supporters  suspected, 
and  was  little  inclined  to  challenge  the  status  quo.  She  was  also 
much  influenced  by  conservative  military  leaders  who  argued  that 
revived  separatist  movements  of  the  OPM  and  GAM  could  success- 
fully be  met  with  force.  Jakarta  declared  martial  law  in  Aceh  and 
deployed  50,000  troops,  which  predictably  only  served  to  alienate 
more  Acehnese  than  ever  before.  The  economy  began  to  recover 
(with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  more  than  7  percent),  but  corruption

flourished,  and  many  of  the  financial  practices  and  business  net- 
works continued  to  operate  as  before,  at  least  in  part  because  the 
tainted  judicial  system  remained  unchanged. 

During  this  period,  however,  two  fundamental  reforms  quietly 
took  hold.  The  first  was  a  Decentralization  Law  that  went  into  effect 
in  early  January  2001.  This  sweeping  legislation  (with  some  revi- 
sions in  2004)  made  the  Indonesian  state  system  one  of  the  world's 
most  decentralized,  with  budgetary  and  most  other  bureaucratic  and 
electoral  matters  being  turned  over  to  local  authorities  down  to  the 
district  level.  This  dramatic  ^change  carried  risks,  as  it  left  plenty  of 
room  for  misuse,  but  it  represented  real  movement  toward  transpar- 
ency and  away  from  the  accumulation  of  centralized  power.  The  sec- 
ond important  reform,  a  major  overhaul  of  the  nation's  constitution 
undertaken  in  four  stages  between  1999  and  2002,  called  for,  among 
other  things,  the  direct  election  of  the  president  and  vice  president;  a 
limitation  of  the  president  to  two  terms  in  office;  free  and  secret 
elections  of  regional  legislatures  and  a  two-house  MPR  consisting 
entirely  of  elected  members;  establishment  of  the  Constitutional 
Court;  and  a  much  expanded  delineation  of  human  rights  (see  The 
Structure  of  Government,  ch.  4).  Only  slightly  more  than  10  percent 
of  the  original  constitution  of  1945,  the  cornerstone  of  New  Order 
legal  thought,  remained  unchanged.  Together,  these  developments 
laid  the  groundwork  for  a  thorough  refashioning  of  the  way  the  Indo- 
nesian state  functioned. 

One  issue  not  directly  addressed  by  the  reformasi  movement  con- 
cerned the  rise  of  Islamic  politics  and,  increasingly  since  1998,  of  the 
use  of  violence  by  extremist  Muslims,  some  of  them  seeking  to  recre- 
ate Indonesia  as  an  Islamic  state.  The  best-known  group  was  Jemaah 
Islamiyah  (Congregation  of  Islam),  one  of  whose  founders  appears  to 
have  been  the  Javanese  cleric  Abu  Bakar  Ba'asyir  (born  1938), 
believed  to  have  ties  to  Al  Qaeda  and  other  terrorist  organizations. 
Between  2000  and  2005,  members  of  Jemaah  Islamiyah  were  respon- 
sible for  a  number  of  bombings,  the  most  infamous  being  the  October 
12,  2002,  explosions  in  Bali,  which  killed  202  people  and  injured 
more  than  300,  including  many  foreign  visitors.  Attacks  in  Jakarta 
(2003,  2004,  and  2009)  and  Bali  (2005)  killed  49  people  and  wounded 
458,  mostly  Indonesians  (see  Terrorism,  ch.  5).  In  part  because  of  what 
was  perceived  as  hype  and  hatred  behind  the  American  "global  war  on 
terrorism"  after  the  September  11,  2001,  attacks  in  the  United  States, 
and  in  part  because  of  a  reluctance  to  criticize  fellow  Muslims  profess- 
ing to  act  on  behalf  of  their  religion,  most  Indonesians  initially  refused 
to  believe  that  Islamist  terror  had  come  to  their  nation  or  that  it  might 
be  of  any  genuine  political  importance.  Many  subscribed  to  fantastic 
conspiracy  theories  to  explain  events,  and  some  public  figures,  includ-

ing  Megawati's  vice  president,  Hamzah  Haz  (born  1940),  attempted  to 
make  political  use  of  such  ideas.  As  a  proliferation  of  Islamist  parties 
jostled  for  position  in  the  more  open  political  arena,  many  worried  that 
the  new  democratization  might  end  up  benefiting  precisely  those  who, 
intolerant  of  religious  diversity,  sought  to  curtail  it. 

The  complex  electoral  contest  of  2004,  in  which  more  than  145 
million  voters  cast  ballots  for  tens  of  thousands  of  local  and  national 
candidates  and  then  returned  to  the  polls  twice  more  in  the  largest 
direct  presidential  election  in  world  history,  was  widely  viewed  as  a 
critical  test  for  both  reformasi  and  the  future  of  Islamist  politics. 
Although  local  contests  generated  some  violence,  the  election  pro- 
cess itself  went  far  more  smoothly  than  generally  predicted,  and  the 
results  did  much  to  suggest  that  reformasi  had  indeed  brought  Indo- 
nesia to  the  threshold  of  a  sustainable,  moderate,  democratic  polity, 
the  world's  third  largest.  Against  all  expectations,  the  presidential 
winner,  with  61  percent  of  the  vote,  was  Susilo  Bambang  Yud- 
hoyono  (born  1949),  a  retired  general  who  abandoned  Suharto  after 
the  1998  Trisakti  University  shootings,  later  refused  then-President 
Wahid's  order  to  declare  a  state  of  emergency  in  order  to  forestall  his 
impeachment,  and  went  on  to  form  the  small,  independent  Democrat 
Party  (PD).  This  victory  was  part  of  a  pattern  suggesting  to  pollsters 
that,  given  both  chance  and  choice,  Indonesian  voters  were  more 
inclined  to  vote  individualistically  than  along  familiar  party  or  ideo- 
logical lines.  The  outcome  also  suggested  that  in  this  Muslim-major- 
ity nation,  most  voters  had  little  real  interest  in  parties  or  candidates 
that  identified  themselves  primarily  with  Islamic  aims  rather  than 
national  or  local  goals  such  as  development  and  reform.  Some  close 
observers  in  the  West,  who  only  two  years  earlier  had  seen  a  bleak 
sociopolitical  future  for  Indonesia,  now  gushed  about  the  country's 
transformation  with  the  advent  of  a  robust  democracy. 

It  soon  became  clear,  however,  that  after  the  momentous  2004  elec- 
tions, Indonesia  passed  into  a  post-New  Order,  post-reformasi  era,  the 
character  and  direction  of  which  were  still  uncertain.  On  the  one  hand, 
concern  that  the  nation  was  still  very  fragile  proved  in  many  respects 
unfounded.  The  new  administration  was  able,  with  international  assis- 
tance, to  cope  reasonably  competently  and  transparently  with  the 
December  2004  tsunami,  thought  to  be  the  most  destructive  ever 
recorded  and  responsible  in  Indonesia  alone  for  at  least  166,561 
deaths  and  203,817  displaced  persons,  mostly  in  Aceh,  as  well  as 
untold  devastation.  A  combination  of  skill  and  goodwill  also  made  it 
possible  for  Jakarta  to  turn  the  catastrophe  to  some  good  account  by 
negotiating  a  peace  settlement  with  GAM  the  next  year.  The  new  gov- 
ernment also  proved  itself  unexpectedly  determined  and  adept  in 
bringing  to  justice  those  responsible  for  various  terrorist  activities.  In

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

November  2008,  it  proceeded  with  the  execution  of  the  three  men 
responsible  for  the  2002  Bali  bombings,  who  had  been  held  since 
their  capture  and  conviction  in  2003.  The  administration  also  showed 
it  could  make  difficult  economic  decisions  when  it  announced  dra- 
matic cuts  to  subsidies  on  gasoline  and  cooking  fuel  in  order  to  save  a 
troubled  budget;  significantly,  this  move  did  not  result  in  angry  pro- 
tests and  demonstrations.  And  despite  a  much  curtailed  presidential 
authority,  far  more  circumscribed  military  powers,  and  rapid  turnover 
in  local  governance  (between  2004  and  2008,  voters  removed  nearly 
40  percent  of  all  governors,  "mayors,  and  district  heads),  Indonesians 
showed  that  they  could  function  in  a  less  authoritarian,  less  predict- 
able structure  than  New  Order  leaders  had  supposed  was  necessary. 

Disquieting  questions  remained,  on  the  other  hand,  about  the  role 
of  Islam  in  Indonesian  society.  The  opening  of  politics  in  the  post- 
New  Order  era  had,  along  with  world  developments,  served  to  inten- 
sify and  complicate  the  struggle  between  radical  conservative  Islam 
and  progressive  liberal  Islam  in  Indonesia.  This  contest  has  taken 
many  different  forms  and  has  come  to  inform  a  wide  and  varied  dis- 
course throughout  the  nation.  Radical  conservative  groups  have  pro- 
liferated. They  have  used  print  and  electronic  media  to  give  voice  to 
their  ideas  and  in  some  areas  have  been  effective  in  using  local  elec- 
tions to  get  approval  for  instituting  the  sharia  in  local  government. 
(More  than  a  dozen  provinces  are  said  to  have  considered  or  adopted 
such  laws,  but  in  many  cases  the  laws  have  either  been  quickly 
rescinded  or  gone  unenforced.)  In  a  long  debate  over  a  so-called  por- 
nography law,  proposed  in  2005  and  finally  passed  in  late  2008,  rad- 
ical conservative  Muslim  parties  and  supporting  groups  framed  their 
arguments  in  ways  to  gather  support  from  secularist  nationalist 
groups,  who  found  it  difficult  politically  not  to  support  such  legisla- 
tion— who  could  be  seen  as  being  "for"  pornography? — even  though 
it  threatened  pluralism  and  had  been  opposed  by  a  range  of  human- 
rights  and  feminist  groups. 

It  is  important  to  realize  that  this  is  not  a  contest  between  Muslims 
and  non-  or  merely  nominal  Muslims,  but  among  Muslims.  Some  rad- 
ical conservative  groups  have  gone  so  far  as  to  declare  death  fatwas 
on  their  moderate  opponents,  who  in  turn  have  publically  denounced 
such  acts  as  "stupid."  And  radical  conservative  groups  have  taken 
very  loud  public  stands  against  government  messages  about  the  plu- 
rality of  Islam  in  Indonesia  and  against  progressive  Muslim  publica- 
tions, such  as  a  Paramadina  Foundation  book  arguing  the  values  of  a 
pluralist  understanding  of  modern  Islam  (even  supporting  interfaith 
marriage  and  inheritance  rights).  What  these  disputes  will  mean  for 
the  nation  is  as  yet  far  from  obvious.

Historical  Setting 


It  can  be  argued  that  even  the  controversies  over  Islam  have  been 
carried  out  very  much  in  the  public  view  (not  possible  a  decade 
before),  and  neither  the  nation  nor  national  society  has  been  torn 
apart,  as  some  have  feared.  In  many  respects,  Indonesian  society 
appears  to  have  settled  on  new  and  calmer  middle  ground,  relatively 
comfortable  with  new  freedoms  and  also  with  the  debate  and  even 
conflicts  that  come  with  them  (see  Islam,  ch.  2).  On  the  whole,  Indo- 
nesians of  the  younger  generation  seem  more  at  ease  than  their  par- 
ents with  plurality  and  individuality,  and  less  in  need  of  old- 
fashioned  nationalism,  ideological  guidance,  or  state  leadership. 
Some  of  these  attitudes  are  reflected  in  the  enormously  popular  2005 
novel  Laskar  Pelangi  (Rainbow  Warriors)  by  Andrea  Hirata,  who 
refuses  to  reveal  his  age  but  is  a  child  of  the  New  Order  era;  a  film 
version  appeared  in  2008.  Hirata's  work  is  autobiographical  and 
traces  his  childhood  and  education  in  a  poor  Muslim  community  and 
a  run-down  Muhammadiyah  school  on  the  tin-mining  island  of  Beli- 
tung.  It  is  essentially  a  personal  success  story  of  overcoming  pov- 
erty, making  the  most  of  schooling  under  difficult  conditions,  and 
(we  learn  in  three  later  volumes)  becoming  a  modern  Indonesian 
who  is  also  a  citizen  of  the  world.  Government,  bureaucracy,  and 
hierarchy  are  of  little  relevance;  neither,  in  the  end,  are  ethnicity, 
gender,  and  religion.  What  matters  is  understanding  that  all  people 
have  talent,  and  that  individual  determination,  education,  and  the 
bonds  of  common  humanity  can  develop  it.  Anyone  can  succeed, 
and  success  is  not  necessarily  defined  by  wealth  or  power  or  social 
status.  Some  commentators  have  seen  this  novel  as  a  key  to  the  new 
values  of  the  post-Suharto,  post-reformasi  generation;  others  have 
gone  much  further,  suggesting  that  it  shows  clearly  for  the  first  time 
that  Indonesian  hopes  for  the  future  are,  in  fact,  universal  and  not 
merely  national  ones,  and  that  Indonesians,  after  65  years  of  inde- 
pendence, are  at  last  joining  the  world.

The  literature  on  Indonesian  history  is  quite  large,  and  includes 
materials  in  many  languages.  This  bibliographic  essay  mentions  only 
works  in  English.  The  most  satisfactory  summaries  of  Indonesian 
history  are  Colin  Brown's  A  Short  History  of  Indonesia:  The 
Unlikely  Nation?  and  the  short  but  sophisticated  chapter  by  Robert 
B.  Cribb,  "Nation:  Making  Indonesia."  The  basic  reference  works 
any  serious  student  of  Indonesian  history  will  find  indispensable  are 
Cribb's  and  Audrey  R.  Kahin's  Historical  Dictionary  of  Indonesia, 
Cribb's  Historical  Atlas  of  Indonesia,  and  the  relevant  portions  of 
Jan  M.  Pluvier's  Historical  Atlas  of  South-East  Asia.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  most  comprehensive  guide  to  pre-  and  proto-history  is  still 
Peter  Bellwood's  Prehistory  of  the  Indo-Malaysian  Archipelago,  but 
this  is  a  field  that  changes  very  rapidly,  and  the  best  information  is 
contained  in  articles  in  specialist  journals.  The  volume  Ancient  His- 
tory (edited  by  John  N.  Miksic)  in  the  Indonesian  Heritage  Series  is 
a  wonderful  summary  and  is  superbly  illustrated.  It  can  be  supple- 
mented with  the  more  comprehensive  and  academic  work  by  Paul 
Michel  Munoz,  Early  Kingdoms  of  the  Indonesian  Archipelago  and 
the  Malay  Peninsula. 

For  a  general  guide  to  the  period  after  1200,  the  standard  work  is 
Merle  C.  Ricklefs's  A  History  of  Modern  Indonesia  Since  c.  1200.  A 
detailed  guide  to  the  following  few  centuries  is  the  Early  Modern 
History  volume,  edited  by  Anthony  J.  S.  Reid,  in  the  Indonesian 
Heritage  Series.  Reid's  Southeast  Asia  in  the  Age  of  Commerce, 
1450-1680  and  Charting  the  Shape  of  Early  Modern  Southeast  Asia 
contain  very  helpful  information  on  Indonesia,  as  well  as  challeng- 
ing interpretations.  Merle  C.  Ricklefs's  works  on  Java  in  the  seven- 
teenth through  nineteenth  centuries,  beginning  with  War,  Culture, 
and  Economy  in  Java,  1677-1726,  set  high  standards  of  scholarship 
in  that  difficult  field. 

The  literature  on  Dutch  expansion  and  the  Netherlands  East  Indies 
is  extensive.  The  most  comprehensive  work  on  the  Cultivation  Sys- 
tem is  perhaps  Robert  E.  Elson's  Village  Java  under  the  Cultivation 
System.  The  1860  novel  Max  Havelaar:  Or  the  Coffee  Auctions  of  the 
Dutch  Trading  Company  by  Multatuli,  penname  of  Eduard  Douwes 
Dekker,  is  still  captivating  reading.  A  History  of  Modern  Indonesia  by 
Adrian  Vickers  begins  its  coverage  with  the  late  nineteenth  century, 
and  the  collection  of  papers  edited  by  Robert  B.  Cribb  in  The  Late 
Colonial  State  in  Indonesia  is  very  useful.  The  subjects  of  nationalism 
and  modernism  are  woven  together  in  Robert  E.  Elson's  valuable  con- 
sideration of  The  Idea  of  Indonesia:  A  History  and  can  also  be  studied 
through  the  lens  of  biography  in,  among  many  available  works,  John 
D.  Legge's  Sukarno:  A  Political  Biography  and  Rudolf  Mrazek's 
Sjahrir:  Politics  and  Exile  in  Indonesia.  The  periods  of  Japanese 
occupation  and  revolution  are  the  subject  of  a  great  many  publica- 
tions, but  few  attempt  a  comprehensive  view.  The  essays  by  Ken'ichi 
Goto  in  Tensions  of  Empire:  Japan  and  Southeast  Asia  in  the  Colonial 
and  Postcolonial  World  are  mostly  about  Indonesia,  and,  coupled 
with  Remco  Raben's  volume  entitled  Representing  the  Japanese 
Occupation  of  Indonesia,  are  good  places  to  begin.  Peter  Post's  The 
Encyclopedia  of  Indonesia  in  the  Pacific  War  is  a  valuable  new 
resource  on  the  World  War  II  period.  On  the  years  1945-50,  Anthony 
Reid's  brief  but  comprehensive  The  Indonesian  National  Revolution, 
1945-1950  is  still  the  best  overall  treatment.

Historical  Setting 


There  is  no  entirely  satisfactory  general  history  covering  the 
entire  post- 1945  period,  beyond  the  excellent  relevant  chapters  in 
Ricklefs  and  in  Vickers,  mentioned  above,  but  Robert  B.  Cribb  and 
Colin  Brown's  Modern  Indonesia.  A  History  Since  1945  packs  a 
great  deal  of  information  and  analysis  in  a  very  short  book,  and  The- 
odore Friend's  colorful  Indonesian  Destinies  offers  an  intimate  view. 
A  number  of  works  illuminate  aspects  of  each  of  the  political  periods 
of  Liberal  Democracy,  Guided  Democracy,  the  New  Order,  and 
reformasi,  but  none  of  these  periods  yet  has  found  a  comprehensive 
treatment. 

Scholarly  articles  in  English  on  various  aspects  of  Indonesian  history 
can  be  found  in  specialized  journals  such  as  Bijdragen  tot  Taal-,  Land-  en 
Volkenkunde  (Leiden,  Netherlands)  (http://www.kitlv-journals.nl);  Cor- 
nell University's  Indonesia  (http://cip.comell.edu/Indonesia);  Journal  of 
Southeast  Asian  Studies  (Singapore)  (http://joumals.cambridge.org/ 
action/displayJournal?jid=SEA);  and  South  East  Asia  Research  (Lon- 
don) (http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/0967-828X). 

There  are  numerous  useful  Web  sites  on  various  aspects  of  the 
Indonesian  past,  many  of  them  in  the  Dutch  and  Indonesian  lan- 
guages. A  well-known  English-language  site  offering  a  detailed,  and 
sometimes  annotated  chronology  (up  to  2004)  is  Charles  A.  Gimon's 
Sejarah  Indonesia:  An  Online  Timeline  of  Indonesian  History  (http:// 
www.gimonca.com/sejarah).  A  useful  collection  of  relevant  Web 
sites  is  maintained  by  the  International  Institute  of  Social  History

Chapter  2.  The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Papuan  pontoon  boat 


INDONESIA'S  SOCIAL  AND  GEOGRAPHIC  ENVIRONMENT  is 
one  of  the  most  complex  and  varied  in  the  world.  By  one  count,  at 
least  731  distinct  languages  and  more  than  1,100  different  dialects  are 
spoken  in  the  archipelago.  The  nation  encompasses  some  17,508 
islands;  the  landscape  ranges  from  rain  forests  and  steaming  man- 
grove swamps  to  arid  plains  and  snowcapped  mountains.  Major 
world  religions — Islam,  Christianity,  Buddhism,  and  Hinduism — are 
represented,  as  well  as  many  varieties  of  animistic  practices  and 
ancestor  worship.  Systems  of  local  political  authority  vary  from  the 
ornate  sultans'  courts  of  central  Java  to  the  egalitarian  communities 
of  hunter-gatherers  in  the  jungles  of  Kalimantan.  A  variety  of  eco- 
nomic patterns  also  can  be  found  within  Indonesia's  borders,  from 
rudimentary  slash-and-burn  agriculture  to  highly  sophisticated  com- 
puter microchip  industries.  Some  Indonesian  communities  rely  on 
traditional  feasting  systems  and  marriage  exchange  for  economic  dis- 
tribution, while  others  act  as  sophisticated  brokers  in  international 
trading  networks  operating  throughout  the  world.  Indonesians  also 
have  a  variety  of  living  arrangements.  Some  go  home  at  night  to 
extended  families  living  in  isolated  bamboo  longhouses;  others  return 
to  hamlets  of  tiny  houses  clustered  around  a  mosque;  still  others  go 
home  to  nuclear  families  in  urban  high-rise  apartment  complexes. 

There  are,  however,  striking  similarities  among  the  nation's  diverse 
groups.  Besides  citizenship  in  a  common  nation-state,  the  single  most 
unifying  cultural  characteristic  is  a  shared  linguistic  heritage.  Almost 
all  of  the  nation's  estimated  240  million  people  speak  at  least  one  of 
several  Austronesian  languages,  which,  although  often  not  mutually 
intelligible,  share  many  vocabulary  items  and  have  similar  sentence 
patterns.  Most  important,  an  estimated  83  percent  of  the  population 
can  speak  Bahasa  Indonesia  (see  Glossary),  the  official  national  lan- 
guage. Used  in  government,  schools,  print  and  electronic  media,  and 
multiethnic  cities,  this  Malay-derived  language  is  both  an  important 
unifying  symbol  and  a  vehicle  of  national  integration. 

The  national  average  population  density,  according  to  the  2000  cen- 
sus, was  109  persons  per  square  kilometer.  However,  in  2007  some  50 
percent  of  Indonesians  lived  in  cities,  defined  by  the  government's 
Central  Statistical  Office  (BPS;  for  this  and  other  acronyms,  see  table 
A)  as  areas  with  population  densities  greater  than  5,000  persons  per 
square  kilometer  or  where  fewer  than  25  percent  of  households  are 
employed  in  the  agricultural  sector.  The  percentage  of  Indonesians 
who  live  in  rural  areas,  and  who  are  closely  associated  with  agriculture,

stockbreeding,  forestry,  or  fishing,  has  been  declining  steadily.  For 
example,  about  53  percent  of  the  workforce  was  employed  in  agricul- 
ture, hunting,  forestry,  and  fishing  as  recently  as  the  mid-1980s;  by 
2005  that  figure  had  decreased  to  44  percent.  As  the  Indonesian  popu- 
lation has  grown,  become  more  educated,  and  moved  increasingly 
toward  urban  centers,  small-scale  agriculture  and  trading  have  played 
decreasing  roles  in  defining  people's  lifestyles.  The  rapid  expansion  of 
the  manufacturing,  retail,  and  service  industries  has  led  to  ways  of  liv- 
ing defined  more  by  social,  cultural,  and  economic  interests  than  by 
geographic  and  environmental  forces. 

The  mobility,  educational  achievement,  and  urbanization  of  the 
Indonesian  population  have  increased  overall  since  the  mid-1990s. 
Indonesians  have  become  increasingly  exposed  to  the  variety  of  their 
nation's  cultures  through  television,  the  Internet,  newspapers,  schools, 
and  cultural  activities.  Links  to  indigenous  geographic  regions  and 
sociocultural  heritage  have  weakened,  and  the  contexts  for  the  expres- 
sion of  those  links  have  narrowed.  Ethnicity  is  a  means  of  identifica- 
tion in  certain  situations  but  not  in  others.  For  example,  during 
Ramadan,  the  Islamic  month  of  fasting,  peasants  from  Java  might 
emphasize  their  Islamic  faith  and  affiliation,  whereas  in  other  settings 
they  emphasize  their  membership  in  the  national  state  by  attending 
school,  participating  in  family-planning  programs,  and  belonging  to 
village  cooperatives,  and  by  invoking  the  Pancasila  (five  principles; 
see  Glossary),  the  state  ideology,  as  a  moral  justification  for  personal 
and  family  choices.  In  a  similar  way,  isolated  hill  tribes  living  in  the 
interior  of  islands  such  as  Sulawesi,  Seram,  or  Timor  might  express 
devotion  to  ancestral  spirits  through  animal  sacrifice  at  home  but 
swear  loyalty  to  the  Indonesian  state  in  school  or  at  the  polls.  A  per- 
son's identity  as  an  Indonesian  is  richly  interwoven  with  familial, 
regional,  and  ethnic  heritage. 

The  Geographic  Context 

Indonesia's  variations  in  culture  have  been  shaped  by  centuries  of 
complex  interactions  with  the  physical  environment.  Although  Indo- 
nesians in  general  are  now  less  vulnerable  to  the  vicissitudes  of 
nature  as  a  result  of  improved  technology  and  social  programs,  it  is 
still  possible  to  discern  ways  in  which  cultural  variations  are  linked 
to  traditional  patterns  of  adjustment  to  their  physical  circumstances. 

Geographic  Regions 

Indonesia  is  a  vast  archipelagic  country  extending  5,120  kilome- 
ters from  east  to  west  and  1,760  kilometers  from  north  to  south. 
According  to  the  Indonesian  Naval  Hydro-Oceanographic  Office, 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  country  encompasses  17,508  islands,  about  6,000  of  which  are 
inhabited.  There  are  five  main  islands  (Sumatra,  Java,  Kalimantan, 
Sulawesi,  and  Papua),  two  major  archipelagos  (Nusa  Tenggara — 
also  known  as  the  Lesser  Sunda  Islands — and  the  Maluku  Islands — 
also  called  the  Moluccas),  and  60  smaller  archipelagos.  Three  of  the 
islands  are  shared  with  other  nations:  Kalimantan,  the  world's  third- 
largest  island — also  known  as  Borneo — is  shared  with  Malaysia  and 
Brunei;  Papua  and  Papua  Barat  provinces  (two  provinces  carved 
from  what  was  formerly  called  West  New  Guinea  or,  later,  Irian 
Jaya)  share  the  island  of  New  Guinea  with  the  nation  of  Papua  New 
Guinea;  and  the  island  of  Timor  is  divided  between  Timor-Leste 
(former  East  Timor)  and  Indonesia's  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur  Province 
(see  fig.  6).  Indonesia's  total  land  area  is  1,811,569  square  kilome- 
ters. Included  in  the  nation's  total  territory  are  another  93,000  square 
kilometers  of  inland  waters  (straits,  bays,  and  other  bodies).  These 
areas,  plus  the  seas  and  oceans  immediately  surrounding  Indonesia, 
bring  the  country's  generally  recognized  territory  (land  and  water)  to 
about  5  million  square  kilometers.  The  government,  however,  also 
claims  a  200-nautical-mile  exclusive  economic  zone  (see  Glossary) 
that  brings  the  total  to  about  7.9  million  square  kilometers. 

Geographers  have  conventionally  labeled  Sumatra,  Java  (and 
Madura,  a  small  island  near  Java's  northeast  coast),  Kalimantan,  and 
Sulawesi  collectively  as  the  Greater  Sunda  Islands.  These  islands, 
except  for  Sulawesi,  lie  on  the  Sunda  Shelf,  an  extension  of  the 
Malay  Peninsula  and  the  Southeast  Asian  mainland.  Far  to  the  east 
are  Papua  and  Papua  Barat  provinces,  which  take  up  the  western  half 
of  the  world's  second-largest  island,  New  Guinea,  which  lies  on  the 
Sahul  Shelf.  Sea  depths  on  the  Sunda  and  Sahul  shelves  average  200 
meters  or  less.  Between  these  two  shelves  lie  Sulawesi,  Nusa  Teng- 
gara, and  the  Maluku  Islands,  whose  adjacent  seas  are  4,500  meters 
deep  in  some  places.  The  term  Outer  Islands  (see  Glossary)  is  used 
inconsistently  by  various  writers  but  is  usually  taken  to  mean  those 
islands  other  than  Java,  Bali,  and  Madura. 

Volcanoes  and  Earthquakes 

The  islands  that  make  up  Indonesia  are  highly  unstable  tectonically, 
and  although  the  resultant  volcanic  ash  has  provided  the  basis  for  fer- 
tile soils,  it  makes  agricultural  conditions  unpredictable  in  some  areas. 
The  nation  has  numerous  mountains  and  some  400  volcanoes,  about 
25  percent  of  which  are  active.  Well-known  examples  are  Mount  Mer- 
api  (Gunung  Merapi),  in  Jawa  Tengah  Province,  which  last  erupted  in 

2007,  and  Soputan,  in  Sulawesi  Utara  Province,  which  last  erupted  in 

2008.  Between  2000  and  2009  alone,  110  new  or  continuous  volcanic

eruptions  were  recorded  in  Indonesia,  mostly  in  Java.  The  most  vio- 
lent geologic  events  in  modern  times  have  occurred  in  Indonesia:  In 
1 8 1 5  the  explosion  of  Mount  Tambora  (Gunung  Tambora),  a  massive 
volcano  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  Province  on  the  island  of  Sumbawa, 
reportedly  killed  an  estimated  60,000  people.  It  last  erupted  in  1967. 
Krakatau,  a  volcano  situated  on  an  island  between  Java  and  Sumatra, 
erupted  in  1883,  and  more  than  36,000  died  in  the  resulting  tsunamis, 
which  were  felt  as  far  away  as  the  Arabian  Peninsula,  and  changes  in 
the  water  level  were  reported  as  far  away  as  Wales.  Krakatau  is  still 
active,  having  erupted  as  recently  as  March  2009.  The  Lumpur  Sido- 
arjo  (Lusi)  mud  volcano  in  Jawa  Timur  Province,  which  began  in  late 
May  2006  coincident  with  natural  gas  exploration  drilling  and,  as 
some  believe,  an  offshore  earthquake,  is  an  eruption  of  hydrogen  sul- 
phide gas  and  hot  mud  rather  than  a  traditional  volcano  with  its  explo- 
sive ejections  and  flows  of  lava. 

Earthquakes  also  frequently  shake  Indonesia.  Thirty-eight  major 
earthquakes,  measuring  between  6.5  and  9.1  magnitude — 26  of  them 
greater  than  7.0 — hit  throughout  most  of  the  archipelago  between 
2000  and  2009.  On  the  morning  of  December  26,  2004,  an  offshore 
earthquake  registering  9.1  magnitude  created  a  massive  tsunami  that 
hit  the  northwestern  coast  of  Sumatra,  primarily  the  Special  Region  of 
Aceh  (called  Nanggroe  Aceh  Darussalam,  1999-2009),  killing 
166,561  people  and  displacing  another  203,817.  Other  tsunamis 
caused  by  this  earthquake  also  devastated  coastal  and  island  areas  of 
the  Indian  Ocean  as  far  west  as  the  east  coast  of  Africa  and  as  far 
north  as  Burma.  Overall,  the  earthquake  and  tsunamis  killed  more 
than  227,898  persons  and  displaced  more  than  1.7  million  in  Indone- 
sia and  13  other  countries.  On  March  28,  2005,  another  devastating 
earthquake,  registering  a  magnitude  of  8.6,  struck  the  island  of  Nias 
and  nearby  islands  in  Sumatera  Utara  Province.  It  killed  more  than 
1,300  persons  and  displaced  40,000.  More  than  5,700  people  were 
killed,  38,000  injured,  and  600,000  left  homeless  when  a  6.3  earth- 
quake hit  offshore  of  the  coast  of  the  Special  Region  of  Yogyakarta, 
on  May  27,  2006.  Then,  on  September  2,  2009,  a  7.0  magnitude  earth- 
quake struck  Jawa  Barat  Province,  causing  severe  damage  and  72 
deaths,  and  was  felt  widely  on  Java.  Several  weeks  later,  on  Septem- 
ber 30,  2009,  a  7.6  magnitude  earthquake  hit  Padang,  Sumatera  Barat 
Province,  and  was  felt  throughout  Sumatra  and  Java,  as  well  as  in 
Malaysia,  Singapore,  and  Thailand.  It  caused  at  least  1,100  deaths, 
more  than  2,180  were  injured,  and  thousands  were  missing  amid  the 
severe  structural  damage.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 
Climate 

The  main  variable  in  Indonesia's  climate  is  not  temperature  or  air 
pressure  but  rainfall.  The  almost  uniformly  warm  waters  that  make 
up  81  percent  of  Indonesia's  area  ensure  that  temperatures  on  land 
remain  fairly  constant.  Traversed  by  the  equator,  the  archipelago  is 
almost  entirely  tropical  in  climate.  Temperatures  average  28°  C  on 
the  coastal  plains,  26°  C  in  inland  and  mountain  areas,  and  23°  C  in 
the  higher  mountain  regions.  Winds  are  moderate  and  generally  pre- 
dictable; monsoons  usually  blow  in  from  the  south  and  east  between 
June  and  September  and  from  the  northwest  between  December  and 
March.  Typhoons  and  other  large  storms  pose  little  hazard  to  mari- 
ners in  Indonesia's  waters;  the  primary  danger  comes  from  swift  cur- 
rents in  channels  such  as  the  Lombok,  Sape,  and  Sunda  straits. 

Extreme  variations  in  rainfall  are  linked  with  the  monsoons. 
There  is  a  dry  season  (June  to  September),  influenced  by  the  Austra- 
lian continental  air  masses,  and  a  rainy  season  (December  to  March) 
that  is  influenced  by  air  masses  from  mainland  Asia  and  the  Pacific 
Ocean.  Local  conditions  in  Indonesia,  however,  can  greatly  modify 
these  patterns,  especially  in  the  central  islands  of  the  Maluku  group. 
This  oscillating  seasonal  pattern  of  wind  and  rain  is  related  to  Indo- 
nesia's geographic  location  as  an  archipelago  between  two  conti- 
nents and  astride  the  equator.  During  the  dry  monsoon,  high  pressure 
over  the  Australian  deserts  moves  winds  from  Australia  toward  the 
northwest.  As  the  winds  reach  the  equator,  the  Earth's  rotation 
causes  them  to  veer  off  their  original  course  in  a  northeasterly  direc- 
tion toward  the  Southeast  Asian  mainland.  During  the  wet  monsoon, 
a  corresponding  high-pressure  system  over  the  Asian  mainland 
causes  the  pattern  to  reverse.  The  resultant  monsoon  is  augmented 
by  humid  breezes  from  the  Indian  Ocean,  producing  significant 
amounts  of  rain  throughout  many  parts  of  the  archipelago. 

Prevailing  wind  patterns  interact  with  local  topographic  condi- 
tions to  produce  significant  variations  in  rainfall  throughout  the 
archipelago.  In  general,  the  western  and  northern  parts  of  Indonesia 
experience  the  most  precipitation  because  the  northward-  and  west- 
ward-moving monsoon  clouds  are  heavy  with  moisture  by  the  time 
they  reach  these  more  distant  regions.  The  average  annual  rainfall 
for  Indonesia  is  around  3,175  millimeters.  Western  Sumatra,  Java, 
Bali,  and  the  interiors  of  Kalimantan,  Sulawesi,  and  Papua  are  the 
most  consistently  damp  regions  of  Indonesia,  with  rainfall  measur- 
ing more  than  2,000  millimeters  per  year.  In  part,  this  moisture  orig- 
inates on  certain  high  mountain  peaks  that,  because  of  their  location, 
trap  damp  air  and  experience  more  than  6,000  millimeters  of  rain  a 
year.  The  city  of  Bogor,  near  Jakarta,  has  a  high  rainfall  rate  of  3,500 


102

to  4,000  millimeters  annually.  On  the  other  hand,  the  areas  closest  to 
Australia — including  Nusa  Tenggara  and  the  eastern  tip  of  Java — 
tend  to  be  dry,  with  some  areas  experiencing  less  than  1,000  milli- 
meters of  rainfall  per  year.  Some  of  the  islands  of  southern  Maluku 
experience  highly  unpredictable  rainfall  patterns,  depending  on  local 
wind  currents. 

The  air  temperature  changes  little  from  season  to  season  or  from 
one  region  to  the  next,  but  cooler  temperatures  prevail  at  higher  eleva- 
tions. In  general,  temperatures  drop  approximately  1  °  C  per  90  meters 
of  increase  in  elevation  from  sea  level;  night  frosts  occur  in  some  high 
interior  mountain  regions.  The  highest  mountain  ranges  in  Papua  are 
permanently  capped  with  snow. 

Located  on  the  equator,  the  archipelago  experiences  relatively  lit- 
tle change  in  the  length  of  daylight  hours  from  one  season  to  the 
next;  the  difference  between  the  longest  day  of  the  year  and  the 
shortest  is  only  48  minutes.  The  archipelago  stretches  across  three 
time  zones:  Western  Indonesian  Time — seven  hours  in  advance  of 
Greenwich  Mean  Time  (GMT) — applies  to  Sumatra,  Java,  and  west 
and  central  Kalimantan;  Central  Indonesian  Time — eight  hours 
ahead  of  GMT — is  observed  in  Bali,  Nusa  Tenggara,  south  and  east

Kalimantan,  and  Sulawesi;  clocks  are  set  to  Eastern  Indonesian 
Time — nine  hours  ahead  of  GMT — in  the  Malukus  and  Papua.  The 
boundary  between  the  western  and  central  time  zones — established 
in  1988 — is  a  line  running  north  between  Java  and  Bali  through  the 
center  of  Kalimantan.  The  border  between  the  central  and  eastern 
time  zones  runs  north  from  the  eastern  tip  of  Timor  to  the  eastern  tip 
of  Sulawesi.  Indonesia  does  not  operate  daylight-saving  time  in  the 
summer. 

Environmental  Concerns 

Centuries-old  patterns  of  resource  exploitation  in  Indonesia  began 
to  change  very  rapidly  in  the  late  twentieth  and  early  twenty-frrst 
centuries.  The  rice-growing  peasantry  is  shrinking  as  a  result  of 
mechanization,  fertilizer  use,  and  intensification  of  agriculture;  the 
coastal  commercial  sector  has  been  transformed  by  overfishing  and 
new  technology  for  interisland  commerce;  and  traditional  swidden 
farming  communities  of  the  upland  forest  have  been  increasingly 
crowded  out  by  industrial  logging. 

The  cumulative  effects  of  rising  population  density,  urbanization, 
agricultural  intensification,  resource  extraction,  and  manufacturing 
have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  Indonesian  environment  in 
recent  decades.  Home  to  the  world's  largest  reef  system,  one  of  its 
largest  expanses  of  rain  forest,  and  some  of  its  richest  areas  of  bio- 
diversity, Indonesia  is  now  experiencing  serious  environmental  dete- 
rioration. Air  pollution,  caused  by  rapidly  rising  levels  of  motor- 
vehicle  emissions  (90  percent  of  vehicles  still  use  leaded  fuel)  and 
by  forest  fires  linked  to  palm-oil  plantation  development,  have  given 
rise  to  respiratory  problems  that  have  become  the  country's  sixth 
most  common  cause  of  death.  Forest  fires  in  Kalimantan  during 
1997-98  produced  a  thick,  smoky  haze  that  covered  much  of  South- 
east Asia,  resulting  in  closed  schools  and  businesses  as  well  as 
deaths  and  illnesses  related  to  respiratory  disorders.  The  fires  also 
drew  worldwide  attention  to  the  uncertain  future  of  the  region's  for- 
est resources. 

Indonesia  has  some  of  the  worst  water  pollution  in  Asia.  The 
shortage  of  sewerage  facilities  is  an  especially  serious  problem.  For 
example,  because  less  than  3  percent  of  Jakarta's  population  is  con- 
nected to  a  sewerage  system,  the  city's  waste  is  typically  discharged 
either  into  private  septic  tanks  or  directly  into  rivers  or  canals.  Sew- 
age disposal  into  such  bodies  of  water  is  linked  in  particular  with 
repeated  epidemics  of  gastrointestinal  infection.  In  rural  areas,  run- 
off from  increased  use  of  pesticides  and  fertilizers  has  resulted  in 
raised  levels  of  toxicity  in  the  water  supply,  excessive  accumulation 


104

of  algae  in  riverbeds,  and  the  consequent  destruction  of  marine  life. 
The  coastal  commercial  sector  suffers  from  environmental  pressures 
originating  in  the  highland  interiors  of  the  islands.  Soil  erosion  from 
upland  deforestation  exacerbates  the  problem  of  silting  downstream 
and  into  the  sea.  Silt  deposits  cover  and  kill  once-lively  coral  reefs, 
creating  mangrove  thickets  and  making  harbor  access  increasingly 
difficult,  if  not  impossible,  without  massive  and  expensive  dredging 
operations. 

National  Territory:  Rights,  Responsibilities,  and 
Challenges 

The  legal  rights  to,  and  responsibility  for,  Indonesia's  territorial 
environment  are  a  matter  of  controversy.  Among  the  continuing  con- 
cerns are  the  exact  boundaries  between  Indonesia  and  Timor-Leste; 
another  issue  of  concern  between  the  two  states  is  sovereignty  over  a 
tiny  uninhabited  island  off  the  coast  of  Timor  that  is  called  Pulau 
Batek  by  Indonesia  but  known  locally  as  Fatu  Sinai.  Differences 
over  the  precise  maritime  boundaries  between  Australia  and  Indone- 
sia in  the  Timor  Gap  remain  an  area  in  need  of  reconciliation.  In 
another  dispute,  the  International  Court  of  Justice  ruled  in  favor  of 
Malaysia  in  2002  regarding  jurisdiction  over  the  Sipadan  and  Ligitan 
islands  (off  northeastern  Kalimantan).  However,  Indonesia  continues 
to  assert  a  claim  to  the  outer  islands  of  the  Ligitan  group  and  has 
established  a  presence  on  them.  In  2005  tensions  flared  again 
between  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  concerning  Ambalat  Island,  located 
in  the  Sulawesi  Sea  (Celebes  Sea)  on  the  boundary  between  the  two 
states,  off  the  northeast  corner  of  Kalimantan  Timur  Province.  Bas- 
ing its  claim  on  a  doctrine  of  the  political  and  security  unity  of  archi- 
pelagic land  and  waters  (wawasan  nusantara),  the  Indonesian 
government  has  asserted  its  rights  to  marine  and  geologic  resources 
within  a  coastal  zone  of  200  nautical  miles.  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and 
Singapore  each  consider  the  Strait  of  Malacca  (Selat  Malaka  in 
Bahasa  Indonesia),  one  of  the  most  heavily  traveled  sea-lanes  in  the 
world,  to  be  their  primary  responsibility.  At  a  conference  in  Singa- 
pore in  2004,  the  United  States  recognized  the  right  of  the  three 
countries  to  organize  security  as  they  saw  fit,  while  at  the  same  time 
offering  assistance  for  their  efforts. 

Since  the  late  1990s,  Indonesia  has  experienced  major  challenges  to 
its  territorial  integrity.  The  most  profound  resulted  from  a  United 
Nations  (UN)-monitored  referendum  in  August  1999  in  East  Timor  on 
whether  to  accept  special  autonomy  within  Indonesia  or  to  separate 
from  Indonesia  and  declare  independence.  After  78.5  percent  of  East 
Timorese  voted  for  independence,  pro-Indonesia  and  pro-independence 


105

forces  fought  each  other,  and  thousands  died  or  fled  to  West  Timor 
(Nusa  Tenggara  Timur  Province)  to  avoid  the  fighting.  The  violence 
began  shortly  after  President  Bacharuddin  J.  (B.J.)  Habibie  announced 
the  referendum  and  continued  until  well  after  the  vote.  On  October  25, 
1999,  the  UN  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET) 
was  established,  and  on  May  20,  2002,  East  Timor,  as  the  Democratic 
Republic  of  Timor-Leste,  became  fully  independent  of  Indonesia.  Most 
of  the  estimated  200,000  refugees  who  went  to  West  Timor  had 
returned  by  2003  (see  Relations  with  Neighboring  Nations,  ch.  4;  East 
Timor,  ch.  5). 

Two  other  regional  struggles  in  recent  times  were  in  the  Special 
Region  of  Aceh,  in  northwestern  Sumatra,  and  in  Papua.  In  Aceh, 
the  long-standing  conflict  between  the  Free  Aceh  Movement 
(GAM — see  Glossary)  and  the  Indonesian  military  intensified  into 
an  open  secessionist  effort.  The  struggle  escalated  in  1998,  but  two 
years  later  secret  negotiations  held  in  Geneva  led  to  a  Cessation  of 
Hostilities  Agreement  signed  on  December  9,  2002. 

The  parties  had  agreed  to  a  dialogue  leading  to  democratic  elec- 
tions and  a  cessation  of  hostilities.  Within  six  months,  however,  the 
agreement  had  broken  down,  and  martial  law  was  declared  in  the 
province  until  May  2004.  Following  the  December  2004  earthquake 
and  tsunami,  a  much  more  comprehensive  peace  agreement,  brokered 
by  former  Finnish  president  Martti  Ahtisaari,  was  officially  signed  in 
Helsinki  on  August  15,  2005,  by  chief  Indonesian  negotiator  Hamid 
Awaluddin  and  GAM  leader  Malik  Mahmud.  The  Indonesian  govern- 
ment agreed  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  Aceh-based  political 
parties  and  to  allow  70  percent  of  the  income  from  local  natural 
resources  to  stay  within  Aceh.  On  December  27,  2005,  GAM  leaders 
announced  that  they  had  disbanded  their  military  wing  and  GAM 
itself  was  dissolved  the  next  month  (see  Separatist  Rebellions,  ch.  5). 

Another  important  challenge  to  Indonesia's  sovereignty  comes 
from  the  Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM).  After  years  of  sabotage, 
secret  meetings,  and  public  demonstrations,  OPM  gained  consider- 
able international  attention  in  January  1996  when  members  of  the 
group  kidnapped  14  members  of  a  multinational  World  Wildlife 
Fund  for  Nature  scientific  expedition.  All  except  two  hostages  were 
freed  following  negotiations;  later  a  rescue  operation  was  conducted 
in  which  six  OPM  members  and  the  two  remaining  Indonesian  hos- 
tages were  killed.  Although  in  2001  local  leaders  were  granted  more 
financial  and  political  autonomy  and  had  been  permitted  a  year  ear- 
lier to  change  the  name  of  their  province  from  Irian  Jaya  to  the 
locally  more  acceptable  Papua,  tension  persists.  (In  2003  Papua  was 
subdivided  into  Papua  and  Irian  Jaya  Barat  provinces;  the  latter  was 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


renamed  Papua  Barat  in  2007.)  Amnesty  International  reported 
grave  concern  about  acts  of  torture  and  prisoner  abuse  in  2000  by  the 
Indonesian  military.  Demonstrations  for  Papuan  independence  inten- 
sified in  2006  in  the  wake  of  revelations  of  pollution  caused  by  the 
Grasberg  mine,  a  source  of  copper,  gold,  and  silver  operated  by 
Phoenix,  Arizona-based  Freeport-McMoRan  Copper  and  Gold.  In 
2008  Indonesian  police  arrested  separatist  leader  Buchtar  Tabuni  as 
he  was  about  to  attend  a  massive  rally  in  Jayapura,  the  capital  of 
Papua,  to  show  support  for  an  international  legislative  caucus  for 
Papua  Barat. 

Even  as  Indonesia  defended  its  claims  to  various  territories,  inter- 
national environmental  groups  were  pressing  Jakarta  to  accept  envi- 
ronmental responsibility  for  those  territories.  Indonesia  was  encour- 
aged to  monitor  pollution  in  its  national  territorial  waters  and  to  take 
legal  action  to  prevent  the  destruction  of  its  rain  forests.  Since  the  late 
1960s,  the  government  has  addressed  increasing  environmental  prob- 
lems by  establishing  resource-management  programs,  conducting 
environmental-impact  analyses,  developing  better  policy  enforce- 
ment, and  enacting  appropriate  laws  to  give  government  officials 
proper  authority.  Despite  these  efforts,  corruption,  overlapping  com- 
petencies among  government  departments,  and  legal  uncertainties 
about  departmental  jurisdictions  have  slowed  progress  against  envi- 
ronmental degradation. 

Emerging  Dynamics  of  Indonesian  Communities 
Population 

Indonesia's  population  was  estimated  by  U.S.  government  sources 
at  240,271,522  in  July  2009.  (The  next  Indonesian  census  was  sched- 
uled for  2010.)  This  marked  an  increase  of  37.6  million  since  2000. 
The  annual  growth  rate  had  changed  slightly,  from  1.3  percent  in 
2000  to  an  estimated  1 . 1  percent  in  2009,  with  a  birthrate  estimated  at 
18.8  per  1,000  population.  Life  expectancy  at  birth  for  the  total  popu- 
lation stood  at  an  estimated  70.8  years  (versus  67.9  years  in  2000), 
with  males  projected  to  live  68.3  years  and  females  73.4  years.  Fertil- 
ity rates  for  women,  based  on  births  per  woman,  decreased  slightly, 
from  2.6  in  2000  to  an  estimated  2.3  in  2009,  and  the  infant  mortality 
rate  improved  from  40.9  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  in  2000  to  an 
estimated  29.9  deaths  per  1,000  in  2009.  The  overall  death  rate  was 
estimated  in  2009  at  6.2  deaths  per  1 ,000  of  the  population. 

Indonesia  is  a  young  nation.  In  2008  it  was  estimated  that  the 
median  age  was  27.6  years  for  the  total  population  (males,  27.1; 
females,  28.1).  The  overall  age  structure  was  such  that  28  percent  of

the  population  was  age  14  or  younger,  66  percent  was  15-64  years 
old,  and  6  percent  was  65  or  older.  Based  on  estimates  for  2009,  Indo- 
nesians aged  nine  or  younger  represent  the  largest  age  cohort,  totaling 
some  44.9  million,  or  nearly  19  percent  of  the  population  (see  fig.  7). 
Indonesia's  gender  ratio  is  fairly  balanced,  and  comparable  to  that  of 
its  regional  neighbors:  the  2009  estimate  was  1.05  males  born  for 
every  female  born,  the  same  as  for  Australia,  Brunei,  Papua  New 
Guinea,  the  Philippines,  and  Timor-Leste.  Malaysia's  gender  ratio 
stood  at  1.07:1  and  Singapore's  at  1.08:1. 

Family 

The  structure,  size,  and  function  of  the  Indonesian  family  exhibit 
considerable  variation  in  the  country's  hundreds  of  different  ethno- 
linguistic  groups.  Enshrined  in  official  rhetoric  and  documents  as  a 
model  for  the  nation  as  a  whole,  the  family  is  regarded  as  the  foun- 
dation of  morality,  justice,  and  duty  concerning  public  behavior. 
Although  Indonesians  in  different  parts  of  the  archipelago  have  dif- 
ferent traditional  notions  about  inheritance,  marriage,  and  filial 
rights  and  responsibilities,  certain  commonalities  are  beginning  to 
emerge,  in  part  as  a  result  of  the  influence  of  national  laws,  institu- 
tions, and  policies,  as  well  as  the  increasing  integration  of  the  popu- 
lation into  a  national  economy. 

One  of  the  most  striking  and  far-reaching  changes  since  the  mid- 
1970s  has  been  the  continued  decline  in  fertility.  As  a  result  of 
improved  education,  an  effective  family-planning  program,  and 
reduced  child  mortality,  the  average  number  of  children  born  per 
Indonesian  woman  has  steadily  declined,  from  approximately  5.0  in 
1970  to  an  estimated  2.3  in  2009.  The  decline  has  been  steepest  in 
Java  and  Bali.  Despite  the  reduction  in  family  size,  the  archipelago  is 
increasingly  overcrowded,  with  an  estimated  population  density  of 
131  persons  per  square  kilometer  in  2009  (compared  with  33.8  per 
square  kilometer  in  the  United  States).  In  Java,  Madura,  and  Bali, 
population  densities  are  more  than  900  per  square  kilometer. 

Since  the  early  1990s,  Indonesian  women  have  tended  to  bear 
fewer  children  as  infant  mortality  has  decreased.  In  1991  the  esti- 
mated infant  mortality  rate  was  59  deaths  per  1,000  live  births.  By 
1995  that  figure  had  declined  to  48  deaths;  it  then  dipped  to  40.9  by 
2000.  In  2009  the  infant  mortality  rate  was  estimated  at  29.9  deaths 
per  1,000  live  births.  Strikingly,  even  as  the  number  of  births  per 
woman  has  declined  in  Indonesia,  there  has  been  no  evidence  of  a 
preference  for  sons  in  the  number  of  children  born  or  who  survive  as 
infants.  Another  factor  influencing  Indonesian  families  is  a  general 
trend  toward  equality  in  inheritance  patterns  and  allocation  of  family 


109

resources.  The  gap  between  the  amounts  inherited  by  sons  and 
daughters  appears  to  have  shrunk  over  the  course  of  the  1980s  and 
1990s,  and  by  2009  it  had  probably  nearly  closed. 

The  mobility  of  working-age  adults  has  increased  greatly,  meaning 
that  households  have  become  more  dynamic  in  the  early  twenty-first 
century.  The  structure  and  size  of  households  fluctuate  more  rapidly 
than  in  the  past.  This  trend  is  both  a  cause  and  a  consequence  of  the 
economic,  social,  and  demographic  changes  that  have  occurred,  as  well 
as  the  result  of  transportation  improvements  (see  Migration,  this  ch.). 

Despite  these  forces  of  rapid  change,  Indonesian  marriages  con- 
tinue to  exhibit  a  typical  pattern  in  which  wives  exert  control  over 
household  finances  and  overall  management  of  children  and  house- 
hold affairs  while  husbands  and  unmarried  young  adults  are  responsi- 
ble for  discretionary  spending  and  ties  to  the  larger  community. 
Polygamy  is  permitted  but  relatively  rare.  The  law  states  that  men  and 
women  are  equal,  and  that  both  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the 
home  and  caring  for  the  children.  The  rate  of  participation  of  women 
in  the  workforce  has  remained  more  or  less  stable,  and,  overall,  Indo- 
nesian marriages  have  experienced  a  decline  in  the  divorce  rate  to 
less  than  40  percent.  This  contrasts  with  the  1960s,  when  the  rate 
peaked  at  nearly  60  percent.  The  reasons  for  this  decline  are  contro- 
versial, but  financial,  political,  and  social  insecurity,  combined  with 
growing  religious  conservatism,  may  be  factors  in  keeping  marriages 
together.  The  actual  divorce  process  exhibits  considerable  variation  in 
different  parts  of  the  archipelago,  but  in  general  a  divorce  is  relatively 
easy  to  obtain  in  Islamic  courts  by  either  a  man  or  a  woman.  Judicial 
divorces  are  harder  to  get. 

National,  Religious,  and  Local  Authority 

Most  Indonesians  have  a  strong  sense  of  citizenship  in  the  larger 
Indonesian  state  and  its  various  levels  of  government  in  addition  to 
feeling  attached  to  their  family  and  household.  Three  generations  of 
schoolchildren  have  worn  similar  uniforms,  sung  common  songs, 
learned  a  common  language,  and  recited  similar  facts  of  history,  civ- 
ics, and  the  Pancasila  ideology.  The  red  and  white  Indonesian  flag  is  a 
common  sight  throughout  the  archipelago.  Uniformed  state  employ- 
ees and  ordinary  citizens  alike  have  all  grown  accustomed  to  carrying 
their  kartu  tanda  penduduk,  or  national  identification  card. 

In  1998,  however,  after  nearly  32  years  of  gradual  centralization  of 
power  and  authority  under  Suharto  (1967-98),  the  relationship  of 
ordinary  Indonesians  to  their  vast  nation-state  began  to  change  rapidly 
(see  The  Political  Process,  ch.  4).  One  of  the  most  noticeable  changes 
was  a  trend  toward  challenging  central  authority  occurring  at  the  same 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


time  as  a  move  toward  decentralization.  Assertions  of  local  control 
and  authority  became  more  frequent  in  the  early  twenty- first  century. 
In  some  cases,  such  assertions  took  the  form  of  vigilante  violence  and 
protests,  as  local  citizens  bypassed  the  courts  and  took  the  search  for 
justice  into  their  own  hands.  As  protests  and  unrest  increased,  citizens 
began  monitoring  calls  for  change  (generally  dubbed  reformasi — see 
Glossary)  in  newly  uncensored  newspapers  and  Internet  sources;  print 
circulation  and  Internet  subscriptions  both  increased  rapidly. 

These  challenges  often  took  the  form  of  assertions  of  religious 
rather  than  secular  authority,  as  the  leadership  of  Islamic  groups,  long 
suppressed  during  the  New  Order  government  of  Suharto,  began  to 
find  its  voice.  One  striking  trend  was  visible  in  Java  among  young 
women,  who,  in  increasing  numbers,  began  to  wear  the  jilbab,  the  tra- 
ditional Islamic  women's  head  covering.  Anthropologist  Suzanne 
Brenner  has  argued,  based  on  extensive  interviews  with  Javanese 
women,  that  this  was  less  a  statement  of  submission  to  an  ideology  of 
male-dominated  tradition  than  an  assertion  of  independence  from  a 
perceived  status  quo  of  secular  authoritarianism.  Young  women,  in 
other  words,  were  employing  the  veil  or  head  covering  as  a  way  of 
making  a  statement  about  their  feelings  toward  what  they  regarded  as 
the  moral  laxity  and  corruption  of  the  state,  and  of  society  more  gener- 
ally. It  did  not  necessarily  signal  a  stance  in  favor  of  an  Islamic  state. 

Urbanization  and  Decentralization 

One  of  the  most  significant  trends  in  Indonesia  since  the  1 970s  has 
been  toward  urbanization.  The  segment  of  the  population  living  in 
urban  areas  grew  from  17  percent  in  1971,  to  31  percent  in  1990,  and 
to  46  percent  in  2003.  In  2006  Indonesia's  Urban  and  Regional  Devel- 
opment Institute  projected  that  the  nation's  urban  population  could 
reach  more  than  50  percent  by  2010  and  60  percent  by  2025.  Surveys 
showed  that  the  movement  toward  urban  areas,  particularly  those  in 
Jawa  Barat  Province,  southwestern  Sulawesi,  and  Kalimantan,  among 
other  areas,  stemmed  not  from  the  innate  lure  of  the  cities  but  from 
the  lack  of  employment  in  the  countryside.  Migrants  seemed  to  view 
the  pollution,  crime,  anonymity,  and  grinding  poverty  of  the  city  as 
short-term  discomforts  that  would  eventually  give  way  to  a  better  life. 
For  high  school  and  college  graduates  with  no  prospects  for  employ- 
ment in  the  rural  areas,  this  may  in  fact  have  been  a  correct  assump- 
tion. But  for  those  migrants  without  capital  or  qualifications,  the  main 
hope  for  employment  was  in  the  so-called  informal  sector,  which 
offered  work  such  as  street  vending,  scavenging,  and  short-term  day 
labor  (see  Employment  and  Income,  ch.  3).  Many  migrants  also  culti- 
vated tiny  but  nutritionally  important  gardens.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Much  urban  growth  has  been  in  mid-sized  cities.  Jakarta's  popula- 
tion (8.5  million,  with  a  population  density  of  nearly  12,900  persons 
per  square  kilometer  in  2009)  has  experienced  a  rate  of  increase  of 
about  1  percent  a  year,  but  there  were  signs  of  decentralizing  trends  in 
the  early  twenty-first  century.  For  example,  much  growth  has  occurred 
in  the  greater  Jakarta  metropolitan  area,  known  as  Jabodetabek  (for 
Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi),  home  to  an  estimated 
24.3  million  in  2007,  rather  than  in  Jakarta  proper.  While  the  capital 
enjoyed  a  disproportionate  amount  of  the  nation's  resources  in  tech- 
nology, health  care,  wealth,  and  political  power  during  the  Suharto 
era,  after  1998  provincial  governments  began  to  demand  a  larger 
share.  On  January  1,  2001,  a  rapid  decentralization  program  began 
that  placed  more  authority  at  the  level  of  the  regency  (kabupaten,  a 
subprovincial  but  nonmunicipal  unit  of  government)  and  municipality 
(kota)  (see  Local  Government,  ch.  4).  This  process  reportedly  was 
going  well  in  the  mid-2000s. 

The  transformation  of  a  well-established  pattern  of  urbanization 
may  have  been  possible  because,  as  anthropologist  Pauline  D.  Milone 
observed  in  the  mid-1960s,  Jakarta  has  never  been  a  true  primate  city 
in  terms  of  being  the  only  center  for  economic,  political,  administra- 
tive, higher  education,  and  technical  functions  in  the  way  that,  for 
example,  Bangkok  has  been  for  Thailand.  In  Java,  Surabaya  has 
always  been  a  major  import-export  center  and  has  long  been  home  to 
an  important  naval  station,  and  Bandung  has  been  a  center  for  trans- 
portation, higher  education,  and  industry.  Nonetheless,  in  terms  of 
population  growth  and  as  a  symbol  of  the  centralization  of  power  in 
the  nation,  Jakarta  has  grown  steadily  in  size  and  importance. 

Migration 

Indonesians,  particularly  Javanese,  are  sometimes  stereotyped  as 
highly  immobile,  rarely  venturing  beyond  the  confines  of  their  vil- 
lage environment,  but  this  image  may  be  due  to  a  lack  of  clear  data 
and  an  extraordinarily  complex  pattern  of  movement  in  the  popula- 
tion. By  the  early  1990s,  out-migration  had  become  a  common 
response  to  overcrowded  conditions  caused  by  population  growth. 
Some  of  these  resettlements  resulted  in  conflicts  with  the  indigenous 
populations,  and  by  the  late  1990s,  many  transmigrants  were  fleeing 
conflicts  in  Aceh,  Kalimantan,  Maluku,  Sulawesi,  and  Timor.  As  a 
result,  by  2000  the  government's  long-standing  Transmigration  Pro- 
gram (see  Glossary)  was  discontinued. 

Many  communities,  particularly  in  Sumatra,  have  a  long  tradition 
of  sending  young  adult  males  on  merantau  (cyclical  out-migration) 
as  a  means  for  them  to  gain  experience  and  income  and  reduce 


112 


household  expenses.  Since  the  1970s,  however,  interprovincial 
migration  has  increased  dramatically  for  all  regions.  In  addition,  the 
financial  crisis  of  1997-98  resulted  in  a  major  increase  in  migration 
overseas  in  search  of  work,  and  the  violence  in  Aceh,  Kalimantan, 
Maluku,  Sulawesi,  and  Timor  has  resulted  in  some  1.2  million  inter- 
nally displaced  persons,  about  half  of  whom  are  living  in  refugee 
camps.  According  to  the  2000  census,  some  7.1  million  of  all  Indo- 
nesian males  living  in  urban  areas  (16.6  percent  of  this  population 
category)  were  migrants.  Among  individual  localities,  Jakarta  led 
with  42.6  percent  of  its  male  population  being  migrant,  followed 
closely  by  Kalimantan  Timur  Province,  with  41 .3  percent,  and  Papua 
and  Riau,  each  with  39.0  percent.  The  proportion  in  rural  areas  was 
much  less;  overall,  only  6.1  percent  of  males  in  these  areas  nation- 
wide were  emigrants.  Kalimantan  Timur  and  the  province  of  Riau 
had  the  greatest  proportions,  with  30.7  percent  and  28.2  percent, 
respectively. 

Indonesians  were  also  engaging  in  what  demographers  call  circu- 
lar migration  and  other  kinds  of  commuting  in  greater  numbers  than 


113 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

ever  before.  This  trend  was  linked  in  part  to  the  steep  increase  in  the 
number  of  motor  vehicles,  from  3.0  per  1,000  population  in  the  1960s 
to  26.2  in  1980, 46.3  in  1990,  78.1  in  2000,  and  132  in  2007.  With  the 
widespread  availability  of  public  bus  transportation  connecting  cities 
and  villages,  many  workers  commute  50  kilometers  or  more  daily  to 
work.  Others  live  away  from  their  homes  for  several  days  at  a  time  in 
order  to  work.  The  World  Bank  has  estimated  that  25  percent  of  rural 
households  have  at  least  one  family  member  working  for  part  of  the 
year  in  an  urban  area. 

In  part  because  of  increasing  migration,  Indonesians  of  different 
ethnic  backgrounds  and  occupations  are  increasingly  intermingling. 
They  more  frequently  find  themselves  in  circumstances  in  which 
they  cannot  rely  on  kin  and  village  networks  for  social  support,  and 
so  they  look  to  government  services  for  help,  particularly  in  the  areas 
of  education  and  health  care  (see  Education;  Health,  this  ch.). 

Social  Class 

The  experience  of  population  mobility  in  the  archipelago  has  not 
necessarily  resulted  in  social  mobility  in  terms  of  social  class. 
Indeed,  recent  studies  underscore  the  continuing  importance  of 
social  stratification  in  Indonesia,  as  least  as  measured  by  regional 
inequalities  in  income  and  consumption.  However,  scholars  and  pol- 
icy analysts  continue  to  debate  the  degree  to  which  social  classes  can 
be  defined  in  ethnic,  economic,  religious,  or  political  terms.  While  it 
is  clear  that  Indonesia  is  a  highly  stratified  society,  and  that  sensitiv- 
ity to  prestige  or  status  (gengsi)  is  widespread,  it  is  nonetheless  diffi- 
cult to  identify  an  upper  class.  Hereditary  ruling  classes  and 
traditional  elites  reinforced  by  their  positions  in  the  Dutch  colonial 
bureaucracy  no  longer  possess  unchallenged  access  to  political 
power  and  wealth  (see  Modernism  and  Nationalism  in  the  Colonial 
Age,  ch.  1).  Indeed,  they  cannot  even  claim  to  form  an  elite.  The  real 
power  holders — generals,  politicians,  and  wealthy  capitalists  of  the 
postindependence  period — are  newcomers  to  their  positions,  and, 
apart  from  extravagant  conspicuous  consumption  and  cosmopolitan- 
ism, they  demonstrate  few  clear  institutional  and  cultural  patterns 
that  suggest  they  constitute  a  unitary  group. 

Defining  a  lower  class  in  Indonesia  is  equally  difficult.  Even 
before  the  banning  of  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party  (PKI — see 
Glossary)  in  1966,  Indonesia's  poor  formed  alliances  that  had  less  to 
do  with  class  than  with  economics,  religion,  and  community  ties.  In 
some  cases,  the  poor  peasantry  identified  across  class  lines  with 
orthodox  Muslim  landowners  on  the  basis  of  their  common  religious 
ideologies  or  aliran  kepercayaan  (streams  of  belief).  This  alliance 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


was  particularly  evident  in  lowland  Jawa  Timur  Province.  In  other 
cases,  small  landowners  united  against  both  the  Islamic  right  wing 
and  Chinese  entrepreneurs.  There  also  were  divisions  between  the 
indigenous,  or  long-settled,  peoples  (pribumi — see  Glossary)  and 
later  Chinese  and  Arab  immigrants.  The  oil  boom  of  the  1970s 
affected  society  and  income  distribution  in  ways  that  benefited  the 
landed  peasantry  and  the  urban  middle  class.  However,  no  indepen- 
dent social  group  based  on  lower-class  affiliations  emerged  as  a 
major  political  force. 

Income  disparities  between  the  Outer  Islands  and  the  rest  of  the 
country  and  between  rural  and  urban  areas  remain  a  major  cause  of 
concern,  although  the  productivity  gap  between  Java  and  the  Outer 
Islands  has  narrowed.  While  the  urban  areas  of  Indonesia,  especially 
Java  and  Bali,  grew  disproportionately  wealthy  in  relation  to  their 
counterparts  in  more  rural  areas  and  the  Outer  Islands  through  much 
of  the  1990s,  they  were  also  hit  particularly  hard  by  the  1997-98 
financial  crisis.  By  2000,  income  and  consumption  inequalities  were 
back  to  levels  experienced  in  the  1980s.  United  Nations  Develop- 
ment Programme  data  based  on  the  Gini  index  (see  Glossary)  indi- 
cate that  Indonesia  stands  comparatively  well  regarding  income 
inequality.  For  example,  the  Gini  index  for  Indonesia  in  2008  was 
estimated  at  0.34,  significantly  lower  than  the  indexes  for  several 
neighboring  countries:  Singapore  (0.42),  the  Philippines  (0.44), 
Malaysia  (0.49),  and  Papua  New  Guinea  (0.51). 

Between  the  nation's  poor  and  privileged  classes  lies  a  complex 
mosaic  of  groups  forming  what  might  loosely  be  called  a  middle 
class.  Not  characterized  by  a  common  political  vision,  a  set  of  eco- 
nomic interests,  ethnic  identification,  or  even  income  levels,  the 
notion  of  a  middle  class  in  Indonesia  is  invoked  by  outsiders  and 
analysts  but  rarely  defined,  especially  by  Indonesians  themselves. 
While  middle-income  Indonesians  appear  to  share  some  consump- 
tion patterns — the  purchase  and  exclusive  use  of  consumer  durables 
such  as  televisions,  motorcycles,  newspapers,  cell  phones,  and  DVD 
players — the  decentralization  of  power  after  1998  does  not  seem  to 
have  resulted  in  an  empowered  middle  class.  As  Richard  Robison 
and  Vedi  Hadiz  argued  in  2004,  the  Indonesian  oligarchy  adapted  to 
the  collapse  of  the  New  Order  and  the  financial  crisis  in  some  new 
ways  but  continues  to  use  state  power  for  private  interests. 

Civil  Society 

Although  the  family,  the  community,  and  the  government  are 
important  sources  of  authority  in  Indonesia,  nongovernmental  orga- 
nizations (lembaga  swadaya  masyarakat,  or  LSM,  or  also  sometimes 


115 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

organisasi  nonpemerintah,  or  ornop),  such  as  foundations  or  charita- 
ble organizations  (yayasan),  associations  (perserikatan),  and  move- 
ments (gerakan),  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  defining  and 
shaping  social  life.  While  some  yayasan,  for  example,  provide  com- 
plex but  significant  financial  loopholes  for  businesses,  since  the 
1980s,  environmental,  legal  aid,  and  women's  groups  have  played  an 
increasingly  important  public  role. 

The  increasingly  free  news  media  are  an  important  means  of 
expression  for  Indonesian  civil  society.  Immediately  preceding  the 
fall  of  Suharto  in  1998,  Indonesians  began  to  enjoy  expanded  access 
to  print  and  electronic  news  sources.  Although  not  completely  unfet- 
tered, the  news  media  were  vibrant  and  played  an  increasingly 
important  role  in  informing  public  debate.  Immediately  upon 
Suharto's  departure,  however,  the  media  were  openly  reporting  on 
strikes,  popular  demonstrations,  and  other  expressions  of  opposition 
to  government  authority.  Intimidation  by  officials  and  private  inter- 
ests remained  a  serious  problem,  but  journalists  reported  and  advo- 
cated positions  at  odds  with  those  of  the  government,  sometimes  at 
their  peril.  Media  observers,  such  as  Krishna  Sen  and  David  T.  Hill, 
believe  that  the  Internet  may  also  have  played  a  role  in  this  new 
openness,  as  the  freedom  it  offered  during  the  waning  days  of  the 
Suharto  era  became  a  constant  reminder  of  the  absence  of  openness 
and  freedom  in  other  media. 

Islamic  civic  organizations  constitute  another  important  manifes- 
tation of  civil  society  in  Indonesia.  In  the  period  following  the  1997- 
98  economic  crisis  and  the  downfall  of  Suharto,  these  organizations 
played  an  important  role  in  filling  the  vacuum  of  authority.  Well 
before  the  term  civil  society  became  widespread  in  the  1980s, 
Islamic  organizations  in  Indonesia  participated  in  activities  that 
mediated  between  the  state  and  the  family.  For  instance,  Muham- 
madiyah  (Followers  of  Muhammad)  is  one  of  the  two  most  impor- 
tant, modern  Islamic  social-religious  organizations  in  Indonesia. 
Established  in  1912,  it  has  played  an  increasingly  important  role  in 
social  and  cultural  spheres  of  Indonesian  life,  such  as  education, 
finance,  socioeconomic  development,  health  care,  and  care  for  indi- 
gent people  and  orphans.  After  the  collapse  of  the  New  Order  in 
1998,  when  new  political  parties  were  being  established  across  the 
archipelago,  Muhammadiyah  had  the  opportunity  to  transform  itself 
from  a  social  and  cultural  organization  into  a  political  party.  How- 
ever, the  membership  rejected  this  change,  and  in  2008  no  official 
link  existed  between  Muhammadiyah  and  any  political  party. 

Indonesia's  other  first-rank  Muslim  organization,  the  Nahdlatul 
Ulama  (literally,  "revival  of  the  religious  teachers,"  but  often  trans- 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


lated  as  Council  of  Scholars),  was  founded  in  1926  as  a  religious  vol- 
untary organization  by  traditional  Muslim  religious  scholars.  It  is  the 
largest  Muslim  organization  in  Indonesia,  with  a  membership  of 
approximately  35  million.  Unlike  Muhammadiyah,  the  more  ortho- 
dox Sunni  (see  Glossary)  Nahdlatul  Ulama  in  the  1950s  was  also  a 
political  party,  but  it  now  is  strongly  oriented  toward  civic  and  social 
activities.  Its  base  is  rural  and  traditional,  practicing  forms  of  Islam 
strongly  linked  to  legal,  theological,  and  mystical  traditions  that  are 
nurtured  in  traditional  boarding  schools  (pondok  pesantren).  Nahd- 
latul Ulama  emphasizes  tolerance  in  its  view  of  society.  In  1983  it 
decided  to  accept  the  Indonesian  state  ideology,  Pancasila,  as  the 
foundation  of  its  social  programs,  and  to  work  for  a  just  society  for 
all  Indonesians,  not  just  Muslims.  In  1998  Nahdlatul  Ulama  unoffi- 
cially backed  the  formation  of  the  National  Awakening  Party  (PKB), 
and  its  leader,  Abdurrahman  Wahid,  was  elected  president  by  the 
People's  Representative  Council  (DPR)  in  1999.  However,  the  PKB's 
moderate  stance,  and  opposition  to  an  Islamic  state,  led  more  conser- 
vative members  to  leave  the  party.  Although  Wahid  was  ousted  from 
power  in  2001,  he  and  Nahdlatul  Ulama  continued  (until  Wahid's 
death  in  2009)  to  be  voices  for  tolerance,  secular  government,  and 
democracy. 

As  in  many  other  societies,  civil-society  organizations  in  Indone- 
sia ideally  promote  peace,  justice,  and  social  tolerance,  but  that  is  not 
always  the  reality.  For  instance,  on  October  12,  2002,  terrorists  asso- 
ciated with  the  radical  group  Jemaah  Islamiyah  (Congregation  of 
Islam)  blew  up  two  Bali  nightclubs,  killing  202  people.  On  August 
5,  2003,  individuals  allegedly  linked  to  the  same  group  struck  the 
Jakarta  JW  Marriott  Hotel,  killing  14.  Nonetheless,  a  national  poll  in 
2003  suggested  that  politically  militant  Islam  was  not  on  the  rise. 
Fully  85  percent  of  the  respondents  indicated  that  they  did  not  sup- 
port the  idea  of  an  Islamic  state  or  rollbacks  of  democratic  freedoms. 
In  spite  of  high-publicity  attacks  by  militant  Muslim  groups,  Muslim 
conservatives  play  a  far  smaller  role  in  national  politics  than  they  did 
in  the  1950s  (see  Islamic  Political  Culture,  ch.  4;  Terrorism,  ch.  5). 

Violence,  Vengeance,  and  Law 

Indonesia  experienced  a  high  level  of  civil  violence  from  about 
1996  to  2003.  Instances  included  ethnic  conflict  in  Sumba  (Nusa 
Tenggara  Timur);  apparently  ethnic  and  religious  strife  in  Kaliman- 
tan, Sulawesi,  Ambon,  and  Halmahera  (in  the  Malukus);  sectarian 
rioting  in  the  cities  of  Situbondo  (Jawa  Timur)  and  Tasikmalaya 
(Jawa  Barat);  race  rioting  in  Jakarta;  gang  warfare  in  Timor;  and 
government  repression  of  student  protests  at  Trisakti  University  in 


117 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Jakarta  on  May  12,  1998.  The  cumulative  casualty  toll  was  in  the 
thousands,  and  the  number  of  displaced  persons  rose  to  more  than 
500,000,  according  to  the  U.S.  Committee  for  Refugees. 

The  predominant  theme  to  this  unrest,  according  to  some  analysts, 
was  not  religion,  ethnicity,  or  politics,  but  rather  a  tendency  to  use 
extralegal  means  to  exact  vengeance  and  retaliate  against  enemies. 
As  the  Suharto  administration  began  to  assume  power,  it  was 
involved  in  a  bloody  retaliation  against  alleged  communist  actions 
during  1965-66;  for  the  next  30  years,  vigilante  neighborhood  watch 
groups  consisting  of  young  men  routinely  captured  and  killed 
alleged  thieves  without  legal  process  but  with  the  implicit  approval 
of  the  government.  Because  the  court  system  was  viewed  as  corrupt 
and  susceptible  to  bribery,  and  many  law  enforcement  agencies  were 
nearly  bankrupt  because  of  the  financial  crisis,  many  Indonesians 
came  to  believe  that  violence  was  the  only  route  to  justice.  The  vio- 
lence of  1996-2003  represented  a  continuation  and  intensification  of 
these  patterns. 

Religion  and  Worldview 

Religion  in  Indonesia  is  a  complex  and  volatile  issue,  not  easily 
analyzed  in  terms  of  social  class,  region,  or  ethnic  group.  Long  dis- 
couraged by  the  New  Order  government  (1966-98)  from  political 
participation,  Islam,  Christianity,  Hinduism,  Buddhism,  and  other 
religions  were  increasingly  influential  frameworks  for  defining 
social  participation  after  1998.  The  state  guaranteed  tolerance  of  cer- 
tain religions  (agama)  regarded  as  monotheistic  by  the  government, 
but  popular  violence  between  Christians  and  Muslims  in  Java, 
Sulawesi,  Kalimantan,  Ambon,  and  Halmahera  made  those  guaran- 
tees difficult  to  honor.  In  some  cases,  the  police  and  army  were  on 
different  sides  of  clashes  defined  in  religious  terms. 

Islam 

Islam  is  the  dominant  religion  by  far  in  Indonesia,  with  the  great- 
est number  of  adherents:  around  86.1  percent  of  the  population 
according  to  the  2000  census;  in  2009  this  would  have  been  about 
207  million  people.  No  other  country  in  the  world  has  more  Muslims 
than  Indonesia. 

The  main  strand  of  Islamic  practice  in  Indonesia  by  far  is  Sunni, 
with  only  a  very  small  number  of  Shia  (also  Shiite — see  Glossary). 
Differing  understandings  of  the  role  of  the  clergy  are  a  key  distinc- 
tion between  Sunni  and  Shia.  Emphasizing  predestination  and  prede- 
termination by  Allah,  Sunni  clerics  interpret  the  sunna  within  limits 


118 


imposed  by  centuries  of  learning  and  scholarship.  Shia  clerics 
emphasize  free  will  and  the  infallibility  of  divinely  inspired  imams 
to  interpret  ancient  texts.  Cutting  across  the  difference  between 
Sunni  and  Shia  groups,  a  small  minority  of  Indonesians  can  be  char- 
acterized in  terms  of  what  Australian  scholar  Greg  Fealy  calls  radi- 
cal Islam,  although  even  mainstream  Muslims  sympathize  with  some 
aspects  of  their  teachings,  if  not  their  practices.  Among  these  radical 
groups  in  Indonesia  are  Darul  Islam  (House  of  Islam),  Jemaah 
Islamiyah  (internationally  regarded  as  a  terrorist  organization), 
Majelis  Mujahidin  Indonesia  (Indonesian  Islamic  Warriors'  Coun- 
cil), and  Front  Pembela  Islam  (Islamic  Defenders'  Front).  These 
groups  share  a  sense  that  the  West  (that  is,  Christians  and  Jews)  has 
used  economic  and  military  power  to  enfeeble  Islam;  their  solution 
is  to  call  for  a  return  to  the  pure  Islam  of  the  righteous  ancestors  (as- 
salaf  as-salih),  or  Salafism.  Varieties  of  Salafism  include  Wahha- 
bism,  the  official  form  of  Islam  in  Saudi  Arabia. 

According  to  orthodox  practice,  Islam  is  a  strictly  monotheistic 
religion  in  which  God  (Allah,  or,  in  Indonesian,  Tuhan,  which  is  also 


119 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

used  to  refer  to  the  Christian  God  and  other  gods)  is  both  a  pervasive 
presence  and  a  somewhat  distant  figure.  The  Prophet  Muhammad  is 
not  deified  but  rather  is  regarded  as  a  human  who  was  selected  by 
God  to  spread  the  word  to  others  through  the  Quran,  Islam's  holy 
book,  the  revealed  word  of  God.  Islam  is  a  religion  based  on  high 
moral  principles,  and  an  important  part  of  being  a  Muslim  is  com- 
mitment to  these  principles.  Islamic  law  (sharia,  or  syariah  in  Indo- 
nesian) is  based  on  the  Quran;  the  sunna,  which  includes  the  hadith 
(hadis  in  Indonesian),  the  actions  and  sayings  of  Muhammad;  ijma, 
the  consensus  of  local  Islamic  jurisprudence  and,  sometimes,  the 
whole  Muslim  community;  and  qiyas,  or  reasoning  through  analogy. 
Islam  is  universalist,  and  in  theory  there  are  no  national,  racial,  or 
ethnic  criteria  for  conversion. 

Over  the  course  of  the  mostly  peaceful  introduction  of  Islam  to 
Indonesia  beginning  in  the  ninth  century  AD,  tensions  periodically 
arose  between  orthodox  Muslims  and  practitioners  of  more  syncretis- 
tic,  locally  based  religions.  These  tensions  are  still  evident  in  the  early 
twenty-first  century.  In  Java,  for  instance,  they  are  expressed  in  the 
contrast  between  a  santri  (see  Glossary),  a  pious  Muslim,  and  an 
abangan  (see  Glossary),  an  adherent  to  a  syncretistic  blend  of  indige- 
nous, Hindu-Buddhist  beliefs  with  Islamic  practices,  sometimes 
called  kejawen  (Javanism),  agama  Jawa  (Javanese  religion),  or  keba- 
tinan  (mysticism — see  Glossary).  In  Java,  santri  not  only  refers  to  a 
person  who  is  consciously  and  exclusively  Muslim,  but  also  describes 
persons  who  have  removed  themselves  from  the  secular  world  to  con- 
centrate on  devotional  activities  in  Islamic  schools  called  pesantren — 
literally,  the  place  of  the  santri,  but  meaning  Islamic  school.  Although 
these  religious  boarding  schools,  typically  headed  by  a  charismatic 
kiai  (Muslim  religious  scholar),  provide  education  for  only  a  minority 
of  Indonesian  children  (less  than  10  percent),  they  remain  an  impor- 
tant symbol  of  Muslim  piety,  particularly  in  rural  areas. 

There  is  also  a  long  history  of  religious  practice  associated  with 
more  mystical  and  often  highly  syncretistic  beliefs.  Drawing  vari- 
ously on  Hindu-Buddhist  ideas  about  self-control  and  intellectual 
contemplation,  as  well  as  more  animistically  inclined  ideas  about  the 
spiritual  character  of  nature,  and  often  based  on  miraculous  revela- 
tions, various  kinds  of  hybrid  Islamic  beliefs  flourished  in  Java  until 
a  presidential  decree  in  1965  urged  consolidation  under  the  rubric  of 
the  main  scriptural  religions  (agama),  including  Islam,  Christianity, 
Buddhism,  Hinduism,  and  Confucianism.  Several  of  the  more  mysti- 
cal varieties  of  Islam  continued  to  flourish  under  the  Suharto  regime, 
and  some  continued  to  struggle  for  autonomy  and  recognition  by  the 
government,  eventually  receiving  recognition  in  1973  as  keper- 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


cayaan  (faiths),  albeit  under  the  umbrella  of  one  of  the  scriptural 
agama.  Among  the  more  prominent  of  these  faiths  was  kebatinan. 
Only  nominally  Muslim,  kebatinan  is  an  amalgam  of  animist, 
Hindu-Buddhist,  and  Muslim,  mostly  Sufi  (see  Glossary),  spiritual 
practices  concerned  with  harmonizing  the  inner  self  with  the  outer 
material  world.  Spirits  are  believed  to  inhabit  natural  objects,  human 
beings,  artifacts,  and  grave  sites  of  important  wali  (Muslim  saints). 
Illness  and  other  misfortunes  are  traced  to  such  spirits,  and  if  sacri- 
fices or  pilgrimages  fail  to  placate  angry  deities,  the  advice  of  a 
dukun,  or  healer,  is  sought.  While  it  connotes  a  turning  away  from 
the  militant  universalism  of  orthodox  Islam,  kebatinan  moves 
toward  a  more  internalized  universalism.  In  this  way,  it  seeks  to 
eliminate  distinctions  between  the  universal  and  the  local,  the  com- 
munal and  the  individual. 

Another  important  tension  dividing  Indonesian  Muslims  is  that 
between  traditionalism  and  modernism.  The  nature  of  this  antipathy  is 
complex  and  a  matter  of  considerable  debate.  One  key  issue  concerns 
the  self-sufficiency  of  scripture  and  the  moral  responsibility  of  the 
individual.  Modernists  emphasize  the  absolute  and  transparent  author- 
ity of  the  Quran  and  the  responsibility  of  individuals  to  follow  its 
teachings;  traditionalists  contend  that  Quranic  texts  can  be  ambiguous, 
and  that  it  is  wiser  to  trust  in  the  collective  wisdom  of  past  teaching. 
While  traditionalists  accept  a  variety  of  ritual  forms,  they  underscore 
the  responsibility  of  believers  to  the  community,  and  are  less  con- 
cerned with  individual  responsibility  to  interpret  scripture.  Specifi- 
cally, traditionalists  are  suspicious  of  modernists'  support  of  the  urban 
madrassa  {madrasah  in  Bahasa  Indonesia),  a  reformist  school  that 
includes  the  teaching  of  secular  topics.  The  modernists'  goal  of  taking 
Islam  and  carrying  it  more  directly  to  the  people  has  been  opposed  by 
traditionalists  because  it  threatens  to  undermine  the  authority  of  the 
kiai.  On  the  other  hand,  some  modernists  accuse  traditionalists  of 
escapist  tendencies  and  of  failing  to  directly  confront  the  individual 
responsibility  to  make  sense  of  a  changing  world.  One  point  of  agree- 
ment is  that  both  modernists  and  traditionalists  have  sought,  unsuc- 
cessfully, to  add  a  clause  to  the  first  tenet  of  the  Indonesian 
constitution  requiring  that,  in  effect,  all  Muslims  adhere  to  the  sharia. 
In  fact,  some  even  hint  that  modernist  and  traditionalist  santri  harbor 
greater  loyalty  toward  the  ummah  (community  of  believers)  of  Islam 
than  to  the  Indonesian  state. 

Christianity 

Christianity — Roman  Catholicism  and  Protestantism — is  the  most 
rapidly  growing  religion  in  Indonesia,  although  Christians  are  modest 


121 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

in  number  compared  to  adherents  to  Islam  (8.7  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion versus  86.1  percent  according  to  the  2000  census).  Christianity 
has  a  long  history  in  the  islands,  with  Portuguese  Jesuits  and  Domini- 
cans operating  in  Maluku,  southern  Sulawesi,  and  Timor  since  the 
sixteenth  century.  When  the  Dutch  defeated  Portuguese  forces  in 
1605  and  began  what  was  to  be  more  than  350  years  of  Dutch  pres- 
ence in  the  Indonesian  archipelago,  however,  the  Catholic  missionar- 
ies were  expelled,  and  the  Dutch  Reformed  Church,  a  Calvinist 
denomination,  became  the  dominant  Christian  presence  in  the  region, 
as  it  would  be  until  Indonesia  became  independent  (see  The  National 
Revolution,  1945^9,  ch.  1).  Because  the  United  East  Indies  Com- 
pany (VOC)  was  a  secular  enterprise,  and  Calvinism  was  a  strict  and 
intellectually  uncompromising  interpretation  of  Christianity  that 
demanded  a  thorough  understanding  of  what,  for  Indonesians,  were 
foreign  scriptures,  Christianity  advanced  little  in  Indonesia  until  the 
nineteenth  century.  Only  a  few  small  communities  endured,  in  Java, 
Maluku,  northern  Sulawesi,  and  Nusa  Tenggara  (primarily  on  the 
islands  of  Roti  and  Timor).  After  the  dissolution  of  the  VOC  in  1799, 
and  the  adoption  of  a  more  comprehensive  view  of  their  mission  in 
the  archipelago,  the  Dutch  permitted  Christian  proselytizing  in  the 
territory.  This  evangelical  freedom  was  put  to  use  by  the  more  toler- 
ant German  Lutherans,  who  began  work  in  Sumatra  among  the  Toba 
Batak  in  1 861,  and  by  the  Dutch  Rhenish  Mission  in  central  Kaliman- 
tan in  1845.  In  addition,  Jesuits  established  successful  Catholic  mis- 
sions, schools,  and  hospitals  throughout  the  islands  of  Flores,  Timor, 
and  Alor  in  the  late  nineteenth  century. 

The  twentieth  century  witnessed  the  influx  of  many  new  Protestant 
missionary  groups,  as  well  as  the  continued  growth  of  Catholicism 
and  of  large  regional  and  reformed  Lutheran  churches.  Following  the 
1965  coup  attempt,  all  nonreligious  persons  were  labeled  atheists  and 
hence  were  vulnerable  to  accusations  of  harboring  communist  sym- 
pathies (see  The  "Coup"  and  Its  Aftermath,  ch.  1).  At  that  time, 
Christian  churches  of  all  varieties  experienced  explosive  growth  in 
membership,  particularly  among  people  who  felt  uncomfortable  with 
the  political  aspirations  of  Islamic  parties. 

Most  Christians  in  Indonesia  are  Protestants  (about  19  million  in 
2009)  of  one  denomination  or  another,  with  particularly  large  concen- 
trations located  in  the  provinces  of  Sumatera  Utara,  Papua,  Papua 
Barat,  Maluku,  Kalimantan  Tengah,  Sulawesi  Tengah,  Sulawesi  Utara, 
and  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur.  Large  concentrations  of  Roman  Catholics 
(a  total  of  about  8  million  in  2009)  live  in  Jawa  Tengah,  Kalimantan 
Barat,  Papua,  Papua  Barat,  and  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur.  In  addition,  a 
substantial  number  of  ethnic  Chinese  Indonesians  are  Roman  Catho-

lie.  Catholic  congregations  grew  less  rapidly  in  the  1980s  and  1990s, 
in  part  because  of  the  church's  heavy  reliance  on  European  personnel. 
These  Europeans  experienced  increasing  restrictions  on  their  mission- 
ary activities  imposed  by  the  Muslim-dominated  Department  of  Reli- 
gion (later  called  the  Department  of  Religious  Affairs). 

Hinduism 

Indonesian  Hinduism,  an  amalgam  of  related  traditions  and  cults 
that  explains  the  nature  of  the  universe  in  terms  of  interactions  among 
numerous  gods,  is  strongly  associated  with  Bali.  In  1953,  in  response 
to  the  central  government's  exclusion  of  Balinese  Hinduism  from  its 
list  of  officially  recognized  religions,  religious  leaders  on  that  island 
sought  official  recognition  of  Agama  Hindu  Bali  (Hindu  Balinese 
Religion)  as  a  creed  equivalent  to  Islam,  Catholicism,  and  Protestant- 
ism. Led  by  Pandit  Shastri,  various  Hindu  reform  organizations  on 
Bali  agreed  in  1958  on  the  Hindu  Dharma  (Principles  of  Hinduism), 
which  emphasized  the  Catur  Veda  (religious  poems),  the  Upanishads 
(treatises  of  Brahmanic  knowledge),  and  the  Bhagavad  Gita,  as  well 
as  two  Old  Javanese  texts  (Sarasamuccaya  and  Sanghyang  Kama- 
hayanikan).  Together,  these  works  came  to  form  the  holy  canon  of 
Balinese  Hinduism.  Other  Hindu  sacred  texts,  such  as  the  Puranas 


123 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

(Sanskrit  cosmogonic  histories),  were  relegated  to  a  minor  position. 
In  addition,  a  daily  prayer  called  the  trisandhya  was  devised  by  Pan- 
dit Shastri  to  correspond  to  the  five  daily  prayers  of  Muslims.  These 
reforms  were  accepted  by  Sukarno  in  1959,  and  Balinese  Hinduism 
gained  full  recognition  in  1963. 

Arriving  in  the  archipelago  before  the  second  century  AD  with 
traders  and  missionaries  from  India,  Hindu  beliefs  were  greatly  mod- 
ified when  adapted  to  Indonesian  society.  The  central  concept  of  rit- 
ual purity,  maintained  through  a  division  of  society  into  occupational 
groups,  or  castes  (varna,  literally  color),  was  never  rigidly  applied  in 
Indonesia.  The  categories  of  Brahman  (priests;  brahmana  in  Indone- 
sian), Kshatriya  (ruler-warrior;  satria  in  Indonesian),  Vaishya  (mer- 
chant-farmer; waisya  in  Indonesian),  and  Shudra  (commoner-servant; 
sudra  in  Indonesian)  do  exist  in  Bali;  besides  the  category  of  Brah- 
man, however,  they  appear  to  have  little  influence  over  occupational 
choices,  or  even  over  social  status  and  marital  opportunities.  Two 
Hindu  epics,  the  Mahabharata  (Great  Battle  of  the  Descendants  of 
Bharata)  and  the  Ramayana  (The  Travels  of  Rama),  have  become 
classics  among  Indonesians,  both  Hindu  believers  and  others,  espe- 
cially in  Java,  and  are  rendered  in  wayang  (see  Glossary)  and  dance 
performances. 

Indonesian  Hindu  believers  are  relatively  few  outside  Bali,  where 
they  make  up  more  than  93  percent  of  the  population.  Others  are  scat- 
tered throughout  the  other  32  provinces  and  special  regions,  where 
diverse,  and  largely  indigenous,  religious  practices  have  sought  and 
gained  recognition  as  Hindu  by  the  Department  of  Religious  Affairs. 
On  a  nationwide  basis,  only  about  1.8  percent  of  the  population  was 
Hindu  according  to  the  2000  census,  although  the  U.S.  Department  of 
State  reported  10  million  adherents  in  2009.  Because  lacking  an  offi- 
cial agama  was  associated  with  communism  during  the  New  Order, 
and  being  communist  was  a  crime  punishable  by  death  or  exile,  some 
of  Indonesia's  heterogeneous  animist,  ancestor  worship,  and  syncretic 
cults  sought  refuge  under  the  tolerant  Hindu  aegis.  Among  these  non- 
Balinese  communities,  one  finds,  for  example,  the  adherents  of  the 
Kaharingan  religion  in  Kalimantan  Tengah,  where  government  statis- 
tics generally  have  counted  them  among  Hindus  as  7.8  percent  of  the 
local  population.  In  addition,  there  are  significant  communities 
labeled  Hindu  among  the  Toraja  in  Sulawesi  Tengah  and  Sulawesi 
Selatan  provinces,  among  the  Karo  Batak  in  northern  Sumatra,  and  in 
Jawa  Tengah  and  Jawa  Timur  provinces,  most  notably  among  the 
Tenggerese. 

Anthropologist  Robert  Hefner  has  noted  that  significant  changes 
in  state  policy  occurred  with  respect  to  Javanese  Hinduism  in  the  late 
1980s  and  early  1990s.  During  the  early  phases  of  the  New  Order,

syncretically  and  mystically  inclined  Javanese  previously  affiliated 
loosely  with  Islam  had  converted  to  Hinduism.  While  there  was  gov- 
ernment support  initially  for  such  groups,  including  the  kebatinan, 
pressure  from  conservative  Muslim  groups  on  the  one  hand  and  gov- 
ernment leadership  on  the  other  resulted  in  an  increasingly  poor  fit 
between  the  syncretic  practice  of  Javanese  Hinduism  and  the  official 
Hindu  dharma. 

Buddhism 

Introduced  before  the  second  century  AD  by  the  same  waves  of 
traders  and  scholars  who  brought  Hinduism,  Indonesian  Buddhism  is 
now  overwhelmingly  associated  with  the  ethnic  Chinese  and  is  an 
unstable  product  of  complex  accommodations  among  religious  ide- 
ology, Chinese  ethnic  identification,  and  a  gradually  more  tolerant 
policy  by  the  central  government.  Traditionally,  Chinese  Daoism, 
Confucianism  {agama  Konghucu),  and  Buddhism,  as  well  as  the 
mass  Buddhist  organization  Perhimpunan  Buddhis  Indonesia  (Per- 
buddhi),  founded  in  1958,  all  had  adherents  in  the  ethnic  Chinese 
community.  Following  the  events  of  1965,  with  any  deviation  from 
the  monotheistic  tenets  of  the  Pancasila  regarded  as  treason,  the

founder  of  Perbuddhi,  Bhikku  Ashin  Jinarakkhita,  proposed  that 
there  was  a  single  supreme  deity,  Sang  Hyang  Adi  Buddha.  He  suc- 
cessfully sought  confirmation  for  this  striking  innovation  to  Bud- 
dhist beliefs  in  ancient  Javanese  texts,  and  even  in  the  shape  of  the 
Borobudur  temple  in  Jawa  Tengah  Province.  After  1965  the  number 
of  Buddhists  swelled;  some  90  new  monasteries  were  built,  mostly 
supported  by  Indonesia's  Chinese  population,  but  also  drawing  sig- 
nificant numbers  from  syncretistically  oriented  Javanese  disaffected 
by  the  increasingly  strict  emphasis  on  doctrinaire  forms  of  Islam.  By 
1987  there  were  seven  schools  of  Buddhism  affiliated  with  the  Per- 
wakilan  Umat  Buddha  Indonesia  (Walubi):  Theravada,  Buddhayana, 
Mahayana,  Tridharma,  Kasogatan,  Maitreya,  and  Nichiren.  In  2009 
Buddhism  had  an  estimated  2  million  followers  in  Indonesia  (less 
than  1  percent  of  the  population),  with  a  growing  presence  in  Kali- 
mantan Barat  Province,  home  to  large  numbers  of  ethnic  Chinese. 

Confucianism  and  Daoism 

The  New  Order  administration  officially  tolerated  Confucianism. 
However,  because  it  was  regarded  as  a  system  of  ethical  relations 
rather  than  a  religion  per  se,  it  was  not  represented  in  the  Department 
of  Religion.  Daoism,  which  is  practiced  both  as  a  philosophy  and  a 
religion,  is  recognized  by  the  department  as  an  official  religion. 

The  Emerging  National  Culture 

Living  Environments 

The  government  of  Indonesia  saw  itself  as  having  a  responsibility 
to  advance  a  national  culture  throughout  most  of  the  New  Order 
period,  a  project  that  was  linked  to  requirements  of  national  develop- 
ment and  political  integration.  Government  mandates  aside,  however, 
as  more  and  more  of  the  Indonesian  population  sought  employment 
in  large,  poorly  integrated  cities  consisting  of  diverse  ethnic  groups, 
the  concept  of  a  national  culture  had  great  appeal  as  a  way  of  regulat- 
ing these  changing  urban  environments.  Although  the  central  govern- 
ment attempted  to  guide  the  formation  of  this  culture  through 
educational  curricula,  celebrations  of  national  holidays,  and  careful 
control  of  the  national  media  (popular  art,  television,  and  print 
media),  this  emerging  culture  came  about  only  partly  through  central 
planning.  Evidence  of  an  emerging  national  culture  also  appeared  in 
the  far  less  controlled  layout  and  social  organization  of  cities;  rou- 
tines of  social  interaction  using  the  official  national  language,  Bahasa 
Indonesia;  patterns  of  eating  and  preparing  food;  the  viewing  of  team

sports,  such  as  soccer,  badminton,  and  volleyball;  movies  and  televi- 
sion programming;  and  material  displays  of  wealth. 

In  smaller  Indonesian  cities,  the  heart  of  urban  culture  before  the 
mid-twentieth  century  was  a  commercial  sector  surrounding  a  cen- 
tral square.  The  Dutch  left  a  legacy  of  a  basic  civil  architecture  and 
street  plans  for  large  cities  and  towns  in  Java,  Sumatra,  and  Bali,  but 
after  World  War  II  most  failed  to  experience  a  level  of  improved 
urban  design  and  services  commensurate  with  their  tremendous  pop- 
ulation growth.  Many  cities,  as  a  result,  had  minimal  or  makeshift 
services,  with  very  simple  sanitation,  transportation  facilities,  and 
fire  protection. 

Indonesian  cities  are  internally  segmented  in  complex,  overlap- 
ping ways  that  differentiate  ethnic  groups,  income  levels,  and  pro- 
fessional specializations.  Some  older  neighborhoods  tend  to  house 
well-to-do  business  owners  and  high-level  government  officials, 
whereas  other  newer  areas  tend  to  be  home  to  migrant  communities 
from  the  rural  areas.  Some  of  these  areas  retain  their  system  of  close- 
knit  social  networks  and  are  distinguished  by  the  label  kampung  (vil- 
lage). However,  the  boundaries  between  one  area  and  another  are 
often  unclear.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 


Language 

The  major  languages  of  Indonesia  belong  to  the  Austronesian  fam- 
ily, a  group  of  agglutinative  languages  spoken  in  the  area  bounded  by 
Madagascar  in  the  western  Indian  Ocean  and  Easter  Island  in  the 
eastern  Pacific  Ocean.  There  is  a  considerable  diversity  in  the  lan- 
guages used  in  Indonesia.  No  fewer  than  731  languages — the  vast 
majority  Austronesian,  the  rest  Papuan  and  used  in  parts  of  Timor, 
Papua,  and  Halmahera — existed  in  the  early  twenty- first  century. 

Based  on  reports  of  ethnic  self-identification  in  the  2000  census, 
the  primary  languages  spoken  by  2  million  or  more  people  were  Java- 
nese (83  million),  Sundanese  (30  million),  Malay/Indonesian  (17  mil- 
lion), Madurese  (6.7  million),  Batak  (6.1  million),  Minangkabau  (5.4 
million),  Buginese  (5.1  million),  Balinese  (3  million),  and  Acehnese 
(2.2  million).  In  addition,  some  2  million  inhabitants  spoke  one  of 
several  dialects  of  Chinese.  Arabic  and  languages  of  India  and  Europe 
also  are  used. 

The  central  and  most  successful  feature  of  the  Indonesian  national 
culture  is  probably  the  Indonesian  language.  Malay  was  used  for  cen- 
turies as  a  lingua  franca  in  many  parts  of  the  archipelago.  The  term 
Bahasa  Indonesia,  which  refers  to  a  modified  form  of  Malay,  was 
coined  by  Indonesian  nationalists  in  1928  and  became  a  symbol  of 
national  unity  during  the  struggle  for  independence.  Bahasa  Indone- 
sia is  spoken  in  more  than  90  percent  of  households  in  Jakarta.  Out- 
side the  capital,  only  10  to  15  percent  of  the  population  speaks  the 
language  at  home,  but  this  number  appears  to  be  on  the  rise.  In  Java- 
nese areas,  only  1  percent  to  5  percent  of  the  people  speak  Bahasa 
Indonesia  in  the  home.  Nationwide,  some  17  million  Indonesians  use 
Bahasa  Indonesia  as  a  primary  language,  while  more  than  150  million 
to  1 80  million  others  use  it  as  a  second  language.  It  is  now  indisput- 
ably the  language  of  government,  schools,  national  print  and  elec- 
tronic media,  and  interethnic  communication.  In  many  provinces,  it  is 
the  primary  language  of  communication  between  ethnic  Chinese 
shopkeepers  and  their  non-Chinese  patrons. 

Bahasa  Indonesia  is  infused  with  highly  distinctive  accents, 
vocabularies,  and  styles  in  some  regions  (particularly  Maluku,  parts 
of  Nusa  Tenggara,  and  Jakarta),  but  there  are  many  similarities  in 
patterns  of  use  across  the  archipelago.  For  example,  it  is  common  to 
vary  the  use  of  address  forms  depending  on  the  rank  or  status  of  the 
individual  to  whom  one  is  speaking.  This  variation  is  not  as  complex 
as  in  the  elaborately  hierarchical  Javanese  language,  but  it  is  none- 
theless important.  For  instance,  in  Bahasa  Indonesia  respected  elders 
are  typically  addressed  in  kinship  terms — bapak  (father  or  elder)  or 
ibu  (mother).  The  use  of  second-person  pronouns  in  direct  address  is 


128 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


generally  avoided  in  favor  of  more  indirect  references  unless  speaker 
and  listeners  are  on  intimate  terms.  In  casual  contexts,  however,  such 
as  when  one  is  speaking  to  taxicab  drivers,  street  peddlers,  and  close 
friends,  formal  textbook  Indonesian  often  gives  way  to  the  more 
ironic,  sly,  and  earthy  urban  forms  of  address  and  reference. 

Food,  Clothing,  and  Popular  Culture 

Although  Indonesia  has  a  varied  environment,  and  many  different 
ethnic  cuisines,  rice  is  a  national  staple,  even  in  areas  such  as  eastern 
Indonesia,  where  the  main  source  of  starch  is  corn,  cassava,  taro,  or 
sago.  On  ceremonial  occasions  such  as  funerals,  modern  weddings, 
and  state  functions,  foods  such  as  sate  (small  pieces  of  meat  roasted 
on  a  skewer),  krupuk  (fried  chips  made  with  rice  flour  and  flavored 
with  fish  or  fried  shrimp),  and  highly  spiced  curries  of  chicken  and 
goat  are  commonly  served.  At  public  events,  these  foods  are  often 
placed  on  a  table  from  which  guests  serve  themselves  buffet  style. 
Rice  is  placed  in  the  center  of  the  plate,  with  meats  or  other  condi- 
ments around  the  edges.  Food  is  eaten — usually  quite  rapidly  and 
without  speaking — with  the  fingertips  or  with  a  spoon  and  fork. 
Water  is  generally  drunk  only  after  the  meal,  when  men  (rarely 
women)  smoke  their  distinctive  clove-scented  kretek  cigarettes. 

On  many  formal  national  occasions,  men  wear  untucked  batik 
shirts  with  no  tie.  Head  wear  usually  consists  of  a  peci,  a  black  felt 
cap  once  associated  with  Muslims  or  Malays  but  which  acquired  a 
more  secular,  national  meaning  during  the  struggle  for  indepen- 
dence. Indonesian  men  generally  wear  sarongs  only  at  home  or  on 
informal  occasions.  Women  wear  sarongs  on  formal  occasions, 
along  with  the  kebaya,  a  tight-fitting,  low-cut,  long-sleeved  blouse. 
On  these  occasions,  women  often  tie  their  hair  into  a  bun,  sometimes 
adding  a  hairpiece.  In  addition,  they  often  carry  a  selendang,  a  long, 
narrow  cloth  draped  over  the  shoulder,  which  on  less  formal  occa- 
sions is  used  to  carry  babies  or  objects.  Increasing  numbers  of  young 
women  have  adopted  traditional  Islamic  clothing  such  as  the  jilbab 
(head  scarf)  or  other  head  covering. 

Urban  Indonesian  nightlife  centers  on  night  markets,  where  peo- 
ple shop  in  toko  (stores)  and  warung  (food  stalls).  Also  popular  are 
forms  of  the  performing  arts  such  as  pop  music  concerts,  puppet 
shows,  and  the  cinema.  American  and  Indian  films  are  popular,  while 
Indonesian  motion  pictures  selectively  emphasize  certain  aspects  of 
Indonesian  life.  Indonesian-made  films  are  set  in  cities — even 
though  the  population  has  traditionally  been  largely  rural — and  most 
films  employ  Bahasa  Indonesia  even  though  most  viewers  are  Java- 
nese. There  is  rarely  mention  of  religion  or  ethnicity,  even  though 
most  of  the  population  has  a  religious  affiliation  (see  Religion  and 


129 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Worldview,  this  ch.).  Anthropologist  Karl  Heider  has  observed  that 
Westerners  in  general  are  unambiguously  presented  as  modern  and 
having  no  tradition  whatsoever.  Western  women  are  presented  as 
having  few  constraints  on  their  sexuality.  The  audiences  for  films 
consist  almost  entirely  of  teenagers  and  young  adults  and  are  more 
male  than  female. 

Television  use  in  Indonesian  households  increased  dramatically  in 
the  late  twentieth  and  early  twenty-first  centuries,  as  did  the  variety 
of  broadcast  stations  and  programming,  especially  after  the  end  of 
the  New  Order  in  1998.  Public  and  private  radio  stations  also  bring  a 
range  of  popular  culture  programs  to  people  throughout  the  archipel- 
ago (see  Post  and  Telecommunications,  ch.  3). 

Popular  programs  include  sinetron  (television  dramas),  which  are 
serialized,  Indonesian- language  dramas  about  everyday  life.  In  addi- 
tion, variety  news  and  entertainment  shows  are  available,  such  as 
Selamat  Pagi  Indonesia  (Good  Morning  Indonesia)  and  the  "soft 
news"  program  Seputar  Indonesia  (Around  Indonesia).  Popular  for- 
eign dramatic  serials  from  Australia,  India,  Japan,  and  the  United 
States  also  appear  in  dubbed,  subtitled,  or  original-language  ver- 
sions. Most  programming  is  in  Bahasa  Indonesia,  although  some 
local  arts  programs  are  presented  in  regional  languages.  Nielsen 
Indonesia  regularly  conducts  rating  surveys  of  the  Indonesian  televi- 
sion market,  and  the  results  are  influential  in  determining  program- 
ming. Recent  figures  suggest  that  Indonesia  is  one  of  the  fastest- 
growing  markets  for  television  advertising  as  well  as  for  burgeoning 
private  and  commercial  television  networks  (see  Media,  ch.  4). 

Sources  of  Local  Identification 

Tradition  and  Multiethnicity 

Indonesian  society  comprises  numerous  ethnic  groups.  The  Java- 
nese are  the  largest,  at  41.0  percent  of  the  total  population.  Sunda- 
nese  make  up  15.0  percent,  followed  by  Malays  (3.4  percent)  and 
Madurese  (3.3  percent).  More  than  14  percent  of  the  population  con- 
sists of  numerous  small  ethnic  groups  or  minorities.  The  precise 
extent  of  this  diversity  is  unknown,  however,  because  the  Indonesian 
census  stopped  reporting  data  on  ethnicity  in  1930,  under  the  Dutch, 
and  only  started  again  in  2000.  In  that  year's  census,  nine  categories 
of  ethnicity  were  reported  (by  age-group  and  province):  Jawa,  Sunda 
and  Priangan,  Madura,  Minangkabau,  Betawi,  Bugis  and  Ugi,  Ban- 
ten,  Banjar  and  Melayu  Banjar,  and  lainnya  (other). 

As  this  increasingly  mobile,  multiethnic  nation  moves  into  its  sev- 
enth decade  of  independence,  Indonesians  are  becoming  aware — 


130 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


through  education,  television,  cinema,  print  media,  and  national 
parks — of  the  diversity  of  their  own  society.  When  Indonesians  talk 
about  their  cultural  differences  with  one  another,  one  of  the  key 
words  they  use  is  adat.  The  term  is  roughly  translated  as  "custom"  or 
"tradition,"  but  its  meaning  has  undergone  a  number  of  transforma- 
tions in  Indonesia.  In  some  circumstances,  for  instance,  adat  has  a 
kind  of  legal  status — certain  adat  laws  (hukum  adat)  are  recognized 
by  the  government  as  legitimate.  These  ancestral  guidelines  may 
pertain  to  a  wide  range  of  activities:  agricultural  production,  reli- 
gious practices,  marriage  arrangements,  legal  practices,  political  suc- 
cession, or  artistic  expression. 

Even  though  the  vast  majority  of  them  are  Muslims,  Indonesians 
maintain  very  different  systems  of  social  identification.  For  example, 
when  Javanese  try  to  explain  the  behavior  of  a  Sundanese  or  a  Bali- 
nese  counterpart,  they  might  say  "because  it  is  his  adat."  Differences 
in  the  ways  ethnic  groups  practice  Islam  are  often  ascribed  to  adat. 
Each  group  may  have  different  patterns  of  observing  religious  holi- 
days, attending  the  mosque,  expressing  respect,  or  burying  the  dead. 

Adat  in  the  sense  of  "custom"  is  often  viewed  as  one  of  the  deep- 
est— even  sacred — sources  of  consensus  within  an  ethnic  group,  how- 
ever, the  word  itself  is  from  Arabic.  Through  centuries  of  contact  with 
outsiders,  Indonesians  have  a  long  history  of  contrasting  themselves 
and  their  traditions  with  those  of  others,  and  their  notions  of  who  they 
are  as  a  people  have  been  shaped  in  basic  ways  by  these  encounters. 
On  some  of  the  more  isolated  islands  in  eastern  Indonesia,  for 
instance,  one  finds  ethnic  groups  that  have  no  word  equivalent  to  adat 
because  they  have  had  very  little  contact  with  outsiders. 

Early  in  the  New  Order,  the  notion  of  adat  came  to  take  on  a 
national  significance  in  touristic  settings  such  as  Balinese  artistic 
performances  and  museum  displays.  Taman  Mini,  a  kind  of  ethno- 
graphic theme  park  on  the  outskirts  of  Jakarta,  seeks  to  display  and 
interpret  the  cultural  diversity  of  Indonesia.  This  100-hectare  park  is 
landscaped  to  look  like  the  Indonesian  archipelago  in  miniature 
when  viewed  from  an  overhead  tramway.  There  is  a  house  for  each 
province,  to  represent  vernacular  architecture.  The  park  sells  distinc- 
tive local  hand  weapons,  textiles,  and  books  explaining  the  customs 
of  the  province.  One  powerful  message  of  the  park  is  that  adat  is 
contained  in  objective,  material  culture,  which  is  aesthetically  pleas- 
ing and  indeed  marketable,  but  which  is  more  or  less  distinct  from 
everyday  social  life.  Furthermore,  the  exhibits  convey  the  impres- 
sion to  some  observers  that  ethnicity  is  a  simple  aesthetic  matter  of 
regional  and  spatial  variations  rather  than  an  issue  of  deep  emotional 
or  political  attachments.  However,  the  park  provides  visitors  with  a 


131 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

vivid  and  attractive  (if  not  always  convincing)  model  for  how  the 
Indonesian  national  motto,  Bhinneka  Tunggal  Ika  (Unity  in  Diver- 
sity, a  Javanese  slogan  dating  to  fourteenth-century  Kediri  poet  Mpu 
Tantular's  poem  "Sutasoma")  might  be  understood. 

When  Indonesians  talk  about  their  society  in  inclusive  terms,  they 
are  more  likely  to  use  a  word  such  as  budaya  (culture)  than  adat. 
One  speaks  of  kebudayaan  Indonesia,  the  "culture  of  Indonesia,"  as 
something  grand,  that  refers  to  traditions  of  refinement  and  high  civ- 
ilization. The  dances,  music,  and  literature  of  Java  and  Bali  and  the 
great  monuments  associated  with  these  islands'  religion  are  often 
described  as  examples  of  "culture"  or  "civilization"  but  not  "cus- 
tom" (or  adat).  However,  as  the  following  descriptions  show,  the 
variety  of  sources  of  local  identification  underscore  the  diversity 
rather  than  the  unity  of  the  Indonesian  population. 

Javanese 

There  are  approximately  83  million  Javanese,  the  majority  of 
whom  live  in  Jawa  Timur  and  Jawa  Tengah  provinces;  most  of  the 
rest  live  in  Jawa  Barat  Province  and  on  Sumatra,  Kalimantan, 
Sulawesi,  and  other  islands.  (Altogether,  some  110  million  people 
live  on  Java.)  Although  many  Javanese  express  pride  at  the  grand 
achievements  of  the  illustrious  courts  of  Surakarta  and  Yogyakarta 
and  admire  the  traditional  arts  associated  with  them,  most  Javanese 
tend  to  identify  not  with  that  elite  tradition,  or  even  with  a  lineage  or 
clan,  but  with  their  own  village  of  residence  or  origin.  These  vil- 
lages, or  desa,  are  typically  situated  on  the  edge  of  rice  fields,  sur- 
rounding a  mosque,  or  strung  along  a  road. 

Most  Javanese  villages  are  divided  into  smaller  administrative 
units,  each  known  as  either  a  rukun  kampung  (village  mutual  assis- 
tance association)  or  rukun  tetangga  (neighborhood  association). 
Rukun  is  an  important  Javanese  word  of  Arabic  origin  describing 
both  "state  of  being  and  a  mode  of  action  ....  a  state  in  which  all  par- 
ties are  at  least  overtly  at  social  peace  with  one  another,"  according 
to  anthropologist  Robert  Jay;  it  is  "a  process  of  sharing  through  col- 
lective action."  Anthropologist  Mary  Hawkins  has  argued  that  while 
modern  forms  of  contract  labor  and  technology  may  have  eroded  the 
rural  communalism  implied  in  earlier  senses  of  rukun,  the  term 
remains  important  as  an  ideological  construct  for  representing  val- 
ued aspects  of  collective  life.  Australian  anthropologist  Patrick 
Guinness  has  written  that  the  neighborhood  is  the  "largest  social 
grouping,  whose  members  participate  in  household  rituals,  gather  for 
rituals,  organize  working  bees,  whose  youth  band  together  for  sports 
teams  and  organizations,  who  maintain  arisan  (rotating  credit  asso- 


132 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


ciations)  and  who  hold  certain  property  such  as  funeral  equipment." 
In  rural  areas,  these  groups  also  sometimes  collaborate  on  harvesting 
their  rice.  The  rukun  associations  were  rooted  in  the  ideals  of  the 
family  but  became  official  administrative  units  during  the  Japanese 
occupation  in  World  War  II.  Many  of  these  local  communities  orga- 
nized security  arrangements  called  ronda  malam  (night  watches). 
Neighbors  watched  closely  for  any  suspicious  activity  and  partici- 
pated vigorously  in  the  apprehension  of  thieves,  even  exacting 
immediate  justice  on  their  own.  The  heads  of  these  organizations 
were  elected  or  appointed  officials  and  were  considered  representa- 
tives of  the  government. 

Differences  in  social  class  are  less  elaborate  and  less  pronounced 
in  Javanese  rural  villages  than  in  urban  areas.  In  villages  where  land 
is  relatively  evenly  distributed,  some  form  of  mutual  labor  exchange 
is  common;  in  villages  where  there  are  large  numbers  of  landless 
peasants,  however,  there  also  are  relationships  of  a  clear  client-patron 
nature  with  landowners,  who  themselves  rarely  own  more  than  two 
hectares.  In  urban  centers,  the  distinctions  among  a  refined,  tradi- 
tional elite,  an  intermediate-level  bourgeoisie  sharing  patterns  of  con- 
sumption, and  a  more  collectivist  peasantry  are  more  pronounced. 

Leaders  are  usually  male,  in  both  the  village  and  the  urban  neigh- 
borhood. Although  some  are  political  appointees,  these  leaders  are 
theoretically  chosen  by  popular  consensus.  This  consensus  system 
proceeds — ideally — through  a  discussion  of  different  points  of  view, 
after  which  a  senior-level  participant  makes  a  final  decision.  Although 
there  is  increasing  acceptance  of  competitive  elections,  in  many  deci- 
sion-making contexts  it  is  not  uncommon  to  make  use  of  a  process 
referred  to  as  musyawarah  mufakat  (deliberation  with  consensus). 

Javanese  kinship  ties  are  reckoned  through  the  mother  and  father 
equally.  The  nuclear  family  of  mother,  father,  and  children  is  more  or 
less  independent;  formal  obligations  between  kin  groups  are  not 
much  greater  than  in  Western  societies.  The  reduced  occurrence  of 
divorce — rates  were  as  high  as  60  percent  in  some  areas  in  the 
1960s — has  made  the  shifting  of  responsibility  for  children — partic- 
ularly among  the  mother's  kin — less  likely  in  recent  years.  This 
three-decade  trend  toward  more  stable  marriages  is  attributed  to  rises 
in  the  level  of  educational  attainment,  age  at  first  marriage,  and 
income  level.  Migrations  during  the  1997-98  financial  crisis  took  a 
toll  on  marriages,  but  stricter  laws  and  a  more  conservative  religious 
ethos  have  mitigated  some  of  those  effects.  Javanese  have  no  clans, 
lineages,  or  other  kin-based  social  groupings  that,  among  some  other 
ethnic  groups,  form  the  basis  of  corporate  entities  such  as  family 
businesses.  Sons  tend  to  treat  their  fathers  with  great  formality  and 


133 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

deference.  Although  the  mother  is  the  focus  of  the  family  in  many 
respects — she  usually  handles  the  finances — she  is  often  depicted  as 
suffering  the  most  when  the  family  experiences  any  loss.  She  is  usu- 
ally the  one  who  disciplines  the  children,  while  the  father  is  mostly 
occupied  outside  the  home. 

The  Javanese  view  childhood  as  a  series  of  shocks  from  which 
children  must  be  protected.  Although  the  youngest  children  are 
much  indulged,  major  transitions  can  be  sharp  and  radical.  The  pro- 
cess of  weaning,  for  instance,  is  traditionally  a  rapid  one  in  which 
the  mother  simply  leaves  the  child  with  a  relative  and  then  returns  a 
few  days  later.  Overall,  however,  a  baby's  general  contentment  and 
resistance  to  disease  and  misfortune  are  viewed  as  dependent  on  the 
child's  being  protected  from  any  form  of  emotional  upset.  Babies  are 
constantly  held  and  nursed  on  demand;  babies  must  not  be  disap- 
pointed. Once  weaned,  they  are  often  released  into  the  care  of  an 
older  sibling  or  relative  who  indulges  and  protects  them. 

Children  become  increasingly  capable  of  withstanding  the  shocks 
and  stresses  of  life  as  they  grow  older,  in  part  because  they  have 
become  more  aware  of  the  rules  defining  social  interaction.  The  rules 
of  etiquette  help  a  child  learn  self-control.  For  example,  children  must 
learn  to  address  their  father  respectfully,  using  refined  speech.  Failure 
to  comply  properly  with  the  rules  will  result  in  a  sharp  reprimand.  For 
Javanese,  learning  the  proper  degree  of  shame,  according  to  anthro- 
pologist Ward  Keeler,  is  a  matter  of  becoming  aware  of  one's  vulnera- 
bility in  interaction.  Children  learn  that  dealing  with  others  in  a  face- 
to-face  encounter  always  poses  a  threat  to  one's  sense  of  self. 

Many  of  the  rules  of  etiquette  center  on  the  proper  use  of  lan- 
guage, which  is  more  problematic  in  Javanese  than  in  most  other  lan- 
guages. When  addressing  someone,  Javanese  speakers  must  choose 
from  several  different  levels  of  politeness.  These  "speech  levels" 
comprise  words  that  have  the  same  meaning  but  are  stylistically  dif- 
ferent. For  instance,  among  the  Javanese  variations  of  the  word 
"now,"  saiki  is  the  least  refined,  while  saniki  is  a  little  fancier,  and 
samenika  is  the  most  elegant.  Javanese  has  many  such  triads — so 
many  that  people  cannot  speak  for  long  in  the  language  without  hav- 
ing to  decide  whether  the  situation  is  formal  or  informal  and  what 
the  relations  among  the  participants  are. 

People  generally  use  the  highest  level  of  language  to  speak  to 
high-status  people  in  formal  situations  and  the  lower  levels  to  speak 
to  people  of  lower  rank  or  with  whom  they  are  most  intimate. 
Although  children  learn  to  speak  at  the  lowest  level  first,  they  gradu- 
ally are  socialized  to  speak  to  some  of  their  more  distant  kin  and 
respected  strangers  in  higher-level  forms  of  Javanese.  This  formality

is  particularly  common  in  cities,  where  there  are  marked  distinctions 
in  status.  However,  there  is  evidence  that  these  practices  are  slowly 
changing.  Many  children  who  go  elsewhere  in  Indonesia  for  work  or 
school  or  who  live  overseas  refuse  to  write  letters  home  to  their  elders 
in  Javanese  because  of  their  fear  of  making  a  glaring  error.  Increas- 
ingly, in  formal  situations,  they  use  Bahasa  Indonesia  because  they 
are  no  longer  sure  of  the  social  situation  at  home.  Although  Bahasa 
Indonesia  possesses  a  relatively  simple  system  for  indicating  status 
distinctions,  it  is  regarded  as  a  foreign  idiom  among  many  Javanese. 

An  expectation  that  women  would  use  the  higher  levels  more  than 
men  would  be  valid  within  the  domestic  environment — and  primar- 
ily for  the  purpose  of  showing  deference  among  their  relatives.  Men 
use  more  politeness  levels  in  public  than  women  do.  Moreover,  in 
the  public  sphere,  the  use  of  Javanese  politeness  levels  is  not  so 
much  associated  with  humility  as  it  is  with  efforts  to  raise  oneself 
above  another.  Men  are  more  likely  to  see  the  use  of  politeness  lev- 
els as  a  strategy  for  negotiating  status. 

There  is  great  diversity  among  Javanese  religious  practices. 
Although  most  Javanese  are  Muslims,  the  wide  variations  in  Islamic 
beliefs  and  practices  are  associated  with  complex  factors  such  as 
regional  history  and  social  class.  The  most  pious,  and  recognizably 
Muslim,  varieties  of  Javanese  religion  are  associated  with  the  santri 
tradition,  nurtured  by  traditional  Muslim  schools.  Santri  hold  more 
tightly  to  the  moralistic  tone  of  Islam  and  express  the  fundamental 
universalism  of  its  teachings.  They  may  make  a  pilgrimage  (hajj  in 
Indonesian)  to  Mecca,  teach  their  children  the  Quran,  and  work  for 
the  social,  spiritual,  and  even  political  advancement  of  the  ummah. 
In  contrast  to  the  santri  tradition,  varieties  of  kejawen  ("Javanist") 
religious  practice  variously  incorporate  pre-Islamic,  animistic,  and 
aesthetic  forms  of  spirituality.  Although  some  observers  have  distin- 
guished between  elite  and  common  varieties  of  kejawen  practice, 
many  now  see  the  traditional  aristocracy  and  peasantry  losing  their 
distinctiveness  in  this  regard.  Religiosity  is  expressed  through  fasts, 
trances,  visits  to  graves,  and  performance  genres  such  as  wayang 
kulit  (a  form  of  shadow  theater  employing  flat  leather  puppets),  con- 
certs by  gamelans  (Javanese  orchestras  featuring  percussive  instru- 
ments), dance,  and  other  arts  of  the  courtly  tradition,  which  are 
widely  appreciated  by  the  Javanese  community  as  a  whole. 

Most  observers  of  Javanese  religion  agree  that  the  core  Javanese 
religious  ritual  is  a  brief  feast  known  as  the  slametan.  Neighbors,  rel- 
atives, and  coworkers  may  be  invited  to  attend  on  the  occasion  of  a 
birth,  marriage,  death,  or  change  in  status.  The  host  typically  gives  a 
speech  in  high  Javanese  explaining  the  purpose  of  the  event  to  the

guests,  after  which  some  incense  is  burned,  a  prayer  is  recited  in 
Arabic,  and  the  special  festive  food  is  consumed,  at  least  in  part. 
Then,  what  is  left  is  divided  among  the  guests  and  taken  home. 
Believers  seek  to  protect  themselves  against  harmful  spirits  by  mak- 
ing offerings,  enlisting  the  aid  of  a  dukun  (healer),  or  engaging  in 
spiritual  acts  of  self-control  and  right  thinking. 

Balinese 

There  is  probably  no  group  in  Indonesia  more  conscious  of  its 
own  ethnic  identity  than  the  nearly  3  million  Balinese.  Inhabitants  of 
the  islands  of  Bali  and  Lombok  and  the  western  half  of  Sumbawa, 
Balinese  are  often  portrayed  as  a  graceful,  poised,  and  aesthetically 
inclined  people.  Although  such  descriptions  date  back  six  centuries 
or  more  and  are  at  least  partially  based  on  legend,  this  characteriza- 
tion is  also  partly  based  on  the  realities  in  contemporary  Indonesia. 
Virtually  no  part  of  Bali  has  escaped  the  gaze  of  tourists,  who  come 
in  increasing  numbers  each  year  to  enjoy  the  island's  beautiful 
beaches  and  stately  temples  and  to  seek  out  an  "authentic"  experi- 
ence of  its  "traditional"  culture.  The  market  for  "traditional"  carv- 
ings, dance  performances,  and  paintings  has  boomed,  and  many 
Balinese  successfully  reinvest  their  earnings  in  further  development 
of  these  highly  profitable  art  forms. 

Balinese  have  a  long  history  of  contrasting  themselves  profitably 
with  outsiders.  The  contemporary  distinctive  Hindu  religious  prac- 
tices of  the  Balinese  date  back  at  least  to  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth 
centuries,  when  Javanese  princes  from  Majapahit  fled  the  advances 
of  Islam  and  sought  refuge  in  Bali,  where  they  were  absorbed  into 
the  local  culture.  Since  that  time,  Balinese,  with  the  exception  of  a 
minority  of  Muslims  in  the  north,  have  maintained  great  pride  in 
their  own  distinctiveness  from  the  surrounding  Muslim  cultures. 
Since  the  terrorist  bombing  of  two  nightclubs  in  the  Balinese  beach 
town  of  Kuta  in  2002  by  Muslim  extremists,  tensions  between  Bali- 
nese and  non-Balinese  Muslims  have  increased. 

Balinese  society  is  stratified,  as  with  the  Javanese.  In  Balinese 
society,  however,  the  social  hierarchy  is  described  in  distinctly 
Hindu  terms:  there  is  a  small  hereditary  Brahman  class,  as  well  as 
small  groups  of  Vaishya  and  Kshatriya  classes.  However,  the  Bali- 
nese caste  system  involves  no  occupational  specializations  or  ideas 
about  ritual  contamination  between  the  ranks.  It  does  not  prohibit 
marriage  between  ranks  but  does  forbid  women  to  marry  beneath 
their  class.  The  vast  majority  of  Balinese,  including  many  wealthy 
entrepreneurs  and  prominent  politicians,  belong  to  the  Shudra  (com- 
moner-servant) class.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Unlike  most  Javanese,  Balinese  participate  enthusiastically  in 
several  interlocking  corporate  groups  beyond  the  immediate  family. 
One  of  the  most  important  of  these  is  the  dadia,  or  patrilineal 
descent  group.  This  is  a  group  of  people  who  claim  descent  through 
the  male  line  from  a  common  ancestor.  The  group  maintains  a  tem- 
ple to  that  ancestor,  a  treasury  to  support  rituals  associated  with  it, 
and  certain  chosen  leaders.  The  prestige  of  a  dadia  depends  in  part 
on  how  widespread  and  powerful  its  members  are.  However,  most  of 
these  organized  groups  tend  to  be  localized,  because  it  is  easier  to 
maintain  local  support  for  their  activities  and  temple.  Balinese  prefer 
to  draw  spouses  from  within  this  group.  These  corporate  kin  groups 
can  also  be  the  basis  for  organizing  important  economic  activities, 
such  as  carving  cooperatives,  gold-  and  silversmithing  cooperatives, 
painting  studios,  and  dance  troupes. 

Another  important  affiliation  for  Balinese  is  with  the  banjar,  or 
village  compound,  which  overlaps  with,  but  is  not  identical  to,  the 
dadia.  The  banjar  and  the  dadia  share  responsibility  for  security,  eco- 
nomic cooperation  in  the  tourist  trade,  and  the  formation  of  inter- 
village  alliances.  The  banjar  is  a  council  of  household  heads  and 
oversees  marriage,  divorce,  and  inheritance  transactions.  In  addition, 
it  is  the  unit  for  mobilizing  resources  and  labor  for  the  spectacular 
cremations  for  which  Bali  has  become  increasingly  well  known.  Each 
banjar  may  have  individual  orchestra,  dance,  and  weaving  clubs. 

Yet  another  important  corporate  group  is  the  agricultural  society, 
or  subak,  each  of  which  corresponds  to  a  section  of  wet-rice  paddies. 
Each  subak  is  not  only  a  congregation  of  members  who  are  jointly 
responsible  for  sacrificing  at  a  temple  placed  in  the  center  of  their 
particular  group  of  paddies,  but  also  a  unit  that  organizes  the  flow  of 
water,  planting,  and  harvesting.  Because  50  or  more  societies  some- 
times tap  into  a  common  stream  of  water  for  the  irrigation  of  their 
land,  complex  coordination  of  planting  and  harvesting  schedules  is 
required.  This  complexity  arises  because  each  subak  is  independent. 
Although  the  government  has  attempted  periodically  to  take  control 
of  the  irrigation  schedule,  these  efforts  have  produced  mixed  results, 
leading  to  a  successful  movement  in  the  early  1990s  to  return  the 
authority  for  the  agricultural  schedule  to  the  traditional  and  highly 
successful  interlocking  subak  arrangement. 

The  very  complexity  of  Balinese  social  organization  has  provided 
it  with  the  flexibility  to  adapt  to  the  pressures  of  modern  life  and  its 
requirements  for  the  accumulation,  distribution,  and  mobilization  of 
capital  and  technological  resources.  Although  the  Balinese  remain 
self-consciously  "traditional,"  they  have  been  neither  rigid  in  that 
tradition  nor  resistant  to  change.

Peoples  of  Sumatra 

The  large  island  of  Sumatra  forms  the  southwestern  shore  of  the 
Strait  of  Malacca.  Although  nearly  all  of  the  approximately  20  eth- 
nolinguistic  groups  of  Sumatra  are  devout  practitioners  of  Islam, 
they  nonetheless  differ  strikingly  from  one  another,  particularly  in 
their  family  structures. 

Acehnese 

Residing  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh,  Sumatra's  northernmost 
provincial-level  jurisdiction,  the  more  than  2  million  Acehnese  are 
most  famous  throughout  the  archipelago  for  their  devotion  to  Islam, 
their  militant  resistance  to  colonial  and  republican  rule,  and  their 
tragic  experience  as  victims  of  the  tsunami  that  struck  Aceh's  west- 
ern coast  on  December  26,  2004.  Although  the  Acehnese  were 
renowned  throughout  the  nineteenth  century  for  their  pepper  planta- 
tions, most  are  now  rice  growers  in  the  coastal  regions. 

Acehnese  do  not  have  large  descent  groups;  the  nuclear  family 
consisting  of  mother,  father,  and  children  is  the  central  social  unit. 
Unlike  that  of  the  Javanese  or  Balinese,  the  Acehnese  family  system 
shows  marked  separation  of  men's  and  women's  spheres  of  activity. 
Traditionally,  males  are  directed  outward  toward  the  world  of  trade. 
In  the  practice  of  merantau — going  away  from  one's  birthplace  in 
order  to  return  later — young  adult  males  seek  fortune,  experience, 
and  commercial  repute.  This  may  involve  travel  to  another  village, 
province,  or  island.  This  maturation  process  among  males  is  viewed 
as  growing  out  of  the  domestic  female-dominated  world  of  sensory 
indulgence  and  into  the  male  world  of  reasoned  rationality,  the  prac- 
tice of  which  is  expressed  through  trade.  One  model  of  Acehnese 
family  life  is  that  a  woman  sends  a  man  out  of  the  house  to  trade  and 
welcomes  him  back  when  he  brings  home  money.  When  he  has 
exhausted  his  money,  she  sends  him  out  again.  Meanwhile,  women 
and  their  kin  are  responsible  for  working  the  fields  and  keeping  the 
gardens  and  rice  fields  productive.  This  oscillating  pattern  of  migra- 
tion encountered  some  difficulties  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  as  increas- 
ing numbers  of  men  failed  to  return  to  the  Acehnese  homeland, 
instead  remaining  and  marrying  in  remote  locations,  such  as  Jakarta 
or  Kalimantan.  In  addition,  many  Acehnese  felt  pressure  from  the 
continuing  influx  of  temporary  workers  seeking  employment  in  the 
natural  gas  and  timber  industries,  and  the  conflict  between  the  Indo- 
nesian army  and  Acehnese  separatists. 

The  August  16,  2005,  peace  agreement  between  the  Free  Aceh 
Movement  (GAM)  and  the  Indonesian  central  government  was  pro- 
pelled by  the  desire  on  both  sides  to  smooth  the  flow  of  aid  to  victims 


139

of  the  December  2004  tsunami.  The  rebels  dropped  their  secession 
demands,  and  the  government  agreed  to  give  them  some  form  of 
political  representation.  Since  2006  ex-GAM  members  have  been 
elected  as  governor  and  to  many  lower-level  posts  in  Aceh,  and  by 
2009  the  remnants  of  GAM  had  splintered  into  several  parties. 

Batak 

The  term  "Batak"  designates  any  one  of  several  groups  inhabiting 
the  interior  of  Sumatera  Utara  Province,  south  of  Aceh:  the  Angkola, 
Karo,  Mandailing,  Pakpak,  Simalungun,  Toba,  and  others.  The 
Batak  number  around  6  million  and  are  mostly  Christian,  with  some 
Muslim  groups  in  the  south  and  east.  Historically  isolated  from 
Hindu-Buddhist  and  Muslim  influence,  they  bear  closer  resemblance 
culturally  to  highland  swidden  cultivators  elsewhere  in  Southeast 
Asia,  even  though  most  practice  wet-rice  farming.  Unlike  the  Bali- 
nese,  who  have  several  different  traditional  group  affiliations  at 
once,  or  the  Javanese,  who  affiliate  with  their  village  or  neighbor- 
hood, the  Batak  traditionally  orient  themselves  primarily  to  the 
marga,  a  landowning  patrilineal  descent  group.  Traditionally,  each 
marga  is  a  wife-giving  and  wife-taking  unit.  Whereas  a  young  man 
takes  a  wife  from  his  mother's  clan  (men  must  seek  wives  outside 
their  own  marga),  a  young  woman  marries  into  a  clan  within  which 
her  paternal  aunts  live. 

The  marga  has  proved  to  be  a  flexible  social  unit  in  contemporary 
Indonesian  society.  Batak  who  resettle  in  urban  areas,  such  as  Medan 
or  Jakarta,  draw  on  marga  affiliations  for  financial  support  and  polit- 
ical alliances.  While  many  of  the  corporate  aspects  of  the  marga 
have  undergone  major  changes,  Batak  migrants  to  other  areas  of 
Indonesia  retain  pride  in  their  ethnic  identity.  Batak  have  shown 
themselves  to  be  creative  in  drawing  on  modern  media  to  codify, 
express,  and  preserve  their  "traditional"  adat.  Anthropologist  Susan 
Rodgers  has  shown  how  audiotaped  cassette  dramas  with  some 
soap-opera  elements  circulated  widely  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  in  the 
Batak  region  to  dramatize  the  moral  and  cultural  dilemmas  of  one's 
kinship  obligations  in  a  rapidly  changing  world.  In  addition,  Batak 
have  been  prodigious  producers  of  written  handbooks  designed  to 
show  young,  urbanized,  and  secular  lineage  members  how  to  navi- 
gate the  complexities  of  their  marriage  and  funeral  customs. 

Minangkabau 

The  Minangkabau — who  predominate  in  the  coastal  areas  of 
Sumatera  Utara  Province,  Sumatera  Barat  Province,  the  interior  of 
Riau  Province,  and  northern  Bengkulu  Province — number  more  than 


140 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


5.4  million.  Like  the  Batak,  they  have  large  corporate  descent 
groups,  but  unlike  the  Batak,  the  Minangkabau  traditionally  reckon 
descent  matrilineally.  A  young  boy,  for  instance,  has  his  primary 
responsibility  to  his  mother's  and  sisters'  clans.  It  is  considered 
"customary"  and  ideal  for  married  sisters  to  remain  in  their  parental 
home,  with  their  husbands  having  a  sort  of  visiting  status.  Not  every- 
one lives  up  to  this  ideal,  however.  In  the  1990s,  anthropologist  Eve- 
lyn Blackwood  studied  a  relatively  conservative  village  in  Sumatera 
Barat  where  only  about  22  percent  of  the  households  were  "matri- 
houses,"  consisting  of  a  mother  and  a  married  daughter  or  daughters. 
Nonetheless,  there  is  a  shared  ideal  among  Minangkabau  in  which 
sisters  and  unmarried  lineage  members  try  to  live  close  to  one 
another  or  even  in  the  same  house. 

Landholding  is  one  of  the  crucial  functions  of  the  suku  (female  lin- 
eage unit).  Because  Minangkabau  men,  like  Acehnese  men,  often 
migrate  to  seek  experience,  wealth,  and  commercial  success,  the 
women's  kin  group  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the  continuity  of  the 
family  and  the  distribution  and  cultivation  of  the  land.  These  family 
groups,  however,  are  typically  led  by  a  penghulu  (headman),  elected 
by  groups  of  lineage  leaders.  With  the  agrarian  base  of  the  Minangka- 
bau economy  in  decline,  the  suku — as  a  landholding  unit — has  also 
been  declining  somewhat  in  importance,  especially  in  urban  areas. 
Indeed,  the  position  of  penghulu  is  not  always  filled  after  the  death  of 
the  incumbent,  particularly  if  lineage  members  are  not  willing  to  bear 
the  expense  of  the  ceremony  required  to  install  a  new  penghulu. 

The  traditions  of  sharia — in  which  inheritance  laws  favor  males — 
and  indigenous  female-oriented  adat  are  often  depicted  as  conflict- 
ing forces  in  Minangkabau  society.  The  male-oriented  sharia  appears 
to  offer  young  men  something  of  a  balance  against  the  dominance  of 
law  in  local  villages,  which  forces  a  young  man  to  wait  passively  for 
a  marriage  proposal  from  some  young  woman's  family.  By  acquiring 
property  and  education  through  merantau  experience,  a  young  man 
can  attempt  to  influence  his  own  destiny  in  positive  ways. 

Increasingly,  married  couples  go  off  on  merantau;  in  such  situa- 
tions, the  woman's  role  tends  to  change.  When  married  couples 
reside  in  urban  areas  or  outside  the  Minangkabau  region,  women 
lose  some  of  their  social  and  economic  rights  in  property.  One  appar- 
ent consequence  is  an  increased  likelihood  of  divorce. 

Minangkabau  were  prominent  among  the  intellectual  figures  in 
the  Indonesian  independence  movement.  Not  only  were  they 
strongly  Islamic,  they  spoke  a  language  closely  related  to  Bahasa 
Indonesia,  which  was  considerably  freer  of  hierarchical  connotations 
than  Javanese.  Partly  because  of  their  tradition  of  merantau, 


141 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Minangkabau  developed  a  cosmopolitan  bourgeoisie  that  readily 
adopted  and  promoted  the  ideas  of  an  emerging  nation-state. 

Ethnic  Minorities 

In  Indonesia,  the  concept  of  ethnic  minorities  is  often  discussed 
not  in  numerical  but  in  religious  terms.  Although  the  major  ethnic 
groups  claim  adherence  to  one  of  the  major  world  religions  (agama) 
recognized  by  the  Department  of  Religious  Affairs — Islam,  Christi- 
anity, Hinduism,  Buddhism,, and  Daoism — millions  of  other  Indone- 
sians engage  in  religious  or  cultural  practices  that  fall  outside  these 
categories.  These  practices  are  sometimes  labeled  animist  or  kafir 
(pagan).  In  general,  these  Indonesians  inhabit  the  more  remote, 
sparsely  populated  islands  of  the  archipelago.  Following  the  massacre 
of  tens  of  thousands  associated  with  the  alleged  1965  coup  attempt  by 
"atheist"  communists,  mandatory  religious  affiliation  became  an  even 
more  intense  political  issue  among  minority  groups.  The  groups 
described  in  the  following  sections  represent  a  broad  sample,  chosen 
for  their  geographic  and  cultural  diversity. 

Toraja 

The  Toraja  of  Sulawesi  Selatan,  Sulawesi  Barat,  and  Sulawesi 
Tengah  provinces  are  one  minority  group  that  has  been  successful  in 
gaining  national  and  international  attention.  This  group  became 
prominent  in  the  1980s,  largely  because  of  the  tourist  industry,  which 
was  attracted  to  the  region  because  of  the  picturesque  villages  and 
the  group's  spectacular  mortuary  rites  involving  the  slaughter  of 
water  buffalo. 

Inhabiting  the  wet,  rugged  mountains  of  the  interior  of  southern 
Sulawesi,  the  Toraja  grow  rice  for  subsistence  and  coffee  for  cash. 
Traditionally,  they  lived  in  fortified  hilltop  villages  with  from  two  to 
40  houses  featuring  large,  dramatically  sweeping  roofs  resembling 
buffalo  horns.  Until  the  late  1960s,  many  of  these  villages  were 
politically  and  economically  self-sufficient.  This  autonomy  devel- 
oped in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  partly  as 
protection  against  the  depredations  of  the  slave  trade  and  partly  as  a 
result  of  intervillage  feuding  associated  with  headhunting. 

The  Toraja  have  strong  emotional,  economic,  and  political  ties  to  a 
number  of  different  kinds  of  corporate  groups.  The  most  basic  tie  is 
that  of  the  rarabuku,  which  might  be  translated  as  "family."  Toraja 
view  this  grouping  as  encompassing  relations  of  "blood  and  bone," 
that  is,  relations  between  parents  and  children — the  nuclear  family. 
Since  Toraja  reckon  kinship  bilaterally,  through  both  mother  and 
father,  the  possibilities  for  extending  the  concept  of  rarabuku  in  sev- 


142 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


eral  different  directions  are  many.  Another  important  kind  of  group 
with  which  Toraja  have  close  affiliations  is  the  tongkonan  (ancestral 
house),  which  contrasts  with  the  banua  (ordinary  house).  The  tong- 
konan is  a  group  of  people  who  reckon  descent  from  an  original 
ancestor.  The  physical  structures  belonging  to  the  tongkonan  are  peri- 
odically renewed  by  replacing  their  distinctively  shaped  roofs.  This 
ritual  is  attended  by  members  of  the  social  group  and  accompanied  by 
trancelike  dances  in  which  the  spirits  are  asked  to  visit.  A  third 
important  kind  of  affiliation  is  the  saroan,  or  village  work  group, 
originally  probably  an  agricultural  work  group  based  in  a  particular 
hamlet.  Beginning  as  a  medium  for  labor  and  credit  exchange,  the 
saroan  has  since  evolved  into  a  unit  of  cooperation  in  ritual  activities 
as  well.  When  sacrifices  and  funerals  take  place,  groups  of  saroan 
exchange  meat  and  other  foods. 

The  flexibility  of  these  affiliations  is  partly  responsible  for  the 
intensity  of  the  mortuary  performances.  Because  there  is  some  ambi- 
guity about  one's  affiliation  (that  is,  one's  claims  to  descent  are  not 
only  based  on  blood  relationships  but  also  on  social  recognition  of  the 
relationship  through  public  acts),  Toraja  may  attempt  to  demonstrate 
the  importance  of  a  relationship  through  elaborate  contributions  to  a 
funeral,  which  provides  an  opportunity  not  only  to  show  devotion  to  a 
deceased  parent  but  also  to  claim  a  share  of  that  parent's  land.  The 
amount  of  land  an  individual  inherits  from  the  deceased  might 
depend  on  the  number  of  buffalo  sacrificed  at  that  person's  funeral. 
Sometimes  people  even  pawn  land  to  get  buffalo  to  kill  at  a  funeral  so 
that  they  can  claim  the  land  of  the  deceased.  Thus,  feasting  at  funerals 
is  highly  competitive. 

With  the  oil  boom  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  there  was  massive  out- 
migration  among  young  upland  Sulawesi  men  looking  for  jobs  in 
northeastern  Kalimantan.  During  this  period,  many  of  these  youths 
became  Christians.  Although  proselytization  began  among  Toraja  in 
the  nineteenth  century,  mass  conversions  were  provoked  after  the 
abortive  1965  coup  and  mass  labor  migrations  in  the  1970s  and  1980s, 
a  move  that  implied  a  rejection  of  many  Toraja  beliefs  and  practices. 
But  when  these  migrants  returned  to  their  villages  as  wealthy  men, 
they  often  wanted  to  hold  large  status  displays  in  the  form  of  funerals, 
causing  what  anthropologist  Toby  Alice  Volkman  has  called  "ritual 
inflation"  as  well  as  intense  debates  about  the  authenticity  of  their 
conversion  to  Christianity.  Because  of  the  successful  efforts  of  highly 
placed  Toraja  officials  in  the  central  government,  Toraja  feasting  prac- 
tices have  been  granted  official  status,  loosely  described  as  agama 
Hindu.

Dayak 

Another  group  of  ethnic  minorities  struggling  for  recognition  are 
the  peoples  of  southern,  central,  and  eastern  Kalimantan.  From  an 
outsider's  perspective,  most  of  the  scattered  ethnolinguistic  groups 
inhabiting  the  interior  of  the  vast  island  have  been  referred  to  as 
Dayak.  The  word  is  a  collective  term  used  by  outsiders  since  1836  to 
indicate  the  indigenous  peoples  of  Kalimantan.  Among  the  people 
labeled  as  Dayak,  however,  one  finds  Ngaju  Dayak,  Maanyan,  and 
Lawangan,  among  others.  Although  they  reside  in  longhouses  that 
traditionally  served  as  a  means  of  protection  against  slave  raiding 
and  intervillage  conflict,  the  Dayak  are  not  communalistic.  They 
have  bilateral  kinship,  and  the  basic  unit  of  ownership  and  social 
organization  is  the  nuclear  family.  The  various  Dayak  peoples  have 
typically  made  a  living  through  swidden  agriculture.  In  regard  to 
religion,  they  tend  to  practice  either  Protestantism  or  Kaharingan,  a 
form  of  indigenous  religious  practice  blending  animism  and  ancestor 
worship  classified  by  the  government  as  Hindu.  The  Dayak  perform 
elaborate  death  ceremonies  in  which  the  bones  are  disinterred  for 
secondary  reburial. 

Through  its  healing  performances,  Kaharingan  serves  to  mold  the 
scattered  agricultural  residences  into  a  community,  and  it  is  at  times 
of  ritual  that  the  Dayak  peoples  coalesce  as  a  group.  There  is  no  set 
ritual  leader,  nor  is  there  a  fixed  ritual  presentation.  Specific  ceremo- 
nies may  be  held  in  the  home  of  the  sponsor.  Shamanic  curing,  or 
balian,  is  one  of  the  core  features  of  these  ritual  practices.  Because 
illness  is  thought  to  result  in  a  loss  of  the  soul,  the  ritual  healing 
practices  are  devoted  to  its  spiritual  and  ceremonial  retrieval.  In  gen- 
eral, religious  practices  focus  on  the  body,  and  on  the  health  of  the 
body  politic  more  broadly.  Sickness  results  from  giving  offense  to 
one  of  the  many  spirits  inhabiting  the  earth  and  fields,  usually  from  a 
failure  to  sacrifice  to  them.  The  goal  of  the  balian  is  to  call  back  the 
wayward  soul  and  restore  the  health  of  the  community  through 
trance,  dance,  and  possession. 

Following  the  fall  of  Suharto  in  1998,  reassertions  of  ethnic  iden- 
tity and  land  claims  caused  tensions  leading  to  violence  with  Muslim 
migrants.  Violent  clashes  between  Dayaks  and  migrants  had  started 
even  earlier,  in  December  1996,  when  a  Madurese  migrant  accused 
of  raping  a  Dayak  woman  was  killed,  and  province-wide  rioting 
occurred.  In  the  following  months,  violence  escalated,  troops  were 
flown  in,  a  crackdown  took  place,  and  the  cycle  of  violence  contin- 
ued with  schools,  homes,  and  businesses  burned  by  Dayaks  and 
migrants  in  retaliation  against  one  another.  Hundreds  died  in  these 
clashes,  and  thousands  were  displaced  or  reported  missing.

Long-simmering  feuds  between  Dayaks  and  mostly  Madurese 
Muslim  migrants  erupted  again  over  issues  of  land  and  economic 
competition  in  mid-2001,  causing  massive  displacements  of  popula- 
tion. Angry  Dayaks,  dressed  in  traditional  clothing,  sometimes  flam- 
boyantly displayed  symbols  of  their  headhunting  tradition  in  gestures 
of  defiance  toward  what  they  perceived  as  a  flood  of  migrants  and 
toward  the  central  government  as  a  whole. 

Weyewa 

The  Weyewa  inhabit  the  western  highlands  of  Sumba  and  Nusa 
Tenggara  Timur  Province,  where  they  cultivate  rice,  corn,  and  cas- 
sava using  both  slash-and-burn  methods  and  continuous  irrigation  of 
paddy  fields.  They  supplement  this  income  through  the  sale  of  live- 
stock, coffee,  vanilla,  cloves,  and  their  distinctive  brightly  colored 
textiles. 

There  were  few  challenges  to  Weyewa  notions  of  political  and 
religious  identity  until  the  1970s.  Because  Sumba  is  a  rather  dry  and 
infertile  island,  located  away  from  the  ports  of  call  of  the  spice  trade, 
it  was  comparatively  insulated  from  the  Hindu-Buddhist,  Muslim, 
and  later  Dutch  influences,  each  of  which  helped  shape  the  character 


145 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

of  Indonesia's  cultures.  Each  Weyewa  belongs  to  a  kabizu,  a  patrilin- 
eal clan  whose  founding  ancestors  are  spirits  requiring  frequent  rit- 
ual propitiation,  gifts,  and  respect  in  exchange  for  continued 
prosperity  among  the  descendants.  Each  clan  is  headquartered  in  a 
fortified  hilltop  wanno  kalada  (ancestral  village);  the  most  tradi- 
tional villages  are  characterized  by  houses  with  spectacular  high- 
pointed  thatch  roofs.  Young  people  are  supposed  to  seek  spouses 
outside  their  clan,  and  clan  members  assist  with  the  often  substantial 
marriage  payments  that  are  required. 

The  Weyewa  system  of  ritual  production  and  exchange  began  to 
undergo  major  technological  development  and  an  economic  shift  in 
the  1970s  and  1980s  that  resulted  in  a  gradual  weakening  of  the 
authority  of  lineages.  With  greater  amounts  of  arable  land  available 
as  a  result  of  improved  irrigation  techniques  and  more  crops  pro- 
duced because  of  the  use  of  faster-growing  and  higher-yielding  vari- 
eties of  rice,  the  legal  and  cultural  rights  to  these  new  resources  came 
to  be  assigned  to  individuals  rather  than  to  clans.  Younger  farmers 
were  increasingly  reluctant  to  invest  in  costly,  large-scale  ritual 
feasts  honoring  the  spirits.  Meanwhile,  government  officials  put  fur- 
ther pressure  on  traditional  leaders  to  give  up  ritual  feasting  practices 
as  "wasteful"  and  "backward."  Furthermore,  as  with  the  Kaharingan 
adherents  of  Kalimantan,  failure  to  affiliate  with  an  approved  reli- 
gion was  regarded  as  potentially  treasonous.  Unlike  the  Toraja  and 
others,  however,  the  Weyewa  were  not  politically  organized  for  the 
preservation  of  their  indigenous  religion.  Most  people  simply  con- 
verted to  Christianity  as  a  symbolic  gesture  of  participation  in  the 
nation-state.  Indeed,  whole  villages  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s 
conducted  feasts  in  which  residents  settled  their  debts  with  ancestral 
spirits  and  became  Christians.  The  number  of  Weyewa  professing 
affiliation  with  the  Christian  religion  (either  Roman  Catholic  or  Cal- 
vinist  Protestant)  jumped  from  approximately  20  percent  in  1978  to 
more  than  90  percent  in  2005. 

Sumba  did  not  escape  violence  during  the  post- Suharto  reform 
period,  but  the  rioting  took  on  distinctive  forms.  Because  the  central 
government  was  generally  perceived  in  eastern  Indonesia  as  a  boun- 
tiful— if  inequitable — source  of  funds  for  education,  development, 
and  jobs,  the  collapse  of  central  authority  resulted  in  open  disputes. 
In  November  1998,  conflict  broke  out  along  ethnic  lines  as  Weyewa 
men  sought  to  defend  the  reputation  of  an  ethnic  Weyewa  govern- 
ment official  accused  of  corruption.  The  ensuing  riots  left  at  least  20 
people  dead  and  more  than  600  homes  destroyed.  The  public  perfor- 
mance of  peace  rituals  in  1999  began  a  slow,  painful  process  of 
rebuilding  trust  between  aggrieved  parties.

Asm  at 

The  approximately  65,000  Asmat  people  of  the  south-central  allu- 
vial swamps  of  Papua  Province  are  of  a  Papuan  genetic  heritage. 
They  live  in  villages  with  populations  that  vary  in  size  from  35  to 
2,000  inhabitants.  Until  the  1950s,  warfare,  headhunting,  and  canni- 
balism were  constant  features  of  Asmat  social  life.  The  people  would 
build  their  houses  along  river  bends  so  that  an  enemy  attack  could  be 
seen  in  advance.  Houses  in  coastal  areas  still  are  generally  built  on 
pilings  two  or  more  meters  high,  to  protect  residents  from  daily 
flooding  by  the  surging  tides  of  the  brackish  rivers.  In  the  foothills  of 
the  Jayawijaya  Mountains,  Asmat  live  in  tree  houses  that  are  five  to 
25  meters  off  the  ground.  In  some  areas,  they  also  build  arboreal 
watchtowers  as  much  as  30  meters  above  the  ground. 

The  Asmat  are  primarily  hunters  and  foragers  who  subsist  by  gath- 
ering and  processing  the  starchy  pulp  of  the  sago  palm,  finding  grubs, 
and  hunting  down  the  occasional  wild  pig,  cassowary,  or  crocodile. 
Although  the  Asmat  population  has  steadily  increased  since  coming 
into  contact  with  missionaries  and  government  health  workers,  the  for- 
est continues  to  yield  an  adequate  supply  and  variety  of  food.  Accord- 
ing to  anthropologist  Tobias  Schneebaum,  "Some  Asmat  have  learned 
to  grow  small  patches  of  vegetables,  such  as  string  beans,  and  a  few 
raise  the  descendants  of  recently  imported  chickens.  The  introduction 
of  a  limited  cash  economy  through  the  sale  of  logs  to  timber  compa- 
nies and  carvings  to  outsiders  has  led  many  Asmat  to  consider  as 
necessities  such  foods  as  rice  and  tinned  fish;  most  have  also  become 
accustomed  to  wearing  Western-style  clothing  and  using  metal  tools." 

Many  Asmat  have  converted  to  Christianity,  although  a  large 
number  continue  to  practice  the  religion  of  their  ancestors.  For 
example,  many  believe  that  all  deaths — except  those  of  the  very  old 
and  very  young — come  about  through  acts  of  malevolence,  either  by 
magic  or  actual  physical  force.  Ancestral  spirits  demand  vengeance 
for  these  deaths.  The  ancestors  to  whom  they  feel  obligated  are  rep- 
resented in  shields,  in  large,  spectacular  wood  carvings  of  canoes, 
and  in  ancestor  poles  consisting  of  human  figurines.  Until  the  late 
1980s,  the  preferred  way  for  a  young  man  to  fulfill  his  obligations  to 
his  kin  and  his  ancestors  and  prove  his  sexual  prowess  was  to  take 
the  head  of  an  enemy  and  offer  the  body  for  cannibalistic  consump- 
tion by  other  members  of  the  village. 

The  first  Dutch  colonial  government  post  was  not  established  in 
Asmat  territory  until  1938,  and  a  Catholic  mission  began  its  work 
there  only  in  1958,  but  the  pace  of  change  in  this  once  remote  region 
greatly  increased  after  the  1960s.  Beginning  in  the  early  1990s, 
many  Asmat  enrolled  their  children  in  Indonesian  schools,  and  many 


147 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

converted  to  Christianity.  As  large  timber,  oil,  and  mining  companies 
expanded  their  operations  in  the  region,  the  fragile,  low-lying  man- 
grove forests  that  were  home  to  many  Asmat  came  under  threat  from 
industrial  waste  and  soil  erosion.  The  Asmat  appear  to  be  gaining 
some  national  and  international  recognition  for  their  artwork;  how- 
ever, this  fame  has  not  resulted  in  their  acquiring  any  significant 
political  input  into  decisions  of  the  Indonesian  government  affecting 
the  use  of  land  in  traditional  Asmat  territory.  Although  there  is  cur- 
rently little  evidence  of  Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM)  activity 
among  the  Asmat,  there  has  been  a  history  of  resistance  to  logging 
companies  and  other  outside  intruders,  often  in  the  form  of  cargo 
cults  and  other  ritual  activity. 

Chinese 

Identifying  someone  in  Indonesia  as  a  member  of  the  Chinese 
(Tionghoa)  ethnic  group  is  not  an  easy  matter,  because  the  physical 
characteristics,  languages,  names,  areas  of  residence,  and  lifestyles 
of  Chinese  Indonesians  are  not  always  distinct  from  those  of  the  rest 
of  the  population.  The  national  census  does  not  record  the  Chinese  as 
a  special  group,  and  there  are  no  simple  racial  criteria  for  member- 
ship in  this  group.  There  are  some  people  who  consider  themselves 
Chinese  but  who,  as  a  result  of  intermarriage  with  the  local  popula- 
tion, are  less  than  one-quarter  Chinese  in  ancestry.  On  the  other 
hand,  there  are  some  people  who  by  ancestry  could  be  considered 
half-Chinese  or  more  but  who  regard  themselves  as  fully  Indonesian. 
Furthermore,  many  people  who  identify  themselves  as  Chinese  Indo- 
nesians cannot  read  or  write  the  Chinese  language. 

The  policy  of  the  Indonesian  government  by  the  early  1990s 
strongly  advocated  the  assimilation  of  the  Chinese  population  into 
the  communities  in  which  they  lived,  but  the  Chinese  had  a  long  his- 
tory of  enforced  separation  from  their  non-Chinese  neighbors.  For 
nearly  a  century  prior  to  1919,  Chinese  were  forced  to  live  in  sepa- 
rate urban  neighborhoods  and  could  travel  out  of  them  only  with 
government  permits.  Most  Chinese  continued  to  settle  in  urban  areas 
of  Indonesia  even  after  this  "quarter  system"  was  discontinued  in 
1919.  In  some  areas,  such  as  the  city  of  Pontianak  in  Kalimantan 
Barat  and  Bagansiapiapi  in  Riau  Province,  Chinese  even  came  to 
form  a  majority  of  the  population.  They  began  to  settle  in  rural  areas 
of  Java  in  the  1920s  and  1930s,  but  in  the  1960s  the  government 
again  prohibited  the  Chinese  from  exercising  free  choice  of  resi- 
dence, requiring  them  to  live  in  cities  and  towns. 

The  Chinese  who  immigrated  to  Indonesia  were  not  linguistically 
homogeneous.  The  dominant  languages  among  these  immigrants 
were  Hokkien,  Hakka,  and  Cantonese.  There  was  great  occupational

diversity  among  the  Chinese  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth 
centuries,  but  Dutch  colonial  policies  channeled  them  into  trade,  min- 
ing, or  skilled  artisanship.  In  the  twenty-first  century,  Chinese  con- 
tinue to  dominate  the  Indonesian  economy's  private  sector,  despite 
central  government  policies  designed  to  promote  non-Chinese  entre- 
preneurs. Nonetheless,  Chinese  are  not  a  monolithic  group.  Not  all  are 
rich  and  urban.  They  seldom  share  a  common  language  besides  Indo- 
nesian or  Javanese.  One  of  the  historical  distinctions  among  Indone- 
sian Chinese  in  the  1960s  and  1970s — between  the  peranakan  (local- 
born  Chinese  with  some  Indonesian  ancestry)  and  totok  (full-blooded 
Chinese,  usually  foreign-born) — has  begun  to  fade  as  fewer  foreign- 
born  Chinese  immigrate  to  Indonesia.  Although  the  distinctiveness 
and  social  significance  of  this  division  vary  considerably  from  place 
to  place  in  the  archipelago,  ties  to  the  Chinese  homeland  are  weaker 
within  the  peranakan  community,  and  there  is  stronger  evidence  of 
Indonesian  influence.  Unlike  the  more  strictly  male-dominated  totok, 
peranakan  families  recognize  descent  along  both  female  and  male 
lines.  Peranakan  are  more  likely  to  have  converted  to  Christianity 
(although  some  became  Muslims)  and  to  have  assimilated  in  other 
ways  to  the  norms  of  Indonesian  culture.  They  typically  speak  Bahasa 
Indonesia  as  their  first  language. 


149 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  Suharto  government's  program  of  assimilation  for  the  Chi- 
nese began  to  be  phased  out  in  1998.  Long-discouraged  symbols  of 
Chinese  identity  such  as  Chinese-language  newspapers,  schools,  and 
public  rituals,  and  the  use  of  Chinese  names,  are  no  longer  subject  to 
strict  regulation.  During  the  Suharto  years,  nearly  all  Chinese  Indo- 
nesians obtained  Indonesian  citizenship,  often  at  high  cost  and  as  a 
result  of  considerable  government  pressure. 

Popular  resentment  persisted  toward  Chinese  economic  success, 
however,  and  nurtured  a  perception  of  Chinese  complicity  in  the 
Suharto  regime's  corruption/ In  May  1998,  riots  broke  out  in  which 
hundreds  of  Chinese  stores  were  burned  and  Chinese  women  were 
raped  and  murdered.  When  many  Chinese  Indonesians  fled  the  vio- 
lence, the  subsequent  capital  flight  resulted  in  further  economic  hard- 
ship in  a  country  already  suffering  a  financial  crisis.  By  2005  many 
had  returned,  but  the  economic  and  social  confidence  of  many  Chi- 
nese in  the  country  was  badly  shaken  by  the  experience. 

Education 

The  character  of  Indonesia's  education  system  reflects  the  country's 
diverse  religious  heritage,  its  struggle  for  a  national  identity,  and  the 
challenge  of  resource  allocation  in  a  poor  but  developing  archipelagic 
nation  with  a  population  that  is  young  (median  age  27.6  years)  and 
growing  (at  an  estimated  annual  rate  of  about  1.1  percent)  in  2009. 
Tremendous  progress  has  been  made  toward  the  goal  of  universal  edu- 
cation since  1973,  when  nearly  20  percent  of  youth  were  illiterate.  At 
that  time,  then-President  Suharto  issued  an  order  to  set  aside  portions 
of  oil  revenues  for  the  construction  of  new  primary  schools.  This  act 
resulted  in  the  construction  or  repair  of  nearly  40,000  primary-school 
facilities  by  the  late  1980s,  and  literacy  rates  improved  significantly 
nationwide.  During  1997-98,  the  financial  crisis  affected  the  poorest 
families  the  most,  resulting  in  their  selectively  cutting  back  on  their 
education  expenditures.  Government  funding  struggled  to  keep  up 
with  rising  costs  during  this  period,  but  by  2002,  according  to  the 
World  Bank,  only  2  percent  of  those  between  the  ages  of  15  and  24 
could  not  read,  and  by  2009,  the  adult  literacy  rate  was  90.4  percent. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Education 

Indonesians  are  required  to  attend  nine  years  of  school.  They  can 
choose  between  state-run,  nonsectarian  public  schools  supervised  by 
the  Department  of  National  Education  (Depdiknas)  or  private  or  semi- 
private  religious  (usually  Islamic)  schools  supervised  and  financed  by 
the  Department  of  Religious  Affairs.  However,  although  86.1  percent 


150 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


of  the  Indonesian  population  is  registered  as  Muslim,  according  to  the 
2000  census  only  15  percent  of  school-age  individuals  attended  reli- 
gious schools.  Overall  enrollment  figures  are  slightly  higher  for  girls 
than  boys  and  much  higher  in  Java  than  the  rest  of  Indonesia. 

A  central  goal  of  the  national  education  system  is  not  merely  to 
impart  secular  wisdom  about  the  world  but  also  to  instruct  children 
in  the  principles  of  participation  in  the  modern  nation-state,  its 
bureaucracies,  and  its  moral  and  ideological  foundations.  Beginning 
under  Guided  Democracy  (1959-65)  and  strengthened  in  the  New 
Order  after  1975,  a  key  feature  of  the  national  curriculum — as  was 
the  case  for  other  national  institutions — has  been  instruction  in  the 
Pancasila.  Children  age  six  and  older  learned  by  rote  its  five  princi- 
ples— belief  in  one  God,  humanitarianism,  national  unity,  democ- 
racy, and  social  justice — and  were  instructed  daily  to  apply  the 
meanings  of  this  key  national  symbol  to  their  lives.  But  with  the  end 
of  the  New  Order  in  1998  and  the  beginning  of  the  campaign  to 
decentralize  the  national  government,  provincial  and  district-level 
administrators  obtained  increasing  autonomy  in  determining  the 
content  of  schooling,  and  Pancasila  began  to  play  a  diminishing  role 
in  the  curriculum. 

A  style  of  pedagogy  prevails  inside  public-school  classrooms  that 
emphasizes  rote  learning  and  deference  to  the  authority  of  the  teacher. 
Although  the  youngest  children  are  sometimes  allowed  to  use  the 
local  language,  by  the  third  year  of  primary  school  nearly  all  instruc- 
tion is  conducted  in  Bahasa  Indonesia.  Teachers  customarily  do  not 
ask  questions  of  individual  students;  rather,  a  standard  teaching  tech- 
nique is  to  narrate  a  historical  event  or  to  describe  a  mathematical 
problem,  pausing  at  key  junctures  to  allow  the  students  to  call  out 
responses  that  "fill  in  the  blanks."  By  not  identifying  individual  prob- 
lems of  students  and  retaining  an  emotionally  distanced  demeanor, 
teachers  are  said  to  show  themselves  to  be  sabar  (patient),  which  is 
considered  admirable  behavior. 

After  completion  of  the  six-year  primary- school  program,  three 
years  of  junior  secondary  school  may  be  followed  by  three  years  of 
senior  secondary  school;  or  students  can  choose  among  a  variety  of 
vocational  and  pre -professional  junior  and  senior  secondary  schools, 
each  level  of  which  requires  three  years  of  study.  After  secondary 
school,  students  may  choose  either  three  years  of  postsecondary 
vocational  and  pre-professional  schools  or  three  years  of  high  school. 
There  are  academic  and  vocational  junior  high  schools  that  lead  to 
senior-level  diplomas.  There  are  also  "domestic  science"  junior  high 
schools  for  girls.  At  the  senior  high  school  level,  three-year  agricul- 
tural, veterinary,  and  forestry  schools  are  open  to  students  who  have

graduated  from  an  academic  junior  high  school.  Special  schools  at  the 
junior  and  senior  levels  teach  hotel  management,  legal  clerking,  plas- 
tic arts,  and  music. 

The  completion  rate  for  Indonesian  primary  schools  is  excellent. 
Indeed,  100  percent  of  the  relevant  age-group  had  completed  primary 
education  as  of  2003,  according  to  World  Bank  data.  The  gross  enroll- 
ment rate  for  primary  schools  was  100  percent,  but  it  decreased  to  62 
percent  for  secondary  schools  and  16  percent  for  postsecondary 
schools.  There  were  nearly  equal  numbers  of  girls  and  boys  in  primary 
and  secondary  schools;  in  the  late  2000s,  the  ratio  was  96.7  girls  to 
100  boys.  Depdiknas  reported  that  in  school  year  2007-8  there  were 
63,444  kindergartens,  with  a  total  enrollment  of  2.8  million  pupils  and 
176,061  teachers.  Later  statistics  are  available  for  primary  and  second- 
ary levels  for  school  year  2008-9.  They  indicate  that  there  were 
144,228  primary  schools,  with  a  total  enrollment  of  26.9  million  stu- 
dents and  1.5  million  teachers;  28,777  junior  secondary  schools,  with 
a  total  enrollment  of  8.9  million  students  and  629,036  teachers;  10,762 
general  senior  secondary  schools,  with  a  total  enrollment  of  3.8  mil- 
lion students  and  314,389  teachers;  and  7,592  vocational  senior  sec- 
ondary schools,  with  a  total  enrollment  of  3  million  students  and 
246,018  teachers.  Additionally,  there  were  1,686  special  education 
schools  from  kindergarten  to  senior  secondary  levels,  with  a  total 
enrollment  of  73,322  and  18,047  teachers. 

Teacher-training  programs  are  varied  and  gradually  being 
upgraded.  For  example,  in  the  1950s  anyone  completing  a  teacher- 
training  program  at  the  junior  high  school  level  could  obtain  a 
teacher's  certificate.  Since  the  1970s,  however,  primary- school  teach- 
ers have  been  required  to  have  graduated  from  a  senior  high  school  for 
teachers,  and  teachers  of  higher  grades  have  been  required  to  have 
completed  a  university-level  education  course.  Remuneration  for  pri- 
mary- and  secondary-school  teachers,  although  low,  compares  favor- 
ably with  that  in  other  Asian  countries  such  as  Malaysia,  India,  and 
Thailand.  Student-teacher  ratios  also  compare  satisfactorily  with  those 
in  many  Asian  nations:  They  were  23.4  to  1  and  18.8  to  1,  respec- 
tively, for  primary  and  secondary  schools  in  2004;  that  same  year,  the 
overall  averages  for  Asia-Pacific  countries  were  22  to  1  and  1 8  to  1 , 
respectively. 

By  2008  the  staff  shortage  in  Indonesia's  schools  was  no  longer  as 
acute  as  in  the  1980s,  but  serious  difficulties  remain,  particularly  in 
the  areas  of  teacher  salaries,  teacher  certification,  and  finding  quali- 
fied personnel.  In  many  remote  areas  of  the  Outer  Islands,  in  particu- 
lar, there  is  a  severe  shortage  of  qualified  teachers,  and  some  villages 
have  school  buildings  but  no  teachers,  books,  or  supplies.  Providing

textbooks  and  other  school  equipment  to  Indonesia's  37  million 
schoolchildren  throughout  the  far-flung  archipelago  continues  to  be 
a  significant  problem  as  well,  especially  in  more  remote  areas. 

Islamic  Schools 

The  secular  and  nationalist  emphasis  in  public  schools  has  been 
resisted  by  some  of  the  Muslim  majority.  A  distinct  and  vocal  minority 
of  these  Muslims  prefer  to  place  their  children  in  a  pesantren,  or 
Islamic  school.  Usually  located  in  rural  areas  and  directed  by  a  Muslim 
scholar,  pesantren  are  attended  by  young  people  seeking  a  detailed 
understanding  of  the  Quran,  the  Arabic  language,  the  sharia,  and  Mus- 
lim traditions  and  history,  as  well  as  more  modern  subjects  such  as 
English,  mathematics,  and  geography.  Students  can  enter  and  leave  the 
pesantren  any  time  of  the  year,  and  the  studies  are  not  organized  as  a 
progression  of  courses  leading  to  graduation.  Although  the  chief  aim 
of  pesantren  is  to  produce  good  Muslims,  they  do  not  share  a  single 
stance  toward  Islam  or  a  position  on  secularism.  Some  pesantren 
emphasize  the  autonomy  of  modern  students  to  think  for  themselves 
and  to  interpret  scripture  and  modern  knowledge  in  a  way  that  is  con- 
sistent with  the  teachings  of  Islam.  Others  are  more  traditional  and 


153 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

stress  the  importance  of  following  the  wisdom  of  elders,  including 
their  teachings  on  science,  religion,  and  family  life.  Although  the  ter- 
rorist bombings  in  Kuta,  Bali,  in  2002  raised  suspicions  about  whether 
pesantren  promote  extremist  views,  the  majority  of  these  schools  in 
Indonesia  are  theologically  moderate,  reflecting  the  views  of  the  Indo- 
nesian population  as  a  whole.  For  those  who  opt  for  a  pesantren  educa- 
tion, a  sixth-grade  equivalency  certificate  is  available  after  successful 
completion  of  a  state  test. 

In  order  for  students  to  adapt  to  life  in  the  modern  nation-state,  in 
the  1970s  the  Muslim-dominated  Department  of  Religion  (now  the 
Department  of  Religious  Affairs)  advocated  the  spread  of  a  newer 
variety  of  Muslim  school,  the  madrassa.  This  kind  of  school  inte- 
grates religious  subjects  from  the  pesantren  with  secular  subjects 
from  the  Western-style  public-education  system.  Although  in  general 
the  public  believes  that  Islamic  schools  offer  lower-quality  education, 
among  Islamic  schools  a  madrassa  is  ranked  lower  than  a  pesantren. 

Higher  Education 

Indonesia's  institutions  of  higher  education  have  experienced  dra- 
matic growth  since  independence.  In  1950  there  were  10  institutions 
of  higher  learning  with  a  total  of  about  6,500  students.  In  1970,  450 
private  and  state  institutions  enrolled  about  237,000  students,  and  by 
1990  there  were  900  institutions  with  about  141,000  teachers  and 
nearly  1.5  million  students.  By  2009  there  were  2,975  institutions  of 
higher  education  and  more  than  4.2  million  students.  Of  these  institu- 
tions, 3  percent  were  public,  with  57.1  percent  of  the  student  enroll- 
ment, and  97  percent  were  private,  with  42.9  of  the  student  enrollment. 
Even  though  government  subsidies  finance  approximately  80  to  90 
percent  of  state-university  budgets,  universities  have  considerably 
more  autonomy  in  curriculum  and  internal  structure  than  primary  and 
secondary  schools.  Whereas  tuition  in  such  state  institutions  is  more 
affordable  for  average  students  than  private-university  tuition,  faculty 
salaries  are  low  by  international  standards.  Lecturers  often  have  other 
jobs  outside  the  university  to  supplement  their  wages. 

Private  universities  are  generally  operated  by  foundations.  Unlike 
state  universities,  private  institutions  have  budgets  that  are  almost 
entirely  tuition-driven.  A  onetime  registration  fee  (which  can  be 
quite  high)  is  determined  at  the  time  of  entry.  If  a  university  has  a 
religious  affiliation,  it  can  cover  some  of  its  costs  with  donations  or 
grants  from  international  religious  organizations.  The  government 
provides  only  limited  scholarship  support  for  students  wishing  to 
attend  private  universities.

Indonesian  institutions  of  higher  education  offer  a  wide  range  of 
programs.  However,  about  52  percent  of  all  non-teacher-training  stu- 
dents enrolled  in  higher  education  were  social  sciences  majors  in  the 
2008-9  academic  year,  while  only  3  percent  majored  in  laboratory- 
intensive  fields  of  study,  largely  because  universities  prefer  to  offer 
social  science  courses  that  do  not  require  expensive  laboratories  and 
equipment.  The  major  academic  degree  programs  are  the  sarjana 
(literally  "scholar,"  roughly  corresponding  to  a  bachelor's  degree) 
and  the  pasca  sarjana  (master's  or  doctoral  degree).  Professional 
schools  offer  "diploma"  and  "specialist"  degrees,  the  latter  graded 
either  "SP1"  or  "SP2,"  depending  on  the  level  of  advancement.  From 
2001  to  2004,  the  number  of  students  completing  their  sarjana 
degrees  grew  dramatically  from  about  308,000  in  2001  to  nearly 
683,000  in  2004,  a  122-percent  increase.  This  level  stood  at  652,364 
graduates  at  the  end  of  academic  year  2008-9. 

Discussion  about  how  to  improve  Indonesian  higher  education 
focuses  on  the  issues  of  teacher  salaries,  laboratory  and  research 
facilities,  and  professors'  qualifications.  Only  7  percent  of  university 
faculty  overall  held  a  Ph.D.  in  the  mid-2000s,  although  the  propor- 
tion was  greater  (11  percent)  in  state  institutions.  Because  doctoral 


155 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

programs  are  few  in  Indonesia  and  there  is  little  money  to  support 
education  overseas,  this  situation  is  improving  only  slowly.  Despite 
these  difficulties,  most  institutions  of  higher  education  receive  large 
numbers  of  applications;  in  state  institutions,  less  than  one  in  four 
applications  was  accepted  in  2004;  in  private  institutions,  the  accep- 
tance rate  was  nearly  two  out  of  three.  One  of  the  most  serious  prob- 
lems for  graduates  with  advanced  degrees,  however,  is  finding 
employment  suited  to  their  newly  acquired  education.  In  2003  the 
unemployment  rate  for  college  graduates  with  the  sarjana  degree 
was  approximately  20  percent,  and  10  percent  for  graduates  of  pro- 
fessional schools. 

The  Republic  of  Indonesia  Institute  for  Higher  Education  (BPTRI) 
was  founded  in  Jakarta  shortly  after  independence  was  declared  in 
1945.  When  the  Dutch  returned  in  force,  BPTRI  dispersed  its  various 
schools  to  other  parts  of  Java.  The  Dutch  established  Nood  Univer- 
siteit  (Emergency  University)  in  Jakarta  in  1946,  and  the  following 
year  changed  its  name  to  Universiteit  van  Indonesie  (UVI),  or  Uni- 
versity of  Indonesia.  On  February  2,  1950,  in  the  wake  of  the  war  for 
independence,  the  government  established  a  state  university  in 
Jakarta  called  Universiteit  Indonesia.  It  was  composed  of  units  of 
BPTRI  and  UVI;  the  name  Universiteit  Indonesia  was  later  changed 
to  Universitas  Indonesia.  This  institution  enrolls  about  37,000  stu- 
dents per  year.  Universitas  Gadjah  Mada  lays  claim  to  being  the  old- 
est Indonesian  university.  It  was  founded  in  Yogyakarta  on  December 
9,  1949,  but  was  giving  its  first  lectures  in  early  1946  (when  Yogya- 
karta was  the  Republican  capital).  State-owned  Gadjah  Mada  has  an 
annual  enrollment  of  about  54,000  students.  Other  major  universities 
include  Catholic  University  and  the  Institut  Teknologi  Bandung,  both 
in  Bandung;  and  the  Institut  Pertanian  Bogor,  in  Bogor.  There  also  are 
important  regional  universities  in  Sulawesi  Selatan,  Sumatera  Utara, 
Jawa  Barat,  and  Papua.  Approximately  15  percent  of  Indonesia's  stu- 
dents of  higher  education  attend  a  public  or  private  Islamic  university, 
institute,  academy,  or  polytechnic  institute.  Among  these  is  the  State 
Muslim  University  (UIN) — formerly  called  the  State  Institute  for 
Islamic  Religion  (IAIN) — which  has  been  an  important  venue  for 
progressive  debates  about  Islam. 

Health 

Services  and  Infrastructure 

As  access  to  education  has  improved  throughout  the  archipelago, 
use  of  modern  forms  of  health  care  also  has  increased.  For  example,  in 
2003  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  reported  that  68 


156 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


percent  of  births  in  Indonesia  were  attended  by  a  trained  midwife  or 
other  health  specialist.  Recent  studies  show  a  correlation  between  the 
rise  of  education  levels  and  the  increased  use  of  hospitals,  physicians, 
and  other  health  resources.  Indeed,  since  the  1980s,  health  in  Indone- 
sia has  shown  overall  improvement.  Life  expectancy  was  estimated  at 

70.8  years  in  2009,  a  substantial  increase  since  1980,  when  it  stood  at 

52.9  years.  However,  the  distribution  of  improvements,  like  the  distri- 
bution of  resources  for  health  maintenance  and  improvement,  has  been 
unequal.  In  2003  life  expectancy  was  72  years  in  Jakarta  and  Yogya- 
karta  but  only  63  years  in  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat  Province.  Whereas 
infant  mortality  nationwide  decreased  from  an  average  of  105.0  deaths 
per  1,000  live  births  in  1980  to  75.2  in  1990,  to  36.0  in  2000,  and  to  an 
estimated  29.9  in  2009,  local  rates  varied  dramatically.  The  poor,  rural, 
and  less-educated  classes  generally  suffered  much  higher  mortality 
rates  than  their  educated  urban  counterparts. 

Community  and  preventive  health  programs  form  another  compo- 
nent of  Indonesia's  health  system.  Established  in  1969  as  part  of  the 
first  Repelita  (see  Glossary),  the  government's  five-year  economic 
development  plan,  community  health  services  are  organized  in  a 
three-tier  system  with  puskesmas  (community  health  centers)  at  the 
top.  Usually  staffed  by  a  physician,  these  centers  provide  maternal 
and  child  health  care,  general  outpatient  curative  and  preventive 
health  care,  pre-  and  postnatal  care,  immunization,  and  communica- 
ble disease-control  programs.  Specialized  clinic  services  are  period- 
ically available  at  some  of  the  larger  clinics. 

Second-level  community  health  centers  include  subpuskesmas 
(community  health  subcenters)  consisting  of  small  clinics  and  mater- 
nal and  child  health  centers  staffed  with  one  to  three  nurses  and  vis- 
ited weekly  or  monthly  by  a  physician.  Toward  the  middle  of  the  first 
decade  of  the  twenty-first  century,  the  World  Health  Organization 
(WHO)  reported  that  there  were  3.6  health  centers  per  100,000  popu- 
lation. Since  the  early  1990s,  the  Department  of  Health  planned  to 
have  three  to  four  subcenters  per  health  center,  depending  on  the 
region,  and  this  plan  has  been  largely  realized  in  the  twenty-first  cen- 
tury. The  third  level  of  community  health  services  consists  of  village- 
level  posyandu  (integrated  service  posts).  These  posts  are  not  perma- 
nently staffed  facilities  but  rather  monthly  clinics  on  rented  premises, 
in  which  a  visiting  team  from  the  regional  health  center  supports 
local  health  volunteers. 

The  distribution  of  Indonesian  health-care  workers  is  also  highly 
uneven.  To  alleviate  the  problem  of  physician  maldistribution,  the 
government  requires  two  to  five  years  of  public  service  by  all  gradu- 
ates of  medical  schools,  whether  public  or  private.  In  order  to  be 


157 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

admitted  for  specialist  training,  physicians  first  have  to  complete  this 
service,  which  is  normally  fulfilled  by  staffing  puskesmas.  Only  two 
years  of  public  service  are  required  for  those  physicians  working  in 
remote  areas  such  as  the  provinces  of  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur, 
Sulawesi  Tenggara,  Kalimantan  Timur,  Maluku,  Papua,  and  Papua 
Barat,  whereas  three  to  five  years  of  service  are  required  for  a  post- 
ing in  Java,  Bali,  or  Sumatra.  Despite  such  requirements,  it  is  diffi- 
cult to  attract  medical-school  graduates  to  these  remote,  understaffed 
regions,  particularly  without  additional  cash  incentives.  With  an 
average  of  only  about  0.1  physicians,  0.8  nurses  or  midwives,  and 
0.6  hospital  beds  per  1,000  population,  Indonesia  compares  unfavor- 
ably with  all  of  its  Southeast  Asian  neighbors. 

Government  Support 

One  of  the  most  notable  features  of  Indonesia's  health-care  system, 
in  comparison  with  those  of  other  Southeast  Asian  nations,  is  the  low 
level  of  government  support.  For  example,  in  2006  the  Philippines 
expended  3.3  percent  of  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glos- 
sary) on  health  care,  Malaysia  4.3  percent,  Singapore  3.4  percent,  and 
Timor-Leste  16.4  percent.  That  same  year,  only  2.2  percent  of  the 
GDP  of  Indonesia  was  devoted  to  health  care,  far  less  than  the  5  per- 
cent recommended  by  the  WHO.  Of  these  percentages,  however,  as 
of  2006,  the  Indonesian  government  provided  50.4  percent  of  the 
total  national  expenditure  on  health  care.  This  compares  favorably 
with  Malaysia's  45.2  percent,  Philippines'  39.6  percent,  and  Singa- 
pore's 33.6  percent  but  not  with  Timor-Leste 's  88.8  percent. 

The  modern  health-care  system  continues  the  Dutch  colonial  pat- 
tern of  low  levels  of  investment  in  health  care.  The  Dutch  did  rela- 
tively little  in  the  field  of  public  health  prior  to  1910,  with  the 
exception  of  giving  smallpox  vaccinations.  In  the  1930s,  however, 
the  government  devoted  increased  attention  to  health  education  and 
disease  prevention,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  An  elaborate  public- 
health  infrastructure  had  developed  by  1939,  including  a  particularly 
sophisticated  model  program  in  Purwokerto  in  central  Java.  But  this 
public-health  system  collapsed  after  the  Japanese  invasion  in  1942. 
During  World  War  II,  the  mortality  rate  rose  dramatically,  and  the 
general  health  situation  of  the  country  deteriorated. 

In  the  postwar  period,  a  network  of  maternal  and  child  health  cen- 
ters was  established,  but  resources  were  extremely  limited,  with  just 
one  physician  for  every  100,000  people.  The  first  dramatic  improve- 
ments resulted  from  the  establishment  of  the  network  of  community 
health  centers  in  1969.  Although  at  first  the  general  population 
strongly  resisted  using  these  facilities,  by  the  time  of  the  1980  cen- 
sus, 40  percent  of  people  reporting  illness  in  the  prior  week  had 


158 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


sought  treatment  at  one.  By  2005  the  community  health  centers 
catered  largely  to  the  rural  and  urban  poor,  and  most  urban  residents 
who  could  afford  to  do  so  sought  health  care  from  private  physicians 
and  clinics. 

Traditional  and  Modern  Health  Practices 

Dukun — traditional  healers — continue  to  play  an  important  role  in 
health  care,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  Often,  the  services  of  a  dukun 
are  used  in  conjunction  with  Western-style  medicine.  In  some  rural 
areas,  these  healers  represent  a  treatment  option  of  first  resort,  espe- 
cially when  there  is  no  community  health  center  nearby,  or  if  the  only 
modern  health  care  available  is  expensive,  or  the  facility  is  under- 
staffed. Ideas  about  healing  differ  greatly  among  the  hundreds  of  eth- 
nic groups,  but  often  healers  use  extensive  knowledge  of  herbal 
medicines  and  invoke  supernatural  legitimacy  for  their  practice. 

Following  childbirth,  women  in  many  parts  of  the  archipelago 
engage  in  "roasting."  Although  different  ethnic  groups  have  differ- 
ent explanations  for  the  practice,  it  usually  involves  the  seclusion  of 
the  mother  and  her  child  for  a  period  following  childbirth — from  a 
few  weeks  to  months — so  that  she  might  submit  herself  to  prolonged 
exposure  to  the  warmth  of  a  hearth  or  other  source  of  heat.  In  gen- 
eral, it  is  believed  that  this  speeds  the  process  of  recovery,  but  many 
believe  it  helps  replace  a  woman's  lost  blood,  returns  her  body  to  a 
trim  and  fit  shape,  and  helps  "dry  her  out." 

Major  Health  Problems 

The  major  cause  of  death  in  Indonesia  is  from  communicable  dis- 
eases, mainly  resulting  from  a  lack  of  clean  water.  Tuberculosis  is 
the  second-leading  cause  of  death  and  the  first  among  infectious  dis- 
eases. Malaria  also  is  a  major  public-health  problem,  as  are  seasonal 
episodes  of  dengue  hemorrhagic  fever  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas, 
according  to  the  WHO. 

Human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immune  deficiency  syn- 
drome (HIV/ AIDS)  poses  a  major  public-health  threat  in  Indonesia. 
Although  in  an  April  1992  report  the  Department  of  Health  reported 
only  47  documented  cases  of  individuals  whose  blood  tested  positive 
for  HIV,  by  2007  there  were  an  estimated  270,000  people  living  with 
HIV/AIDS,  the  highest  rate  among  its  neighbors  and  third  highest  in 
Southeast  Asia.  Indonesia's  estimated  8,700  deaths  from  HIV/ AIDS 
by  2007  also  placed  it  far  above  the  figures  for  any  of  its  neighbors 
and  fourth  highest  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  rate  of  infection  is  particu- 
larly high  in  Papua.  The  Ford  Foundation  and  the  U.S.  Agency  for 
International  Development  have  funded  HIV/ AIDS  prevention  and

awareness  programs  in  Bali  and  Papua,  and  Family  Health  Interna- 
tional was  operating  a  program,  Aksi  Stop  AIDS  (ASA),  in  many 
parts  of  the  archipelago  in  2009. 

Two  other  important  public-health  concerns  are  avian  influenza 
and  polio.  The  first  outbreak  of  H5N1  avian  influenza  in  Indonesia 
occurred  in  2004,  when  cases  in  poultry  were  reported  in  1 1  prov- 
inces. In  2005  the  Department  of  Health  reported  that  a  38-year-old 
man  who  had  died  on  July  12  was  the  country's  first  laboratory-con- 
firmed positive  human  case  of  H5N1  avian  influenza.  By  the  end  of 
the  year,  19  more  cases  had 'been  confirmed.  By  January  2009,  Indo- 
nesia had  confirmed  140  cases  of  avian  influenza  in  humans  in  vari- 
ous parts  of  the  country.  The  Department  of  Health,  working  with  the 
WHO,  presents  seminars  and  workshops  with  the  goal  of  strengthen- 
ing surveillance  of  influenza-like  illness,  outbreak  investigation,  and 
appropriate  isolation  and  barrier  nursing.  The  National  Committee  for 
Avian  Influenza  Control  and  Pandemic  Influenza  Preparedness 
(Komnas  FPBI)  coordinates  the  Indonesian  government  response  to 
the  H5N1  avian  influenza  virus.  Stockpiling  of  personal  protective 
equipment  to  protect  the  health  of  veterinary  workers,  as  well  as  the 
general  health,  and  procurement  of  antivirals  for  treatment  and  pro- 
phylaxis, as  appropriate,  are  continuing.  Prevention  guidelines  for  the 
general  Indonesian  community  emphasize  practices  such  as  frequent 
hand  washing,  avoidance  of  contact  with  sick  animals,  and  safe  and 
hygienic  handling  and  cooking  of  poultry.  Although  some  mass  cull- 
ings  have  taken  place  in  Indonesia,  they  have  not  been  as  extensive  as 
in  other  countries.  Although  there  were  more  than  1,800  deaths  in 
Southeast  Asia  as  a  result  of  the  2009  pandemic  influenza  H1N1, 
Indonesia  was  largely  spared.  Only  a  few  fatal  cases  were  reported  in 
Kalimantan  by  the  end  of  2009.  To  confront  the  threat  of  the  H1N1 
pandemic,  Komnas  FPBI  established  an  H1N1  Command  Post  at  the 
Office  of  the  Coordinating  Minister  of  People's  Welfare.  As  of  July 
2005,  there  were  122  polio  cases  confirmed  in  Indonesia,  primarily  in 
Jawa  Barat  and  Jawa  Tengah,  and  in  Sumatra.  Two  emergency  vacci- 
nation campaigns  were  conducted  by  the  government  in  May  and 
June  2005. 

Pharmaceuticals 

Indonesia  achieved  self-sufficiency  in  basic  pharmaceutical  pro- 
duction by  the  early  1990s,  but  as  the  twenty-first  century  began, 
Indonesians  still  had  one  of  the  lowest  per  capita  expenditures  for 
modern  drugs  among  the  members  of  the  Association  of  Southeast 
Asian  Nations  (ASEAN — see  Glossary).  According  to  one  estimate 
in  2000,  Indonesia's  annual  consumption  of  medicine  was  US$4  per 


160 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


capita,  compared  to  US$6  in  the  Philippines  and  US$11  in  Thailand 
and  Malaysia.  Many  Indonesians  continue  to  rely  at  least  partially  on 
traditional  herbal  medicines,  in  part  because  modern  pharmaceuti- 
cals are  expensive.  When  modern  medicines  are  used,  ongoing  prob- 
lems include  overprescription  of  antibiotics,  overuse  of  injections, 
poor  patient  compliance,  use  of  unlabeled  drugs,  and  inattention  to 
drug  interactions.  By  2005  Indonesia  had  about  200  pharmaceutical 
companies  and  nearly  1,000  pharmaceutical  wholesalers.  Most  were 
located  on  Java. 

Public  Sanitation 

In  2008  about  89  percent  of  the  urban  population  in  Indonesia  had 
access  to  clean  water,  and  about  60  percent  had  access  to  piped 
water,  mostly  from  a  shared  faucet.  The  number  of  urban  dwellers 
with  a  household  connection  rose  between  1990  and  2008,  from  28 
percent  to  37  percent.  In  rural  areas,  the  proportions  were  smaller: 
approximately  71  percent  had  access  to  an  improved  water  source, 
and  about  8  percent  had  a  household  connection  in  2008.  Many  mid- 
dle- and  lower-class  Indonesians  continue  to  rely  on  the  country's 
frequently  polluted  streams,  canals,  and  water  catchment  areas.  In 
many  coastal  cities,  the  freshwater  table  is  being  threatened  by  the 
drilling  of  private  wells,  which  become  contaminated  by  leaking 
septic  tanks.  This  situation  has  given  rise  to  the  popularity  of  com- 
mercially purified  water  sold  in  sealed  plastic  containers. 

According  to  the  WHO,  82  percent  of  urban  residents  and  54  per- 
cent of  rural  residents  had  access  to  modern  sanitation  facilities  in 
2007,  but  only  67  percent  and  36  percent,  respectively,  used  these 
improved  facilities  in  2008.  Even  in  urban  areas,  the  WHO  estimated 
that  16  percent  of  residents  were  without  proper  sanitation.  Many 
commercial  and  residential  areas  are  served  by  a  waterborne  sewerage 
system  of  open  drainage  canals  discharging  raw  wastes  directly  into 
rivers  or  the  sea.  In  the  slum  areas  of  Jakarta,  residents  are  subjected 
to  frequent  flooding  and  the  outbreak  of  waterborne  diseases  resulting 
from  clogged  sewers. 

Society's  Prospects 

As  the  world's  largest  archipelago,  and  fourth  most  populous 
country,  the  diverse  nation  of  Indonesia  faces  environmental  and 
social  challenges  of  breathtaking  scope.  While  improved  access  to 
education  has  resulted  in  lower  birthrates,  rising  incomes,  better 
health,  and  greater  levels  of  political  participation,  it  has  also  come  at 
a  severe  cost  to  the  environment.  The  preservation  of  the  country's 


161 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

rich  ethnic,  linguistic,  and  ecological  diversity  must  increasingly  be 
negotiated  in  relation  to  the  homogenizing  influences  of  the  ever 
more  integrated  and  interconnected  national  and  international  econo- 
mies. Achieving  a  sustainable  balance  among  these  interests  will  be 
one  of  the  central  challenges  facing  Indonesia  in  the  coming  decades.

Several  sources  give  a  broad,  useful  perspective  on  the  cultures  of 
Indonesia.  The  Potent  Dead:  Ancestors,  Saints  and  Heroes  in  Con-

Chapter  3.  The  Economy

THE  INDONESIAN  ECONOMY,  BY  MANY  MEASURES,  pros- 
pered during  the  New  Order  government  of  President  Suharto,  whose 
long  tenure,  from  1966  to  1998,  both  began  and  ended  in  political  and 
social  upheaval.  Rapid  growth  of  Indonesia's  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP — see  Glossary)  endured  over  a  long  period  of  time,  signifi- 
cantly raising  the  standard  of  living.  Social  achievements  under  the 
New  Order  are  widely  considered  to  have  been  far  less  impressive, 
however.  The  most  urgent  challenge  facing  Suharto's  four  immediate 
successors,  who  took  office  between  1998  and  2004,  was  to  reignite 
the  fast-paced  economic  expansion  of  the  New  Order  years. 

The  role  of  government  has  been  absolutely  crucial  in  the  shaping  of 
economic  development  in  Indonesia  since  the  1960s.  The  main  themes 
of  government  economic  policy  during  the  latter  part  of  the  Suharto 
period  were  liberalization  and  deregulation,  which  in  the  1980s  and 
1990s  radically  changed  the  economic  landscape  as  well  as  the  relation- 
ship between  private  capital  and  political  power.  The  financial  crisis 
that  started  in  Thailand  in  the  summer  of  1997  soon  reached  Indone- 
sia— and  other  Asian  nations — and  crisis  management  with  interna- 
tional assistance  became  the  most  pressing  topic  of  economic  policy  in 
Jakarta  over  the  next  several  years.  In  the  early  years  of  the  new  cen- 
tury, the  government  started  putting  economic  reforms  in  place.  Among 
other  new  policies,  these  reforms  included  a  far-reaching  decentraliza- 
tion of  economic  authority  and  policy  making.  Central  government 
finance  and  the  execution  of  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policies  now 
drew  special  attention.  A  resumption  of  economic  growth,  though  not 
at  the  same  torrid  pace  experienced  prior  to  the  1997  crisis,  accompa- 
nied the  implementation  of  the  reforms. 

Three  trends  characterize  the  changes  that  have  occurred  in  the  Indo- 
nesian economy  since  the  late  1960s:  increasing  integration  with  the 
world  economy,  profound  structural  change,  and  intense  diversifica- 
tion. These  trends  are  highlighted  in  discussions  about  major  aspects  of 
the  Indonesian  economy,  such  as  international  trade,  aid,  and  payments; 
employment  and  income  development;  and  the  main  sectors  of  eco- 
nomic activity.  The  economy  has  experienced  a  fundamental  reorienta- 
tion from  agriculture  to  industry,  and  within  the  industrial  sector  itself, 
from  oil  and  gas  production  to  other  branches  of  manufacturing,  both 
labor-intensive  (for  example,  textiles  and  food  processing)  and  capital- 
intensive  (for  example,  chemicals  and  electrical  and  electronic  goods). 
Modernization  has  enabled  the  services  sector  and  the  transportation 
and  communication  infrastructures  to  make  a  greater  contribution  to 


165 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

economic  growth.  In  the  early  twenty-first  century,  the  national  econ- 
omy no  longer  depends  only  on  natural  resources  such  as  oil  and  gas. 

The  Role  of  Government 

The  government  pursued  policies  to  support  pribumi  (see  Glos- 
sary) businessmen  in  the  early  years  of  nation  building,  from  inde- 
pendence in  1945  to  1957.  These  included  subsidized  credit  from  the 
state-owned  Indonesian  People's  Bank  (BRI — for  this  and  other  acro- 
nyms, see  table  A),  and  positive  discrimination  in  favor  of  indigenous 
traders  in  the  allocation  of  scarce  foreign  exchange  for  imports.  The 
first  five-year  development  plan  (1956-60)  proposed  a  realistic  level 
of  government  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  but  offered  little 
regulation  or  overall  guidance  to  the  private  sector.  This  plan  was 
superseded  by  dramatic  developments  in  the  political  and  economic 
sphere,  in  particular  the  takeover  of  virtually  all  remaining  Dutch- 
owned  private  enterprises  in  December  1957,  which  led  to  national- 
ization and  state  control  of  key  sectors  of  the  economy.  Indonesian 
civil  servants  and  military  officers,  most  of  whom  had  little  manage- 
rial experience,  replaced  Dutch  management  personnel. 

The  expansion  of  the  state's  role  in  the  economy  was  sustained  by 
general  policy  shifts.  The  Guided  Economy  of  President  Sukarno  (in 
office  1945-67)  was  initiated  in  a  new  eight-year  development  plan 
begun  in  1959,  which  entailed  a  twelvefold  increase  in  spending  on 
government  projects  without  a  clear  indication  of  sources  of  finance. 
By  the  mid-1960s,  credit  from  Bank  Indonesia — the  central  bank — 
accounted  for  half  of  government  expenditures.  This  situation  led  to 
budget  deficits  and  a  mounting  foreign  debt,  as  well  as  galloping 
inflation,  which  peaked  at  an  annual  rate  of  900  percent  in  1966.  In 
spite  of  a  highly  visible  public  building  campaign,  the  economy  stag- 
nated, and  by  1965  per  capita  GDP  was  back  at  its  1957  level. 

Following  the  downfall  of  Sukarno  in  1967,  the  New  Order 
regime  under  Suharto  drew  upon  financial  assistance  from  the  Inter- 
national Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  the  pursuit  of  a  variety  of  emer- 
gency stabilization  measures.  During  the  late  1960s,  a  team  of  five 
economists  from  the  Faculty  of  Economics  at  the  Universitas  Indo- 
nesia (University  of  Indonesia)  in  Jakarta  became  influential  presi- 
dential advisers,  even  gaining  cabinet-level  posts.  Because  three  of 
the  advisers  were  graduates  of  the  University  of  California  at  Berke- 
ley, the  group,  led  by  Widjoyo  Nitisastro,  who  headed  the  National 
Development  Planning  Board  (Bappenas),  became  colloquially 
known  as  the  Berkeley  Mafia.  Foremost  among  this  group's  recom- 
mended reforms  was  a  balanced  budget,  although  foreign  borrowing 
and  aid  counted  as  sources  of  revenue.  In  a  radical  break  from  the 


166 


The  Economy 


socialist  tenor  of  Sukarno's  Guided  Economy,  Suharto's  New  Order 
heralded  a  return  to  private-market  development. 

The  New  Order  remained  committed  to  a  stable  economic  envi- 
ronment encouraged  by  responsible  fiscal  and  monetary  policy,  but 
concerns  over  foreign  economic  dominance,  the  limited  national 
industrial  base,  and  the  need  for  pribumi  economic  development 
mandated  increased  government  regulation  during  the  1970s.  The 
economy  continued  to  prosper  throughout  that  decade,  with  GDP 
growing  at  an  average  rate  of  8  percent  annually.  In  the  early  1980s, 
a  precipitous  drop  in  the  growth  rate  pointed  to  limits  in  the  industri- 
alization strategy,  and  a  new  generation  of  reformers  advocated  a 
more  limited  role  for  the  government.  When  the  oil  market  collapsed 
in  1986,  the  balance  was  tipped  in  favor  of  these  advocates  of  "free- 
fight"  economic  competition. 

The  Political  Economy  of  Reform 

Two  main  forces  of  influence  within  the  New  Order  government 
battled  to  shape  economic  policy:  the  technocrats,  favoring  market 
reform  and  little  intervention  by  the  government;  and  the  economic 
nationalists,  arguing  that  trade  protection  and  direct  government  con- 
trol and  regulation  were  necessary.  The  leaders  of  the  technocrats  were 
the  original  members  of  the  Berkeley  Mafia.  After  Nitisastro,  the  most 
influential  technocrat  was  Ali  Wardhana,  initially  minister  of  finance 
and  later  coordinating  minister  of  economics,  finance,  and  industry. 
Although  retired  by  1988,  both  men  remained  influential  behind-the- 
scenes  advisers  until  the  early  1990s.  Beneficiaries  of  the  tutelage  of 
Sumitro  Joyohadikusumo,  former  cabinet  member  and  founding  dean 
of  the  Faculty  of  Economics  at  the  Universitas  Indonesia,  these  West- 
ern-trained economists  were  advocates  of  economic  liberalism. 

The  economic  nationalists  included  prominent  officials  in  the 
Department  of  Industry,  which  was  headed  by  Hartarto;  Bacharuddin  J. 
(B.  J.)  Habibie,  minister  of  research  and  technology,  who  since  child- 
hood had  enjoyed  Suharto's  special  protection;  and  officers  on  the  Cap- 
ital Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM).  The  balance  of  power 
between  the  technocrats  and  the  economic  nationalists  was  for  several 
decades  mediated  by  Suharto,  but  around  1993  the  nationalists  gained  a 
decisive  influence  over  economic  policy  and  increasingly  pushed  the 
technocrats  into  the  background.  This  change  reflected  Suharto's  rising 
confidence  that  he  was  capable  of  managing  economic  development 
without  much  advice  from  others,  his  great  trust  in  Habibie's  capacity 
to  stage  major  economic  advances,  and  the  rise  of  his  children's  busi- 
ness empires  in  the  1980s  and  1990s. 


167 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  technocrats  had  initially  gained  a  great  deal  of  credibility  by 
curbing  rampant  inflation  and  restoring  financial  stability  after  the 
New  Order  government  came  to  power  in  1966.  As  oil  revenues 
increased,  starting  in  1974,  government  agencies  responsible  for 
trade  and  industrial  policy  sought  to  extend  Indonesia's  domestic 
industrial  base  by  investing  in  basic  industries,  especially  steel  man- 
ufacturing, and  by  erecting  trade  barriers  to  protect  domestic  produc- 
ers from  foreign  competition.  Government  regulations  proliferated, 
and  oil  taxes  fueled  investment  in  development  projects  and  state 
enterprises. 

The  private  sector  became  dominated  by  large  conglomerates, 
often  owned  by  Indonesians  of  Chinese  descent  who  had  sufficient 
wealth  and  know-how  to  assist  the  government  with  large-scale  mod- 
ernization projects.  During  the  1970s,  Chinese  Indonesian  conglom- 
erates were  estimated  to  account  for  75  percent  of  private-sector 
investment.  Around  1990,  the  top  200  conglomerates  accounted  for 
sales  that  taken  together  corresponded  to  25  percent  of  GDP.  Turn- 
over of  the  five  largest,  including  the  Salim  and  Astra  International 
groups,  amounted  to  Rpl6  trillion  (US$6.8  billion;  for  value  of  the 
rupiah — Rp — see  Glossary),  and  1 8  of  the  22  largest  conglomerates 
were  owned  by  Indonesians  of  Chinese  descent.  Among  them,  the  top 
200  conglomerates  controlled  almost  45,000  individual  firms.  The 
growth  of  the  conglomerates  throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s  was  in 
most  cases  highly  dependent  on  political  patronage.  In  exchange  for 
monopoly  privileges  related  to  production  and  imports  of  key  indus- 
trial products,  conglomerates  would  undertake  large-scale  investment 
projects  that  helped  the  government  reach  its  industrialization  goals. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  about  1,500  items  representing  35  percent  of 
the  value  of  imports  were  either  imported  by  licensed  importers  or 
controlled  through  a  quota  system.  Nontariff  barriers  affected  virtu- 
ally all  manufactured  imports  but  were  a  particular  impediment  to 
foreign-made  textiles,  paper  and  paper  products,  and  chemical  prod- 
ucts. As  a  result,  domestic  firms  in  these  lines  of  production  were 
effectively  protected  from  foreign  competition  or  were  able  to  sell 
their  products  at  a  higher  cost.  Firms  that  obtained  import  licenses 
were  also  highly  profitable,  but  costs  were  borne  by  the  entire  econ- 
omy because  imports  were  often  key  inputs  for  other  manufacturers. 
Popular  resentment  grew  as  gains  from  the  restrictions  enriched  a 
privileged  minority  and  added  to  a  long-standing  public  sensitivity 
toward  the  prominent  economic  position  of  the  Indonesian  Chinese 
minority. 

In  the  1980s,  Suharto's  six  children  came  of  age  and  quickly 
became  the  most  visible  beneficiaries  of  direct  access  to  the  apex  of 
political  power.  Each  of  them  was  connected  with  one  or  more  con- 


168 


The  Economy 


glomerates  that  based  their  business  success  at  least  partly  on  lucra- 
tive government  contracts.  For  example,  the  Bimantara  Citra  Group, 
run  by  Suharto's  second  son,  Bambang  Trihatmojo,  started  out  by 
selling  allocations  of  imported  oil  to  Pertamina  (the  State  Oil  and 
Natural  Gas  Mining  Company,  sometimes  translated  as  State  Oil 
Company).  Around  1990,  the  business  groups  of  Suharto's  children 
were  among  the  foremost  non-Chinese  conglomerates  in  Indonesia. 

Examples  from  two  vital  industries  illustrate  the  symbiotic  rela- 
tionship between  government  and  business  in  Indonesia.  In  1984 
Suharto's  long-time  personal  friend  Liem  Sioe  Liong,  founder  of  the 
Salim  Group,  agreed  to  invest  US$800  million  to  expand  the  opera- 
tions of  a  government-owned  company,  Krakatau  Steel,  in  Cilegon, 
Banten  Province,  by  adding  production  of  cold-rolled  sheet  steel.  In 
return,  a  company  partly  owned  by  Liem  received  a  monopoly  on 
imports  of  cold-rolled  steel.  Once  domestic  production  was  under- 
way, Liem's  imports  were  restricted  to  ensure  demand  for  the  Kraka- 
tau product.  In  a  similar  way,  imports  of  plastic  raw  materials  were 
monopolized  through  a  government  license  issued  to  Panca  Holding, 
which  had  two  Suharto  sons,  Bambang  Trihatmojo  and  Sigit  Har- 
joyudanto,  on  its  board  of  directors.  In  each  case,  the  price  of  an 
important  commodity  for  Indonesian  users — either  steel  products  or 
plastics — was  artificially  and  significantly  raised. 

Oil  prices  fell  from  US$25  to  US$13  per  barrel  in  1986,  which 
resulted  in  a  5 -percent  decline  in  national  income.  Suddenly,  there 
was  a  great  need  to  promote  non-oil  exports.  Meanwhile,  dissatisfac- 
tion had  been  growing  over  the  Suharto  administration's  trade  and 
industrial  policies;  in  particular,  local  chambers  of  commerce  and 
industry  voiced  criticism  of  the  "high-cost"  economy.  Some  reforms 
had  been  in  preparation  before  1986,  but  without  provisions  that 
would  directly  affect  trade  restrictions.  Major  trade  deregulation 
began  in  1986  but  left  the  main  import  monopolies  untouched  until 
1988.  This  very  gradual  approach  to  reform  became  characteristic  of 
the  later  years  of  the  Suharto  regime.  The  first  sector  to  experience 
reform  in  the  1980s  was  finance  and  banking. 

Financial  Reform 

The  Suharto  administration  inherited  a  system  dominated  by  large 
state  banks  in  which  private  banking  had  virtually  ceased  to  exist. 
The  New  Order  government  immediately  revived  the  legal  founda- 
tion for  commercial  banking,  and  by  1983  Indonesia  had  81  private 
banks,  including  11  foreign  or  joint- venture  institutions.  Neverthe- 
less, the  banking  sector  remained  highly  regulated  until  the  early 
1980s,  when  the  technocrats  spearheaded  a  return  to  market-led

development.  Their  sweeping  reforms  were  aimed  at  transforming 
Indonesia's  financial  sector  into  a  competitive  source  of  credit  at  mar- 
ket-determined interest  rates,  with  a  much  greater  role  for  private 
banks  and  a  growing  stock  exchange.  By  the  1990s,  critics  com- 
plained that  deregulation  had  gone  too  far,  introducing  excessive  risk. 

So-called  liquidity  credits  extended  by  Bank  Indonesia  at  very 
low  interest  rates  subsidized  state  bank  lending  during  the  1980s.  In 
1983  such  credits  represented  more  than  half  of  all  state  bank  lend- 
ing, which  in  turn  made  up  three-quarters  of  all  bank  lending  in 
Indonesia.  Lending  by  private  commercial  banks  had  been  severely 
curtailed,  even  though  such  institutions  offered  better  service  and 
competitive  interest  rates  on  deposits.  In  addition,  Bank  Indonesia 
imposed  credit  quotas  on  all  banks,  ostensibly  to  reduce  inflationary 
pressures.  In  June  1983,  credit  quotas  were  lifted,  and  state  banks 
began  to  offer  market-determined  interest  rates  on  deposits.  Impor- 
tant restrictions  remained,  however,  and  by  1988  state  banks  still 
accounted  for  almost  70  percent  of  total  bank  credit,  with  liquidity 
credits  still  constituting  one-third  of  total  state  bank  credit.  In  Octo- 
ber 1988,  further  financial  deregulation  eliminated  the  remaining 
restrictions  on  bank  competition. 

The  number  of  banks  increased  as  limitations  on  licenses  lifted.  In 
1990  there  were  103  private  banks,  including  12  new  foreign  joint- 
venture  banks.  The  expansion  accelerated  in  the  early  and  mid- 
1990s,  and  by  1997  Indonesia  counted  237  banks,  more  than  Japan. 
These  institutions  included  203  private  commercial  banks,  43  of 
which  were  foreign  or  joint- venture  banks  and  34  state  banks, 
including  27  that  were  run  by  provincial  governments. 

Two  spectacular  bank  scandals  demonstrated  that  professional, 
uncorrupted  regulation  and  oversight  were  sorely  needed.  In  1990 
Bank  Duta,  Indonesia's  second-largest  private  bank,  had  to  be  bailed 
out  after  losing  more  than  US$400  million  in  foreign-exchange  deal- 
ings. Bank  Indonesia  organized  a  rescue  operation  with  the  money 
raised  from  the  shareholders  of  Bank  Duta,  including  several  founda- 
tions chaired  by  Suharto.  In  late  1992,  Bank  Summa  found  itself  in  a 
similar  predicament,  but  the  government  did  not  come  to  the  rescue, 
possibly  because  of  the  honorable  public  image  of  the  bank's  owner, 
William  Suryajaya  (Tjia  Kian  Liong),  founder  of  Astra  International, 
who  had  consistently  declined  to  enter  into  dubious  deals  with  gov- 
ernment agencies.  Liquidation  of  assets  for  the  recovery  of  losses  at 
Bank  Summa  in  fact  paved  the  way  for  a  takeover  of  Astra  Interna- 
tional by  a  group  of  Suharto  cronies,  including  Liem  Sioe  Liong. 

A  few  idiosyncrasies  of  Indonesian  banking  deserve  special  men- 
tion. One  is  the  option  for  banks  to  offer  deposits  denominated  in  for- 
eign currency,  usually  U.S.  dollars.  This  gave  rise  to  the  so-called 


170

Jakarta  dollar  market,  and  in  1990  Bank  Indonesia  determined  that  a 
bank's  net  foreign  position  (the  difference  between  foreign  assets  and 
foreign  liabilities)  could  correspond  to  as  much  as  25  percent  of  the 
bank's  total  outstanding  capital.  Also  characteristic  was  the  close  link 
between  banks  and  conglomerates.  Prior  to  the  reforms  of  1988,  it 
was  often  the  case  that  a  private  bank  was  virtually  the  financial  arm 
of  a  large  conglomerate  and  only  lent  money  to  firms  connected  with 
the  bank's  owners.  The  reforms  constrained  such  loans,  although  they 
remained  difficult  to  control.  In  addition,  starting  in  1990  the  govern- 
ment requested  that  banks  lend  20  percent  of  their  loan  portfolios  to 
small  businesses.  This  policy  reflected  a  growing  concern  that  the 
public  might  perceive  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  as  accruing 
only  to  the  well-connected,  wealthy  few. 

The  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange,  which  operated  for  several  years  as 
a  small  and  ineffective  institution,  experienced  a  spectacular  expan- 
sion once  various  restrictions  were  lifted  in  the  1980s.  The  number 
of  listed  firms  rose  from  24  in  1988  to  125  in  1991,  and  market  capi- 
talization (total  market  value  of  issued  stocks)  climbed  above  Rpl2 
billion  (about  US$6.2  million).  Although  market  capitalization  cor- 
responded to  less  than  15  percent  of  total  bank  credit  to  private 
firms,  the  stock  market  promised  to  become  an  important  source  of 
finance.  However,  the  early  1990s  saw  extreme  swings  between 
euphoric  expansion  and  virtual  collapse,  and  at  one  point  in  1991 
one  stock  brokerage  firm  was  even  charged  with  swindling  other 


171 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

brokers  by  issuing  bad  checks.  The  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  settled 
into  a  more  stable  existence  in  the  mid-1990s  as  the  public  and  bro- 
kers grew  more  familiar  with  procedures.  (The  Jakarta  Stock 
Exchange  merged  with  the  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange  in  2007  to 
form  the  new  Indonesia  Stock  Exchange.) 

Deregulation  and  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector  led  to  a 
very  rapid  enlargement  of  credit  in  Indonesia.  Total  outstanding 
credit  by  1997  reached  Rp306  trillion  (US$105  billion),  80  percent 
of  which  was  denominated  in  rupiah.  Interest  rates  at  domestic  banks 
remained  high,  at  around  15  to  16  percent  on  deposits,  which  made 
borrowing  from  foreign  banks  all  the  more  attractive. 

Industrial  and  Trade  Reform 

Indonesia's  industrialization  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  occurred 
with  many  trade  restrictions  and  government  regulations  that  made 
private  businesses  hostage  to  government  approval  or  protection.  As 
a  consequence,  almost  all  of  Indonesia's  industrial  production  was 
sold  in  the  domestic  market,  leaving  exports  to  be  dominated  by  oil 
and  agricultural  products.  Trade  policy  reforms  in  the  mid-1980s 
proved  successful  in  promoting  the  growth  of  new  export  industries, 
but  the  large  conglomerates  were  in  the  best  position  to  benefit  from 
the  more  competitive  business  environment.  The  uneven  distribution 
of  gains  from  economic  growth  caused  mounting  popular  dissatis- 
faction by  the  mid-1990s. 

The  Indonesian  government  favored  a  strategy  of  import-substitu- 
tion industrialization  that  did  not  expose  domestic  manufacturing  to 
competition  in  world  markets  (see  Industry,  this  ch.).  This  strategy 
was  supported  by  a  great  variety  of  barriers  to  imports:  almost  1,500 
nontariff  restrictions  and  tariffs  ranging  up  to  200  percent  of  the 
value  of  imported  goods.  Inefficiencies  plagued  the  import- substitu- 
tion approach,  and  it  offered  generous  opportunities  for  corruption. 
Case  studies  of  import  substitution  in  manufacturing  showed  that  it 
generated  only  25  percent  of  the  jobs  export-oriented  production 
would  have  provided. 

The  government  initiated  trade  reforms  in  May  1986,  when  duty 
refunds  compensated  for  tariffs  paid  on  goods  imported  by  domestic 
producers  that  exported  a  substantial  share  of  their  output.  A  major 
trade  reform  in  November  1988  began  the  dismantling  of  the  elabo- 
rate nontariff  barriers  and  the  simplification  and  reduction  of  tariffs. 
The  reforms  reduced  the  share  of  domestic  manufacturing  protected 
by  nontariff  barriers  from  50  percent  in  1986  to  35  percent  in  1988. 
By  1990,  some  60  percent  of  nontariff  barriers  had  been  abolished, 
and  import  tariffs  had  a  maximum  rate  of  40  percent.

The  Economy 


There  were  important  exceptions  to  the  credo  of  economic  liberal- 
ism that  accompanied  the  series  of  deregulation  packages  introduced 
between  the  mid-1980s  and  mid-1990s.  Strict  government  control 
remained  in  key  sectors,  notably  natural-resource  exploitation,  tech- 
nology, and  the  sensitive  area  of  pribumi  entrepreneurship. 

The  exploitation  of  oil  and  natural  gas  (marketed  in  the  form  of 
liquefied  natural  gas,  or  LNG)  remained  tightly  controlled  by  the 
government  through  contractual  agreements  between  Pertamina  and 
foreign  oil  companies  (see  Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas,  this  ch.).  In 
the  early  1980s,  restrictions  also  increasingly  restricted  the  logging 
industry,  culminating  in  a  total  ban  on  log  exports  in  1985.  This 
strategy,  aimed  at  fostering  a  domestic  plywood  and  sawmill  indus- 
try, proved  successful  and  was  later  extended  to  exports  of  sawn  tim- 
ber in  order  to  bolster  wood  furniture  manufacturing. 

Ten  state-owned  enterprises  entrusted  with  the  strategic  task  of 
raising  the  level  of  Indonesia's  technological  sophistication  bene- 
fited from  special  protection.  They  included  Krakatau  Steel  and  the 
embryonic  Archipelago  Aircraft  Industry  (IPTN)  and  were  under  the 
direct  supervision  of  the  powerful  minister  of  research  and  technol- 
ogy, Habibie,  a  talented  aircraft  engineer.  The  strategic  industries 
enjoyed  extrabudgetary  funding  and  were  accountable  only  to  the 
president  himself. 

In  order  to  counter  resentment  of  the  privileges  of  the  conglomer- 
ates, President  Suharto  urged  large  corporations  to  divest  part  of  their 
equity  to  employee-owned  cooperatives  on  credit  supplied  by  the 
employer  and  also  to  sponsor  smaller  pribumi  firms  that  could  serve 
as  subcontractors.  None  of  these  actions  were  legally  mandated,  but 
Suharto  made  it  clear  to  the  Chinese  Indonesian  tycoons  that  he 
expected  them  to  comply  if  they  were  to  continue  getting  priority 
access  to  lucrative  government  contracts.  A  survey  of  the  Suharto 
family's  corporate  wealth,  published  in  the  Hong  Kong-based  Far 
Eastern  Economic  Review  in  1992,  demonstrated  that  public  resent- 
ment of  the  ruling  elite  was  growing,  although  government  officials 
and  businessmen  still  declined  to  voice  criticism  openly. 

Corruption  scandals  involving  members  of  the  Suharto  family  prolif- 
erated in  the  mid-1990s,  and  there  were  frequent  public  outcries  of 
indignation.  Some  of  the  most  notorious  cases  concerned  the  president's 
youngest  son,  Tommy  Suharto  (Hutomo  Mandala  Putra).  In  blatant  con- 
tradiction of  the  prevailing  general  policies  of  deregulation,  he  was 
granted  monopoly  rights  to  purchase  and  distribute  cloves  needed  by 
Indonesia's  cigarette  industry,  and  before  long  his  agency  obtained  large 
credits  from  state  banks,  despite  outstanding  debts  to  Bank  Indonesia. 
Even  more  infamous  was  his  involvement  with  the  national  car  industry, 


173 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

set  up  as  a  joint  venture  with  the  automobile  manufacturer  Kia  of  the 
Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea).  In  1996  Tommy  Suharto's  company, 
National  Son  Timor  (TPN),  was  exempted  from  payment  of  import  tar- 
iffs when  importing  South  Korean-made  sedans  that  were  subsequently 
marketed  as  a  domestic  product  called  the  Timor.  Because  of  this  fla- 
grant violation  of  its  own  trade  legislation,  the  Indonesian  government 
was  brought  before  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO — see  Glos- 
sary) by  Japanese,  U.S.,  and  European  car  manufacturers  operating  in 
Indonesia.  The  Indonesian  government  predictably  lost  the  case,  adding 
to  the  considerable  damage  already  done  to  its  prestige,  both  interna- 
tionally and  at  home. 

In  The  East  Asian  Miracle,  a,  well-known  analysis  of  spectacular 
economic  success  in  East  Asia  published  in  1993,  the  World  Bank 
classified  Indonesia  as  a  "high-performing  Asian  economy,"  along 
with  Hong  Kong,  Japan,  Malaysia,  Singapore,  South  Korea,  Taiwan, 
and  Thailand.  Indonesia's  GDP  growth  had  indeed  been  impressive, 
averaging  5.5  percent  annually  during  the  preceding  decade  (1984- 
93).  A  growth  acceleration  occurred  in  the  mid-1990s,  with  the 
annual  average  approaching  8  percent  over  the  years  1994-96. 
Exports  grew  by  8  percent  per  year,  and  growth  figures  were  higher 
still  in  finance,  construction,  utilities,  and  various  branches  of  manu- 
facturing. As  late  as  May  1997,  only  a  few  months  before  the  Asian 
financial  crisis  spread  to  Indonesia,  the  World  Bank,  in  its  annual 
assessment,  expressed  confidence  in  the  growth  prospects  and  mac- 
roeconomic  fundamentals  of  the  Indonesian  economy. 

Crisis  Management 

No  one  foresaw  that  when  Bank  Indonesia  floated  the  rupiah  on 
August  14,  1997,  this  would  be  the  starting  point  of  a  severe  finan- 
cial crisis  with  profound  social  and  political  ramifications.  The 
downward  adjustment  in  the  value  of  the  currency  turned  into  a  free 
fall  of  the  exchange  rate,  a  near  collapse  of  the  stock  market,  mas- 
sive capital  flight,  an  abrupt  end  to  growth  in  almost  all  sectors  of 
the  economy,  mass  layoffs,  galloping  inflation,  and  a  rapidly  increas- 
ing incidence  of  poverty.  In  May  1998,  riots  and  political  upheaval 
culminated  in  the  downfall  of  Suharto.  The  key  issues  surrounding 
the  financial  crisis  that  struck  Indonesia  relate  to  the  reasons  why  the 
crisis  became  so  severe  and  the  ways  in  which  crisis  management 
was  executed. 

There  is  general  agreement  among  scholars  that  high  rates  of 
growth  and  apparently  healthy  macroeconomic  indicators,  notably  a 
balanced  budget  and  moderate  rates  of  inflation,  masked  structural 
weaknesses  that  made  Indonesia  highly  vulnerable  to  a  financial  cri- 


174

sis  imported  from  abroad.  Such  weaknesses  included  rapidly  increas- 
ing private  debt,  a  quasi-fixed  exchange  rate  despite  large  inflows  of 
mobile  short-run  capital,  a  poorly  supervised  banking  system  that  left 
much  room  for  reckless  lending  and  widespread  collusion,  and  cor- 
ruption in  the  allocation  of  government  contracts.  Private  external 
debt  grew  from  US$7.5  billion  in  1991  to  nearly  US$58  billion  in 
1997,  an  almost  eightfold  increase.  Much  of  this  debt  was  short-term 
and  lacked  hedging  in  the  form  of  safeguards  against  fluctuations  in 
the  exchange  rate.  Banks  and  conglomerates  tacitly  assumed  that  the 
government  would  step  in  and  bail  them  out  if  they  were  unable  to 
meet  their  foreign  obligations.  Such  behavior,  commonly  regarded  as 
constituting  a  "moral  hazard,"  was  a  characteristic  feature  of  the 
Asian  crisis  in  general,  but  in  the  case  of  Indonesia  it  was  more 
strongly  linked  than  elsewhere  to  the  political  economy,  in  particular 
the  nexus  between  private  economic  interests  and  the  apex  of  politi- 
cal power.  Corruption  and  poor  governance  did  not  cause  the  finan- 
cial crisis  in  Indonesia,  but  these  factors  did  make  the  crisis  worse. 

Predicaments  in  the  financial  sector  became  acute  because  short- 
run  loans  from  foreign  creditors  had  to  be  repaid  in  international  cur- 
rency, whereas  revenues  were  generated  from  long-run  investment 
and  denominated  in  domestic  currency.  The  sharp  depreciation  of  the 
rupiah  led  to  an  instant  increase  in  the  number  of  nonperforming 
loans.  The  government  had  little  choice  but  to  turn  to  the  IMF  for 
assistance.  From  late  October  1997  until  December  2002,  crisis 
management  and  postcrisis  recovery  policies  were  determined  by  the 
interplay  between  the  IMF  and  the  Indonesian  government. 


175 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  rescue  package  envisaged  a  huge  standby  assistance  fund  of 
US$38  billion,  at  the  time  the  largest  sum  of  this  kind  ever  offered  by 
the  IMF  to  an  individual  nation,  with  disbursement  conditional  on  the 
implementation  of  specific  reforms.  The  IMF  concluded  no  fewer 
than  four  consecutive  agreements  with  Indonesia,  on  October  31, 
1997,  and  January  15,  April  10,  and  July  29,  1998.  The  agreements 
required  the  establishment  of  facilities  for  bank  and  debt  restructur- 
ing, prudence  in  fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  and  the  pursuit  of 
deregulation  with  greater  vigor  than  in  the  past.  However,  action  fol- 
lowing the  first  IMF  agreement  backfired  as  the  closure  of  16  ailing 
banks  triggered  large-scale  capital  flight  that  put  the  rupiah  under 
even  greater  strain  than  before.  Doubts  arose  about  Suharto's  com- 
mitment to  reform,  especially  after  one  of  the  shuttered  institutions, 
Bank  Andromeda,  owned  by  his  second  son,  Bambang  Trihatmojo, 
reopened  under  a  new  name.  It  took  a  telephone  call  from  U.S.  presi- 
dent William  J.  Clinton  in  January  1998  to  persuade  Suharto  to  sign  a 
second  agreement  with  the  IMF,  which  more  forcefully  committed 
the  Indonesian  government  to  reform  and,  in  particular,  did  away 
with  monopoly  privileges  such  as  those  enjoyed  by  Tommy  Suharto's 
national  car  project  and  B.  J.  Habibie's  aircraft  company.  The  IMF 
also  permitted  the  government  to  run  a  deficit,  corresponding  to  1 
percent  of  GDP,  to  allow  for  aid  to  the  large  numbers  of  people  now 
struck  by  poverty. 

Lack  of  cooperation  on  the  part  of  the  central  authorities  contin- 
ued into  the  first  half  of  1998,  Indonesia's  worst  year  of  economic 
crisis,  when  GDP  contracted  by  an  unprecedented  13.7  percent, 
more  than  during  the  entire  depression  of  the  1930s.  Suharto's  selec- 
tion of  Habibie  as  vice  president,  and  the  appointment  of  well- 
known  cronies  and  his  own  daughter  as  cabinet  ministers,  eroded 
confidence  in  the  long-serving  president's  ability  to  deliver  Indone- 
sia from  crisis.  The  IMF  grew  alarmed  by  Suharto's  toying  with  the 
idea  of  a  currency  board  that  would  operate  on  the  basis  of  a  fixed 
rate  of  exchange.  This  arrangement  would  have  been  in  direct  viola- 
tion of  the  reform  agreements,  but  the  rumor  was  that  it  would  allow 
the  Suharto  family  to  get  assets  out  of  the  country  without  serious 
damage  to  their  value. 

The  third  IMF  agreement  (April  10,  1998)  reiterated  the  commit- 
ments made  in  the  two  previous  agreements  but  raised  the  permitted 
deficit  on  the  budget  to  3.5  percent  of  GDP  and  pressed  anew  for 
determined  action  by  the  Indonesian  government.  By  that  time,  even 
Suharto's  most  ardent  supporters  were  realizing  that  the  aging  presi- 
dent was  part  of  the  problem  rather  than  the  means  for  its  solution.  The 
fourth  and  final  IMF  agreement  (July  29,  1998)  followed  Habibie's 


176 


The  Economy 


installation  as  Suharto's  successor.  The  extreme  increase  in  poverty 
necessitated  a  far  larger  budget  deficit;  in  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glos- 
sary) 1999,  it  would  correspond  to  8.5  percent  of  GDP  and  would  be 
financed  with  a  loan  provided  by  an  international  aid  consortium,  the 
Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  (CGI — see  Glossary;  see  Govern- 
ment Finance,  this  ch.). 

Precious  time  was  lost  between  the  onset  of  the  financial  crisis  in 
August  1997  and  the  fourth  IMF  agreement  in  July  1998.  The  main 
reason  was  the  Suharto  administration's  inability  to  confront  the  fun- 
damental problems  of  the  crisis.  This  delay  understandably  caused 
serious  doubts  on  the  part  of  the  IMF,  which  deferred  disbursement  of 
the  pledged  assistance.  By  July  1998,  only  a  small  proportion  of  the 
huge  rescue  package  had  actually  been  paid  out.  Cooperation  with  the 
IMF  improved  significantly  under  President  Habibie  and  his  two 
immediate  successors,  Abdurrahman  Wahid  and  Megawati  Sukar- 
noputri. Two  key  members  of  the  Megawati  cabinet,  Minister  of 
Finance  Budiono  and  Coordinating  Minister  for  the  Economy  Doro- 
jatun  Kuncoro-Yakti,  were  both  Western-trained  and  highly  respon- 
sive to  IMF  recommendations.  The  IMF  also  displayed  an  increasing 
sensitivity  to  the  demands  of  the  specific  crisis  in  Indonesia,  notably 
by  abandoning  the  priority  of  a  balanced  budget  in  fiscal  policy  and 
by  recognizing  the  need  for  social  safety-net  programs  to  protect  the 
most  vulnerable  groups  in  society  from  the  effects  of  the  crisis. 

Postcrisis  Reform 

The  most  pressing  problems  of  structural  reform  in  the  wake  of  the 
financial  crisis  fell  to  two  newly  established  institutions,  the  Indone- 
sian Bank  Restructuring  Agency  (BPPN,  also  IBRA)  and  the  Indone- 
sian Debt  Restructuring  Agency  (Indra),  established  in  January  and 
July  1998,  respectively.  The  BPPN  had  the  task  of  taking  over  assets 
of  bankrupt  banks  and  arranging  recapitalization  of  ailing  banks.  Indra 
focused  on  corporate  debts  but  was  superseded  by  another  agency,  the 
so-called  Jakarta  Initiative,  set  up  jointly  by  the  government  and  the 
World  Bank  in  September  1998,  which  smoothed  debt  settlement 
through  bilateral  negotiations  and  debt-equity  swapping.  As  a  result, 
the  government  acquired  substantial  holdings  of  assets  that  were  to  be 
sold  off  gradually  so  as  to  retroactively  finance  the  debt  settlements. 
Privatization  became  a  key  strategy  of  economic  policy. 

The  BPPN  took  over  10  private  banks  in  1998  and  1999,  closed 
down  another  66,  and  merged  four  troubled  state  banks  into  one  new 
institution,  Bank  Mandiri,  which  became  the  single  largest  bank  in 
Indonesia.  In  May  1999,  the  total  cost  of  bailing  out  and  recapitaliz- 
ing troubled  banks  was  estimated  at  Rp406  trillion  (US$51.4  billion).

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

By  2002  the  total  amount  needed  for  bailout  and  recapitalization  had 
reached  Rp660  trillion  (US$70.8  billion).  The  country  then  had  179 
banks  remaining,  93  of  which  were  scheduled  for  restructuring, 
including  31  state-owned,  57  joint  ventures,  and  5  privately  owned. 
Progress  was  slow,  however,  especially  in  terms  of  divesting  the 
assets  that  had  been  taken  over  from  these  institutions.  By  the  time 
the  BPPN  was  dissolved  in  February  2004,  it  had  recovered  28  per- 
cent of  the  nominal  value  of  loans  it  had  taken  over  but  had  been  able 
to  return  only  25  percent  of  the  value  of  the  bonds  the  government 
had  issued  to  pay  the  banks  *  creditors.  Remaining  assets,  carrying  a 
book  value  of  US$8.3  billion,  came  directly  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Department  of  Finance.  Assessments  of  BPPN's  performance  pointed 
out  that  it  would  have  been  unrealistic  to  expect  the  agency  to  get 
more  for  assets  that  had  been  grossly  overvalued  in  the  first  place. 

Bank  and  debt  restructuring  in  the  period  from  1998  to  2004  suf- 
fered from  two  problems  beyond  the  strict  confines  of  financial  policy 
and  management.  One  problem  was  in  the  legal  sphere  and  concerned 
bankruptcy.  A  1998  bankruptcy  law  finally  replaced  one  dating  from 
Dutch  colonial  times,  but  it  still  proved  very  difficult  to  get  debt-rid- 
den firms  declared  bankrupt.  Creditors  won  very  few  cases,  in  a  judi- 
cial system  widely  known  to  be  rife  with  corruption.  The  other 
problem  concerned  the  divestment  of  seized  corporate  assets.  When 
assets  were  sold  off,  there  was  a  real  risk  that  the  BPPN  would  come 
across  former  owners  trying  to  buy  back  their  assets  at  low  prices, 
possibly  under  other  names.  Whenever  foreign  buyers  were  involved, 
political  opposition  was  likely  in  the  legislature  or  through  pressure 
groups.  In  2001  nationalist  opposition  in  Sumatera  Barat  Province 
successfully  blocked  the  sale  of  a  majority  equity  share  in  a  state- 
owned  cement  factory  to  the  Mexican  cement  giant  CEMEX  (for- 
merly Cementos  Mexicanos).  Eventually,  CEMEX  bought  25  percent 
of  the  shares,  but  it  expressed  a  wish  to  pull  out  in  2006. 

Good  governance  became  a  top  priority  of  postcrisis  reform,  and 
recent  administrations  have,  in  varying  degrees,  pledged  to  combat 
corruption  and  enhance  democracy  and  the  transparency  of  govern- 
ment affairs.  One  of  the  most  sweeping  reforms  entailed  a  far-reaching 
delegation  of  authority  to  subnational  levels  of  government  (see 
Decentralization,  this  ch.).  Although  implementation  was  quick  and 
complete,  with  maximum  involvement  of  democratic  institutions,  suc- 
cess was  limited,  largely  because  of  great  variation  in  the  capacity  of 
local  governments  to  exercise  their  authority  in  taxation  and  fiscal  pol- 
icy. Even  though  he  supported  democratic  reforms,  including  arrange- 
ment of  Indonesia's  first  fully  free  general  elections  since  1955, 
Habibie  enjoyed  little  credibility,  as  he  himself  was  the  product  of  a 


178 


The  Economy 


corrupt  and  despised  system.  A  scandal  in  September  1999  involving 
secret  money  transfers  from  the  private  Bank  Bali  to  the  ruling  political 
party  erased  any  remaining  faith  in  Habibie's  commitment  to  genuine 
reform. 

Elected  to  the  presidency  by  the  People's  Consultative  Assembly 
(MPR)  in  October  1999,  Abdurrahman  Wahid  initially  profited  from 
much  goodwill  both  at  home  and  abroad,  but  this  support  vanished 
as  a  result  of  his  erratic  style  of  government  and  lack  of  tangible 
accomplishments  (see  The  Political  Process,  ch.  4).  Direct  adminis- 
trative intervention  by  the  president  frequently  had  unfortunate 
results.  For  example,  in  April  2000  Wahid  dismissed  Laksamana 
Sukardi  as  minister  for  investment  and  state  enterprises  development 
without  offering  any  clear  explanation.  Sukardi  had  an  undisputed 
image  of  integrity  and  was  in  fact  the  first  cabinet-level  minister  to 
expose  the  way  Suharto  had  abused  his  power  in  order  to  give  signif- 
icant favors  to  his  business  associates.  Shortly  afterward,  Wahid  also 
had  the  governor  of  Bank  Indonesia,  Syahril  Sabirin,  placed  under 
detention  out  of  displeasure  with  the  central  bank's  independent 
action.  Wahid's  successor,  his  vice  president,  Megawati  Sukarnopu- 
tri, had  the  good  fortune  of  being  surrounded  by  some  very  capable 
economic  advisers.  During  her  presidency,  economic  recovery  pro- 
ceeded reasonably  smoothly,  but  strikingly  little  was  achieved  in 
combating  corruption,  including  that  in  the  judicial  system. 

Two  institutions  in  particular  had  a  mandate  to  combat  corruption, 
the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  the  Corruption 
Crimes  Court  (Tipikor),  both  established  in  2002  on  the  recommen- 
dation of  the  IMF.  After  a  relatively  slow  start,  they  became  more 
active  in  2005.  In  that  year  alone,  450  corruption  cases  were  prose- 
cuted, compared  with  only  about  200  during  the  three  years  of  Mega- 
wati's  presidency  (2001^).  This  increase  seemed  to  reflect  a  genuine 
commitment  on  the  part  of  Megawati's  successor,  Susilo  Bambang 
Yudhoyono  (known  colloquially  by  his  initials,  SBY),  to  weed  out 
corrupt  practices  from  public  administration  in  Indonesia.  Signifi- 
cantly, by  early  2006  Yudhoyono  had  allowed  corruption  charges  to 
be  levied  against  52  high-ranking  government  officials  at  the  provin- 
cial and  district  levels,  as  well  as  against  seven  governors,  nine  may- 
ors, and  36  district  heads. 

The  Yudhoyono  administration  also  sought  to  improve  the  invest- 
ment climate  in  Indonesia  by  presenting  a  reform  package  in  Febru- 
ary 2006  that  included  a  new  investment  law,  tax  incentives, 
facilities  for  training  personnel,  and  financial  aid  to  small-scale  busi- 
ness enterprises.  The  reform  package  also  proposed  the  establish- 
ment of  eight  new  special  economic  zones  for  export  production.  At 


179 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

mid-decade,  economic  reform  policies  pursued  by  the  Indonesian 
government  seemed  to  have  a  new  momentum.  By  2008,  however, 
there  was  again  mounting  disappointment  with  the  slow  pace  of 
reform,  especially  in  local  governments,  state-owned  enterprises, 
and  some  central  government  departments. 

Government  Finance 

Central  Government  Budget 

Five-year  development  plans  (Repelita — see  Glossary)  were  an 
important  tool  in  economic  planning  beginning  in  the  1960s.  These 
plans  offered  broad  guidelines  and  set  general  priorities.  The  empha- 
sis was  on  rehabilitation  in  Repelita  I  (1969-73),  but  it  then  shifted  to 
increasing  productivity  in  agriculture  and  improving  infrastructure  in 
particular  during  the  1970s.  After  the  drop  in  oil  prices  in  the  early 
and  mid-1980s,  consecutive  Repelitas  stressed  industrialization  and 
export  promotion.  By  the  time  of  Repelita  V  (1989-93),  the  main 
objectives  included  continued  export  diversification  and  reduced  reli- 
ance on  foreign  aid.  The  1980s  and  early  1990s  also  saw  increasing 
attention  given  to  social  development  issues,  such  as  education, 
health,  and  family  planning.  Repelita  VI  (1994-98)  stressed  the 
expansion  of  manufacturing  and  set  growth  targets  that  were  over- 
taken by  actual  developments  on  the  eve  of  the  1997-98  financial  cri- 
sis. The  government  abandoned  conventional  Repelitas  in  the  wake  of 
the  crisis  and  thereafter  replaced  them  with  national  medium-term 
development  plans  (NMDPs),  also  set  out  in  five-year  increments. 
The  main  objectives  of  the  2004-9  NMDP  included  a  sharp  reduction 
in  poverty  and  registered  unemployment  and  an  average  annual  rate  of 
growth  of  6.6  percent. 

The  Repelitas  served  as  general  indicators  of  the  direction  of  gov- 
ernment policy  rather  than  concrete  priorities  (the  latter  being  pro- 
vided by  the  annual  budget  of  the  central  government).  Indonesia 
traditionally  had  a  fiscal  year  that  ran  from  April  1  to  March  3 1 ,  with 
the  national  government's  draft  budget  for  a  particular  year  usually 
submitted  to  the  People's  Representative  Council  (DPR)  in  January, 
only  months  before  the  budget  was  to  become  effective  (see  Legisla- 
tive Bodies,  ch.  4).  Beginning  in  2000,  the  fiscal  year  coincided  with 
the  calendar  year,  with  the  budget  now  sent  to  the  DPR  at  mid-year. 
As  a  consequence,  the  budget  for  2000  covered  only  nine  months. 
Public  spending  historically  was  divided  into  two  broad  categories, 
routine  and  development  expenditures.  Routine  expenditures  included 
the  salaries  of  civil  servants  and  most  spending  on  materials,  opera- 
tions, and  maintenance,  whereas  development  expenditures  consisted 


180 


The  Economy 


of  project-related  spending  in  areas  such  as  investment,  research,  and 
training.  Over  time,  however,  the  line  dividing  the  two  categories 
became  somewhat  arbitrary  in  practice.  Starting  with  the  FY  2005 
budget,  the  distinction  between  routine  and  development  expenditure 
was  abandoned  entirely  and  replaced  by  a  classification  system  rec- 
ommended by  the  IMF  that  differentiated  more  carefully  between  cur- 
rent and  capital  outlays  and  among  levels  of  government  authority. 
The  distinction  between  spending  by  the  central  government  and  that 
by  regional  governments  has  become  ever  more  important  since  the 
decentralization  reforms  that  followed  the  collapse  of  the  New  Order 
government. 

Since  the  1980s,  the  total  government  budget  has  been  rather  stable, 
about  or  slightly  less  than  20  percent  of  GDP.  In  2003  total  government 
expenditures  amounted  to  Rp371  trillion  (US$43.2  billion),  or  19.1 
percent  of  GDP,  against  a  total  revenue  of  Rp336  trillion  (US$39.2  bil- 
lion), or  17.3  percent  of  GDP.  The  resulting  deficit  corresponded  to  1.8 
percent  of  GDP.  The  2009  budget  envisaged  government  revenue  at 
21.2  percent  of  GDP  and  government  expenditure  at  23.4  percent  of 
GDP.  Deficit  spending  has  been  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule  in 
Indonesian  government  finance  since  the  late  1960s.  Fiscal  prudence 
and  rapid  economic  growth  resulted  in  balanced  budgets  throughout 
the  1980s  and  early  and  mid-1990s.  Even  the  initial  draft  budget  for  the 
crisis  year  1998-99,  prepared  in  mid- 1997,  included  projection  of  a 
small  surplus,  which  proved  entirely  unrealistic.  Combating  crisis  and 
staging  economic  recovery  necessitated  deficit  spending  by  the  central 
government  starting  in  1998.  The  budget  deficit  rose  to  6.8  percent  of 
GDP  in  FY  1999  (12  months)  and  was  5  percent  of  GDP  in  FY  2000 
(nine  months).  It  then  fell  gradually,  reaching  2.5  percent  in  FY  2002 
and  creeping  below  1  percent  in  FY  2005  and  FY  2006.  The  budget  for 
FY  2008  displayed  a  deficit  of  Rp73  trillion  (US$8.1  billion)  corre- 
sponding to  1.7  percent  of  GDP,  whereas  the  one  agreed  for  FY  2009 
showed  a  slightly  higher  deficit  at  2.2  percent  of  GDP. 

A  bottleneck  in  central  government  finance  in  Indonesia  occurs 
because  of  the  heavy  reliance  on  sources  of  revenue  based  in  the  oil 
and  gas  sector.  Taxes  paid  by  foreign  oil  companies  burgeoned  during 
the  oil  boom  of  the  1970s,  raising  oil's  contribution  to  total  government 
revenue  from  one-third  in  1974  to  more  than  two-thirds  by  1979.  Even 
in  the  early  1980s,  at  least  half  of  government  income  came  from  oil- 
related  taxes.  A  major  tax  reform  in  1984  introduced  a  value-added  tax 
(VAT)  on  consumer  goods  and  a  moderately  progressive  income  tax. 
Although  85  percent  of  households  did  not  earn  enough  to  be  subject  to 
the  income  tax,  the  contribution  of  non-oil  tax  revenue  did  increase  sig- 
nificantly, climbing  from  less  than  RplO  trillion  (about  US$9  billion) 


181 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

annually  in  the  mid-1980s  to  almost  Rp60  trillion  (about  US$26  bil- 
lion) by  the  mid-1990s.  As  a  consequence,  revenues  from  oil  and  gas 
dropped  to  20  percent  of  total  domestic  revenue,  but  the  downward 
trend  was  reversed  by  the  steep  decline  in  incomes  during  the  Asian 
financial  crisis.  The  contribution  of  oil  and  gas  revenues  again  rose  to 
about  30  percent  of  total  government  revenue  and  oscillated  around 
that  level  in  the  years  immediately  following  the  turn  of  the  century, 
even  rising  somewhat  as  a  result  of  high  oil  prices  on  the  world  market 
in  2005  and  2006.  Oil  and  gas  contributed  20  percent  of  total  govern- 
ment revenue  in  the  agreed  budget  for  FY  2008. 

The  tax-revenue  bottleneck  has  been  reflected  in  a  high  depen- 
dence on  foreign  aid  and  borrowing  abroad.  Foreign  public  debt 
increased  sharply  in  the  1980s,  approaching  US$50  billion  by  that 
decade's  end.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  government  shifted  from  its  tra- 
ditional reliance  on  long-term  public  debt  to  allowing  more  private 
and  short-run  lending.  The  stock  of  foreign  debt  declined  from  about 
80  percent  of  GDP  to  less  than  60  percent  as  a  result,  and  also 
because  of  simultaneous  rapid  economic  growth.  On  the  eve  of  crisis 
in  1997,  Indonesia's  public  debt  amounted  to  US$58  billion.  This 
downward  trend  was  reversed  by  the  crisis,  which  saw  another  sharp 
increase  in  foreign  indebtedness,  up  to  more  than  100  percent  of 
GDP.  Foreign  funding  was  vital  to  finance  two-thirds  of  the  deficit 
on  the  FY  1999  (April  1999-March  2000)  budget  and  half  of  the 
deficit  on  the  budget  for  FY  2000  (April-December  2000);  the  Indo- 
nesian government  had  little  choice.  Tax  revenues  were  constrained 
by  the  real  decline  in  GDP,  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  seized  corpo- 
rate assets  were  slow  in  coming,  and  it  was  next  to  impossible  to  cut 
expenditures  in  the  midst  of  a  severe  economic  crisis.  Prior  to  the 
crisis,  routine  expenditures  usually  made  up  about  two-thirds  of  total 
public  spending,  but  this  proportion  rose  to  85  percent  at  the  time  of 
the  crisis.  The  traditional  expenditure  ratio  of  roughly  two-thirds 
routine  and  one-third  development  was  restored  around  2000,  but  the 
allocation  now  needed  for  debt  servicing  represented  a  far  heavier 
burden  than  before.  The  distribution  between  routine  and  develop- 
ment expenditures  stabilized  at  75  percent  for  the  former  and  25  per- 
cent for  the  latter  during  the  2002—4  period,  preceding  the  change  in 
the  system  of  budgetary  classification. 

The  budget  for  FY  2002,  in  part  designed  by  ministers  Budiono 
and  Dorojatun  of  the  newly  inaugurated  Megawati  cabinet,  may 
serve  to  illustrate  some  typical  features  of  public  finance  in  Indone- 
sia that  held  true  for  the  most  part  in  subsequent  years.  Tax  revenue 
was  expected  to  contribute  73  percent  of  total  government  income, 
corresponding  to  less  than  13  percent  of  GDP,  which  was  low  by 


182 


The  Economy 


international  standards.  Most  other  government  revenue  was  pro- 
jected to  derive  from  the  exploitation  of  oil  and  natural  gas 
resources,  an  assumption  that  implied  a  continued  dependence  on 
strong  world  oil  prices  in  government  financial  planning.  Expendi- 
tures, corresponding  to  20  percent  of  GDP,  were  divided  between 
routine  and  development  purposes  at  a  ratio  of  78  percent  to  22  per- 
cent. The  central  government  assumed  responsibility  for  72  percent 
and  regional  governments  for  28  percent  of  total  outlays,  a  ratio  that 
testifies  to  the  strong  start  of  the  decentralization  reforms.  Total 
development  spending  at  the  central  level  was  set  at  Rp50  trillion 
(about  US$5.3  billion),  about  25  percent  of  which  was  designated 
for  education  and  culture  but  only  10  percent  for  health  and  welfare. 
The  scope  for  expenditure  on  social-development  projects  remained 
severely  constrained.  Interest  payments  would  make  up  more  than 
25  percent  of  central  government  outlays  in  the  FY  2002  budget, 
whereas  around  12  percent  would  go  to  subsidies  on  consumption,  in 
particular  fuel  use.  Neither  expenditure  lent  itself  to  easy  reduction. 
The  interest  payments  were  a  legacy  of  the  crisis  management  of  the 
late  1990s,  which  entailed  the  buildup  of  a  large  public  debt,  and  the 
subsidies  were  politically  untouchable  because  no  administration  in 
search  of  popular  support  would  tamper  with  a  benefit  enjoyed  by 
large  segments  of  the  population.  The  subsidies  on  fuel  consumption 
were  substantially  reduced  in  October  2005  after  many  years  when 
the  change  was  motivated — and  justified — by  the  finding  that  80 
percent  of  this  entitlement  represented  a  generous  handout  to  those 
in  the  top  60  percent  of  income  distribution.  Fuel  subsidies  increased 
again  in  early  2009,  arguably  with  an  eye  to  the  upcoming  presiden- 
tial elections. 

Decentralization 

Under  Suharto's  administration,  Indonesia  had  one  of  the  most 
centralized  governments  among  developing  nations.  Spending  at  the 
regional  level  was  highly  dependent  on  transfers  of  funds  from  the 
top  level  of  government  through  a  complex  system  of  direct  grants 
from  both  the  routine  and  development  budgets,  complemented  by 
special  allocations  made  at  the  direction  of  the  president.  One  legacy 
of  the  short-lived  Habibie  administration  in  the  late  1990s  was  the 
transformation  of  this  arrangement  into  its  virtual  opposite,  one  of 
the  most  decentralized  public-finance  systems  among  the  major 
nations  of  the  world.  The  basis  for  this  far-reaching  reform  was  laid 
down  in  two  laws  promulgated  in  1999 — Law  22,  on  regional  gov- 
ernment, and  Law  25,  on  the  financial  balance  between  the  center 
and  the  regions.  Law  22  did  away  with  the  hierarchical  relationship 


183 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

between  the  central  government  and  the  provinces  and  regencies. 
The  most  striking  feature  of  the  new  system,  which  took  effect  in 
January  2001,  is  that  it  granted  considerable  discretionary  authority 
in  public  finance  to  the  regencies  and  municipalities,  which  by  that 
time  numbered  353.  The  provincial  level  was  virtually  bypassed. 
Law  25  enumerates  categories  of  revenue  for  activities  under  the 
direct  responsibility  of  the  district  government.  They  include  the  dis- 
trict's own  sources  of  income  through  local  taxation;  so-called  equal- 
ization grants,  which  replaced  transfers  from  Jakarta;  and  borrowing 
at  home  and  abroad.  The  equalization  grants  contain  a  general  fund 
allocation,  a  special  fund  allocation,  and  provisions  for  revenue  shar- 
ing in  the  exploitation  of  natural  resources  within  the  borders  of  the 
district.  This  revenue  sharing  ranges  from  1 5  percent  of  revenues  for 
oil  exploitation  and  30  percent  for  natural  gas,  up  to  80  percent  for 
logging,  fisheries,  and  non-oil,  non-gas  mining.  This  provision  meant 
that  certain  districts  located  in  resource-rich  jurisdictions  such  as  the 
Special  Region  of  Aceh  (called  Nanggroe  Aceh  Darussalam,  1 999- 
2009)  and  the  provinces  of  Kalimantan  Timur  and  Papua  quickly 
started  to  receive  substantially  more  income  than  previously. 

The  decentralization  reform  enjoyed  considerable  popular  support 
from  the  outset.  It  was  generally  regarded  as  having  gotten  off  to  a 
strong  start,  but  the  authorities  were  criticized  for  proceeding  too 
hastily.  Rules  for  allocating  funding  preceded  a  precise  definition  of 
tasks  under  district  responsibility,  and  the  distinctions  among  the 
various  levels  of  government  remained  blurred  by  liberal  use  of  the 
term  region  (daerah)  in  legislation  and  official  instructions.  One 
direct  consequence  of  the  reform  was  the  reassignment  of  1 .9  million 
civil  servants  from  the  central  government  to  local  authorities,  with- 
out these  individuals  actually  having  to  move  physically.  The  trans- 
fer affected  almost  50  percent  of  all  civil  servants  in  Indonesia, 
including  large  numbers  of  teachers  and  health-care  workers.  By 
2005  two  out  of  three  civil  servants  in  Indonesia  were  working  for  a 
local  government. 

The  overall  allocation  of  budgetary  expenditures  to  the  central  and 
local  governments  stabilized  at  a  ratio  of  70  percent  to  30  percent  dur- 
ing the  five  years  immediately  following  the  decentralization  reform. 
This  division  implies  that  as  much  as  6  to  7  percent  of  GDP  was  actu- 
ally being  transferred  annually  by  the  central  government  to  be  spent 
by  a  local  authority.  Intergovernmental  transfers  form  the  chief  source 
of  income  for  local  governments,  accounting  for  an  average  of  76  per- 
cent of  disposable  funds  at  the  local  level.  Moreover,  bypassing  the 
provincial  level  of  government,  in  accordance  with  the  1999  legisla- 
tion, led  to  the  expenditure  of  75  percent  of  decentralized  revenue

according  to  the  priorities  of  district  administrative  heads  or  regents 
(bupati)  in  rural  regencies  and  mayors  in  the  municipalities.  The 
direct  link  between  budget  authority  and  locally  elected  officials  can 
have  a  positive  impact  in  terms  of  enhancing  democracy,  but  it  may 
equally  well  offer  enlarged  opportunities  for  corruption.  Subsequent 
revisions  to  decentralization  legislation  restored  some  authority  to 
provincial  governments. 

Monetary  and  Exchange-Rate  Policy 

Bank  Indonesia,  the  nation's  central  bank,  was  founded  in  1953  as 
the  successor  to  the  Java  Bank,  which  had  been  nationalized  two 
years  earlier.  Bank  Indonesia  has  since  then  been  supervised  by  a 
monetary  board  chaired  by  the  minister  of  finance,  which  has  made  it 
difficult  for  the  central  bank  to  pursue  monetary  policies  indepen- 
dently of  the  current  administration.  Although  this  arrangement 
remained  unchanged  in  2008,  legislation  in  1999  had  strengthened  the 
position  of  the  governor  of  Bank  Indonesia  vis-a-vis  the  government, 
notably  by  precluding  dismissal  unless  criminal  charges  were  raised. 
The  bank's  major  tasks  are  regulating  the  money  supply,  setting  the

exchange-rate  policy,  and  supervising  the  financial  sector.  A  chief 
instrument  for  monetary  policy  was  established  in  1984  when  Bank 
Indonesia  started  issuing  its  own  debt  in  the  form  of  certificates,  Ser- 
tifikat  Bank  Indonesia  (SBIs).  Because  commercial  banks  have  been 
encouraged  to  invest  short-term  funds  in  SBIs,  Bank  Indonesia  has 
been  able  to  influence  the  volume  of  bank  reserves  by  buying  and 
selling  SBIs.  Bank  Indonesia  also  has  supported  the  development  of 
other  privately  issued  short-term  debt  instruments.  A  sophisticated 
market  in  short-term  securities  has  offered  banks  a  tool  for  more  flex- 
ible management  of  their  total  assets  and  has  encouraged  them  to  hold 
short-term  funds  in  rupiah  rather  than  in  international  currency  depos- 
its, which  had  become  the  practice  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s. 
Because  the  Indonesian  government  maintained  a  balanced  budget, 
no  securities  were  made  available  until  crisis  management  required 
financing  by  means  of  large-scale  issuing  of  government  bonds. 

Very  high  inflation  was  a  major  problem  during  the  final  years  of 
the  Sukarno  administration,  when  budget  deficits  were  increasingly 
financed  by  Bank  Indonesia  in  compliance  with  instructions  from  the 
monetary  board  but  in  flagrant  violation  of  the  bank's  own  charter, 
which  limited  central  bank  credit  to  20  percent  of  gold  and  foreign- 
exchange  reserves.  The  Suharto  government  curbed  inflation,  reduc- 
ing it  from  about  900  percent  in  1966  to  9  percent  by  1970.  When  oil 
revenues  surged  in  1974,  the  central  bank  found  itself,  in  essence, 
printing  rupiah  currency  in  exchange  for  oil  revenues  denominated  in 
U.S.  dollars.  Bank  credit  increased  precipitously  once  the  currency 
was  deposited  in  domestic  banks.  Inflation  shot  to  more  than  40  per- 
cent annually,  and  Bank  Indonesia  responded  by  imposing  direct  con- 
trols on  the  volume  of  credit  issued  by  individual  banks,  a  policy  that 
made  it  harder  for  private  banks  to  compete  with  the  favored  state 
banks.  By  1978  inflation  had  come  down  to  less  than  10  percent  per 
year,  but  four  years  of  double-digit  increases  had  seriously  under- 
mined the  competitiveness  of  Indonesia's  exports. 

The  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector  was  accompanied  by 
measures  to  contain  inflationary  pressures,  such  as  imposing  high 
rates  of  interest  on  domestic  bank  credit.  Bank  Indonesia  also  inter- 
vened directly  by  controlling  the  availability  of  SBIs.  On  two  occa- 
sions, in  late  1987  and  early  1991,  the  central  bank  required  state- 
owned  corporations  to  withdraw  large  sums  from  their  deposits, 
Rp800  billion  (about  US$486  million)  in  1987  and  Rp8  trillion 
(about  US$4.1  billion)  in  1991,  to  purchase  SBIs,  which  deprived 
banks  of  a  major  source  of  funds  to  be  used  for  speculative  purposes. 
As  a  result,  inflation  in  Indonesia  continued  at  an  average  of  about 
14  percent  per  year  throughout  the  1980s,  which  was  low  by  the 


186 


The  Economy 


standards  of  many  developing  countries  but  above  that  of  many  of 
Indonesia's  industrialized  trading  partners.  Rapid  growth  in  the  early 
and  mid-1990s  reintroduced  inflationary  pressures,  but  cautious 
monetary  policies  resulted  in  a  relatively  moderate  rate  of  inflation 
averaging  9  percent  per  year  during  the  1991-96  period. 

The  immediate  inflationary  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis 
severely  eroded  purchasing  power,  bringing  whole  segments  of  the 
economy  to  a  virtual  standstill  and  pushing  millions  of  people  from 
just  above  to  below  the  poverty  line  (see  Employment  and  Income, 
this  ch.).  Controlling  inflation  became  a  top  priority  during  the  subse- 
quent economic  recovery.  In  2002  the  IMF  assumed  that  9  to  1 1  per- 
cent per  year  would  be  a  manageable  rate  of  inflation.  In  budgetary 
planning  for  2001-3,  the  government  projected  a  lower  rate,  8  to  9 
percent,  which  was  generally  sustained  despite  a  spike  to  1 5  percent 
in  early  2002.  By  2004  restrictive  monetary  policies  had  reduced  the 
rate  of  inflation  to  5  percent  annually,  and  in  its  planning  for  2005  and 
2006  the  government  chose  less-than-ambitious  targets  in  the  range 
of  6  to  8  percent.  Actual  inflation  in  2007  amounted  to  6.6  percent, 
and,  for  2008,  the  central  bank  targeted  4  to  6  percent  inflation. 

Bank  Indonesia  also  managed  the  exchange  rate  between  the 
rupiah  and  foreign  currencies,  a  responsibility  that  sometimes  con- 
flicted with  its  tasks  of  regulating  the  volume  of  bank  credit  and  the 
size  of  the  base  money  supply.  After  floating  the  rupiah  from  1966  to 
1971,  Bank  Indonesia  pegged  the  exchange  rate  at  Rp415  per  US$1. 
To  maintain  this  exchange  rate,  the  central  bank  had  to  buy  or  sell  as 
much  foreign  currency  as  necessary  at  the  predetermined  rate.  Three 
major  devaluations  occurred  in  the  following  years.  Bank  Indonesia 
set  new  rates  of  exchange  at,  respectively,  Rp625  per  dollar  in  1978, 
Rp970  per  dollar  in  1983,  and  Rpl,641  per  dollar  in  1986.  The  main 
objective  was  to  address  the  eroding  competitiveness  of  non-oil 
exports  resulting  from  Indonesia's  rate  of  inflation  being  higher  than 
the  rate  in  the  home  countries  of  important  buyers  of  Indonesian 
manufactured  products.  The  exchange-rate  strategy  became  an 
important  instrument  supporting  the  industrialization  policy  to 
reduce  dependence  on  oil  and  natural  gas. 

From  the  late  1980s  onward,  the  rupiah  was  effectively,  if  not  offi- 
cially, pegged  to  the  U.S.  dollar  in  such  a  way  that  it  was  allowed  to 
depreciate  in  a  smooth  but  highly  predictable  manner  at  a  rate  slightly 
above  5  percent  per  year.  The  nominal  value  of  the  rupiah  fell  by  37 
percent  against  the  dollar,  from  Rp  1,840  per  dollar  in  1990  to  Rp2,900 
per  dollar  in  mid- 1997.  Then  came  the  financial  crisis,  and  with  it  the 
urgent  need  to  control  the  free  fall  of  the  rupiah  and  mitigate  the 
extreme  short-run  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate.  By  agreement 


187 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

with  the  IMF,  Indonesia  became  committed  to  a  floating  exchange 
rate  under  which  the  value  of  the  currency  would  be  determined 
exclusively  by  market  forces.  This  commitment  was  retained  even 
after  direct  involvement  by  the  IMF  in  Indonesian  economic  policy 
came  to  a  conclusion,  thus  precluding  pursuit  of  an  active  exchange- 
rate  policy  by  Bank  Indonesia.  Assumptions  underlying  the  central 
government  budget  during  the  period  of  economic  recovery  in  the  first 
years  of  the  twenty-first  century  stayed  within  a  narrow  range,  from 
Rp8,600  per  dollar  in  2004  to  Rp9,900  per  dollar  in  2006.  The  value 
of  the  currency  averaged  Rp8,875  per  dollar  during  the  period  2002- 
4,  stabilized  at  Rp9,250  per  dollar  in  August  2007,  but  increased  to 
Rp  12,000  during  the  emerging  world  economic  crisis  in  2008. 

Market  interventions  with  SBIs  served  to  secure  a  stable  increase 
in  the  base  money  supply  of  about  7  percent  per  year,  which  was, 
incidentally,  also  the  target  that  the  IMF  had  recommended  in  the 
wake  of  the  financial  crisis.  Continuous  monetary  expansion  was 
accompanied  by  an  increase  in  credits  made  available  by  commer- 
cial banks.  In  2000  total  outstanding  commercial  credit  reached 
Rp720  trillion  (US$86  billion),  140  percent  above  the  level  of  March 
1997,  and  by  2004  it  amounted  to  Rp965  trillion  (US$110  billion). 
The  annual  increase  during  the  intervening  period  had  been  8.5  per- 
cent, which  may  be  contrasted  with  the  26.0  percent  increase  in 
banking  credit  in  FY  1996  alone.  Stability  returned  to  monetary  and 
exchange-rate  developments  as  soon  as  the  recovery  from  the  crisis 
gained  momentum. 

Indonesia  in  the  Global  Economy 

The  Changing  Nature  of  Trade  and  Aid 

Indonesia  is  highly  integrated  into  the  global  economy,  and 
exports  are  vital  to  its  economic  development.  By  the  1980s,  exports 
accounted  for  about  25  percent  of  GDP,  and  this  proportion  has 
stayed  remarkably  stable  over  time.  In  2004  total  foreign  exports 
amounted  to  Rp625,295  trillion  (US$71.6  billion),  corresponding  to 
27  percent  of  GDP,  and  in  2007  the  total  value  of  exports  approached 
Rpl, 100,000  trillion  (US$114  billion),  or  about  31  percent  of  GDP. 
Expressed  in  current  market  prices,  export  revenues  rose  threefold 
between  1980  and  2004.  During  the  next  several  years,  2004-7, 
exports  increased  by  an  average  of  17  percent  per  year.  The  tradi- 
tional range  of  exports,  consisting  almost  exclusively  of  oil,  natural 
gas,  and  other  primary  products,  has  broadened  to  include  manufac- 
tured goods.  The  most  vital  distinction  in  the  structure  of  exports 
refers  to  the  division  between  oil  and  natural  gas  on  the  one  hand  and 


188 


The  Economy 


all  other  products  on  the  other.  The  share  of  oil  and  natural  gas 
reached  nearly  80  percent  around  1980  but  fell  to  about  50  percent  in 
the  late  1980s,  32  percent  in  the  early  1990s,  and  22  percent  by 
1997.  After  the  1990s,  scarcely  more  than  20  percent  of  Indonesia's 
export  revenues  originated  from  deliveries  of  oil  and  natural  gas. 

The  export  sector's  traditional  reliance  on  the  country's  rich  natu- 
ral resources  made  the  economy  vulnerable  to  the  vicissitudes  of 
changing  world  prices  for  these  products.  The  need  to  shift  to  manu- 
factured exports  became  especially  urgent  when  world  oil  prices  fell 
sharply  in  the  mid-1980s.  This  shift  having  been  successfully  accom- 
plished, Indonesia  now  faces  increasingly  stiff  competition  from 
other  low-cost  producers  of  manufactured  goods,  especially  China. 
Initially,  plywood  was  the  most  important  manufactured  export,  its 
production  having  been  facilitated  by  a  total  ban  on  log  exports  in  the 
early  1980s.  However,  by  the  late  1990s  plywood  accounted  for  only 
10  percent  of  manufacturing  exports,  and  textiles,  in  particular  gar- 
ments, and  electrical  appliances  were  both  of  greater  importance, 
whereas  paper  products,  footwear,  and  chemical  goods  each  equaled 
plywood  among  manufactured  exports.  In  2007  the  total  value  of 
manufactured  exports  amounted  to  US$76  billion,  with  three  catego- 
ries of  products  accounting  for  28  percent  of  this  total:  textiles  at  13 
percent  and  electrical  goods  and  wood  products  at  7  and  8  percent 
each.  Although  manufactured  exports  have  come  to  dominate  Indo- 
nesian deliveries  to  the  world  market,  the  emphasis  has  remained  on 
labor-intensive  production.  An  estimate  from  just  before  the  1997-98 
financial  crisis  suggested  that  only  15  percent  of  Indonesia's  manu- 
factured exports  originated  from  industries  characterized  by  an  inten- 
sive use  of  technology  and  know-how.  Access  to  local  raw  materials 
and  cheap  labor  have  remained  the  main  sources  of  competitiveness 
for  Indonesian  manufactured  exports  in  world  markets. 

Steady  growth  in  non-oil  exports  has  helped  Indonesia  to  finance 
imports,  in  particular  inputs  needed  for  manufacturing  production  for 
exports.  During  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  imports  increased  more 
rapidly  than  exports,  but  this  trend  reversed  radically  during  the 
financial  crisis  as  the  depreciated  Indonesian  currency  effectively 
reduced  the  volume  of  purchases  from  abroad.  As  a  result,  the  sur- 
plus on  the  commodity  balance  of  trade  improved  from  about  20  per- 
cent of  total  export  earnings  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  to  47 
percent  in  1999,  only  to  stabilize  at  a  slightly  lower  level  in  the  first 
years  of  the  twenty-first  century.  On  the  eve  of  the  crisis,  imports 
consisted  of  about  71  percent  raw  materials  and  intermediate  goods, 
22  percent  capital  goods,  and  only  7  percent  consumer  goods.  This 
pattern  has  remained  unchanged,  reflecting  an  increasing  dependence 


189 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

for  export  production  on  foreign  imports  as  well  as  far-reaching 
import  substitution. 

The  positive  trade  balance  notwithstanding,  Indonesia  has  often 
suffered  from  a  deficit  on  the  current  account  because  of  increasing 
service  costs  and  interest  payments  on  outstanding  foreign  debt.  The 
deficit  on  the  current  account  worsened  from  scarcely  more  than 
US$1  billion  in  1989  to  almost  US$8  billion  in  1996.  Driven  by  rap- 
idly declining  imports,  the  huge  improvement  in  the  balance  of  trade 
during  the  financial  crisis  turned  the  deficit  on  the  current  account 
into  a  surplus.  The  surplus  on  the  current  account  grew  to  US$5.9  bil- 
lion in  2000  and  stayed  at  that  level  until  2003,  when  outflows  began 
to  increase  as  a  result  of  economic  recovery.  One  consequence  of  the 
crisis  for  the  surplus  on  the  current  account  was  that  international 
reserves  were  not  depleted  but  actually  increased  between  1996  and 
2000.  A  key  factor  in  the  state  of  Indonesia's  capital  account  has  been 
the  inflows  and  outflows  of  foreign  direct  investment. 

Export  growth  has  also  contributed  to  Indonesia's  ability  to  borrow 
from  world  financial  markets  and  to  obtain  foreign  aid.  Public  debt 
grew  in  particular  during  the  1980s,  whereas  private  debt  expanded 
dramatically  during  the  1990s,  providing  a  major  cause  of  the  finan- 
cial crisis  that  struck  Indonesia  in  1997-98.  Increasing  foreign 
indebtedness  as  a  means  of  combating  the  crisis  and  staging  an  eco- 
nomic recovery  implied  a  heavy  burden  on  the  government  budget  in 
the  early  twenty-first  century.  Successive  repayments  reduced  the 
total  outstanding  foreign  debt  from  almost  US$150  billion  in  2001  to 
US$113  billion  by  2004.  The  reduction  applied  fully  to  private 
indebtedness,  whereas  the  public  foreign  debt  increased  from  US$69 
billion  in  2001  to  US$80  billion  in  2004.  These  trends  reversed  after 
2004,  as  private  debt  increased  by  US$35  billion  in  the  face  of  a 
decline  in  public  debt  to  US$69  billion.  As  a  result,  Indonesia's  total 
foreign  indebtedness  amounted  to  US$137  billion  in  December  2007. 

Multilateral  aid  to  Indonesia  has  traditionally  been  an  area  of 
international  interest,  particularly  on  the  part  of  the  Netherlands, 
Indonesia's  former  colonial  ruler.  Starting  in  1967,  the  bulk  of  Indo- 
nesia's multilateral  aid  was  coordinated  by  a  consortium  of  foreign 
governments  and  international  financial  organizations,  the  Inter- 
Governmental  Group  on  Indonesia  (IGGI — see  Glossary).  The  IGGI 
met  annually  under  Dutch  leadership,  although  aid  from  the  Nether- 
lands accounted  for  an  ever-smaller  proportion  of  the  total.  The 
Netherlands  suspended  aid  to  Indonesia  following  the  shootings  by 
the  Indonesian  army  of  between  50  and  270  demonstrators  in  Dili, 
Timor  Timur  Province,  in  November  1991;  in  turn,  in  March  1992 
the  Indonesian  government  said  it  would  henceforth  refuse  all  Dutch 


190 


The  Economy 


aid.  The  IGGI  was  replaced  by  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia 
(CGI),  formed  on  the  initiative  of  the  World  Bank  and  chaired  by 
Japan,  Indonesia's  single  largest  aid  donor.  The  CGI  was  instrumen- 
tal in  facilitating  international  debt  restructuring  during  the  Asian 
financial  crisis.  The  volume  of  annual  commitments  of  assistance 
declined  gradually  from  a  peak  of  US$8  billion  during  the  crisis  to  a 
stable  level  of  US$3  billion  during  the  period  2002-4.  An  additional 
US$5. 1  billion  for  tsunami  relief  reached  Indonesia  in  2005  (see  Vol- 
canos  and  Earthquakes,  ch.  2). 

Principal  Trade  Relationships 

Indonesia's  trading  partners  have  traditionally  included  numerous 
countries  throughout  the  world.  At  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century, 
most  imports  came  from  just  three  places:  the  European  Union  (EU; 
26  percent),  Japan  (18  percent),  and  the  United  States  (18  percent). 
Member  countries  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations 
(ASEAN — see  Glossary)  supplied  only  10  percent.  In  the  twenty- 
first  century,  China  has  also  emerged  as  a  major  supplier  of  imports 
to  Indonesia.  The  growth  in  Indonesia's  production  of  manufactured 
products  has  contributed  to  a  diversification  of  export  markets,  espe- 
cially in  Asia.  In  2006  more  than  50  percent  of  all  exports  went  to 
Asian  trading  partners,  in  particular  to  Japan,  the  ASEAN  states, 
China  and  India,  whereas  the  United  States  and  the  EU  between  them 
purchased  27  percent  of  all  Indonesian  exports.  Oil  and  liquefied  nat- 
ural gas  (LNG),  however,  continued  to  be  supplied  to  a  rather  limited 
number  of  customers.  In  the  late  1990s,  Japan  bought  one-third  of 
Indonesia's  oil  and  two-thirds  of  its  LNG;  South  Korea  and  Taiwan 
also  figured  prominently  among  customers  for  Indonesian  LNG.  Five 
leading  trading  partners,  China,  Japan,  Malaysia,  Singapore,  and  the 
United  States,  accounted  for  more  than  50  percent  of  all  non-oil  and 
natural  gas  exports  in  2004.  The  United  States  and  Japan  became  key 
markets  as  the  development  of  manufacturing  export  production  in 
Indonesia  gained  momentum,  while  Singapore  retained  its  traditional 
role  as  an  intermediary  in  trade  with  third  countries.  Rapid  increases 
in  non-oil,  non-gas  exports  to  China  and  ASEAN  neighbors  such  as 
Malaysia  signified  new  trends  in  Indonesian  trade. 

Diplomatic  relations  with  China  were  reestablished  in  1991,  and 
exports  to  that  country  doubled  over  the  next  six  years  (see  Relations 
with  East  Asia,  ch.  4).  Bilateral  trade  declined  during  the  1997-98  cri- 
sis but  recovered  by  2000.  Indonesian  imports  from  China  increased 
by  more  than  60  percent  in  the  year  2000  alone,  reflecting  a  tendency 
among  Indonesian  importers  to  replace  expensive  imports  from  Japan 
with  cheaper  goods  from  China.  Bilateral  trade  experienced  a  rapid 


191 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

expansion  starting  in  2002,  and  already  by  2005  the  value  of  Indone- 
sian exports  to  China  was  150  percent  above  the  1997  level.  The 
expansion  of  Indonesian  imports  from  China  was  even  more  spectac- 
ular. In  2005  their  level  was  almost  four  times  that  of  1997.  The  shift 
from  a  trading  relationship  based  on  Indonesian  exports  to  one  based 
on  Indonesian  imports  in  bilateral  trade  with  China  testified  to  the 
dynamic  nature  of  international  commerce  in  the  region. 

ASEAN  was  founded  in  1967  to  promote  regional  stability,  eco- 
nomic development,  and  cultural  exchange  in  Southeast  Asia.  Its  orig- 
inal members  were  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore, 
and  Thailand;  starting  in  the  mid-1980s,  Brunei,  Burma  (Myanmar), 
Cambodia,  Laos,  and  Vietnam  also  joined.  Not  until  the  late  1970s  did 
the  ASEAN  states  give  serious  attention  to  matters  of  economic  inte- 
gration, such  as  the  establishment  of  joint  industrial  projects.  In  Janu- 
ary 1993,  preparations  began  for  an  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area 
(AFTA).  Originally  scheduled  for  2008,  implementation  was  moved 
forward  to  2002,  and  by  2006  most  import  tariffs  in  intra- ASEAN 
trade  were  2  percent  or  less.  Intra- ASEAN  exports  doubled  between 

2002  and  2006,  rising  from  US$  9.9  billion  to  US$  18.5  billion.  Four 
priority  areas  were  designated  for  further  rapid  expansion:  electronics, 
agro-processing,  rubber-based  products,  and  transport  vehicles,  all  of 
which  were  important  branches  of  manufacturing  for  Indonesia.  In 

2003  Bank  Indonesia  predicted  that  full  implementation  of  AFTA 
would  increase  competition  and  reduce  prices  in  the  domestic  market 
while  offering  new  opportunities  for  Indonesian  exporters.  Confi- 
dence in  the  growth  potential  of  both  large  and  small  enterprises  was 
also  voiced  in  2006  by  then  ASEAN  secretary  general  Ong  Keng 
Yong.  The  association's  stated  ultimate  goal  is  to  establish  an  ASEAN 
Economic  Community  by  2015. 

Employment  and  Income 

The  world's  fourth  most  populous  nation,  Indonesia  had  an  esti- 
mated 240.3  million  inhabitants  in  2009,  60  percent  of  whom  lived 
in  Java,  21  percent  in  Sumatra,  and  another  12  percent  in  Kalimantan 
and  Sulawesi  taken  together.  The  increase  in  population  over  the  pre- 
ceding 18  years  alone  amounted  to  almost  50  million  people.  At 
least  60  percent  of  all  persons  1 5  years  of  age  and  older  were  gain- 
fully employed.  The  labor  force  grew  from  75  million  in  1988  to  86 
million  in  1993  and  106  million  in  2006,  or  1 17  million  when  includ- 
ing those  who  were  economically  active  but  not  at  work.  The  rapid 
growth  reflected  both  the  increase  in  the  working-age  population, 
estimated  at  2.7  percent  per  year,  and  an  increasing  rate  of  economic 
participation  by  women.  It  has  been  a  major  challenge  for  the  Indo-

The  Economy 


nesian  economy  to  offer  employment  to  such  large  numbers  of  peo- 
ple entering  the  labor  market  each  year. 

Structural  change  in  the  Indonesian  economy  has  had  fundamental 
repercussions  for  employment  patterns  and  especially  the  composi- 
tion of  national  income.  In  1985  agriculture  contributed  only  25  per- 
cent of  GDP  but  provided  employment  for  53  percent  of  the  labor 
force.  In  addition  to  the  agricultural  employment  in  the  1980s,  1 1  per- 
cent of  the  labor  force  worked  in  manufacturing,  1 8  percent  in  trad- 
ing, 14  percent  in  finance  and  other  services,  and  4  percent  in 
construction.  A  milestone  was  reached  around  1990  when  agricul- 
ture's share  of  employment  fell  below  50  percent,  and  Indonesia  was 
no  longer  a  predominantly  agrarian  economy.  Further  expansion  of 
employment  outside  agriculture,  particularly  in  services,  reduced  the 
agricultural  proportion  of  the  labor  force  to  43  percent  by  1997.  Mod- 
ernization of  employment  patterns  came  to  a  halt  in  the  wake  of  the 
1997-98  financial  crisis;  for  instance,  the  share  of  the  workforce  in 
agriculture  was  44  percent  in  2005,  up  a  point  from  1997.  There  has 
been  a  tendency  for  the  labor  force  in  the  primary  sector,  comprising 
agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries,  to  increase  somewhat  in  relative 
terms  at  the  expense  of  manufacturing  and  services.  The  interruption 
of  the  trend  toward  restructuring  of  the  economy  away  from  the  tradi- 
tional predominance  of  the  primary  sector  in  employment  patterns  is 
one  of  the  most  serious  consequences  of  the  financial  crisis. 

In  a  developing  country  such  as  Indonesia,  official  open  unemploy- 
ment is  a  statistic  with  much  less  meaning  than  in  an  industrial  economy. 
Registration  as  being  unemployed  carries  no  benefits,  and  those  laid  off 
from  jobs  in  the  formal  sector  are  likely  to  work  fewer  hours  or  resort  to 
some  kind  of  pursuit  in  the  informal  sector.  Open  unemployment  was 
registered  at  only  3  percent  of  the  labor  force  around  1990,  but  this  figure 
ignored  much  underemployment.  Official  unemployment  increased  only 
marginally  even  during  the  worst  year  of  the  financial  crisis,  from  4.7 
percent  in  1997  to  5.5  percent  in  1998.  Supplementary  data  offer  a  differ- 
ent impression.  During  the  first  crisis  year  alone,  the  number  of  workers 
declined  15  percent  in  medium-sized  and  large  manufacturing  enter- 
prises and  20  percent  in  small  manufacturing  firms  and  cottage  indus- 
tries. More  than  300,000  workers  in  the  textiles  and  garment  industry  had 
already  lost  their  jobs  by  March  1998.  The  International  Labour  Organi- 
zation (ILO)  estimated  conservatively  that  7  percent  of  the  Indonesian 
labor  force  would  be  out  of  work  by  the  end  of  1998.  The  informal  sector 
in  rural  areas  had  to  absorb  more  than  3  million  workers  who  had  been 
laid  off  in  the  cities. 

In  2001  the  Central  Statistical  Office  (BPS)  tried  to  obtain  a  better 
representation  of  actual  unemployment  by  applying  a  wider  definition 


193 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

that  included  discouraged  workers.  As  a  result,  the  official  unemploy- 
ment figures,  5.8  percent  in  2000  and  6.5  percent  in  2004,  were  adjusted 
upward  to  8.1  percent  and  10.1  percent,  respectively.  The  rate  of  unem- 
ployment stayed  at  a  stubbornly  high  level  after  the  initial  recovery 
from  the  financial  crisis,  and  in  late  2004  the  newly  installed  adminis- 
tration of  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  pledged  to  reduce  official  open 
unemployment  by  half  by  2009.  However,  in  2007  officially  registered 
unemployment  was  still  as  high  as  9.1  percent. 

The  introduction  of  minimum- wage  legislation  in  1992  appeared 
contradictory  to  the  prevailing  mode  of  deregulation  at  the  time.  The 
Indonesian  government  took  this  measure  partly  in  response  to  criti- 
cism from  the  ILO  and  the  American  Federation  of  Labor  about  poor 
working  conditions  in  Indonesian  manufacturing.  Implementation  of 
this  policy  led  to  considerable  regional  differences  in  nominal  daily 
wage  rates,  which  ranged  in  1995  from  Rp3,100  (about  US$1.38)  in 
Sulawesi  Selatan  Province  to  Rp4,600  (about  US$2.04)  in  Jawa  Barat 
Province.  Real  wage  rates,  after  correction  for  inflation,  increased  by 
more  than  200  percent  in  Jawa  Barat  and  Jawa  Tengah  provinces  but 
by  less  than  100  percent  in  the  capital,  Jakarta,  and  in  Sumatera  Utara 
Province.  Earnings  outside  the  industrial  sector  were  typically  lower, 
with  the  exception  of  services  such  as  finance  and  banking. 

The  financial  crisis,  with  its  concomitant  rapid  inflation,  brought  a 
sharp  dip  in  real  minimum  wages  in  1998  and  1999;  only  in  2001  was 
the  pre-crisis  level  of  the  real  minimum-wage  rate  restored.  Yet,  this 
was  the  outcome  of  political  and  administrative  change  rather  than  a 
sign  of  economic  recovery.  The  decentralization  reform  that  became 
effective  in  January  2001  vested  the  power  to  set  minimum- wage  rates 
with  provincial  authorities,  which  caused  an  immediate  increase  in  the 
minimum- wage  rate  in  many  provinces.  Jakarta  led  the  way  with  a 
wage  hike  of  38  percent,  followed  by  adjacent  districts  in  Jawa  Barat 
Province.  Other  centers  of  labor-intensive  manufacturing  industry  lim- 
ited increases  to  20  percent.  After  2001  real  minimum- wage  rates  also 
continued  to  rise,  but  the  pace  of  increase  remained  smooth  and  mod- 
erate. In  2004  the  highest  nominal  wages  were  paid  in  the  greater 
Jakarta  metropolitan  area — then  known  as  Jabotabek  (for  the  four 
adjacent  population  centers  of  Jakarta,  Bogor,  Tangerang,  and  Bekasi), 
now  known  as  Jabodetabek  to  include  Depok — where  rates  were  on 
average  72  percent  higher  than  in  the  city  of  Surabaya  in  Jawa  Timur 
Province,  or  144  percent  higher  than  in  the  Special  Region  of  Yogya- 
karta  in  central  Java.  Workers  in  non-oil  mining  were  likely  to  earn 
three  times  as  much  as  employees  in  highly  labor-intensive  lines  of 
manufacturing  production  such  as  textiles.

Effective  enforcement  of  minimum-wage  rates  was  difficult  from 
the  start.  Attempts  by  employers  to  circumvent  the  legislation  had 
already  become  a  frequent  cause  of  labor  unrest  in  the  mid-1990s. 
The  problem  of  enforcement  survived  the  collapse  of  the  Suharto 
regime.  Statistics  for  2000  show  that  only  43  percent  of  surveyed 
employees  actually  received  more  than  the  minimum  wage.  The  score 
was  especially  bad  for  female  workers,  75  percent  of  whom  received 
less  than  the  minimum  wage.  Rural  workers  were  also  disadvantaged, 


195 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

and  wages  in  manufacturing  were  found  to  be  seriously  lagging 
behind  those  in  the  services  sector. 

Labor  unrest  increased  significantly  in  the  1990s,  although  there  was 
only  one  officially  sanctioned  trade  organization,  the  All-Indonesian 
Workers'  Union  (SPSI),  which  was  converted  in  1995  into  the  All- 
Indonesian  Workers'  Union  Federation  (FSPSI).  Activism  was  fur- 
thered by  the  rise  of  two  rival  independent  unions.  One,  the  Indonesian 
Prosperous  Workers'  Union  (SB SI),  was  founded  in  1992  and  run  by 
Muchtar  Pakpahan,  who  was  exceptionally  outspoken  in  his  criticism 
of  the  government.  Confrontations  between  the  Suharto  administration 
and  the  SB  SI  culminated  in  a  rising  number  of  strikes  during  the  mid- 
1990s,  and  the  imprisonment  of  Pakpahan.  Frequent  violent  strikes 
accompanied  the  financial  crisis  and  other  events  leading  up  to  the 
change  of  government  during  1997-98.  Labor  unrest  subsided  some- 
what in  1999  but  flared  up  again  in  2000.  That  year  there  were  173 
major  strikes — compared  with  125  in  1999 — involving  more  than 
60,000  workers.  Demands  for  higher  wages  were  the  main  reason  for 
trade-union  action,  but  other  grievances,  such  as  dismissals,  meager 
food  provisions,  the  cost  of  transportation,  and  failure  to  pay  out 
accrued  social-security  benefits,  were  other  causes.  Most  strikes  were 
in  the  labor-intensive  branches  of  manufacturing.  Trade  unionism  grew 
in  the  more  liberal  political  climate  prevailing  immediately  after  the  fall 
of  the  Suharto  regime.  In  2001  some  36  trade  unions  were  operating  on 
a  national  level,  but  many  more  restricted  themselves  to  individual 
regions  or  even  districts.  Several  unions,  including  the  SBSI  and 
FSPSI,  maintained  close  links  with  political  parties,  which  had  also 
mushroomed  in  the  wake  of  reformism  after  1998.  Some  trade  unions 
expressed  a  strong  Muslim  identity.  These  developments  signified  a 
belated  ideological  awakening  within  organized  labor  in  Indonesia. 

Observers  saw  an  impressive  increase  in  per-capita  income  in 
Indonesia  up  to  1997.  The  nominal  average  income  increased  120 
percent  between  1991  and  1996.  But  the  financial  crisis  had  a  severe 
impact  on  incomes,  reducing  the  real  per-capita  level  13  percent 
between  1997  and  1999  alone,  and  it  was  well  into  the  first  years  of 
the  twenty-first  century  before  Indonesians'  per-capita  GDP  returned 
to  the  1997  level.  However,  doubts  have  frequently  been  voiced  about 
the  unequal  distribution  of  income,  especially  in  light  of  the  conspic- 
uous consumption  by  wealthy  Chinese  Indonesians  and  members  of 
the  Suharto  family.  Studies  have  shown  the  Gini  coefficient,  which 
measures  the  degree  of  inequality  in  income  distribution,  to  have 
remained  stubbornly  constant  over  time.  The  coefficient  fell  slightly 
during  the  first  two  decades  of  the  Suharto  era,  from  0.35  in  the  mid- 
1960s  to  0.32  in  the  late  1980s,  but  rose  to  0.34  in  the  mid-1990s  and 


196 


The  Economy 


0.37  during  the  financial  crisis.  Indonesia's  long-run  stability  on  the 
Gini  index  (see  Glossary)  may  be  interpreted  both  as  an  achievement 
by  government  policies,  in  the  sense  that  inequality  did  not  get  worse, 
and  as  a  failure,  in  the  sense  that  rapid  growth  should  have  resulted  in 
relatively  more  gains  accruing  to  low-income  groups  rather  than  sus- 
taining existing  discrepancies  in  income  levels. 

Reduction  of  poverty  was  invariably  listed  as  one  of  the  major 
achievements  of  the  Suharto  government.  The  BPS  defined  an  official 
poverty  line  on  the  basis  of  the  expenditure  needed  to  maintain  a  daily 
intake  of  2,100  calories  and  to  meet  other  basic  needs.  The  proportion 
of  Indonesians  living  below  that  line  declined  from  40  percent  in  1976 
to  17  percent  in  1987  and  to  1 1  percent  by  1996.  However,  it  must  be 
noted  that  the  official  criteria  were  set  at  far  lower  levels  than  in  neigh- 
boring countries  in  Southeast  Asia,  and  that  considerable  regional  dif- 
ferences were  concealed  by  the  nationwide  averages.  The  incidence  of 
poverty  was  higher  in  rural  areas  than  in  cities,  and  the  1 1  percent  reg- 
istered as  poor  in  1996  corresponded  to  more  than  22  million  people. 
The  full  onslaught  of  the  economic  crisis  in  1998  occasioned  a  number 
of  projections  about  the  resulting  increase  in  poverty.  In  August  and 
September  1998,  a  team  from  the  ILO  and  the  United  Nations  Devel- 
opment Programme  (UNDP)  predicted  that  a  staggering  48  percent  of 
the  Indonesian  population,  94  million  people,  would  be  counted  as 
poor  by  the  end  of  the  year,  and  that  this  number  was  likely  to  continue 
to  increase  in  1999.  A  few  months  later,  in  December  1998,  revised 
estimates  by  BPS  produced  a  figure  of  about  20  percent,  still  high  in 
that  it  corresponded  to  40  million  people,  but  nonetheless  closer  to 
reality  than  the  alarming  ILO-UNDP  forecast. 

The  recovery  of  the  Indonesian  economy  in  the  early  years  of  the 
twenty-first  century  was  slow  and  at  best  partial.  As  a  result,  the 
incidence  of  poverty  declined  slowly,  from  18.4  percent  in  2001  to 
16.7  percent  in  2004.  These  figures  again  conceal  much  differentia- 
tion by  region.  Rural  areas  were  especially  severely  struck  by  pov- 
erty. There  the  incidence  by  official  measure  averaged  20  percent  in 
2004,  against  12  percent  for  cities.  In  2006  the  government  and 
observers  were  alarmed  by  an  unexpected  increase  in  the  incidence 
of  poverty  in  the  face  of  resumed  economic  growth.  Pockets  of  pov- 
erty existed  in  a  number  of  regions  where  the  economic  recovery 
failed  to  generate  jobs.  The  poverty  rate  climbed  to  17.8  percent  but 
again  reduced,  touching  16.6  per  cent  by  2007. 

Agriculture 

Indonesia  has  followed  a  well-recognized  trend  among  developing 
nations,  in  which  agriculture's  share  of  GDP  has  declined  over  time, 


197 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

even  though  the  sector  still  provides  employment  for  a  large  propor- 
tion of  the  labor  force.  The  agricultural  sector  in  Indonesia  has 
remained  vital  for  several  reasons.  A  significant  segment  of  the  popu- 
lation lives  and  works  in  rural  areas,  and  rice,  the  chief  food  crop,  is  the 
staple  nutrient  for  most  households,  urban  and  rural  alike.  Adequate 
supplies  of  affordable  rice  are  deemed  essential  to  preventing  political 
instability. 

The  share  of  agriculture  in  GDP  oscillated  around  25  percent 
throughout  the  1970s  and  early  1980s  but  then  fell  sharply,  reaching 
16  percent  by  1995.  This  trend  was  temporarily  reversed  with  the 
financial  crisis,  with  agriculture's  contribution  reaching  almost  20 
percent  of  GDP  in  1999.  Economic  recovery  reduced  the  share  of 
agriculture  again;  the  average  remained  stable  around  16  percent 
during  the  first  years  of  the  twenty-first  century  and  by  U.S.  govern- 
ment estimates  was  about  14.4  percent  in  2008 — as  compared  with 
the  Central  Statistical  Office  figure  for  2007,  of  13.8  percent.  Mean- 
while, the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  total  labor  force  dropped,  too, 
from  more  than  50  percent  to  a  little  above  40  percent.  Within  agri- 
culture, food  crops  have  always  accounted  for  the  predominant  share 
of  output,  leaving  considerably  smaller  proportions  to  tree-crop  cul- 
tivation, fisheries,  and  forestry. 

Food  Crops 

A  total  land  area  of  about  42  million  hectares  was  being  cultivated 
for  agricultural  purposes  in  Indonesia  around  the  turn  of  the  twenty- 
first  century.  Slightly  more  than  50  percent  was  dedicated  to  food- 
crop  cultivation,  both  intensive  sawah  (irrigated  or  wetland)  cultiva- 
tion in  Java  (8.5  million  hectares)  and  ladang  (not  irrigated)  cultiva- 
tion on  other  islands  (16.0  million  hectares;  see  fig.  8).  Estates  (large 
state-owned  or  private  units  of  production  with  a  high  degree  of  spe- 
cialization of  tasks)  accounted  for  25  percent  of  the  land  in  use. 
Since  around  1960,  expansion  of  output  in  food-crop  cultivation  has 
been  attained  through  intensified  land  use  and  application  of  high- 
yield  seed  varieties.  By  2000  total  rice  output  exceeded  50  million 
tons  per  year,  largely  realized  in  sawah  cultivation.  Ladang  cultiva- 
tion was  responsible  for  most  of  the  non-rice  food-crop  output,  in 
particular  the  production  of  cassava  and  corn,  which  together 
accounted  for  an  annual  yield  of  more  than  25  million  tons  by  2000. 

In  the  1980s,  rice  cultivation  covered  a  total  of  around  10  million 
hectares,  primarily  on  sawah  land.  About  60  percent  was  irrigated, 
which  was  crucial  to  the  productivity  of  land  when  planted  with 
high-yield  seed  varieties.  Output  grew  at  a  spectacular  rate  of  7  per- 
cent annually  from  1977  to  1982,  and  by  1985,  Indonesia,  once  the 


198 


The  Economy 


world's  single  largest  importer  of  rice,  was  self-sufficient  in  its  most 
important  foodstuff.  Annual  production  grew  from  about  25  million 
tons  in  the  late  1970s  to  some  50  million  tons  in  the  mid-1990s,  and 
it  then  continued  at  about  that  level  thereafter.  The  government  was 
intensely  involved,  both  in  stabilizing  prices  for  urban  consumers 
and  expanding  domestic  output  to  achieve  national  self-sufficiency 
in  rice  production.  Various  government  policies  included  the  dissem- 
ination of  high-yield  seed  varieties  through  the  government- spon- 
sored Mass  Guidance  System  (Bimas)  in  agriculture,  which  also 
subsidized  the  use  of  fertilizer  and  pesticides  and  provided  rural 
credit.  Moreover,  government  intervention  included  control  of  the 
domestic  rice  price  through  the  National  Logistical  Supply  Organi- 
zation (Bulog).  Government  investment  in  irrigation  also  made  a  sig- 
nificant contribution.  Between  1970  and  1990,  about  2.5  million 
hectares  of  existing  irrigated  land  were  rehabilitated,  and  irrigation 
was  extended  to  another  1.2  million  hectares. 

Expansion  of  food-crop  cultivation  slowed  in  the  late  1980s  and 
early  1990s  as  a  result  of  ecological  constraints  on  the  intensification 
of  cropping  ratios  and  lower  government  investment  in  irrigation. 

Also,  markets  for  agricultural  commodities  were  depressed.  Poor 
harvests  in  the  mid-1990s  necessitated  a  temporary  return  to  rice 
imports,  and  the  situation  during  the  crisis  was  aggravated  by 
repeated  droughts  during  1997-98  caused  by  El  Nino.  By  the  early 
years  of  the  twenty-first  century,  it  was  apparent  that  the  Green  Rev- 
olution, started  in  the  late  1960s,  had  run  its  course  in  Indonesia,  but 
also  that  it  had  had  a  lasting  impact  on  productivity  in  food-crop 
agriculture. 

Although  rice  is  by  far  the  most  important  food  crop,  cassava  and 
corn  have  remained  major  sources  of  calories  for  large  groups  of  Indo- 
nesians. Corn  cultivation  is  concentrated  in  Java  and  Madura,  usually 
on  rain-fed  land  (tegalan),  and  much  of  the  output  is  generally  con- 
sumed as  a  staple  food.  Both  corn  and  cassava  have  increased  in  impor- 
tance as  major  supplements  to  rice.  Between  2000  and  2005,  production 
of  these  two  crops  increased  by  15  and  20  percent,  respectively. 

Export  Crops 

Indonesia  has  a  strong  tradition  of  export  crops  cultivated  by 
estates  and  smallholders.  Java  was  once  the  world's  third-largest 
producer  of  sugarcane,  and  rubber  from  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan 
provided  important  non-oil  export  revenues  during  the  1950s  and 
1960s.  Sugar  no  longer  is  an  export  crop;  in  fact,  Indonesia  now 
imports  sugar.  Rubber  lost  its  strong  position  in  the  world  market  to 
synthetic  rubber,  and  palm  oil  overtook  agricultural  exports.  By  the 


199 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 


200 


The  Economy 


beginning  of  the  twenty-first  century,  rubber  and  palm  oil  accounted 
for  more  than  5  million  hectares  of  arable  land,  with  production  by 
smallholders  as  well  as  by  government-owned  estates  appropriated 
in  the  nationalization  of  Dutch  properties  in  the  late  1950s.  Rubber  is 
cultivated  on  3  million  hectares,  of  which  about  80  percent  is  land 
owned  by  smallholders  with  holdings  of  two  hectares  or  less.  Small- 
holder cultivation  is  concentrated  in  Sumatra. 

Palm-oil  estates,  primarily  in  Kalimantan  and  Sumatra,  expanded 
rapidly,  covering  2.2  million  hectares  by  the  mid-1990s.  The  estates 
represented  major  investments  by  leading  domestic  conglomerates 
and  also  increasing  investment  by  estate  companies  based  in  Malay- 
sia. In  2005  Indonesia  was  the  world's  second-largest  producer  of 
palm  oil,  behind  Malaysia,  accounting  for  more  than  one-third  of 
world  output.  Palm-oil  production  in  Indonesia  climbed  from  6.5 
million  tons  in  2000  to  10.3  million  tons  in  2004,  an  impressive  58 
percent  increase.  Estates  provided  the  largest  part  of  production,  but 
the  contribution  of  smallholders  increased  at  a  faster  rate,  exceeding 
one-third  by  2004.  In  2006  total  output  amounted  to  16  million  tons. 

Government  efforts  to  transfer  new  technologies  and  increase  pro- 
ductivity in  export-crop  cultivation  were  less  successful  than  they 
were  with  food  crops.  The  Nucleus  People's  Estate  (PIR)  program, 
which  provided  small  plots  of  high-yield  tree  crops  to  participating 
farmers  in  predetermined  locations,  was  the  main  government  under- 
taking. One  anticipated  advantage  was  the  sharing  of  benefits  from 
centralized  technological  and  managerial  assistance.  However,  only  a 
few  cultivators  participated,  and  little  success  was  achieved,  especially 
in  rubber  cultivation  by  smallholders.  The  centralization  of  facilities, 
which  in  turn  remained  seriously  understaffed,  allegedly  stifled  indi- 
vidual initiative. 

Other  export  crops,  notably  cocoa,  coconuts,  coffee,  and  tea,  cover 
far  smaller  planted  areas  and  contribute  only  marginally  to  the  aggre- 
gate earnings  of  the  overall  Indonesian  economy.  Coconuts  are  culti- 
vated almost  exclusively  by  smallholders,  with  production  centered  in 
Sulawesi.  High  prices  on  the  world  market  secured  rising  incomes  for 
some  local  producers  even  in  the  midst  of  the  1997-98  financial  cri- 
sis. The  main  source  of  Indonesian  coffee  beans  has  traditionally  been 
the  southern  Sumatran  province  of  Lampung,  where  smallholders 
strongly  dominate  production.  The  predominance  of  smallholders  has 
increased  since  the  late  1990s;  in  the  early  twenty-first  century,  they 
accounted  for  at  least  95  percent  of  output.  A  temporary  decline  in 
smallholder  production  in  2001  was  followed  by  an  impressive  recov- 
ery during  2002.  Annual  coffee  production  by  smallholders  has  since 
remained  rather  stable,  averaging  about  660,000  tons.  Nevertheless,

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesian  output  has  not  increased  as  fast  as  that  of  chief  rivals  in 
the  world  market.  By  2005  Indonesia  not  only  ranked  behind  Brazil, 
Colombia,  and  Mexico  but  also  had  been  overtaken  by  Vietnam. 

Livestock 

Smallholders  own  nearly  all  the  livestock  in  Indonesia;  these  ani- 
mals are  sources  of  draft  power,  manure,  meat  for  home  consumption, 
and,  if  sold,  revenue.  The  livestock  population  in  Indonesia  in  the  first 
years  of  the  twenty-first  century  included  35  million  ducks,  21  million 
goats  and  sheep,  11  million  cows,  7  million  pigs,  2.5  million  buffalo, 
and  500,000  horses.  Numbering  in  the  hundreds  of  millions,  chickens 
were  the  fastest-growing  type  of  commercial  livestock,  notwithstand- 
ing the  spread  of  avian  influenza  in  Indonesia  since  2004.  Govern- 
ment-sponsored programs  to  increase  productivity  through  extension 
services  to  livestock  farmers  and  the  expansion  of  ranching  began 
operation  in  the  Outer  Islands  (see  Glossary)  in  the  early  1990s. 

Fishing  and  Forestry 

Fishing 

Fish  has  traditionally  been  a  main  source  of  animal  protein  in  the 
average  Indonesian  diet,  being  generally  far  more  available  than  meat. 
The  fishing  industry  engages  more  than  2  million  households  working 
in  Indonesia's  large  archipelagic  sea  area,  about  50  percent  of  them  in 
Java  and  25  percent  in  Sumatra  (see  Geographic  Regions,  ch.  2).  The 
industry  is  divided  into  two  widely  different  branches,  marine  and 
inland,  of  which  the  latter  includes  harvesting  from  open  water  as  well 
as  ponds  and  aquatic  cages.  Productivity  is  far  greater  in  marine  fisher- 
ies, which  employ  only  25  percent  of  the  producer  households  but  oper- 
ate 75  percent  of  all  fishing  boats  and  account  for  almost  80  percent  of 
total  output.  Total  annual  production  of  fish  in  Indonesian  waters  oscil- 
lated between  2  million  and  3  million  tons  during  the  1980s,  reached 
4.5  million  tons  in  1996,  and  continued  to  increase,  albeit  slowly,  dur- 
ing the  years  of  crisis.  The  annual  total  surpassed  5.6  million  tons  by 
2003.  Foreign-owned  fishing  enterprises,  which  must  be  licensed,  oper- 
ate on  a  much  smaller  scale  than  the  domestic  industry.  Fish  exports 
consist  primarily  of  shrimp  and  tuna  for  the  Japanese  market. 

Enormous  changes  have  taken  place  in  Indonesian  fisheries  since 
around  1980,  when  the  physical  possibility  of  extending  catch  areas 
began  to  be  exhausted.  The  government  designated  offshore  waters 
as  exclusive  economic  zones  closed  to  fishing,  and  it  banned  trawl- 
ing in  the  waters  surrounding  Java  and  Bali.  The  frontier  of  expan- 
sion was  thus  literally  closing,  and  output  could  increase  only  by

intensification  and  overfishing.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the  trawling  ban 
had  ceased  to  be  effective,  having  resulted  in  numerous  incidents  in 
which  small-scale  Indonesian  fishers  took  matters  into  their  own 
hands,  attacking  intruding  Thai  and  Taiwanese  trawlers.  Mangrove 
forests  all  along  the  eastern  coastline  of  Sumatra  have  been  trans- 
formed into  shrimp  ponds;  large  fish-catching  stakes  tended  by  teen- 
age boys  have  been  put  into  operation  in  Sumatran  estuaries;  and 
coral  reefs  off  Papua  have  been  severely  damaged  by  the  use  of  cya- 
nide poisoning  and  fish  blasting  as  harvesting  practices.  With  the 
biodiversity  of  Indonesian  waters  seriously  threatened,  the  govern- 
ment doubled  its  efforts  between  1999  and  2006  to  reduce  foreign 
fishing  in  order  to  at  least  reserve  the  scarce  resources  for  the  large 
domestic  industry. 

Forestry 

Forests  cover  110  million  hectares,  or  57  percent,  of  Indonesia's 
land  area;  two-thirds  of  the  forested  area  is  tropical  rain  forest  in 
Kalimantan  and  Papua.  Estimates  of  the  rate  of  depletion  reached  1 
million  hectares  per  year  during  the  mid-1980s,  while  targets  for 
reforestation  and  afforestation  were  set  at  95,000  and  250,000  hect- 
ares, respectively.  The  government  revised  these  targets  significantly 
downward  in  the  late  1980s  but  increased  them  again  during  the 
1990s,  reaching  a  combined  level  of  nearly  200,000  hectares  by  the 
late  1990s.  Official  logging  output  fell  by  two-thirds  during  the 
period  1998-2002,  but  targets  for  rehabilitation  of  forests  were 
reduced  even  further,  being  restored  to  250,000  hectares  in  2003, 
339,000  hectares  in  2004,  and  as  little  as  27,000  hectares  by  2005.  In 
1999  estimates  put  the  extent  of  endangered  forest  land  at  23.2  mil- 
lion hectares,  of  which  only  1.2  million  hectares,  or  about  5  percent, 
had  been  rehabilitated  four  years  later.  Forest  Watch  Indonesia,  the 
Indonesian  Forum  for  Environment,  and  the  Department  of  Forestry 
estimated  that  the  rate  of  deforestation  rose  to  a  staggering  4  million 
hectares  per  year  in  2003.  Replenishment  of  forest  resources  in  Indo- 
nesia clearly  was  lagging  far  behind  both  ecological  and  commercial 
needs  and  official  targets. 

Uncontrolled  expansion  of  logging  operations,  both  legal  and  ille- 
gal, has  magnified  the  ecological  issues  in  Indonesian  forestry.  The 
1970s  witnessed  a  boom  in  logging  concessions,  both  large-scale 
and  small-scale,  whereas  a  ban  on  log  exports  put  in  place  by  the 
government  in  1983  fostered  the  emergence  of  timber  conglomer- 
ates. The  expansion  was  fueled  by  liberal  regulation  of  concessions, 
extremely  low  taxation,  lax  enforcement  of  reforestation  obligations, 
and  widespread  corruption.  During  the  1980s  alone,  large  business 
groups  acquired  concessions  covering  millions  of  hectares,  and  the 


204 


The  Economy 


production  capacity  of  Indonesia's  100  or  so  plywood  plants  rose 
eightfold.  Together  with  Malaysia,  Indonesia  then  supplied  more 
than  90  percent  of  the  world's  tropical  plywood  exports.  Govern- 
ment promotion  of  the  domestic  timber-processing  industry  was 
seen  as  the  most  immediate  threat  to  Indonesia's  forests,  but  in  the 
long  run,  settlement  by  migrants  under  government-sponsored  trans- 
migration programs  may  have  had  an  even  greater  impact. 

In  the  1990s,  the  gap  between  total  demand  from  the  plywood 
industry  and  officially  authorized  logging  output  widened,  giving  a 
new  impetus  to  illegal  logging.  In  2001  the  total  timber  harvest  in 
Indonesia  amounted  to  60  million  cubic  meters,  50  million  of  which 
may  have  been  obtained  illegally.  Possibly  10  million  cubic  meters 
was  smuggled  abroad,  mostly  to  Malaysia.  The  Indonesian  press  and 
politicians  generally  have  put  the  blame  for  illegal  logging  and  tim- 
ber smuggling  on  small-scale  loggers  and  Malaysian  and  ethnic  Chi- 
nese traders.  In  the  early  twenty-first  century,  they  were  also  held 
responsible  for  the  haze  of  smoke  that  regularly  emanated  from  for- 
ests burning  in  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan,  causing  both  health  hazards 
and  irritation  in  neighboring  countries.  Yet  such  viewpoints  easily 
overlook  the  far-reaching  involvement  of  Indonesian  conglomerates 
in  large-scale  logging  and  plywood  production  and  also  divert  atten- 
tion from  a  long  history  of  forest  mismanagement  dating  back  to  the 
boom  of  the  1970s.  This  history  entered  a  new  phase  with  the  decen- 
tralization of  responsibility  for  forest  policies  in  2001.  The  delega- 
tion of  authority  had  the  potential  to  enhance  local  involvement  in 
the  terms  of  implementation,  but  it  could  equally  well  prove  condu- 
cive to  further  corruption  at  the  local  level. 

Industry 

Indonesia  was  a  late  starter  in  industrialization,  lagging  behind 
regional  neighbors  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand  by  at  least  a  decade. 
This  delay  may  be  attributed  to  the  generous  revenues  from  exploiting 
natural  resources  that  effectively  postponed  a  sense  of  urgency  regard- 
ing rapid  industrialization.  The  first  phase  of  import  substitution  relied 
on  labor-intensive  production  with  a  low  level  of  technological 
sophistication  and  took  place  in  the  1970s,  but  its  impact  on  the  econ- 
omy was  limited.  By  the  early  1980s,  manufacturing  not  related  to  oil 
and  gas  still  accounted  for  only  1 1  percent  of  GDP,  and  production 
catered  almost  exclusively  to  the  domestic  market.  In  the  1980s,  a  sec- 
ond phase  of  import  substitution  shifted  the  focus  to  selected  key 
upstream  industries  with  a  relatively  high  level  of  technological 
sophistication,  including  heavy  industries  such  as  petroleum  refining, 
steel,  and  cement,  in  which  state-owned  enterprises  often  dominated. 


205 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  next  shift  in  industrial  policy  favored  private  investment  and  an 
export  orientation.  Between  1987  and  1997,  a  rapid  industrialization 
took  place  that  caused  a  surge  in  manufacturing  exports  while  raising 
the  share  of  non-oil  and  gas  manufacturing  to  25  percent  of  GDP,  a 
level  sustained  into  the  twenty- first  century. 

A  detailed  study  by  Australian  economist  Hal  Hill  of  the  industrial 
structure  in  Indonesia  in  the  1980s  underscored  the  continuing  pre- 
dominance of  oil  and  natural  gas  processing  and  showed  the  second 
major  industrial  activity  to  be  the  production  of  kretek  cigarettes,  a 
popular  Indonesian  product'made  from  tobacco  blended  with  cloves. 
Most  of  the  13,000  firms  Hill  surveyed  were  privately  owned,  and 
generally  much  smaller  than  the  joint  ventures  with  either  the  govern- 
ment or  foreign  investors,  which  employed,  on  average,  six  times  as 
many  people.  Government  enterprises  controlled  all  processing  of  oil 
and  natural  gas  and  were  important  in  other  heavy  industries,  such  as 
basic  metals,  cement,  paper  products,  fertilizer,  and  transportation 
equipment.  The  growing  industries  manufacturing  for  export  offered 
far  more  employment  opportunities  than  the  capital-intensive  heavy 
industries  dominated  by  government  and  joint  ventures  with  foreign 
capital. 

As  the  twenty- first  century  began,  the  three  leading  industries  out- 
side the  oil  and  gas  sector  contributed  1 8  percent  of  GDP.  They  were, 
in  descending  order  of  size,  food  (including  beverages  and  tobacco), 
transportation  equipment  (including  electrical  appliances),  and  chem- 
ical products  (including  fertilizer  and  rubber  goods).  By  2005  there 
were  20,700  individual  large  and  medium-size  manufacturing  enter- 
prises employing  a  total  work  force  of  4.3  million  people. 

Industrial  development  has  been  unevenly  distributed  across  the 
archipelago  (see  fig.  9).  Significant  oil  and  LNG  production  occurs 
mainly  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh  and  in  the  provinces  of  Suma- 
tera  Selatan,  Riau,  Jawa  Tengah,  Kalimantan  Timur,  and  Papua  Barat. 
In  western  Java,  manufacturing  outside  the  oil  and  gas  sector  centers 
on  Jabodetabek,  and  in  and  around  Surabaya,  Indonesia's  second-larg- 
est city,  in  Jawa  Timur  Province.  Regional  forms  of  specialization  in 
industrial  production  include  batik  printing  and  furniture  making  in 
the  Special  Region  of  Yogyakarta  and  in  Jepara,  as  well  as  kretek  ciga- 
rette manufacturing  in  Kudus,  the  latter  two  in  Jawa  Tengah  Province. 

Foreign  Inputs 

Foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  has  particularly  targeted  the 
industrial  sector  since  the  beginning  of  Suharto's  New  Order  in 
1966.  There  have  been  several  marked  shifts  in  the  climate  for  FDI 
over  time.  The  launch  of  new  FDI  legislation  by  the  Suharto  govern- 


206 


The  Economy 


ment  in  1967  initiated  a  liberal  period  of  seven  years,  after  which 
came  20  years  of  restrictive  policies  prompted  by  nationalist  riots 
during  the  visit  of  Japan's  prime  minister  to  Jakarta  in  January  1974. 
Regulations  in  effect  from  1974  to  1994  precluded  majority  equity 
ownership  in  a  firm  by  a  foreign  investor  in  the  long  run  and  urged 
gradual  divestment  of  such  holdings.  Although  these  regulations 
produced  a  slowdown  in  investment,  the  new  opportunities  for 
export-oriented  manufacturing  that  opened  up  in  the  late  1980s 
proved  highly  attractive  to  foreign  investors.  A  deregulation  package 
announced  in  June  1994  radically  liberalized  foreign  investment. 
Foreign  majority  control  of  equity  again  became  legal,  and  divest- 
ment rules  relaxed.  An  immediate  surge  in  FDI  followed  that  even 
persisted  far  into  the  1997-98  financial  crisis. 

Total  realized  FDI  from  1991  to  2005  exceeded  US$75  billion, 
US$31  billion  of  which  dated  to  the  five  years  from  1996  to  2000, 
which  included  the  worst  of  the  financial  crisis  years.  This  total  can 
be  compared  to  the  aggregate  for  realized  domestic  investment  dur- 
ing the  1991-2005  period,  which  was  closer  to  US$215  billion.  The 
United  States  remained  the  chief  investor  in  the  oil  and  natural  gas 
sector  but  played  only  a  marginal  role  in  other  branches  of  industry 
(see  Other  Minerals,  this  ch.).  Japan  traditionally  was  the  first-rank- 
ing foreign  investor  outside  the  oil  and  natural  gas  industry,  but 
investment  from  the  newly  industrializing  economies  of  Hong  Kong, 
Singapore,  South  Korea,  and  Taiwan  became  equally  important  dur- 
ing the  rapid  enlargement  of  incoming  FDI  in  the  1990s.  Investors 
from  the  EU  made  only  a  belated  entry,  or  in  some  cases  reentry,  into 
the  Indonesian  capital  market  on  the  eve  of  the  1997-98  crisis.  It 
took  some  time  before  FDI  inflows  were  restored  after  the  1997-98 
crisis.  Total  approved  FDI  rose  from  US$14  billion  in  2003  to 
US$40  billion  by  2007. 

Foreign  investment  has  often  been  crucial  to  the  development  of 
capital-intensive  heavy  industries.  A  prime  example  is  the  Asahan 
Hydroelectric  and  Aluminum  Project,  a  government  joint  venture  with 
a  consortium  of  Japanese  companies.  Investment  in  an  aluminum 
smelter  and  two  hydroelectric  power  stations,  located  in  Sumatera 
Utara  Province,  was  worth  a  total  of  US$2.2  billion,  a  welcome  change 
from  the  relative  stagnation  that  characterized  Japanese  investment  in 
Indonesia  from  the  mid-1970s  to  the  mid-1990s.  In  another  type  of 
project,  the  development  of  special  economic  zones  on  the  Riau  Archi- 
pelago islands  of  Batam,  Bintan,  and  Karimun  was  entrusted  to  a  con- 
sortium consisting  of  a  state-owned  Singapore  company  and  two 
private  Indonesian  firms,  in  an  agreement  signed  June  28,  2006.  About 
80  percent  of  Indonesia's  oil-equipment  industry  is  located  on  Batam

Island,  and  the  project  will  likely  lead  to  further  development  of  these 
facilities  as  well  as  others  involving  electronics,  chemicals,  precision 
equipment,  garments,  and  other  manufactures. 

In  many  industries,  foreign  firms  have  supplied  technical  assis- 
tance and  arranged  for  domestic  production  under  licensing  agree- 
ments without  direct  equity  participation  in  the  domestic  firm.  For 
example,  domestic  Indonesian  plants  have  produced  automobiles  for 
about  20  international  car  makers,  foremost  among  them  Toyota, 
some  of  whose  vehicles  are  built  in  Indonesia  by  Astra  International, 
the  country's  largest  auto  manufacturer.  Other  Japanese  companies, 
as  well  as  South  Korean,  European,  and  American  firms,  assemble 
their  vehicles  in  Indonesia.  The  Indonesian  automotive  industry  has 
grown  amid  heavily  protected  markets. 

Foreign  inputs  of  a  different  nature  have  been  applied  in  high-tech- 
nology enterprises,  particularly  ones  headed  by  B.  J.  Habibie,  first  as 
minister  of  research  and  technology  and  later  as  president.  IPTN, 
established  in  1976,  assembled  helicopters  and  small  fixed- wing  air- 
craft under  licenses  from  French,  German,  and  Spanish  firms  aided 
by  imported  personnel  and  know-how.  Many  people  considered 
IPTN  a  premature  leap  into  advanced  technology.  Extra-budgetary 
support  and  credit  privileges  stopped  at  the  request  of  the  IMF  in  Jan- 
uary 1998,  and  operations  at  IPTN  all  but  ceased  subsequently. 

Small-Scale  Industry 

The  modern  sector  of  large  and  medium-sized  firms  is  the  main 
focus  of  government  policy,  but  small-scale  factories  employing 
fewer  than  20  workers  and  cottage  industries  with  up  to  five  workers 
are  far  more  numerous  and  crucial  in  terms  of  providing  employ- 
ment. Small-scale  establishments  engage  in  a  wide  range  of  activi- 
ties from  traditional  bamboo  weaving  to  metal  and  leather  working. 
Many  of  these  industries  offer  part-time  employment  to  rural  work- 
ers during  off-peak  seasons.  In  1986  small-scale  industries  employed 
3.9  million  workers,  corresponding  to  67  percent  of  total  industrial 
employment,  twice  as  many  as  in  large  and  medium- sized  firms. 
Still,  this  figure  reflected  a  significant  decline  from  the  1970s,  when 
small-scale  industry  accounted  for  86  percent  of  total  industrial 
employment.  By  2004  the  number  of  small-scale  enterprises  was 
around  250,000,  and  together  they  employed  1.8  million  workers,  16 
percent  of  the  industrial  labor  force.  The  foremost  branches  were 
food  and  beverages,  including  tobacco,  with  about  33  percent  of 
these  workers,  followed  by  wood  and  textiles,  including  footwear, 
each  of  which  accounted  for  slightly  more  than  20  percent.  Labor 
productivity  has  remained  relatively  low  in  small-scale  industry.  In 


209 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

2004  value-added  contributions  in  this  sector  amounted  to  only 
Rpl2  million  (about  US$1,342)  per  worker,  as  compared  with  Rp77 
million  (about  US$8,614)  in  large  and  medium-sized  firms.  Foster- 
ing small-scale  manufacturing  is  especially  important  in  terms  of 
generating  employment,  whereas  a  successive  upgrading  of  technol- 
ogy is  more  easily  achieved  by  stimulating  large  and  medium-sized 
units  of  production. 

The  considerable  productivity  gap  compared  to  larger  industrial 
enterprises  has  slowed  in  the  development  of  small-scale  industry. 
Differentials  of  1:10,  or  even  more,  have  been  reported,  with  few 
signs  of  improvement.  The  New  Order  policy  of  supporting  small- 
scale  industry  through  sponsorship  or  partnership  relationships  with 
bigger  firms  evolved  in  the  early  1990s  and  officially  launched  in 
1996,  but  it  had  little  effect  when  the  financial  crisis  caused  priorities 
to  be  shifted  elsewhere. 

Minerals 

Indonesia  is  the  leading  producer  of  petroleum  in  Southeast  Asia 
and  has  the  world's  tenth-largest  proven  natural  gas  reserves,  70  per- 
cent of  which  are  offshore.  It  exported  16  percent  of  the  world's  total 
volume  of  LNG  in  2005,  but  more  recent  reports  indicate  that  the 
share  is  diminishing.  It  also  has  significant  reserves  of  other  valuable 
minerals,  such  as  bauxite,  coal,  copper,  gold,  nickel,  and  tin.  Much 
of  the  nation's  industrial  development,  however,  is  based  on  the  pro- 
cessing of  oil  and  natural  gas.  Most  mineral  production,  after  some 
degree  of  domestic  processing,  is  exported  to  industrial  nations, 
especially  Japan.  Some  of  Indonesia's  own  mineral-intensive  indus- 
tries, notably,  steel  and  aluminum,  rely  on  imports  of  raw  materials. 
On  balance,  however,  Indonesia  is  a  net  exporter  of  minerals,  in 
large  part  because  of  large-scale  exports  of  LNG. 

Petroleum  and  Natural  Gas 

Between  1962  and  2009,  Indonesia's  oil  production  was  formally 
governed  by  a  quota  allocation  from  the  Organization  of  the  Petro- 
leum Exporting  Countries  (OPEC — see  Glossary).  In  2005  Indone- 
sian output  of  crude  oil  amounted  to  about  1.1  million  barrels  per 
day,  corresponding  to  3.5  percent  of  OPEC's  total  production.  This 
was  about  20  percent  less  than  the  level  of  crude  output  in  1999  and 
also  failed  to  meet  the  allocated  OPEC  quota  of  1 .4  million  barrels 
per  day.  In  2006  the  crude  oil  output  fell  below  1  million  barrels  per 
day.  Experts  attribute  the  decline  in  output  to  a  slowdown  in  invest- 
ment and  declining  productivity.  With  oil  exports  governed  at  least

The  Economy 


in  part  by  long-run  contractual  agreements  and  domestic  fuel  con- 
sumption increasing  rapidly  as  Indonesia  shook  off  the  effects  of  the 
Asian  financial  crisis,  oil  imports  into  the  country  in  the  early 
twenty-first  century  were  rising  at  a  rate  considered  alarming  by  out- 
side observers.  The  increase  from  2004  to  2005  amounted  to  30  per- 
cent, and  purchases  of  foreign  oil,  in  both  crude  and  refined  forms, 
corresponded  to  22  percent  of  total  expenditures  on  imports  in  the 
latter  year.  Exports  looked  likely  to  increase  with  production  com- 
mencing from  the  Cepu  oil  field  in  Jawa  Tengah  Province. 

Indonesia's  oil  industry  is  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  world.  The  two 
pioneering  oil  firms  in  the  then-Dutch  colony,  Royal  Dutch  and  the 
British  company  Shell,  exploited  reserves  in  eastern  Kalimantan  and 
northern  Sumatra  starting  in  the  late  1890s.  The  firms,  which  in  1907 
forged  an  alliance,  Royal  Dutch  Shell,  virtually  monopolized  the  oil 
sector  through  joint  subsidiaries  for  production  and  distribution  for 
several  decades  in  the  twentieth  century.  Two  American  rivals,  Stan- 
dard-Vacuum Oil  Company  (Stanvac)  and  California  Texas  Oil  Com- 
pany (Caltex),  gained  prominence  shortly  after  independence  in  1945 
and  survived  into  the  Suharto  era;  Royal  Dutch  Shell  withdrew  from 
Indonesia  in  1965.  By  the  1990s,  five  of  the  six  largest  foreign  oil  com- 
panies operating  in  Indonesia  were  American-owned.  For  decades, 
exploitation  of  Indonesia's  oil  and  gas  reserves  has  taken  place  under  a 
production-sharing  arrangement  between  the  government  and  foreign 
oil  companies,  by  which  the  state-owned  enterprise  Pertamina  dis- 
burses the  bulk  of  output,  retaining  for  itself  the  proceeds  from  sales  in 
international  markets.  A  smaller  part  of  output  serves  to  recover  the 
costs  of  investment  and  operations  incurred  by  the  foreign  firms.  Ini- 
tially the  ratio  was  65:35,  but  the  Suharto  government  negotiated  a 
shift  to  85:15.  Contract  terms  for  Indonesian  oil  have  been  considered 
among  the  toughest  in  the  world. 

Annual  oil  production  expanded  quickly  in  response  to  rising 
world  prices  during  the  1970s,  reaching  a  peak  of  almost  1.7  million 
barrels  per  day  in  1977.  Prices  continued  to  soar  until  1982,  when  a 
gradual  decline  set  in,  culminating  in  the  sharp  drop  in  world  oil 
prices  of  1986.  Total  production  in  the  late  1980s  amounted  to 
around  1 .2  million  barrels  per  day.  Production  then  increased,  aver- 
aging 1.35  million  barrels  per  day  over  the  1991-99  period.  A  grad- 
ual decline  followed,  to  slightly  more  than  1  million  barrels  per  day 
by  2003-5,  dropping  below  that  benchmark  in  early  2006.  It  seemed 
probable  that  Indonesia  might  become  a  net  importer  of  crude  oil, 
which  indeed  occurred  temporarily  in  2008,  and  since  January  2009 
Indonesia  has  suspended  its  membership  in  OPEC.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

By  the  1990s,  Pertamina  was  operating  eight  large  oil  refineries, 
in  Sumatra,  Kalimantan,  and  Java.  Major  investments  negotiated  in 
the  first  years  of  the  twenty-first  century  involved  the  new  exploita- 
tion of  offshore  oil  reserves  in  Jawa  Timur  and  Kalimantan  Timur,  as 
well  as  the  construction  of  long  pipelines  connecting  southern  Suma- 
tra, Java,  and  eastern  Kalimantan.  The  Indonesian  government  con- 
tinues to  subsidize  domestic  fuel  prices  at  well  below  international 
market  prices. 

Natural  gas  fields  exist  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh,  the  Natuna 
Islands  in  Kepulauan  Riau  Province,  and  in  Kalimantan  Timur  and 
Papua  Barat  provinces.  After  conversion  to  LNG — a  refrigeration 
process  that  reduces  it  to  1 /600th  of  its  volume — the  gas  is  exported 
primarily  to  Japan,  South  Korea,  and  Taiwan,  and  increasingly  to 
China.  Conversion  facilities  were  constructed  in  the  late  1970s  at 
Lhokseumawe  (in  Aceh)  and  Bontang  (in  Kalimantan  Timur)  and,  in 
the  late  2000s,  in  Bintuni  Bay  (in  Papua  Barat).  The  total  capacity  of 
these  plants  reached  23  million  tons  by  1990.  Continued  expansion 
brought  the  total  to  a  peak  of  32  million  tons  in  1999,  and  by  the 
beginning  of  the  twenty-first  century  the  level  of  output  had  stabi- 
lized at  an  annual  average  of  27.5  million  tons.  Indonesia  supplies  as 
much  as  15  percent  of  the  natural  gas  produced  by  OPEC  members. 

Most  output  goes  to  liquefying  plants  for  export,  although  a  grow- 
ing proportion  is  needed  for  domestic  consumption,  especially  of 
fertilizer,  the  production  of  which  requires  that  natural  gas  be  pro- 
cessed into  ammonia  and  urea.  Growing  domestic  and  export 
demand  have  encouraged  the  development  of  the  gas  field  in  the 
Natuna  Islands  in  the  South  China  Sea  and  the  Tangguh  gas  field  in 
Bintuni  Bay. 

Other  Minerals 

The  New  Order  government  made  efforts  to  rejuvenate  the  coal 
industry,  mainly  located  in  the  provinces  of  Sumatera  Barat,  Sumatera 
Selatan,  and  Kalimantan  Timur,  so  as  to  encourage  coal  use  by,  for 
example,  cement  and  electric-power  plants.  Joint  ventures  between 
the  state  and  foreign  investors  have  resulted  in  a  steady  increase  in 
production.  Output  exceeded  50  million  tons  in  1997  and  climbed  to 
more  than  100  million  tons  in  2002. 

Another  extractive  industry  dating  from  the  colonial  period  is  tin 
mining,  based  on  the  islands  of  Bangka  and  Belitung  (Bangka-Belitung 
Province)  in  the  Java  Sea  off  the  southeastern  coast  of  Sumatra.  Along 
with  Malaysia  and  Bolivia,  Indonesia  is  one  of  the  world's  top-three 
producers  of  tin.  Production  was  fully  controlled  by  the  government 
starting  in  the  late  1950s,  but  it  stagnated  in  the  early  Suharto  period,

with  output  falling  below  30  million  tons  annually  throughout  most  of 
the  1980s.  A  gradual  increase  followed  in  the  1990s  as  a  result  of  new 
investment  in  production  capacity,  and  by  2000  Indonesia  was  produc- 
ing 50  million  tons  per  year.  Rising  tin  prices  on  the  world  market 
caused  a  further  increase  by  2006  to  a  level  in  excess  of  81  million  tons. 

Another  postindependence  development  in  the  mineral  industry 
was  nickel  mining  in  Sulawesi  Tenggara  Province,  where  a  Canadian 
investor  entered  into  a  joint  venture  with  the  government.  In  the 
1980s,  Indonesia  emerged  as  one  of  the  world's  top-five  producers 
of  nickel.  Capacity  increased  to  2.5  million  tons  per  year  in  the  early 
1990s  and  substantially  enlarged  during  the  first  couple  of  years  of 
the  twenty- first  century,  nearing  a  level  of  4.4  million  tons  by  2003. 

One  of  the  world's  most  spectacular  mines  is  the  huge  P.  T.  Free- 
port-Indonesia  copper  and  gold  mine,  located  atop  Ertsberg  Moun- 
tain near  Tembagapura,  Papua  Province.  Since  the  beginning  of  the 
Suharto  period,  the  mine  has  been  run  by  a  joint  venture  with  the 
U.S. -based  Freeport-McMoRan  Copper  and  Gold.  The  ore  is  trans- 
ported by  pipeline  96  kilometers  down  the  mountain  slopes  and 
through  the  rain  forest  to  Freeport's  port  of  Amamapare  for  export. 
A  second  mine,  on  nearby  Grasberg  Mountain,  came  online  in  the 
early  1990s.  Both  Ertsberg  and  Grasberg  are  north  of  the  city  of 
Tembagapura.  Much  attention  has  been  given  in  the  news  media  to 
the  environmental  degradation  resulting  from  this  kind  of  open-cast 
mining  and  also  to  confrontations  between  the  American  enter- 
prise— protected  by  the  Indonesian  military — and  the  local  Papua 
population  concerning  land  use  and  the  exploitation  of  the  region's 
natural  resources.  Given  its  participation  in  the  equity  of  the  Freeport 
subsidiary,  the  Indonesian  government  has  always  had  high  profits  at 
stake.  Total  copper  production  has  risen  rapidly,  climbing  to  more 
than  1  million  tons  in  1994,  reaching  2.5  million  tons  per  year  in  the 
late  1990s,  and  approaching  4  million  tons  per  year  by  2002.  In 
2007,  however,  total  output  fell  below  3  million  tons. 

Other  Indonesian  mineral  products  also  are  important.  They 
include  gold,  mainly  extracted  as  a  by-product  at  the  Freeport  copper 
mines,  and  bauxite  found  on  Bintan  Island  in  Kepulauan  Riau  Prov- 
ince, used  in  the  domestic  production  of  aluminum. 

Services  and  Infrastructure 

In  the  first  years  of  the  twenty-first  century,  service  industries  pro- 
vided jobs  for  about  40  million  Indonesians,  corresponding  to  39  per- 
cent of  the  total  labor  force,  a  proportion  that  had  risen  only 
marginally  since  the  1990s.  About  50  percent  of  these  jobs  were  in 
trading,  hotels,  and  restaurants;  33  percent  were  in  a  variety  of  com- 


214 


The  Economy 


munity,  social,  and  personal  services;  and  the  remainder,  approxi- 
mately 17  percent,  were  mostly  in  the  transportation,  communications, 
and  storage  sectors.  Jobs  in  finance  accounted  for  less  than  2  percent 
of  total  employment  in  the  services  sector.  Indonesia  also  had  about  4 
million  civil  servants  at  all  levels  of  government.  A  large  proportion 
of  work  in  the  services  sector,  about  70  percent,  consisted  of  informal 
employment.  Petty  traders  made  up  the  majority  of  the  informal  sec- 
tor, and  unincorporated  establishments  accounted  for  as  much  as  90 
percent  of  employment  in  commerce.  Ubiquitous  self-employed 
small-scale  traders  plied  their  wares  in  village  markets  and  on  urban 
streets. 

The  government's  attitude  toward  the  informal  sector  has  often 
been  ambivalent.  On  the  one  hand,  its  importance  as  a  source  of 
employment  required  support  as  part  of  the  overall  effort  to  promote 
pribumi  entrepreneurship.  On  the  other  hand,  policies  often  thwarted 
informal-sector  activities.  For  example,  the  once  common  becak 
(pedicab)  was  restricted  to  small  side  streets  in  many  urban  areas  and 
phased  out  altogether  in  Jakarta. 

Transportation 

An  elaborate  upgrade  of  the  long-neglected  transportation  infra- 
structure began  in  the  1970s.  The  physical  infrastructure,  such  as 
roads,  railroads,  ports,  and  airports,  was  significantly  expanded  and 
improved  with  the  aid  of  burgeoning  revenues  from  oil  exports.  This 
process  slowed  in  the  1990s  and  came  to  a  complete  halt  during  the 
financial  crisis  and  subsequent  recovery.  In  2005  attention  focused 
on  reconstruction  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh  after  the  damage 
caused  by  the  December  26,  2004,  tsunami.  Outlays  for  infrastruc- 
ture alone  in  2005  were  estimated  at  US$660  million.  In  early  2006, 
the  government  announced  a  new  package  for  infrastructure  devel- 
opment at  a  total  cost  of  US$48  billion  during  the  subsequent  five- 
year  period. 

Roads 

Indonesia  had  some  437,760  kilometers  of  roads  by  2008,  of 
which  59  percent  were  paved,  and  about  60  percent  were  located  in 
Java,  Madura,  Bali,  and  Sumatra  (see  fig.  10).  There  are  less  exten- 
sive networks  of  roads  in  Sulawesi  and  Kalimantan,  while  smaller 
islands  often  have  just  a  few  roads  within  or  connecting  major  settle- 
ments. About  40,000  kilometers  of  roads  administered  by  the  national 
and  provincial  governments  were  considered  to  be  in  good  condition; 
another  35,000  kilometers  were  in  varying  stages  of  repair.  About  32 
percent  of  the  nation's  roads  are  classified  as  highways. 


215 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  nation's  roads  and  highways  are  used  annually  by  some  5.5 
million  passengers  cars,  1.2  million  buses,  2.9  million  trucks,  and 
28.5  million  motorcycles.  Motor  vehicles  increasingly  dominate 
urban  transit,  and  in  major  cities  the  policy  is  to  increase  the  role  of 
larger  public  buses  over  that  of  privately  owned,  smaller-capacity 
vehicles  such  as  the  nine-seat  Opelet  microbus  and  the  six-seat 
Bemo.  The  formerly  ubiquitous  becak  has  been  largely  replaced  in 
the  major  cities  by  the  bajaj,  a  three-wheeled,  multipassenger  motor- 
cycle, which  itself  is  losing  ground  to  minibuses  and  automobiles.  In 
Jakarta  the  increased  use  of  private  vehicles  contributes  to  urban 
sprawl,  ever-greater  traffic  congestion,  and  air  pollution. 

Vehicular  congestion  and  automotive  emissions  are  increasing, 
particularly  in  urban  areas.  Some  new  toll  roads  were  constructed  in 
the  1990s,  such  as  the  one  between  Jakarta  city  center  and  Sukarno- 
Hatta  International  Airport  to  the  west  and  the  industrial  areas  around 
Cikarang  and  Cikampek  to  the  east.  However,  such  developments  fell 
far  short  of  keeping  up  with  rapidly  expanding  demand,  and  new  proj- 
ects were  shelved  altogether  when  the  financial  crisis  struck  in  1997, 
resuming  only  after  several  years  of  recovery.  A  toll  road  opened  in 
2005  significantly  reduced  travel  time  between  Jakarta  and  Bandung, 
the  nearest  major  city  to  the  capital.  Newly  constructed  toll  roads  con- 
nect Semarang  and  Surakarta  (also  known  as  Solo)  in  Jawa  Tengah 
Province  and  improve  access  to  Pasuruan  in  Jawa  Timur.  Investment 
in  a  mass  public-transport  system  in  Jakarta  lagged  behind  develop- 
ments in  other  Southeast  Asian  capitals  such  as  Bangkok,  Kuala  Lum- 
pur, Manila,  and  Singapore.  A  system  of  priority  bus  lanes  introduced 
in  2005  has  offered  a  temporary  solution.  In  2004  construction  started 
on  an  elevated,  two-line  monorail  serving  Jakarta's  central  business 
district  and  suburban  areas  east  and  west  of  the  city.  Completion  of 
the  monorail,  scheduled  for  2007,  was  delayed  with  construction 
barely  underway  in  2008,  and  little  progress  was  made  thereafter. 
Administrative  hurdles  and  disputes  over  land  generally  are  cited  as 
factors  that  severely  slow  down  investment  in  the  transportation  infra- 
structure in  Indonesia. 

Railroads 

In  2008  Indonesia  had  8,529  kilometers  of  railroad  track,  all  of  it 
owned  by  the  government  and  operated  by  the  Department  of  Trans- 
port, a  gain  of  more  than  30  percent  since  2006.  About  75  percent  of 
railroad  track  is  located  in  Java.  In  2006  most  of  the  track  (5,961  kilo- 
meters) was  1.067-meter  narrow  gauge,  125  kilometers  of  which  was 
electrified  in  2006;  the  rest  (497  kilometers)  was  0.750-meter  gauge. 
Although  trains  are  used  mostly  for  passenger  transportation,  freight 


216 


The  Economy 


haulage  has  made  significant  advances,  having  increased  to  more 
than  17  million  tons  by  2005,  a  gain  of  50  percent  over  the  level  of 
the  early  1990s.  Rail  transportation  is  especially  suited  to  hauling 
bulk  items  such  as  fertilizer,  cement,  and  coal,  and  freight  has  proved 
more  profitable  than  passenger  service.  Sumatra  accounts  for  75  per- 
cent of  freight  handling.  In  2007  railroads  carried  about  175  million 
passengers,  97  percent  of  whom  boarded  trains  in  Java. 

Shipping 

Maritime  transportation  experienced  major  investments  and  various 
reforms  in  the  1980s  after  growing  increasingly  restrictive  and  bureau- 
cratic during  preceding  decades.  The  Indonesian  National  Shipping 
Company  (Pelni)  had  been  established  in  1952  but  gained  the  upper 
hand  in  interisland  shipping  only  after  the  nationalization  of  the 
Dutch-owned  shipping  company  in  1959.  By  1965  Pelni  accounted  for 
50  percent  of  tonnage  in  interisland  shipping,  but  its  market  share 
declined  sharply  despite  a  virtual  monopoly  on  passenger  travel.  In 
1982  a  "gateway  policy"  was  introduced  in  order  to  discourage  trans- 
shipment via  Singapore  and  direct  Indonesia's  nonbulk  exports 
through  four  designated  deep-sea  ports:  Tanjung  Priok  (Jakarta),  Tan- 
jung  Perak  (Surabaya,  Jawa  Timur  Province),  Belawan  (Medan, 
Sumatera  Utara  Province),  and  Makassar  (formerly  Ujungpandang,  in 
Sulawesi  Selatan  Province).  The  protectionist  measures  were  accom- 
panied by  a  US$4  billion  investment  plan  launched  in  1983  that  in  par- 
ticular favored  upgrading  facilities  at  the  four  gateway  ports. 
However,  such  a  gateway  policy  became  irrelevant  as  exports  were 
increasingly  handled  by  container  shipping.  By  1987  Indonesia's  trade 
with  North  America  and  Europe  moved  almost  exclusively  via  trans- 
shipment in  Singapore.  In  fact,  the  closing  of  Indonesian  ports  to 
feeder  vessels  denied  Indonesian  shippers  the  benefits  of  lower  freight 
rates  made  possible  by  the  cargo  consolidation  at  Singapore.  By  the 
late  1980s,  the  gateway  policy  had  been  abandoned. 

Total  freight  volume  handled  by  some  95  commercial  Indonesian 
ports  reached  a  total  of  1 .2  billion  tons  by  2004,  75  percent  of  which 
went  to  foreign  destinations.  The  greatest  volume  passed  through 
ports  adjacent  to  oil  refineries:  30  million  tons  at  Dumai,  Riau  Prov- 
ince, and  22  million  tons  at  Balikpapan,  Kalimantan  Timur  Province. 
By  contrast,  the  four  main  ports  in  Java — Tanjung  Priok  (Jakarta), 
Tanjung  Perak  (Surabaya),  Semarang,  and  Cilacap — were  together 
responsible  for  just  30  million  tons.  In  addition  to  major  ports,  there 
are  more  than  30  other  significant  ports  supporting  interisland  mari- 
time trade  throughout  the  archipelago.

The  Economy 


Civil  Aviation 

Although  passenger  transportation  by  sea  still  exceeded  domestic 
air  travel  in  2002,  with  17  million  passengers  compared  to  12  million, 
by  2007  civil  aviation  had  become  of  far  greater  importance.  In  that 
year,  3 1  million  passengers  boarded  an  airplane  compared  with  only 
6  million  using  sea  transport.  The  phenomenal  increase  in  domestic 
air  travel  in  the  early  twenty-first  century  was  caused  by  a  prolifera- 
tion of  private  budget  airlines  linking  all  parts  of  the  archipelago  and 
making  air  travel  affordable  for  large  groups  of  new  customers.  By 
comparison,  international  arrivals  by  air  increased  from  4.3  million 
passengers  in  2000  to  5.3  million  in  2004  and  then  declined  to  4.5 
million  by  2007.  Civil  aviation  is  handled  by  the  state-owned  national 
carrier,  Garuda  Indonesia,  which  dates  from  1949;  its  subsidiary, 
Merpati  Nusantara  Airlines;  and  a  host  of  private  budget  airlines, 
which  expanded  from  three  in  2000  to  29  by  2005. 

The  enlargement  of  physical  infrastructure  in  the  late  1970s  and 
early  1980s  included  construction  of  airports  throughout  the  archipel- 
ago so  that  every  provincial  capital  was  within  hours  of  Jakarta.  The 
hub,  Sukarno-Hatta  International  Airport  at  Jakarta,  opened  in  1985 
and  was  followed  by  international  airports  in  Denpasar,  Bali  (Ngurah 
Rai),  Surabaya,  Jawa  Timur  (Juanda),  and  Medan,  Sumatera  Utara 
(Polonia).  In  2009  Indonesia  had  683  airfields,  164  of  which  were 
full-fledged  airports,  including  at  least  22  designated  as  international. 
There  also  were  36  heliports.  The  largest  numbers  of  passengers  dis- 
embarked at  Jakarta,  Surabaya,  Medan,  and  Denpasar.  Runways  at 
least  3,000  meters  long  were  available  in  Medan,  Padang,  Jakarta, 
Surabaya,  Denpasar,  and  Biak  (Papua  Barat  Province).  Besides  these 
major  airports,  Indonesia  is  well  served  by  35  or  more  significant  air- 
ports. In  this  regard,  Papua  is  particularly  well  served. 

Post  and  Telecommunications 

The  national  postal  system  is  the  most  important  means  of  commu- 
nication for  the  majority  of  citizens.  Postal  services  are  available  in  all 
subdistricts,  and,  by  the  first  years  of  the  twenty-first  century,  the  total 
number  of  post  offices  had  increased  to  7,000  from  fewer  than  3,000  in 
1980.  Having  invested  early  in  satellite  communications,  since  the 
1980s  Indonesia  has  possessed  a  sophisticated  telecommunications 
infrastructure.  It  is  supported  by  the  Palapa  system  of  satellites  (the 
name  signifies  unity).  The  first  two  Palapa- A  satellites  were  launched 
in  1976;  they  were  successfully  replaced  by  Palapa-B  satellites  in 
1987.  The  first  Palapa-C  was  launched  in  January  1996,  and  a  second 
in  May  1996,  providing  coverage  not  only  for  the  Indonesian  archipel- 
ago but  also  for  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Singapore.  Formerly 


219 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

government-owned,  the  Palapa  system  was  acquired  by  a  private- 
sector  company,  Satelindo,  established  in  1993.  The  system  includes 
international  direct-dialing  facilities  and  a  fully  integrated  national  tele- 
phone system.  By  2007  there  were  17.8  million  main  telephone  lines  in 
use,  and  the  number  of  mobile  phones  had  reached  81.8  million. 
Although  there  are  more  than  200,000  telephone  kiosks,  many  located 
in  remote  areas,  recent  expansion  has  almost  entirely  been  in  mobile- 
phone  connections.  The  number  of  mobile-phone  subscribers  more 
than  doubled  between  2004  and  2007,  whereas  only  12  million  inhabit- 
ants, less  than  6  percent  of  the  total  population,  had  access  to  a  fixed 
telephone  line.  Privatization  of  the  telecommunications  sector  has 
facilitated  competition  and  reduced  costs  for  the  consumer. 

Television  and  radio  traditionally  have  been  dominated  by  govern- 
ment networks,  but  private  commercial  channels  have  been  emerging 
since  the  introduction  of  Hawk  Television  Indonesia  (RCTI)  in  the 
Jakarta  area  in  1988.  By  early  in  the  new  century,  the  improved  com- 
munications system  had  brought  television  signals  to  every  village  in 
the  country,  and  most  Indonesians  could  choose  from  1 1  channels.  In 
addition  to  the  state-owned  Television  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia 
(TVRI),  there  were  10  national  private  channels  in  2009.  The  best 
known  are  Indosiar,  RCTI,  Sun  Television  (SCTV),  Metro  TV,  and 
Trans  7.  Some  channels  have  a  specific  orientation,  for  instance,  Global 
TV,  which  initially  offered  broadcasts  from  MTV  Indonesia,  and  Indo- 
nesian Educational  Television  (TPI),  which  originally  carried  only  edu- 
cational programming  but  expanded  into  quiz  programs,  sports,  reality 
shows,  and  other  popular  entertainment.  There  also  were  54  local  tele- 
vision stations  in  2009,  such  as  Bali  TV  in  Bali,  Jak  TV  in  Jakarta,  and 
Pacific  TV  in  Manado.  There  were  about  3,000  live  radio  stations 
throughout  Indonesia,  but  only  a  few  broadcast  nationally.  Examples 
include  Jakarta  News,  Sonara,  and  Prambors  in  the  nation's  capital; 
JJFM,  Radio  DJ,  and  Radio  Istra  in  Surabaya;  Swaragama  in  Yogya- 
karta;  and  Global  FM  Bali  in  Denpasar. 

Internet  usage  has  surged  since  2000,  when  there  were  2  million 
users.  In  2009  there  were  nearly  30  million  users,  a  1,500-percent 
increase  since  the  start  of  the  twenty-first  century.  Indonesia  has  the 
most  Internet  users  among  all  other  Southeast  Asian  nations. 

Electric  Power 

As  it  had  been  for  many  years,  the  government-owned  National 
Electric  Company  (PLN)  was  virtually  the  sole  source  of  electricity 
for  domestic  consumption  in  the  early  twenty-first  century.  Capacity 
had  been  growing  at  a  rate  of  15  percent  per  year  since  the  1970s  and 
was  especially  enhanced  by  the  addition  of  large  coal-fired  generating 


220 


The  Economy 


facilities  at  Paiton,  Jawa  Timur  Province,  in  the  late  1990s.  Industry 
tended  to  use  almost  50  percent  of  domestically  generated  power.  By 
2004  total  installed  capacity  amounted  to  22,000  megawatts,  and 
PLN  had  more  than  40,000  employees.  There  was  a  slowdown  in  the 
expansion  of  capacity  and  production  during  the  Asian  financial  cri- 
sis, but  starting  in  2000  production  growth  again  achieved  annual 
increases  of  10  percent  or  more. 

Economic  Prospects 

The  big  challenge  for  Indonesia  in  the  early  twenty-first  century  is 
to  resume  rapid  economic  growth  while  retaining  the  achievements  of 
reform  and  democratization  won  since  the  collapse  of  the  New  Order 
government  in  1998.  This  is  no  easy  task.  Short-run  prospects  for 
major  macroeconomic  variables  looked  quite  favorable  at  the  end  of 
the  first  decade  of  the  twenty-first  century.  Production  capacity  was 
being  enlarged  as  a  result  of  new  investment,  the  current  account  in 
the  balance  of  payments  was  improving,  the  exchange  rate  had 
reached  a  stable  level,  inflation  was  slowing,  and  the  government  bud- 
get deficit  had  been  significantly  reduced.  An  average  annual  growth 
rate  in  the  6  to  6.5  percent  range  appeared  possible,  with  6.2  percent 
specified  as  the  target  for  2010.  That  would  be  sufficient  to  reduce 
poverty  and  official  unemployment  to  the  levels  laid  down  in  the 
long-run  economic  plans.  But  such  positive  prospects  were  offset  by 
external  and  internal  uncertainties.  Continued  high  oil  prices  in  the 
world  economy  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  prices  of  imports 
in  general  and  put  an  additional  strain  on  foreign-exchange  earnings  if 
Indonesia  were  indeed  to  stay  a  net  importer  of  fuels.  Another  external 
source  of  uncertainty  was  the  excessive  dependence  of  the  Indonesian 
capital  market  on  short-run  foreign  portfolio  investments  with  an 
inclination  toward  high  sensitivity  to  sudden  fluctuations  in  expecta- 
tions. The  most  crucial  internal  source  of  uncertainty  concerned  the 
government's  capability  to  create  sound  business  conditions.  Progress 
was  urgently  needed  in  combating  corruption  and  guaranteeing  legal 
security  for  both  foreign  and  domestic  firms.  The  administration  of 
President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono,  who  took  office  in  2004  and 
was  reelected  in  2009,  initially  enjoyed  considerable  credit  for  its 
determination  to  tackle  these  huge  problems,  but  signs  of  disappoint- 
ment with  the  slow  pace  of  progress  have  been  mounting. 

The  three  chief  trends  in  Indonesian  economic  development  since 
the  late  1 960s — increasing  integration  with  the  world  economy,  pro- 
found structural  change,  and  intense  diversification — remain  rele- 
vant to  an  assessment  of  long-term  prospects  in  the  twenty-first 
century.  Further  integration  with  the  world  economy  is  expected  to 


221 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

be  strengthened,  in  particular,  following  the  accelerated  implementa- 
tion of  AFTA,  which  was  moved  up  from  2008  to  2002.  Already  by 
2006  the  average  tariff  rate  on  imports  in  the  five  original  ASEAN 
member  states  (plus  Brunei)  for  goods  covered  by  the  AFTA  agree- 
ment had  declined  to  less  than  2  percent  from  12  percent  in  the  early 
1990s.  The  successful  reduction  of  tariffs  prompted  the  formulation 
of  a  single  market,  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community,  as  an  official 
target  to  be  achieved  by  2015.  Structural  change,  notably  the  shift  of 
resources  from  the  primary  to  the  secondary  sector,  was  temporarily 
halted  by  the  1997-98  financial  crisis  and  its  aftermath  but  is  likely 
to  gain  momentum  as  rapid  economic  growth  resumes.  Further 
diversification  of  the  economy  is  likely  to  occur  and  may  be  rein- 
forced when  economic  effects  materialize  from  the  far-reaching 
decentralization  of  government  authority  that  became  effective  in 
2001.  In  the  process,  however,  regional  disparities  may  be  widened. 
It  will  be  a  major  challenge  for  the  central  government  to  give  sub- 
stance to  its  motto  "Unity  in  diversity,"  which  has  so  often  been 
applied  to  the  Indonesian  society  and  economy.

The  quality  of  statistics  on  the  Indonesian  economy  has  improved 
substantially,  and  a  wide  range  of  publications,  often  in  bilingual  format, 
are  available  from  the  BPS  Web  site  in  Jakarta  (http://www.bps.go.id/). 
The  annual  reports  issued  by  the  central  bank,  Bank  Indonesia,  contain  a 
wealth  of  information  on  current  economic  conditions.  In  addition,  the 
World  Bank  prepares  an  elaborate  analysis  of  the  nation's  economic 
prospects  each  year.  The  Far  Eastern  Economic  Review  (Hong  Kong, 
formerly  published  weekly  and  now  monthly)  and  daily  Asian  Wall 
Street  Journal  (Hong  Kong)  offer  less  scholarly  but  more  up-to-date 
information.  Most  informative  journals  published  in  Indonesia  are  in  the 
Indonesian  language. 

The  most  accessible  and  up-to-date  source  in  the  secondary  literature 
is  the  Bulletin  of  Indonesian  Economic  Studies,  published  by  the  Indone- 
sia Project  at  the  Australian  National  University  in  Canberra.  Each  issue 
opens  with  a  "Survey  of  Recent  Developments,"  a  tradition  sustained 
since  the  journal  was  founded  in  the  1960s  that  provides  a  succinct  over- 
view of  the  most  current  data  and  issues.  The  Indonesia  Project  also 
organizes  an  annual  conference  on  various  aspects  of  the  Indonesian  pol- 
ity and  economy,  the  "Indonesia  Update,"  which  has  resulted  in  a  series 
of  conference  proceedings  published  under  the  title  "Indonesia  Assess- 
ment" until  2001  and  thereafter  as  "Indonesia  Update  Series,"  available 
at  http://rspas.anu.edu.au/economics/ip/publications.php.

Indonesia.  An  early  and  especially  useful  summary  was  offered  by 
Hal  Hill  in  The  Indonesian  Economy  in  Crisis.  Two  other  mono-

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics 


A  precolonialJavanese  jong 


PRESIDENT  SUHARTO  RESIGNED  IN  1998,  and  Indonesia  began 
a  transition  to  democracy,  a  process  that  has  had  the  country  strug- 
gling to  establish  a  new  political  identity.  This  struggle  has  taken 
place  on  four  fronts:  executive-legislative  relations,  center-region 
relations,  religion-state  relations,  and  interethnic  relations.  A  slow 
but  eventually  successful  process  of  constitutional  reforms  from  1999 
to  2002  addressed  the  first  three  fronts.  Political  elites  in  the  People's 
Consultative  Assembly  (MPR;  for  this  and  other  acronyms,  see  table 
A)  established  a  strongly  presidential  system  with  directly  elected 
national  and  local  chief  executives,  stronger  legislatures,  and  an  inde- 
pendent judiciary,  as  well  as  a  decentralized  political  system  with  sig- 
nificant local  autonomy.  They  also  maintained  Indonesia's  identity  as 
a  plural,  tolerant,  and  moderate  Muslim-majority  society  with  signifi- 
cant non-Muslim  minorities,  but  not  an  Islamic  state.  This  vision  was 
sorely  tested  by  the  passage  in  some  districts  of  local  regulations 
implementing  parts  of  Islamic  law — sharia,  or  syariah  in  Bahasa 
Indonesia  (see  Glossary) — and  by  the  Al  Qaeda-linked  terrorist 
attacks  in  Bali  and  Jakarta  from  2002  to  2009.  Indonesian  citizens 
heartily  endorsed  these  changes  through  their  broad,  enthusiastic,  and 
largely  nonviolent  participation  in  the  1999,  2004,  and  2009  electoral 
processes.  The  constitutional  reform  process  indicated  little  on  the 
fourth  front,  interethnic  relations,  except  that  Indonesia  was  still  to  be 
a  state  based  on  Pancasila  (see  Glossary),  the  five-point  pan-religious, 
pan-ethnic  state  ideology  created  by  the  first  president,  Sukarno  (in 
office  1945-67).  Indonesians  have  struggled  to  overcome  deadly 
communal  strife  in  Maluku,  Sulawesi,  and  Kalimantan,  among  other 
places,  but  by  2009  much  of  this  violence  had  receded. 

Consolidation  of  the  new  democracy  remains  a  significant  chal- 
lenge. By  the  end  of  the  first  decade  of  the  twenty-first  century, 
reforms  in  the  national-security  sector  were  only  partial  at  best.  The 
military  and  police  remained  neutral  in  elections  between  1999  and 
2009,  and  they  were  stripped  of  their  appointed  seats  in  legislatures  at 
all  levels.  The  system  of  secondment  of  military  officers  to  the  civilian 
bureaucracy  was  also  abolished.  However,  the  roots  of  the  military's 
political  influence — the  territorial  system,  business  ventures,  and  the 
lack  of  democratic  civilian  oversight — only  began  to  be  addressed 
under  the  leadership  of  President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono,  who 
took  office  in  2004.  The  police  were  organizationally  separated  from 
the  military  in  1999  and  have  done  a  respectable  job  of  addressing  the 
threat  of  terrorism,  but  for  most  Indonesian  citizens,  daily  interactions 


227 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

with  the  police  have  not  been  reformed:  overall,  corruption  and  inef- 
fectiveness remain  widespread.  The  implementation  of  decentraliza- 
tion, including  revised  autonomy  laws  passed  in  2004  and  the  direct 
election  of  regional  chief  executives  (governors,  mayors,  and  district 
administrative  heads  or  regents — bupatis)  beginning  in  2005,  created 
its  own  problems,  as  corruption  also  has  been  decentralized,  and  the 
national  government  is  confronted  with  a  host  of  local  regulations  that 
are  inconsistent  with  national  laws  and  the  constitution.  Executive- 
legislative  relations  are  frequently  contentious,  as  the  president  and 
the  legislative  branch  establish  a  working  relationship  within  the  new 
constitutional  parameters  and  the  legislature  itself  adjusts  to  the  pres- 
ence of  a  new  upper  house,  the  Regional  Representative  Council 
(DPD),  established  in  2004.  Internal  reform  of  these  entities,  to  unclog 
the  process  of  enacting  laws  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity,  is  a 
pressing  need. 

Corruption  has  tainted  every  branch  and  level  of  the  state:  the  civil- 
ian bureaucracy,  the  military  and  police,  the  legislatures,  and  the  judi- 
ciary. Efforts  to  root  out  corruption,  including  the  passage  of  new  laws 
and  regulations  and  the  establishment  of  an  array  of  commissions, 
have  been  only  partially  effective.  Nonetheless,  for  ordinary  citizens, 
fighting  corruption  remains  a  matter  of  primary  concern,  particularly 
the  corruption  they  experience  on  a  day-to-day  basis  at  the  village  or 
ward  offices,  schools,  government  offices,  courts,  and  police  stations. 
Private  investors,  both  domestic  and  foreign,  are  reluctant  to  commit 
their  capital  to  Indonesia  because  of  the  high  cost  of  doing  business 
and  the  lack  of  consistent  contract  enforcement  by  a  clean  and  impar- 
tial judiciary. 

The  new  political  system  that  President  Yudhoyono  inherited  has 
made  dealing  with  these  pressing  issues  more  complex  than  previ- 
ously. Legislatures  are  more  independent  of  the  executive  branch,  and 
there  are  now  two  legislative  bodies  at  the  national  level.  Provincial 
and  district  governments  are  more  powerful  and  have  greater  auton- 
omy vis-a-vis  the  central  government.  The  judicial  system  is  no  longer 
under  the  administrative  and  political  control  of  the  executive  branch. 
The  military  retains  significant  latent  political  influence.  Nonetheless, 
the  success  of  the  2004  electoral  process  gave  the  new  system  broad 
legitimacy,  and,  again  in  2009,  Yudhoyono  enjoyed  a  strong  popular 
mandate  from  voters  to  move  the  country  forward. 

Foreign  policy  is  frequently  a  significant  issue  in  domestic  politics, 
particularly  when  it  concerns  relations  with  the  United  States,  Austra- 
lia, or  the  complex  tangle  of  problems  in  the  Middle  East.  Yudhoyono 
has  had  to  navigate  these  political  minefields,  given  his  ties  to  the 
United  States  from  his  prior  military  career  and  his  cultivation  of  a 


228 


Government  and  Politics 


profile  as  a  secular  nationalist  rather  than  an  Islamist  politician 
(although  he  is  personally  pious).  When  Indonesia  cooperates  with 
the  United  States  and  Australia  on  counterterrorism  measures,  the 
Yudhoyono  administration  has  to  be  careful  not  to  be  labeled  as  an 
agent  of  a  perceived  Western  "war  on  Islam."  Indonesia  has  also  had 
to  balance  maintaining  good  relations  with  the  West  with  supporting 
the  Palestinian  cause  and  opposing  the  U.S. -led  war  in  Iraq.  Indone- 
sia has  contributed  troops,  including  Yudhoyono's  elder  son,  to  the 
United  Nations  (UN)  peacekeeping  force  in  Lebanon,  while  simulta- 
neously preventing  private  citizens  from  volunteering  to  fight  beside 
Hezbollah  in  the  2006  war  with  Israel. 

When  Indonesia's  international  treaty  obligations  have  come  into 
conflict  with  expressing  solidarity  with  a  fellow  Muslim  nation — for 
example,  its  March  2007  vote  to  approve  UN  Security  Council  Reso- 
lution 1747  on  Iran's  nuclear- weapons  program — the  government  has 
been  harshly  criticized  at  home  as  a  tool  of  Western  interests.  The 
legislature  has  also  attempted  to  force  the  president  to  face  question- 
ing regarding  this  vote.  In  the  late  New  Order  period  under  President 
Suharto  (in  office  1967-98),  Indonesia  had  begun  to  project  a  more 
assertive  presence  in  the  international  arena,  corresponding  to  its 
large  population,  strategic  location,  abundant  natural  resources,  eco- 
nomic success,  and  growing  nationalism.  After  a  setback  of  a  decade 
of  focusing  inward  to  solve  its  political  and  economic  crisis,  by  2008 
Indonesia  began  to  reassert  itself  on  the  global  stage  as  a  generally 
constructive  force,  offering  to  help  solve  conflicts  ranging  from  the 
Korean  Peninsula  to  Iran,  from  Burma  (Myanmar)  to  Iraq.  Indone- 
sia's good  relations  with  independent  Timor-Leste  (East  Timor,  for- 
merly Timor  Timur  Province  of  Indonesia),  and  its  implementation  of 
a  peace  agreement  in  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh,  have  helped  bolster 
its  case  to  play  this  role,  largely  free  of  criticism  over  its  own  nagging 
human-rights  issues. 

The  Political  Debate 

Indonesia  has  been  a  magnet  for  students  of  comparative  politics 
as  well  as  foreign  diplomats  and  policy  makers  ever  since  indepen- 
dence from  the  Netherlands  was  declared  in  1945.  Fascination  with 
Indonesia  stems  in  part  from  its  large  population  (estimated  at  more 
than  240  million  people  in  2009),  strategic  location,  economic  poten- 
tial, great  cultural  and  ethnic  diversity,  and  fragmented  archipelagic 
geography  confounding  centralized  administration.  Equally  compel- 
ling is  Indonesia's  tumultuous  political  history,  from  Indianization 
and  Islamization  to  Dutch  colonialism  and  an  often  violent  decoloni- 
zation process. 


229 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Contemporary  Indonesian  political  history  can  be  divided  into  four 
periods,  each  defined  by  a  central  issue.  First,  during  the  1950s,  there 
was  the  question  of  the  political  integrity  of  the  state  itself,  beset  as  it 
was  by  religious,  regionalist,  and  ethnic  revolts  and  rebellions.  Sec- 
ond, and  of  great  concern  to  U.S.  policy  makers,  was  the  drift  that 
became  a  rush  to  the  left  and  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party 
(PKI — see  Glossary)  during  the  period  of  Sukarno's  Guided  Democ- 
racy (1959-65).  Third,  from  1966  to  1998,  there  was  the  develop- 
mentalist  authoritarianism  of  Suharto's  army-dominated  New  Order. 
Finally,  since  1998,  the  yeaf  Suharto  left  the  presidency,  the  success- 
ful transition  to  and  ongoing  consolidation  of  liberal  democracy  has 
provided  inspiration  for  reformers  and  democrats  in  other  Muslim- 
majority  societies. 

The  political  transition  in  Indonesia  has  produced  a  requisite 
change  among  academic  observers  of  Indonesian  politics:  Indonesia 
has  become  a  "normal"  country  that  can  be  examined  with  all  of  the 
standard  theoretical  and  methodological  tools  available.  As  before, 
some  continue  to  debate  the  basic  nature  of  the  Indonesian  state. 
Others,  however,  adopt  a  more  micro-analytical  approach,  examin- 
ing trends  in  various  policy  areas,  public  opinion,  etc.,  an  approach 
that  had  been  greatly  hampered  under  the  previous  authoritarian 
regime.  In  addition  to  providing  more  varied  empirical  fodder  for 
research,  democratization  in  Indonesia  has  also  resulted  in  much 
greater  freedom  for  researchers  to  conduct  their  studies.  One  conclu- 
sion on  which  most  observers  have  agreed  is  that  the  complexity, 
number,  and  interdependence  of  various  social,  cultural,  economic, 
and  political  factors  are  so  great  that  no  single  theory  suffices. 

Harking  back  to  previous  debates  regarding  the  basic  nature  of  the 
Indonesian  state,  one  of  the  broadest  current  discussions  concerns 
whether  the  still-fragile  democratic  order  can  be  consolidated  and  sus- 
tained. Some  scholars  argue  that  the  relatively  nonviolent  and  gradual 
nature  of  the  transition  bodes  well  for  the  future  of  Indonesian  democ- 
racy. As  positive  signs  in  this  regard,  they  point  to  the  success  of  the 
national  elections  in  1999,  2004,  and  2009;  the  acquiescence  (however 
grudging)  of  the  security  forces  to  the  establishment  of  democracy; 
and  the  consensual  process  and  broad  scope  of  the  constitutional 
reforms  passed  between  1999  and  2002.  Others  posit  that  it  is  pre- 
cisely the  lack  of  a  cleaner  and  deeper  break  with  the  past  that  has  cre- 
ated internal  contradictions  that  may  doom  the  new  democracy.  For 
instance,  a  substantial  level  of  continuity  in  the  political,  military, 
bureaucratic,  and  economic  elite  has  meant  that  old  habits  have  been 
adapted  to  the  new  institutions  and  retained  their  strength,  ensuring  the 
superficiality  of  institutional  change.  There  has  been  little  accountabil- 
ity, especially  at  the  highest  levels,  for  the  political  and  economic  sins

of  the  New  Order,  fostering  simmering  resentments  that  could  one  day 
be  tapped  as  a  reservoir  of  opposition  to  democracy  itself.  Most 
importantly,  despite  a  number  of  successful  high-level  prosecutions, 
rampant  bureaucratic,  military,  legislative,  and  judicial  corruption 
remains  the  most  significant  factor  keeping  private  foreign  investors 
on  the  sidelines.  Their  absence  lowers  economic  growth  rates,  which 
in  turn  hampers  the  performance  legitimacy  of  the  new  democratic 
regime.  Whatever  approach  is  used  to  describe  and  analyze  Indonesian 
government  and  politics,  it  requires  an  understanding  of  the  legal  basis 
and  institutional  structures  of  the  system. 

The  Constitutional  Framework 

The  legal  basis  of  the  Indonesian  state  is  the  1945  constitution, 
promulgated  the  day  after  the  August  17,  1945,  proclamation  of  inde- 
pendence from  the  Netherlands  and  amended  four  times  between 
1999  and  2002.  The  original  constitution  was  essentially  a  temporary 
instrument  hurriedly  crafted  by  the  Independence  Preparatory  Com- 
mittee in  the  last  months  before  the  Japanese  surrender  (see  The  Japa- 
nese Occupation,  ch.  1).  According  to  George  McTurnan  Kahin, 
whose  1952  book  Nationalism  and  Revolution  in  Indonesia  was  the 
pioneering  study  of  modern  Indonesian  politics,  the  constitution  was 
considered  "definitely  provisional."  Provisional  or  not,  the  constitu- 
tion provided  structural  continuity  in  a  period  of  political  discontinu- 
ity after  1998.  Beginning  with  the  preamble,  which  invokes  the 
principles  of  the  Pancasila,  the  37  articles  of  the  constitution  set  forth 
the  boundaries  of  both  Sukarno's  Old  Order  and  Suharto's  New 
Order.  Amendment  of  the  1945  constitution  was  one  of  the  principal 
demands  of  the  student  movement  that  forced  Suharto  to  resign  in 
1998,  and  as  of  2009  was  one  of  the  few  of  those  demands  that  had 
been  largely  fulfilled.  Four  amendments  eliminated  many  ambiguities 
and  transformed  the  constitution  into  a  more  democratic  framework, 
with  extensive  separation  of  powers  and  checks  and  balances. 

The  Japanese  efforts  to  establish  an  independent  Indonesian  state 
encouraged  the  writing  of  the  1945  constitution,  which  was  very 
soon  temporarily  put  aside  and  had  not  been  fully  implemented 
when  the  transfer  of  sovereignty  from  the  Netherlands  took  place  on 
December  27,  1949.  The  1949  agreement  called  for  the  establish- 
ment of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Indonesia  (RIS).  Subsequently,  a 
provisional  constitution  adopted  in  February  1950  provided  for  the 
election  of  a  constituent  assembly  to  write  a  permanent  constitution 
(see  The  National  Revolution,  1945^9,  ch.  1).  A  rising  tide  of  more 
radical  nationalism,  driven  partly  by  perceptions  that  the  RIS  was  a 
Dutch  scheme  to  divide  and  reconquer  their  former  colony,  rapidly 


231 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

moved  political  leaders  in  the  direction  of  a  unitary  republic.  The 
Committee  for  the  Preparation  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Unitary 
State  was  established  on  May  19,  1950,  and  on  August  14  a  new 
constitution  (technically  an  amendment  to  the  RIS  constitution)  was 
ratified,  to  be  in  force  until  an  elected  constituent  assembly  com- 
pleted its  work.  The  new,  interim  constitution  provided  for  a  parlia- 
mentary system  of  government,  in  which  the  cabinet  and  the  prime 
minister  were  responsible  to  a  unicameral  legislature.  The  president 
was  to  be  head  of  state  but  without  real  executive  power  except  as  a 
catalyst  in  forming  a  cabinet. 

As  the  political  parties  wrestled  ineffectually  in  the  parliamentary 
forum,  dissident  ethnic  politicians  and  army  officers  joined  in  resist- 
ing central  authority  and  even  engaged  in  armed  rebellions  in  various 
provinces  between  1949  and  1962  (see  The  Road  to  Guided  Democ- 
racy, 1950-65,  ch.  1).  Sukarno  assumed  an  extra-constitutional  posi- 
tion from  which  he  wielded  paramount  authority  in  imposing  his 
more  defined  concept  of  Guided  Democracy  in  1959.  This  move  was 
backed  by  the  senior  military  leaders  whose  revolutionary  experi- 
ences had  already  made  them  suspicious,  even  contemptuous,  of 
civilian  politicians,  and  who  were  now  dismayed  by  the  disintegrative 
forces  at  work  in  the  nation.  The  military  moved  to  the  political  fore- 
front, where  it  remained  until  1998. 

Sukarno  sought  to  legitimize  his  authority  by  returning  to  the  1945 
constitution.  He  would  have  preferred  to  accomplish  this  goal  consti- 
tutionally by  having  the  402-member  Constituent  Assembly  formally 
adopt  the  1945  constitution.  However,  the  Constituent  Assembly, 
elected  in  1955  and  divided  along  secular  and  religious  lines,  could 
not  muster  the  required  two-thirds  majority  necessary  to  approve  new 
constitutional  provisions.  According  to  political  scientist  Daniel  S. 
Lev,  the  body  deadlocked  on  two  fundamental  issues:  the  role  of  Islam 
in  the  state  and  the  question  of  federalism.  Furthermore,  division  on 
these  issues  meant  that  ideological  consensus  among  the  anticommu- 
nist  parties  could  not  be  translated  into  effective  political  cooperation. 
As  long  as  the  Constituent  Assembly  failed  to  agree  on  a  new  consti- 
tutional form,  the  interim  constitution  with  its  weak  presidency  con- 
tinued in  force.  Backed  by  the  Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces 
(TNI — see  Glossary)  and  a  large  part  of  the  public,  which  was  impa- 
tient with  the  political  impasse  and  the  government's  failure  to  imple- 
ment the  promises  of  independence,  on  July  5,  1959,  Sukarno  decreed 
the  dissolution  of  the  Constituent  Assembly  and  a  return  to  the  1945 
constitution.  Martial  law  had  already  been  proclaimed  on  March  14, 
1957,  and  Sukarno  claimed  that  under  martial  law  his  legal  authority 
stemmed  from  his  position  as  supreme  commander  of  the  TNI.

The  national  coat  of  arms  of  Indonesia  depicts  the  Garuda — an  ancient 
mythical  bird — which  symbolizes  creative  energy,  the  greatness  of  the 
nation,  and  nature.  The  8  feathers  on  the  tail,  17  on  each  wing,  and  45  on 
the  neck  stand  for  the  date  of  Indonesia  s  independence  (August  1 7,  1945). 
The  shield  symbolizes  self-defense  and  protection  in  struggle.  The  five 
symbols  on  the  shield  represent  the  state  philosophy  of  Pancasila  (see 
Glossary).  The  motto  "Bhinneka  Tunggal Ika"  ("Unity  in  Diversity")  on 
the  banner  signifies  the  unity  of  the  Indonesian  people  despite  their 
diverse  ethnic  and  cultural  backgrounds.

The  original  1945  constitution  proved  to  be  extremely  elastic  as  a 
provisional  legal  framework  for  a  modern  state,  subject  to  broad 
interpretation  depending  upon  the  constellation  of  political  forces  in 
control  at  any  given  time.  Other  than  outlining  the  major  state  struc- 
tures, the  document  contained  few  specifics  about  relations  between 
citizens  and  the  government  and  left  open  basic  questions  about 
rights  and  responsibilities  of  citizen  and  state.  For  example,  Article 
28  states  that  "The  freedom  to  associate  and  to  assemble,  to  express 
written  and  oral  opinions,  etc.,  shall  be  established  by  law."  Subse- 
quent laws,  however,  did  not  fully  recognize  the  fundamental  rights 
of  the  individual  citizen  stipulated  by  the  constitution.  These  rights 
have  now  been  enshrined  and  further  delineated  in  a  new  chapter  on 
human  rights  immediately  following  the  original  Article  28 — Arti- 
cles 28A  to  28J,  approved  in  2000.  However,  the  1945  document  also 
is  an  expression  of  revolutionary  expectations  about  social  and  eco- 
nomic justice.  The  original  Article  33  states  that  the  economy  shall 
be  organized  cooperatively,  that  important  branches  of  production 


233 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

affecting  the  lives  of  most  people  shall  be  controlled  by  the  state,  and 
that  the  state  shall  control  natural  resources  for  exploitation  for  the 
general  welfare  of  the  people.  An  additional  clause  introduced  in 
2002  now  states  that  the  national  "economic  democracy"  shall  be 
organized  on  the  basis  of  such  principles  as  togetherness,  efficiency, 
justice,  sustainability,  environmental  perspectives,  self-sufficiency, 
and  balance. 

The  political  struggle  from  1945  to  1959  over  the  constitutional 
framework  of  the  state  stemmed  not  from  the  ambiguities  of  the  1945 
document  nor  its  heavy  weighting  of  executive  power,  but  over  deep 
disagreements  about  the  nature  of  the  state  itself,  particularly  the 
issues  of  federalism  and  the  role  of  Islam.  Once  the  common  battle 
against  Dutch  imperialism  had  been  won,  the  passionate  differences 
dividing  various  nationalist  groups  about  the  future  of  Indonesia  sur- 
faced. The  possibility  of  a  federation  of  loosely  knit  regions  was 
denied  by  the  use  of  force,  first  in  crushing  the  Republic  of  South 
Maluku  (RMS)  in  1950,  then  in  suppressing  the  Darul  Islam  insurgen- 
cies in  Jawa  Barat,  Aceh,  and  Sulawesi  Selatan  between  1949  and 
1962,  and  finally  in  defeating  the  Revolutionary  Government  of  the 
Republic  of  Indonesia  (PRRI)  and  the  Universal  Struggle  Charter 
(Permesta)  regional  rebellions  of  1957  to  1961.  In  subsequent  decades, 
the  central  government  was  always  sensitive  to  the  issue  of  separat- 
ism, and  the  existence  of  a  unitary  republic,  expressed  through  a  pri- 
mary "Indonesian"  national  identity,  seemed  secure.  The  difficulty  of 
integrating  an  Islamic  political  identity  with  the  Indonesian  Pancasila 
identity  was  no  longer  of  primary  importance  by  the  late  1990s  and, 
although  hotly  debated  at  times,  was  never  a  major  stumbling  block  in 
the  constitutional-amendment  process  from  1999  to  2002  (see  Pan- 
casila: The  State  Ideology,  this  ch.). 

The  Structure  of  Government 

The  original  1945  constitution  established  a  presidential  system  with 
significant  parliamentary  characteristics,  whereas  the  amended  consti- 
tution establishes  a  pure  presidential  system  with  extensive  separation 
of  powers  and  checks  and  balances.  Sovereignty  in  Indonesia  is  vested 
in  the  people,  who  exercise  their  will  through  six  organs  of  state  of 
roughly  equal  stature.  The  president  and  vice  president  lead  the  execu- 
tive branch  and  are  chosen  as  a  team  through  direct,  popular  elections; 
the  president  is  both  head  of  state  and  head  of  government  (see  fig.  11). 
Legislative  power  is  vested  in  the  People's  Representative  Council 
(DPR)  and  the  new  but  less  powerful  upper  house,  the  Regional  Repre- 
sentative Council  (DPD).  Although  the  People's  Consultative  Assem- 
bly (MPR)  is  now  no  more  than  a  joint  sitting  of  the  DPR  and  DPD,  it 


234 


Government  and  Politics 


retains  separate  powers  that  have  been  restricted  to  swearing  in  the 
president  and  vice  president,  amending  the  constitution,  and  having 
final  say  in  the  impeachment  process.  At  the  apex  of  the  judicial  sys- 
tem are  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  new  Constitutional  Court,  whose 
powers  include  reviewing  the  constitutionality  of  laws,  reaching  a  ver- 
dict on  articles  of  impeachment,  resolving  disputes  among  state  institu- 
tions, dissolving  political  parties,  and  resolving  electoral  disputes. 
Significant  decentralization  of  power  to  subnational  authorities  has 
also  been  enshrined  and  delineated  in  the  amended  constitution. 

Legislative  Bodies 

People's  Representative  Council 

Primary  legislative  authority  is  constitutionally  vested  in  the  Peo- 
ple's Representative  Council  (DPR;  often  referred  to  as  the  House  of 
Representatives),  which  had  500  members  in  1999,  550  members  in 
2004,  and  560  members  in  2009.  Members  are  elected  for  a  five-year 
term  from  multimember  districts  under  an  open-list  system  of  propor- 
tional representation.  These  electoral  districts  consist  either  of  whole 
provinces  (propinsi)  or  of  several  municipalities  (kota)  and  regencies 
(kabupaten)  within  the  same  province  (see  Elections,  this  ch.).  Parties 
must  win  at  least  2.5  percent  of  the  national  vote  in  order  to  win  DPR 
seats.  Thirty-eight  national  parties  contested  the  2009  elections,  and 
nine  of  those  parties  won  seats  in  the  DPR.  Since  2004  the  military 
and  police  no  longer  have  appointed  seats  in  any  legislative  body. 
Active  members  of  these  security  forces  were  still  disenfranchised  in 
2009  but  may  be  allowed  to  vote  beginning  in  2014. 

The  DPR  is  led  by  a  speaker  and  four  deputy  speakers  elected  by  and 
from  the  membership,  and  each  has  a  policy  portfolio.  Work  is  orga- 
nized through  11  permanent  commissions  (like  U.S.  congressional  com- 
mittees), each  with  specific  functional  areas  of  governmental  affairs 
corresponding  to  one  or  more  ministries,  and  a  budget  committee.  The 
DPR  also  has  other  bodies  that  specialize  in  interparliamentary  coopera- 
tion, the  legislative  agenda,  ethics  violations,  and  internal  financial  and 
administrative  management.  The  DPR  secretariat  includes  a  small 
research  unit  designed  to  provide  nonpartisan  information  to  members. 
Individual  members  have  only  one  or  two  staff  members,  who  primarily 
handle  administrative  tasks.  Commissions  also  have  a  limited  number  of 
staff,  mainly  for  administration.  Party  blocs  have  a  handful  of  profes- 
sional staff  supported  by  the  DPR  budget.  The  DPR's  budget  remains 
inadequate  to  support  a  professional  legislature,  and  employees  of  the 
secretariat  are  still  technically  civil  servants  in  the  Department  of  Home 
Affairs.

Government  and  Politics 


The  legislative  process  in  Indonesia  has  an  extraordinary  provision 
in  Article  20(2)  of  the  amended  1945  constitution,  which  requires 
bills  to  achieve  the  "joint  approval"  of  the  DPR  and  the  president  in 
order  to  become  law.  The  unique  twist  is  that  approval  by  the  presi- 
dent takes  place  as  part  of  the  legislative  committee  deliberations,  not 
when  the  bill  is  sent  to  the  president  for  signature.  Bills  may  be  initi- 
ated by  either  the  executive  or  the  DPR;  most  still  originate  in  the 
executive  branch.  The  president  must  issue  a  separate  "presidential 
mandate"  for  each  bill  to  the  relevant  cabinet  minister  to  represent  the 
executive  branch  in  legislative  deliberations.  Issuance  of  this  mandate 
is  normally  not  a  problem  when  the  government  initiates  a  bill  but 
can  be  when  the  DPR  is  the  initiating  branch.  Withholding  this  man- 
date in  essence  gives  the  president  a  veto  that  cannot  be  overridden 
by  the  DPR,  which  cannot  deliberate  on  a  bill  without  executive- 
branch  participation. 

Legislative  deliberations  generally  follow  a  four-step  process.  The 
first  two  of  the  four  steps  are  a  reading  of  the  bill  in  a  plenary  session 
by  a  representative  of  the  initiating  branch,  followed  by  a  formal 
response  from  the  other  branch.  In  the  third  step,  the  bill  is  referred  for 
further  discussion  and  amendment  to  one  of  the  permanent  commis- 
sions, or  often  instead  to  a  working  committee  (panitia  kerja  or panja) 
or  special  committee  {panitia  khusus  or  pansus)  formed  on  an  ad  hoc 
basis  for  the  purpose  of  addressing  that  bill.  This  step  is  the  locus  of 
the  achievement  of  joint  approval,  and  the  executive  branch  partici- 
pates directly  in  these  committee  deliberations  in  the  person  of  the  rel- 
evant minister  or  department  officials.  This  step  is  also  the  second 
source  of  the  president's  untrammeled  veto  power;  if  the  president 
withholds  approval  of  the  bill,  it  cannot  move  forward.  In  the  fourth 
step,  when  a  bill  has  achieved  joint  approval  in  committee,  it  goes 
back  to  the  plenary  session  for  a  final  vote.  The  approved  bill  then 
goes  to  the  president  for  signature;  Article  20(5)  of  the  constitution 
ensures  that  this  is  a  formality,  for  any  bill  not  signed  by  the  president 
within  30  days  of  its  approval  by  the  DPR  automatically  becomes  law. 
(The  president  cannot  exercise  a  veto  at  this  point,  as  there  is  not  a 
third  option  of  rejecting  the  bill  and  sending  it  back  to  the  DPR.) 
Occasionally,  circumstances  compel  the  president  to  issue  emergency 
regulations  rather  than  wait  for  this  lengthy  legislative  process  to  run 
its  course.  In  this  case,  during  the  legislative  session  immediately  fol- 
lowing the  issuance  of  such  regulations,  the  DPR  must  approve  them; 
lacking  such  approval,  they  must  be  revoked. 

DPR  deliberations  are  designed  to  produce  consensus.  It  is  the 
political  preference  of  the  leadership  to  avoid  overt  expressions  of 
opposition  or  less  than  complete  support.  This  practice  is  justified  by  a 
cultural  predisposition  to  avoid,  if  possible,  votes  in  which  majority- 


237 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

minority  opposing  positions  are  recorded.  If  votes  are  necessary,  how- 
ever, a  quorum  requires  a  two-thirds  majority.  On  issues  of  nomina- 
tion and  appointment,  voting  is  by  secret  ballot;  on  all  other  matters,  it 
is  by  a  show  of  hands. 

The  DPR  also  has  an  important  role  in  various  nonlegislative  mat- 
ters under  the  amended  constitution.  The  DPR  begins  the  impeachment 
process  by  approving  an  indictment  that  is  sent  to  the  Constitutional 
Court  for  trial.  The  DPR  must  approve  declarations  of  war  and  peace, 
treaties,  and  other  international  agreements  initiated  by  the  president.  It 
also  must  approve  the  president's  appointment  and  dismissal  of  the 
commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces,  the  national  police  chief,  and 
members  of  the  Judicial  Commission.  The  DPR  selects  members  of  the 
Finance  Audit  Board  (BPK)  and  three  of  the  nine  members  of  the  Con- 
stitutional Court;  it  also  approves  the  Judicial  Commission's  nomina- 
tions for  Supreme  Court  justices.  Finally,  the  president  must  consider 
the  DPR's  views  regarding  Indonesia's  ambassadors  to  other  countries, 
foreign  ambassadors  in  Indonesia,  and  the  granting  of  amnesties  and 
pardons.  In  one  of  the  few  remaining  vestiges  of  the  parliamentary 
characteristics  of  the  political  system  under  the  original  1945  constitu- 
tion, the  DPR  has  the  right  of  interpellation,  the  power  to  summon  the 
president  before  the  legislature  to  answer  questions.  In  practice,  how- 
ever, the  DPR  has  found  this  power  difficult  to  enforce. 

The  legislature  has  become  a  more  vibrant,  vocal  branch  of  gov- 
ernment with  increasing  pluralism  and  freedom  and  the  expansion  of 
the  DPR's  constitutional  authority.  Nonetheless,  most  legislation  still 
originates  in  the  executive  branch.  The  DPR  continues  to  lack  suffi- 
cient professional  research  staff — whether  attached  to  individual 
members,  party  blocs,  commissions,  or  the  legislature  as  a  whole — 
and  its  constituency-outreach  efforts  remain  limited  as  well.  The  leg- 
islative process  itself  remains  slow,  and  the  DPR  suffers  from  a 
backlog  of  proposed  bills  waiting  to  enter  the  process.  However, 
approximately  65  percent  of  the  members  elected  in  2009  were  new 
to  the  DPR,  and  even  among  those  reelected  there  is  a  group  inter- 
ested in  reforming  the  institution,  revising  the  standing  orders  to 
streamline  the  legislative  process,  and  expanding  the  DPR  budget  to 
give  it  the  resources  to  begin  to  study  policy  issues  and  draft  legisla- 
tion on  its  own. 

Regional  Representative  Council 

The  DPR's  less-powerful  partner  in  the  legislative  process  is  a 
body  established  in  October  2004  to  represent  regional  interests  at  the 
national  level:  the  Regional  Representative  Council  (DPD;  some- 
times referred  to  colloquially  as  the  Senate).  This  132-member  body

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

meets  on  the  same  calendar  as  the  DPR,  which  is  required  by  the  con- 
stitution to  hold  sessions  at  least  once  every  year.  Four  members  from 
each  province  are  elected  directly  by  voters  for  the  same  five-year 
term  as  the  DPR.  To  be  eligible  for  nomination  for  the  2004  election, 
candidates  could  not  be  affiliated  with  political  parties,  must  have 
collected  1,000  to  5,000  signatures  from  verified  registered  voters 
(depending  on  the  size  of  the  province),  and  must  have  resided  in  the 
province  for  five  years.  The  DPR  tried  to  strip  the  nonpartisan  and 
residency  requirements  for  the  2009  elections.  However,  the  DPD 
petitioned  the  Constitutional*  Court  to  overturn  this  decision  as  incon- 
sistent with  the  constitutional  intent  for  the  DPD;  the  court  sided  with 
the  DPD  and  restored  the  provincial-residency  requirement  but  ruled 
that  it  was  constitutional  to  allow  for  partisan  DPD  candidates.  Can- 
didates' photographs  appear  on  the  ballot  paper,  and  voters  are  eligi- 
ble to  vote  for  one  candidate;  the  four  candidates  with  the  highest 
vote  totals  win. 

The  DPD  is  led  by  a  speaker  and  two  deputy  speakers;  one  of  each 
of  the  three  leaders  represents  western,  central,  and  eastern  Indonesia. 
The  DPD  has  divided  itself  into  four  committees,  each  of  which  deals 
with  a  set  of  policy  areas.  Its  role  in  the  legislative  process  is  more 
indirect  than  and  subordinate  to  the  DPR's.  The  DPD  can  propose 
bills  to  the  DPR  in  the  areas  of  regional  autonomy;  center-region 
relations;  the  formation,  division,  and  merger  of  regions;  the  manage- 
ment of  natural  resources  and  other  economic  resources;  and  the 
financial  balance  between  the  center  and  the  regions.  The  constitution 
also  specifies  that  the  DPD  may  participate  in  the  deliberations 
regarding  bills  in  these  areas,  but  it  does  not  indicate  how  this  should 
happen,  leaving  that  up  to  the  two  bodies  to  negotiate.  The  DPD  must 
also  provide  its  opinion  to  the  DPR  on  the  state  budget  and  on  bills 
regarding  taxation,  education,  and  religion.  Finally,  the  DPD  has 
oversight  authority  related  to  all  of  these  policy  areas;  however,  it 
cannot  take  action  on  the  results  of  its  inquiries,  which  go  to  the  DPR 
for  further  action. 

One  of  the  first  acts  of  the  DPD  after  its  establishment  was  to 
begin  work  on  a  constitutional  amendment  to  increase  its  powers. 
Passage  of  any  amendments  requires  the  support  of  a  substantial  por- 
tion of  the  DPR,  and  it  is  not  likely  that  the  DPR  would  support  an 
amendment  that  would  require  it  to  share  legislative  power.  In  the 
2004  term,  the  proposal  failed  to  garner  sufficient  support,  but  a 
commission  has  been  established  to  study  the  issue,  and  it  was  likely 
the  DPD  would  try  again  in  the  2009  term.

Government  and  Politics 


People's  Consultative  Assembly 

No  longer  the  highest  constitutional  body,  the  People's  Consulta- 
tive Assembly  (MPR)  nonetheless  retains  important  roles  in  the  polit- 
ical process.  The  MPR  inaugurates  the  president  and  vice  president, 
has  the  final  say  in  the  impeachment  process,  and  remains  the  only 
body  permitted  to  amend  the  constitution.  The  "Broad  Outlines  of 
State  Policy,"  a  document  that  theoretically  established  policy  guide- 
lines for  the  next  five  years  and  was  subject  to  MPR  approval  during 
the  Suharto  years,  has  been  abolished  because  competing  presidential 
candidates  are  expected  to  present  their  policy  platforms  to  the  public 
during  the  campaign.  The  MPR  now  consists  solely  of  the  members 
of  the  DPR  and  DPD,  having  dropped  the  vague  "functional  group 
delegates"  as  part  of  the  constitutional  reform  process.  The  MPR  is 
led  by  a  speaker  (who  also  must  be  a  DPR  member)  and  four  deputy 
speakers,  two  each  from  the  DPR  and  the  DPD. 

The  Executive 

President  and  Vice  President 

Indonesia's  government  is  a  strong  presidential  system  with,  since 
2004,  significant  checks  and  balances  by  the  legislative  and  judicial 
branches  as  well  as  by  local  authorities.  The  president  and  vice  pres- 
ident are  directly  elected  as  a  ticket  for  a  five-year  term  in  a  two- 
round  system;  if  no  ticket  wins  a  simple  majority  in  the  first  round, 
the  two  tickets  that  received  the  most  votes  advance  to  the  second 
round.  The  winning  presidential  ticket  must  gain  at  least  20  percent 
of  the  vote  in  half  of  the  provinces.  A  president  is  limited  to  two 
terms  in  office.  The  only  qualifications  for  office  provided  in  the 
constitution  are  that  the  president  be  a  native-born  Indonesian  citi- 
zen, never  have  acquired  another  citizenship,  never  have  committed 
treason,  and  be  "spiritually  and  physically  capable"  of  the  office. 
Although  the  DPR  is  vested  with  primary  legislative  power,  the  pres- 
ident has  de  facto  veto  power  over  any  legislation,  with  no  possibil- 
ity of  override  by  the  DPR.  The  president  serves  as  the  supreme 
commander  of  the  armed  forces.  The  president  appoints  cabinet 
members,  with  no  requirement  for  legislative  confirmation. 

Between  1945  and  2009,  Indonesia  had  six  presidents:  Sukarno 
(1945-67),  Suharto  (1967-98),  Bacharuddin  J.  (B.  J.)  Habibie  (1998- 
99),  Abdurrahman  Wahid  (1999-2001;  also  known  as  Gus  Dur), 
Megawati  Sukarnoputri  (2001^1;  Sukarnoputri  means  "daughter  of 
Sukarno";  it  is  not  a  family  name),  and  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono 
(since  2004;  often  referred  to  as  SBY).  When  Suharto  was  forced  to 
resign  on  May  21,  1998,  Vice  President  Habibie  became  president 


241 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

and  immediately  announced  a  package  of  political  reforms  that 
included  new  legislative  elections  in  June  1999.  Although  Mega- 
wati's Indonesian  Democracy  Party-Struggle  (PDI-P)  won  a  plural- 
ity in  those  elections,  she  was  defeated  in  the  MPR  vote  for  president 
in  October  1999  by  Wahid  when  Habibie  withdrew  his  candidacy  fol- 
lowing a  vote  of  no  confidence.  The  MPR  then  elected  Megawati  as 
Wahid's  vice  president.  Two  years  later,  the  MPR  removed  Wahid 
from  office  following  allegations  of  corruption  and  incompetence, 
and  Megawati  became  president.  Yudhoyono  and  vice  presidential 
candidate  Muhammad  Yustif  Kalla  defeated  Megawati  and  three 
other  tickets  in  Indonesia's  first  direct  presidential  elections  in  July 
and  September  2004.  Yudhoyono  was  reelected,  this  time  running 
with  Bank  Indonesia  governor  Budiono,  in  one  round  in  July  2009. 

Although  the  vice  president  is  elected  on  a  ticket  with  the  president, 
the  question  of  their  relationship  is  a  political  issue.  This  is  in  part 
because  the  level  of  political  pluralism  forces  parties  and  candidates 
to  form  coalitions:  in  2004  Yudhoyono,  from  the  Democrat  Party 
(PD),  chose  Kalla  to  obtain  support  from  the  much  larger,  better  orga- 
nized, and  wealthier  Golkar  Party.  This  dynamic  became  even  more 
pronounced  two  months  after  they  were  inaugurated,  when  Kalla  was 
elected  Golkar  chairman  at  its  party  congress.  During  their  adminis- 
tration, Kalla  was  wont  on  occasion  to  take  a  different  stance  than 
Yudhoyono  on  certain  issues.  Although  privately  Yudhoyono  some- 
times admonished  Kalla  for  this  behavior,  in  public  he  insisted  that 
they  remained  a  solid  team.  Nonetheless,  in  early  2009  Yudhoyono 
began  to  distance  himself  from  Kalla,  signaling  his  intention  to  choose 
a  different  running  mate.  Following  the  April  2009  legislative  elec- 
tions, Yudhoyono  surprised  many  by  bucking  the  logic  of  party  coali- 
tions when  he  chose  the  technocratic,  nonpartisan  central  banker 
Budiono  as  his  vice  presidential  candidate;  nonetheless,  they  were 
easily  elected  with  60.8  percent  of  the  vote.  Kalla  was  unsuccessful  in 
forming  a  ticket  with  Megawati,  and  instead  ran  with  retired  General 
Wiranto,  coming  in  a  distant  third  place  with  12  percent.  Megawati 
and  retired  Lieutenant  General  Prabowo  Subianto,  Suharto's  former 
son-in-law,  placed  second  with  27  percent. 

The  Cabinet 

The  president  appoints  and  is  assisted  by  a  cabinet  of  ministers.  In 
October  2009,  Yudhoyono  named  his  second  "United  Indonesia"  cab- 
inet, with  34  ministers  representing  six  parties  (the  five  that  formed 
the  nominating  coalition  for  his  presidential  ticket  plus  Golkar). 
Twenty  departments  were  headed  by  ministers,  and  these  departments 
were  grouped  under  three  coordinating  ministers:  political,  legal,  and 


242 


Government  and  Politics 


security  affairs;  economic  affairs;  and  people's  welfare.  The  state  sec- 
retary, who  supports  the  president's  role  as  head  of  state,  also  was  a 
minister.  There  were  10  ministers  of  state,  that  is,  ministers  with  port- 
folios but  without  full  departments.  Yudhoyono  also  revived  the  use 
of  vice  ministers,  a  practice  allowed  by  law  since  2008,  appointing  1 1 
to  ministries  with  particularly  heavy  workloads.  Most  of  these  vice 
ministers  were  career  bureaucrats  rather  than  partisan  or  retired  mili- 
tary appointees.  In  addition  to  the  ministers,  two  high-ranking  state 
officials  were  accorded  cabinet  rank:  the  attorney  general  and  the 
cabinet  secretary. 

Specialized  Agencies 

Specialized  agencies  and  boards  at  the  central  government  level  are 
numerous  and  diverse.  They  include  the  National  Development  Plan- 
ning Board  (Bappenas),  the  National  Family  Planning  Coordinating 
Agency  (BKKBN),  the  Capital  Investment  Coordinating  Board 
(BKPM),  and  the  Agency  for  the  Study  and  Application  of  Technology 
(BPPT).  At  lower  levels  there  are  regional  planning  agencies,  invest- 
ment boards,  and  development  banks  under  the  aegis  of  the  central 
government. 

Presidential  Advisory  Council 

Article  16  of  the  amended  constitution  authorizes  the  president  to 
establish  an  advisory  council,  and  a  law  passed  in  2006  further  speci- 
fies this  provision.  Yudhoyono  established  the  nine-member  Presiden- 
tial Advisory  Council  in  2007,  but  in  2009  this  body  was  still  trying  to 
determine  what  its  role  would  be  in  relation  to  the  cabinet  and  the 
advisers  in  the  office  of  the  president.  The  larger  Supreme  Advisory 
Council  was  abolished  in  2002  by  the  Fourth  Amendment. 

The  Security  Forces 

Article  30  of  the  constitution  establishes  the  existence  of  the  Indo- 
nesian National  Armed  Forces  (TNI)  and  the  National  Police  of 
Indonesia  (Polri).  The  constitution  further  specifies  that  the  role  of 
the  military  is  national  defense,  and  the  role  of  the  police  is  public 
order  and  domestic  security.  However,  the  constitution  does  not 
explicitly  establish  the  principle  of  civilian  control  of  the  security 
forces,  leaving  this  matter  to  the  laws  on  the  military  and  police. 
Both  of  these  institutions  report  directly  to  the  president  rather  than 
through  a  cabinet  minister,  such  as  (for  the  military)  the  minister  of 
defense  or  (for  the  police)  the  minister  of  home  affairs  or  the  minis- 
ter of  justice  and  human  rights  (see  The  Armed  Forces  in  National 
Life;  The  National  Police,  ch.  5).

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 
The  Judiciary 

The  Indonesian  legal  system  is  extraordinarily  complex,  the  inde- 
pendent state  having  inherited  three  sources  of  law:  customary  or 
adat  law,  traditionally  the  basis  for  resolving  interpersonal  disputes  in 
the  village  environment;  Islamic  law  (sharia),  often  applied  to  dis- 
putes between  Muslims;  and  Dutch  colonial  law.  Adat  courts  were 
abolished  in  1951,  although  customary  means  of  dispute  resolution 
are  still  in  use  in  villages.  The  return  to  the  1945  constitution  in  1959 
meant  that  Dutch  laws  remained  in  force  except  as  subsequently 
altered  or  found  to  be  inconsistent  with  the  constitution.  A  criminal 
code  enacted  in  1981  expanded  the  legal  rights  of  criminal  defen- 
dants. The  government  in  2009  was  still  reviewing  its  legacy  of 
Dutch  civil  and  commercial  laws  in  an  effort  to  codify  them  in  Indo- 
nesian terms.  The  types  of  law  recognized  in  MPR  Decree  No.  3  of 
1999  include  the  constitution,  MPR  decrees,  statutes  passed  by  the 
DPR  and  ratified  by  the  president,  government  regulations  promul- 
gated by  the  president  to  implement  a  statute,  presidential  decisions 
to  implement  the  constitution  or  government  regulations,  other  imple- 
menting regulations  such  as  ministerial  regulations  and  instructions, 
and  local  (provincial  and  district)  regulations.  Obviously,  the  execu- 
tive enjoys  enormous  discretion  in  determining  what  is  law. 

Article  24  of  the  amended  constitution  states  that  judicial  power  shall 
be  vested  in  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Constitutional  Court,  and  subordi- 
nate courts  established  by  law,  and  that  the  organization  and  competence 
of  courts  shall  be  established  by  law.  In  Sukarno's  Guided  Democracy, 
the  justice  system  became  a  tool  of  the  revolution,  and  any  pretense  of 
an  independent  judiciary  was  abandoned.  Although  in  theory  one  of  the 
goals  of  the  New  Order  was  to  restore  the  rule  of  law,  in  practice  the 
judiciary  remained  both  corrupt  and  a  means  for  suppressing  political 
dissent.  Judicial  reform  was  thus  a  key  demand  of  the  1998  student 
movement  and  remains  one  of  the  most  important  items  on  the  political- 
reform  agenda.  Important  steps  were  taken  in  this  regard  as  part  of  the 
1999-2002  constitutional-amendment  process.  A  new  body,  the  Consti- 
tutional Court,  was  established  to  review  the  constitutionality  of  laws, 
resolve  disputes  among  the  various  branches  and  levels  of  government, 
have  final  say  in  the  dissolution  of  political  parties,  and  decide  disputes 
over  election  results.  The  Constitutional  Court  also  plays  a  role  in  the 
presidential-impeachment  process  by  issuing  a  verdict  on  an  indictment 
made  by  the  DPR.  The  court  has  nine  justices,  three  each  nominated  by 
the  Supreme  Court,  the  DPR,  and  the  president.  Justices  must  be  knowl- 
edgeable about  the  constitution  and  may  not  be  state  officials.  The  Con- 
stitutional Court  chief  justice  and  deputy  chief  justices  are  chosen  by 
and  from  among  the  justices. 


244 


Government  and  Politics 


The  judicial  branch  stands  coequal  with  the  executive  and  legisla- 
tive branches.  Justices  of  the  Supreme  Court  are  nominated  by  the 
independent  Judicial  Commission  for  approval  by  the  DPR  and  for- 
mal appointment  by  the  president.  The  chief  justice  and  deputy  chief 
justice  are  elected  by  and  from  among  the  justices.  Members  of  the 
Judicial  Commission  must  have  a  legal  background  or  experience 
and  are  appointed  and  dismissed  by  the  president  with  the  approval 
of  the  DPR.  The  Supreme  Court  has  exclusive  jurisdiction  in  dis- 
putes between  courts  of  the  different  court  systems  and  between 
courts  located  in  different  regions.  It  can  annul  decisions  of  high 
(appellate)  courts  on  points  of  law,  not  fact.  On  request,  it  can  give 
advisory  opinions  to  the  government  and  guidance  to  lower  courts. 
However,  its  powers  of  judicial  review  are  limited  to  decisions  on 
whether  administrative  regulations  and  local  regulations  conform  to 
the  laws  as  passed  by  the  DPR.  Another  reform  to  strengthen  the 
system  of  checks  and  balances  was  the  2004  shift  of  administrative 
and  financial  control  over  the  lower  courts  from  the  Department  of 
Justice  (now  called  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Human  Rights)  to 
the  Supreme  Court. 

Four  different  court  systems  operate  below  the  Supreme  Court. 
First,  there  are  courts  of  general  civil  and  criminal  jurisdiction.  Dis- 
trict courts  are  the  courts  of  first  instance.  High  courts  (at  the  provin- 
cial level)  are  appellate  courts.  Following  the  Dutch  legal  system, 
cases  are  decided  by  panels  of  judges  rather  than  juries.  Sources  of 
law  on  which  parties  to  a  dispute  may  base  their  claims  include: 
international  law  (to  date  rarely  used);  modern  Indonesian  civil  law, 
which  has  replaced  but  is  often  rooted  in  colonial-era  Roman-Dutch 
civil  law;  and  adat  (customary)  law,  which  differs  widely  among 
ethnic  groups  (see  Tradition  and  Multiethnicity,  ch.  2).  The  court 
system  remains  highly  corrupt,  with  verdicts  in  both  civil  and  crimi- 
nal cases  influenced  by  bribery  by  both  plaintiffs  and  defendants. 
Although  judicial  reform  is  key  to  consolidating  democracy  and 
establishing  a  more  favorable  investment  climate,  efforts  at  judicial 
reform  have  so  far  been  half-hearted  and  largely  ineffective. 

Second,  religious  courts  exist  throughout  Indonesia  to  resolve  dis- 
putes between  Muslims  in  matters  of  marriage,  divorce,  inheritance, 
and  gifts.  These  district-level  courts  base  their  decisions  on  Islamic 
law.  As  in  the  secular  court  system,  religious  high  courts  are  appellate 
courts  at  the  provincial  level.  One  of  the  persistent  tensions  between 
Muslims  and  the  state  arises  from  efforts  to  expand  the  jurisdiction  of 
the  religious  courts. 

Third,  the  state  administrative  court  system  resolves  matters  pertain- 
ing to  the  decisions  of  government  officials.  In  addition,  the  Taxation 


245 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Review  Board  adjudicates  taxation  disputes.  Other  administrative 
courts  were  eliminated  as  part  of  the  government's  effort  to  simplify 
and  standardize  the  court  system. 

Fourth,  military  courts  have  jurisdiction  over  TNI  members.  After 
the  1965  coup  attempt,  temporary  special  military  courts  were  given 
authority  to  try  military  personnel  and  civilians  alleged  to  be  involved 
in  the  abortive  coup  (see  The  Coup  and  Its  Aftermath,  1965-66,  ch.  1). 
Hundreds  of  sentences  ranging  from  20  years'  imprisonment  to  death 
were  meted  out  by  the  special  military  courts,  with  executions  occur- 
ring more  than  two  decades  after  the  event.  The  DPR  has  included  a 
provision  in  a  draft  military  law  that  would  require  all  military  person- 
nel accused  of  nonmilitary  crimes  to  be  investigated  by  civilian  prose- 
cutors and  tried  by  the  civil  court  system.  The  military  leadership 
opposed  this  provision,  and  it  is  still  being  debated. 

Another  court,  the  Corruption  Crimes  Court  (Tipikor  Court),  was 
established  in  2003  to  confront  widespread  corruption  in  Indonesia, 
especially  in  cases  of  financial  loss  to  the  state  and  as  a  deterrent  to 
future  corruption.  In  2006,  however,  the  Constitutional  Court  ruled 
that  the  Tipikor  had  no  legal  basis  and  gave  the  DPR  and  the  govern- 
ment until  December  2009  to  pass  a  law  to  justify  the  court's  contin- 
ued existence.  Tipikor  was  allowed  to  continue  to  function  during 
this  period,  and  in  September  2009  the  DPR  complied  with  appropri- 
ate enabling  legislation,  thus  ensuring  the  court's  constitutionality. 

Independent  Bodies 

The  Finance  Audit  Board  is  specified  in  Chapter  VIILA  of  the  con- 
stitution as  an  independent  body  existing  at  both  the  national  and  pro- 
vincial levels  to  conduct  official  examinations  of  the  government's 
finances.  The  board  reports  to  the  DPR  and  DPD,  which  approve  the 
national  budget,  and  to  each  Regional  People's  Representative  Coun- 
cil (DPRD),  the  legislative  body  that  approves  the  budget  at  the  pro- 
vincial, municipality,  or  regency  level  of  government.  The  board's 
members  are  chosen  by  the  DPR  with  nonbinding  input  by  the  DPD. 

The  constitution  established  a  number  of  independent  bodies 
besides  the  Finance  Audit  Board  and  the  Judicial  Commission.  In 
Article  22E(5),  the  constitution  requires  that  elections  shall  be  man- 
aged by  an  independent  commission.  The  electoral  law  established  the 
General  Elections  Commission  (KPU),  whose  members  are  nomi- 
nated by  the  president  and  chosen  by  the  DPR  following  a  hearing  and 
confirmation  process  called  in  Indonesia  a  "fit  and  proper  test."  One 
weakness  of  this  system,  as  with  the  selection  process  for  many  other 
bodies  in  Indonesia,  is  that  the  president  nominates  multiple  candi- 
dates for  each  position  on  the  commission,  from  which  the  DPR  is  free

Government  and  Politics 


to  select.  Nominating  multiple  rather  than  single  candidates  makes  the 
process  much  more  vulnerable  to  favoritism  and  corruption,  and  in 
fact  the  DPR  was  widely  criticized  for  choosing  inexperienced  over 
much  more  qualified  candidates  in  its  selections  of  KPU  commission- 
ers in  2007.  In  Article  23D,  the  constitution  also  established  a  central 
bank,  known  as  Bank  Indonesia  (see  Monetary  and  Exchange-Rate 
Policy,  ch.  3).  The  constitution  only  establishes  the  existence  of  the 
bank,  leaving  all  of  the  details  on  its  composition,  status,  authority, 
accountability  and  independence  to  the  central  bank  law. 

Local  Government 

Government  administration  operates  through  descending  levels  of 
administrative  subunits.  Indonesia  is  made  up  of  33  provinces  and  spe- 
cial regions  (each  led  by  a  governor),  up  from  27  at  the  end  of  the  New 
Order  in  1998,  as  some  provinces  were  subdivided,  a  process  that  may 
yet  continue.  There  are  two  special  regions  (daerah  istimewa;  Aceh 
and  Yogyakarta)  and  one  special  capital-city  region  (daerah  khusus; 
Jakarta).  The  30  provinces  (propinsi),  in  turn,  are  subdivided  into  dis- 
tricts, called  municipalities  (kota,  led  by  a  mayor)  in  urban  areas  and 
regencies  (kabupaten,  led  by  a  regent  or  bupati)  in  rural  areas,  and 
below  that  into  subdistricts  (kecamatan,  led  by  a  camat).  At  the  lowest 
tier  of  the  administrative  hierarchy  is  the  village  (desa).  According  to 
the  Department  of  Home  Affairs,  Indonesia  in  2009  had  348  regen- 
cies, 91  municipalities,  5,263  subdistricts,  and  66,979  villages. 

The  New  Order  was  a  highly  centralized  system,  but  subnational 
governance  has  undergone  significant  change  since  1999.  In  that 
year,  the  Habibie  administration  introduced  two  new  laws  collec- 
tively known  as  "regional  autonomy  policy,"  one  on  regional  gover- 
nance and  the  other  on  the  financial  relationship  between  the  center 
and  the  regions.  This  policy  was  further  codified  between  1999  and 
2002  in  amendments  to  Chapter  VI  of  the  1945  constitution.  In  2004 
revised  regional  autonomy  laws  replaced  the  1999  laws.  This  entire 
legal  framework  remains  based  on  Indonesia  as  a  unitary  state.  Since 
the  Dutch-imposed  RIS  in  1949-50,  federalism  has  been  anathema  to 
Indonesian  politicians  and  the  public.  At  the  end  of  the  1945^19  war, 
as  part  of  the  negotiations  over  the  terms  of  independence,  the  Dutch 
insisted  that  the  nationalist  Republic  of  Indonesia  join  with  the  vari- 
ous puppet  states  they  had  established  around  the  archipelago  to  form 
the  RIS.  Nationalists  saw  this  action  as  an  attempt  to  maintain  indi- 
rect Dutch  control  over  Indonesia,  and  Sukarno  ended  the  federal 
experiment  only  eight  months  later.  One  of  the  initial  agreements  in 
1999,  at  the  outset  of  the  constitutional  amendment  process,  was  to 
maintain  Indonesia  as  a  unitary  state,  as  it  has  been  since  1950.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesia,  nonetheless,  now  enjoys  a  level  of  political  decentraliza- 
tion greater  even  than  some  federal  systems.  Regional  autonomy 
reserves  six  policy  areas  to  the  central  government:  foreign  relations, 
national  defense,  internal  security,  justice,  monetary  policy,  and  religion. 
All  other  policy  areas  are  primarily  handled  by  provincial  and  district 
governments,  with  the  central  government's  role  limited  to  interregional 
coordination,  setting  service-delivery  standards,  and  providing  block 
grants.  The  1999  laws  bypassed  the  provincial  governments  and  made 
district  governments  the  primary  locus  of  decentralized  authority.  This 
was  because,  at  the  time,  the  6verriding  concern  was  that  the  unfolding 
democratic  transition  might  lead  to  the  breakup  of  the  nation,  as  had 
happened  in  Yugoslavia  and  the  Soviet  Union.  The  assumption  was  that 
districts  would  not  have  the  size,  resources,  or  distinctive  ethnic  identity 
sufficient  to  mount  a  separatist  challenge  to  the  center.  This  concern  had 
receded  significantly  by  the  2004  legal  reforms,  and  provincial  govern- 
ments regained  some  measure  of  authority. 

Service  design,  planning,  and  delivery  are  concentrated  at  the  pro- 
vincial and  district  levels,  although  these  subnational  authorities  do  not 
have  the  power  to  raise  much  revenue  on  their  own.  Taxation  remains 
primarily  the  prerogative  of  the  central  government,  which  then  pro- 
vides block  grants  to  local  authorities.  The  size  of  these  grants  for  each 
province  or  district  is  determined  by  a  complex  formula  that  takes  into 
account  the  geographic  size,  population,  and  natural  resource  base  of 
each  unit.  Although  provinces  and  districts  rich  in  natural  resources 
cannot  keep  all  of  the  revenues  associated  with  those  resources,  they 
receive  a  much  higher  share  than  under  the  New  Order. 

Another  reform  introduced  in  the  revised  regional  autonomy  laws 
of  2004  is  that  governors,  mayors,  and  bupatis  are  now  directly 
elected  for  the  first  time  in  Indonesia's  history.  Under  the  New  Order, 
they  had  been  appointed  by  the  central  government,  and  beginning  in 
1999  they  were  elected  by  the  local  assembly.  Since  2005,  as  the 
terms  of  these  local  chief  executives  expired,  elections  for  their 
replacements  for  five-year  terms  have  occurred  on  a  rolling  basis. 
Despite  fears  of  administrative  chaos,  fraud,  or  violence,  these  local 
elections  have  generally  proceeded  smoothly,  as  was  the  case  with  the 
national  elections  of  1999,  2004,  and  2009. 

Parallel  to  their  chief  executives,  each  province,  municipality,  and 
regency  also  has  a  local  assembly,  similar  to  the  DPR,  called  the 
Regional  People's  Representative  Council  (DPRD).  These  councils 
range  in  size  from  20  to  100  members,  depending  on  the  administra- 
tive level  and  the  population  of  the  region.  They  are  elected  at  the  same 
time  as  the  DPR  and  for  the  same  five-year  term,  which  means  that  the 
terms  of  the  regional  assemblies  and  their  corresponding  regional  chief 
executives  are  never  the  same.  The  DPRDs  have  powers  similar  to  the

DPR:  approving  the  regional  government  budget,  passing  regional 
statutes,  and  providing  oversight  of  the  regional  government. 

Five  provincial-level  units  have  special  status,  in  addition  to  the 
devolution  of  power  to  all  provinces  under  regional  autonomy.  Aceh 
and  Papua  (which  was  divided  in  two  in  2005),  the  two  remaining 
provincial-level  units  with  active  separatist  movements  once  East 
Timor  separated  from  Indonesia  in  1999,  were  granted  "special  auton- 
omy." Jakarta  and  Yogyakarta  have  "special-region"  status,  although 
in  practice  they  are  not  much  different  from  other  provinces.  The 
main  difference  in  Jakarta  is  that  its  five  municipalities,  while  they 
have  mayors,  do  not  have  corresponding  assemblies  (the  only  assem- 
bly is  at  the  provincial  level).  In  Yogyakarta  the  primary  difference  is 
that  the  sultan  of  the  larger  of  the  two  palaces  or  kr atoms  (in  2009, 
Sultan  Hamengkubuwono  X)  automatically  becomes  governor. 

Indonesia's  experience  in  East  Timor  (Timor  Timur  Province) — in 
the  course  of  which  President  Habibie  offered  the  province  a  referen- 
dum on  special  autonomy,  Timorese  voters  defeated  that  referendum, 
and  Indonesia  was  forced  to  acknowledge  its  independence — raised 
concerns  for  the  government  that  this  would  set  an  example  for  other 
provinces.  This  fear  has  turned  out  to  be  largely  unjustified,  however,  as 
no  significant  new  separatist  movements  appeared  in  any  provinces 
where  they  did  not  already  exist  prior  to  1999.  The  main  domestic 
impact  of  Timor-Leste's  independence  was  to  somewhat  exacerbate 
existing  separatist  sentiments  in  Aceh  and  Papua.  In  Aceh  in  particular, 
a  student-led  group  called  the  Aceh  Referendum  Information  Center 
(SIRA)  sprang  up  not  long  after  Habibie's  offer  to  East  Timor  and 
posted  banners  in  the  province  calling  for  a  referendum.  Nonetheless, 
Aceh  subsequently  turned  its  focus  to  special  autonomy  and  various 
peace  negotiations  (see  Separatist  Rebellions,  ch.  5).  In  Papua  the  idea 


249 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

of  a  UN-administered  referendum  reminded  many  of  the  region's  own 
decolonization  process  in  the  1960s,  the  legitimacy  of  which  is  still 
questioned  by  many  Papuans.  As  in  Aceh,  however,  the  focus  in  Papua 
then  turned  to  a  debate  over  special  autonomy 

Aceh 

The  Special  Region  of  Aceh  (called  Nanggroe  Aceh  Darussalam, 
meaning  the  State  of  Aceh,  Abode  of  Peace,  from  1999  to  2009),  in 
northwestern  Sumatra,  is  the  area  of  Indonesia  where  the  Islamic 
character  of  the  population  is  the  most  pronounced.  The  Acehnese 
demand  for  autonomy,  expressed  in  support  for  the  1950s  Darul 
Islam  rebellion,  was  partially  met  by  the  central  government's  accep- 
tance of  a  "special-region"  status  for  the  province  in  1959,  allowing 
a  higher-than-usual  official  Indonesian  respect  for  Islamic  law  and 
custom.  This  special-region  status,  together  with  growing  prosperity, 
brought  Aceh  into  the  Indonesian  mainstream.  Nevertheless,  in  the 
early  twenty-first  century  the  idea  of  an  independent  state  was  kept 
alive  by  the  Free  Aceh  Movement  (GAM).  Thought  to  have  been 
crushed  in  the  mid-1970s,  the  guerrilla  campaign  of  the  insurgents, 
under  the  leadership  of  Swedish-based  Hasan  di  Tiro  and  with  Lib- 
yan support,  renewed  its  hit-and-run  warfare  in  the  late  1980s,  hop- 
ing to  build  on  economic  and  social  grievances.  The  military  reacted 
with  crushing  force  but  never  was  able  to  defeat  the  separatists  fully. 

President  Habibie's  offer  in  1999  to  revive  the  railroad  from 
Medan  in  Sumatera  Utara  Province  to  Aceh's  capital,  Banda  Aceh, 
and  other  economic-development  projects  in  exchange  for  Acehnese 
loyalty  to  Jakarta  was  seen  as  a  continuation  of  the  patronizing,  cen- 
tralistic  politics  of  the  New  Order.  Habibie's  policy  on  East  Timor 
led  to  growing  calls  among  Acehnese  civilians  for  a  similar  referen- 
dum. In  response,  the  central  government  hurriedly  passed  a  new 
law  updating  Aceh's  "special-autonomy"  status,  including  particu- 
larly the  right  to  incorporate  elements  of  Islamic  law  into  local  legal 
codes,  which  had  not  actually  been  a  demand  of  most  Acehnese. 
President  Wahid  involved  international  participants  in  resolution  of 
the  conflict  for  the  first  time  by  inviting  the  Geneva-based  Henri 
Dunant  Centre  for  Humanitarian  Dialogue  to  help  mediate  a  Cessa- 
tion of  Hostilities  Agreement  (COHA).  Although  Vice  President 
Megawati  was  not  particularly  supportive  of  this  policy,  she  allowed 
the  process  to  continue  after  she  became  president  in  July  200 1 ,  and 
the  COHA  was  signed  in  December  2002.  Nonetheless,  by  May 
2003  the  agreement  had  broken  down.  President  Megawati  declared 
martial  law  in  Aceh  and  unleashed  the  military  once  again. 


250 


Government  and  Politics 


The  military  had  much  more  success  than  previously  in  breaking  up 
GAM  cells,  but  it  still  could  not  achieve  final  victory.  Following  her 
party's  defeat  in  the  legislative  elections  of  April  2004,  Megawati 
lifted  martial  law  in  May.  In  December  2004,  a  massive  earthquake 
and  tsunami  struck  Aceh,  following  which  both  the  government  under 
newly  elected  President  Yudhoyono  and  the  rebels  returned  to  the 
negotiating  table,  this  time  with  facilitation  by  former  Finnish  presi- 
dent Martti  Ahtisaari  through  his  nongovernmental  organization  Crisis 
Management  Initiative.  A  memorandum  of  understanding  detailing 
the  peace  agreement  was  signed  in  August  2005  and  began  to  be 
implemented  in  September.  A  joint  civilian  effort  between  the  Euro- 
pean Union  (EU)  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations 
(ASEAN),  called  the  Aceh  Monitoring  Mission,  monitored  the  entire 
process.  Ahtisaari  was  awarded  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  in  2008,  in  part 
for  his  efforts  in  Aceh. 

For  its  part,  GAM  relinquished  the  goal  of  independence,  and  its 
fighters  were  demobilized  and  their  arms  destroyed  in  public  ceremo- 
nies between  September  and  December  2005.  The  central  government 
withdrew  some  military  forces  and  paramilitary  police  units  from  the 
province.  Funds  were  set  up  to  provide  cash  or  land  (or  both)  to  vari- 
ous categories  of  demobilized  GAM  ex-combatants  and  supporters,  as 
well  as  (in  a  controversial  move)  pro-Indonesian  militias,  and  training 
programs  were  established  to  provide  job  skills.  A  new  law  on  gover- 
nance in  Aceh  replaced  the  special-autonomy  law,  and  direct  elections 
for  governor,  mayors,  and  bupatis  occurred  in  December  2006.  GAM 
formally  dissolved  itself  in  January  2006,  but  remnants  may  remain. 
A  GAM-affiliated  ticket  running  as  independents,  Irwandi  Yusuf  and 
Muhammad  Nazar  (the  former  leader  of  SIRA),  were  elected  as  gov- 
ernor and  vice  governor,  respectively,  and  GAM-affiliated  candidates 
also  won  in  11  of  the  19  districts  holding  elections  (in  two  of  the  21 
districts  the  bupatis  term  had  not  yet  expired).  Acehnese  were  also 
allowed  to  form  local  political  parties,  unlike  in  the  remainder  of  the 
country,  to  contest  the  2009  special-region  and  district  legislative 
elections.  Although  the  Aceh-Nias  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction 
Agency  (BRR),  set  up  in  the  wake  of  the  tsunami,  was  dissolved  in 
early  2009,  the  central  government  and  international  donors  remain 
heavily  invested  in  reinforcing  the  peace  process  and  supporting 
reconstruction  in  Aceh. 

Papua 

Papua — formerly  called  at  various  times  Irian  Jaya,  West  Irian,  West 
Papua,  Dutch  New  Guinea,  and  West  New  Guinea — remained  under 
Dutch  control  after  Indonesian  independence  in  1949.  A  combination 


251 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

of  Indonesian  political  and  military  pressure  and  international  efforts 
led  to  an  October  1962  Dutch  transfer  of  sovereignty  to  the  UN  Tem- 
porary Executive  Authority,  which  was  supported  by  a  military  obser- 
vation force  that  oversaw  the  cease-fire.  In  May  1963,  the  UN  gave 
Indonesia  full  administrative  control.  After  a  controversial  1969  "Act 
of  Free  Choice,"  the  territory,  which  the  Indonesians  called  Irian  Barat 
(West  Irian)  until  1972,  was  integrated  into  the  republic  as  Indonesia's 
twenty-sixth  province  and  later  renamed  Irian  Jaya  (Victorious  Irian). 
In  2000,  in  a  vain  attempt  to  dampen  separatist  sentiments,  President 
Wahid  renamed  the  province  Papua.  In  a  move  widely  perceived  in 
Papua  as  an  effort  to  divide  and  conquer,  President  Megawati  in  2003 
set  in  motion  a  tortuous  three-year  process  by  which  the  northwestern 
portion  was  split  off  to  form  the  new  province  of  Irian  Jaya  Barat  (West 
Irian  Jaya),  with  the  eastern  two-thirds  retaining  the  name  Papua.  (Irian 
Jaya  Barat  was  renamed  Papua  Barat  in  2007.)  Further  division  of  the 
rump  Papua  was  blocked  at  the  time,  although  various  proposals  for  as 
many  as  four  new  provinces  remain  in  circulation.  Rich  in  natural 
resources,  this  is  Indonesia's  least  densely  populated  region.  The  cen- 
tral government's  efforts  to  exploit  these  resources  and  to  assimilate 
indigenous  Papuans,  who  are  racially  Melanesian,  into  the  national 
administration  and  culture  have  met  with  sporadic  armed  resistance 
from  the  Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM)  and  have  aroused  interna- 
tional concerns. 

Although  the  OPM  is  a  marginal  domestic  actor,  more  visible  as 
an  international  symbol,  the  fact  of  its  existence  has  been  used  by  the 
central  government  to  justify  suspicions  about  Papuan  loyalties  and 
an  intimidating  Indonesian  military  presence  in  the  region,  leading  to 
human-rights  abuses.  Cultural  differences  between  Indonesians  and 
the  indigenous  population,  and  complaints  about  the  "Indonesianiza- 
tion"  of  Papua,  have  exacerbated  tensions.  The  cultural  conflict  is 
aggravated  by  resentment  of  racially  Malay  in-migrants  (Javanese, 
Buginese,  Bataks,  and  other  groups)  from  other  parts  of  Indonesia, 
who  dominate  the  state  bureaucracy  and  urban  economies.  Despite 
human-rights  abuses  and  ethnic  tensions,  charges  by  some  interna- 
tional activists  that  the  central  government  is  waging  genocide  in 
Papua  are  overblown. 

As  in  Aceh,  the  central  government  has  responded  to  unrest  in 
Papua  with  both  repression  and  a  new  "special-autonomy"  law.  This 
law,  passed  in  December  2002,  provided  for  a  much  greater  share  of 
Papua's  natural  resource  wealth  to  return  to  the  region  as  block  grants 
and  specifies  that  these  funds  should  prioritize  the  infrastructure,  edu- 
cation, and  health  sectors.  The  law  also  provided  for  the  establishment 
of  a  special  upper  house  of  the  local  legislature,  the  Papuan  People's 


252 


Government  and  Politics 


Council  (MRP).  This  body  consists  of  representatives  of  religious 
leaders,  traditional  (adat)  leaders,  and  women.  The  MRP  is  involved 
in  all  decisions  regarding  special  autonomy,  in  any  proposals  to  subdi- 
vide Papua,  and  in  vetting  candidates  for  governor,  mayor,  and  bupati 
to  ensure  that  they  are  native  Papuans.  Implementation  of  this  law  has 
been  slow  and  partial.  The  enhanced  fiscal  resources  began  to  flow  to 
the  region  immediately,  but  without  local-government  capacity  to  use 
these  funds  properly,  much  has  been  wasted  in  corruption  or  inappro- 
priate projects.  The  MRP  did  not  form  until  November  2005  and  was 
immediately  thrust  into  the  uncomfortable  position  of  having  to  rule 
on  the  formation  of  the  new  province  of  Irian  Jaya  Barat  and  guberna- 
torial candidates  in  both  provinces.  In  February  2006,  the  first  direct 
elections  for  governor  proceeded  in  both  Irian  Jaya  Barat  and  Papua, 
despite  continued  controversy  regarding  the  sheer  existence  of  the 
new  province.  At  first  the  provincial  government  of  Irian  Jaya  Barat 
did  not  receive  special-autonomy  funds  (instead  relying  for  its  exis- 
tence solely  on  support  provided  by  the  central  government),  but  in 
July  2008  the  DPR  passed  a  law  mandating  that  special  autonomy 
also  be  implemented  fully  in  the  renamed  Papua  Barat. 

Problems  in  Papua  have  implications  for  Indonesia's  foreign  rela- 
tions as  well,  particularly  with  neighboring  Papua  New  Guinea  and 
Australia.  The  border  crossing  with  Papua  New  Guinea  on  the  north 
coast  near  Jayapura  reopened  in  late  2005,  but  relations  with  Austra- 
lia soured  after  it  granted  42  Papuan  boat  people  temporary  protec- 
tion visas  in  March  2006.  Despite  resolution  of  the  separatist  conflicts 
in  East  Timor  and  Aceh,  albeit  via  very  different  outcomes,  it  is  likely 
that  problems  in  Papua  will  continue  to  fester  for  many  years,  as  the 
central  government  does  not  yet  seem  serious  about  addressing  issues 
there  in  a  systematic  manner. 

Political  Culture 

Following  the  constitutional  amendments  of  1999  to  2002,  the 
reformed  Indonesian  political  system  is  characterized  by  a  set  of 
institutions  labeled  a  "difficult  combination"  in  many  other  coun- 
tries: a  powerful  presidency  and  multiparty  politics.  There  is  a  fixed 
term  for  the  president  as  well  as  separate  popular  elections,  and  thus 
roughly  equal  democratic  legitimacy,  for  the  president  and  the 
national  legislature.  Some  of  the  dangers  inherent  in  this  system  are 
divided  government,  in  which  the  presidency  and  the  legislature  are 
controlled  by  different  political  parties,  and  the  possibility  of  elect- 
ing as  president  a  political  outsider  who  has  no  experience  forging 
political  compromises  in  the  legislature.  These  dangers  are  exacer- 
bated in  a  multiparty  polity,  in  which  the  likelihood  of  a  single  party 


253 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

controlling  the  legislature  is  much  lower  than  in  a  two-party  system. 
Under  this  difficult  combination  of  institutions,  deadlock  can  occur 
between  the  president  and  the  legislature,  leading  one  or  both  to  be 
tempted  to  use  extra-constitutional  means  to  break  the  deadlock. 
When  that  occurs,  democracy  itself  can  be  threatened. 

The  strong  presidential  system  tends  to  be  associated  with  much 
more  of  a  "winner-take-aH"  political  culture  than  has  been  evident  in 
Indonesia  since  1999.  One  of  the  hallmarks  of  the  new  Indonesian 
democracy  is  that  although  its  institutions  are  strongly  presidential, 
many  of  its  practices  are  much  more  common  in  multiparty  parlia- 
mentary government,  including  numerous  possible  inclusionary 
coalitions  as  well  as  consensus-based  decision  making.  These  inclu- 
sionary and  consensual  practices  have  contributed  positively  to  mak- 
ing the  blending  of  a  strong  presidency  with  multiparty  politics 
function  fairly  well  so  far  in  Indonesia.  This  style  of  governance  can 
be  linked  to  other  political  cultures  in  Indonesia,  particularly  Java- 
nese and  Islamic,  as  well  as  to  the  cultural  roots  of  Pancasila. 

Inclusionary  Coalitions 

The  Indonesian  political  party  system  is  as  highly  fragmented  after 
the  2009  elections  as  it  was  in  the  1950s.  According  to  the  Laakso- 
Taagepera  Index  (see  Glossary),  there  are  6.1  "effective"  political 
parties  in  the  2009  DPR  versus  6.4  in  the  legislature  following  the 
1955  elections.  Nonetheless,  all  of  the  major  parties  (and  even  most 
of  the  minor  ones)  cluster  around  the  middle  of  the  political  spectrum. 
Thus,  although  the  contemporary  party  system  is  equally  fragmented, 
it  is  less  polarized  than  in  the  1950s.  At  that  time,  on  the  right  end  of 
the  spectrum,  both  of  the  two  major  Muslim-based  parties — Nahd- 
latul  Ulama  and  the  Consultative  Council  of  Indonesian  Muslims 
(Masyumi) — were  Islamist,  favoring  the  implementation  of  Islamic 
law.  Now,  of  the  four  major  Muslim-based  parties,  only  two  are  Isla- 
mist, and  only  one  of  these  as  a  matter  of  principle,  the  other  out  of 
political  expediency.  The  other  two  parties  take  a  much  more  moder- 
ate stance  (see  Muslim  Parties,  this  ch.).  On  the  left  end  of  the  spec- 
trum, in  the  1950s  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party  (PKI)  was  the 
most  organized  and  grassroots-based  of  all  the  major  parties,  and  was 
the  largest  communist  party  outside  of  the  Soviet  bloc  and  China. 
There  is  no  radical  leftist  equivalent  in  the  contemporary  Indonesian 
party  system.  In  1999  the  Democratic  People's  Party  (PRD),  which 
was  the  only  party  to  include  a  hammer  and  sickle  in  its  symbol,  won 
barely  0.1  percent  of  the  national  vote,  and  its  founder,  Budiman 
Sujatmiko,  joined  the  national  leadership  board  of,  and  in  2009  was 
elected  to,  the  DPR  from  Megawati's  PDI-P.

The  consequence  of  this  clustering  around  the  middle  in  the  con- 
temporary party  system  is  that  parties  mainly  compete  for  political 
spoils  rather  than  act  on  a  programmatic  basis.  Coalition-building  is 
thus  a  key  element  in  determining  political  prosperity  and  even  sur- 
vival. High  fragmentation  means  that  in  order  to  build  even  a  signif- 
icant bloc  of  votes  (much  less  an  outright  majority),  the  coalition 
often  must  include  several  partners.  Low  polarization  means  that  all 
three  major  and  six  smaller  parties  are  potential  coalition  partners 
with  each  other.  Both  of  these  rules  have  proven  to  hold  in  Indone- 
sia. With  decentralization  and  the  inauguration  of  direct  election  of 
governors,  mayors,  and  bupatis  beginning  in  2005,  there  are  now 
hundreds  of  examples  from  around  the  nation  of  numerous,  shifting 
coalitions  being  formed  based  on  parties'  local  strength,  even  if 
these  local  coalitions  often  do  not  match  the  parties'  political  posi- 
tions at  the  national  level.  The  two  parties  that  are  farthest  apart  on 
the  political  spectrum — the  strongly  secular  PDI-P  and  the  fervently 
Islamist  Prosperous  Justice  Party  (PKS) — have  even  formed  local 
coalitions  when  it  suited  their  needs. 

The  coalition  pattern  at  the  national  level  has  set  the  tone  for  these 
local  alliances.  The  presidential  election  process  in  the  MPR  in  1999 
saw  intense  jockeying  among  most  of  the  parties  other  than  the  PDI-P 
in  a  successful  effort  to  deny  front-runner  Megawati  the  presidency. 
The  newly  elected  president,  Abdurrahman  Wahid,  then  surprised 
some  of  these  erstwhile  supporters  by  reaching  out  to  Megawati  and 
supporting  her  nomination  for  vice  president,  which  she  accepted. 
Their  first  cabinet  included  ministers  from  all  five  major  parties,  and 
this  pattern  was  maintained  throughout  subsequent  reshuffles  and 
Megawati's  rise  to  the  presidency  in  2001.  Prior  to  the  2004  legislative 
elections,  most  parties  did  not  reveal  their  preferred  presidential  candi- 
date in  order  to  maximize  their  coalitional  possibilities  in  the  first 
round  of  the  direct  presidential  elections  later  in  the  year.  That  election 
included  some  strange  bedfellows,  such  as  former  military  commander 
General  Wiranto,  accused  by  many  of  human-rights  abuses  in  the  1998 
transition  and  the  1999  East  Timor  referendum,  gaining  support  from 
former  President  Wahid  (a  long-time  human-rights  activist)  once  the 
latter  was  disqualified  from  becoming  a  candidate  himself.  Wahid's 
brother  Salahuddin  Wahid  even  resigned  from  the  National  Human 
Rights  Commission  to  be  Wiranto 's  running  mate.  The  coalitions 
shifted  again  for  the  second  round,  with  the  parties  behind  the  three 
losing  tickets  having  to  support  either  Megawati  or  Susilo  Bambang 
Yudhoyono.  The  inclusionary  pattern  broke  down  briefly  following 
Yudhoyono's  election,  when  Golkar,  the  PDI-P,  the  National  Awaken- 
ing Party  (PKB),  and  the  Reform  Star  Party  (PBR)  formed  the  National

Front  and  took  all  DPR  leadership  positions  for  themselves.  The 
exception  proved  the  rule,  however,  as  this  maneuver  was  perceived  as 
inappropriate,  and  within  weeks  the  committee  leaderships  had  been 
reshuffled  to  include  all  parties.  In  addition,  Yudhoyono's  first  cabinet 
even  included  some  figures  affiliated  with  some  of  the  National  Front 
parties,  creating  links  "across  the  aisle,"  even  if  these  people  tended  to 
be  marginal  within  their  parties  and  were  not  officially  representing 
their  parties  in  the  cabinet.  Yudhoyono  also  worked  assiduously  to 
bring  more  and  more  of  those  parties  over  into  his  camp,  leaving  the 
PDI-P  as  the  only  steadfast  opposition  to  his  administration. 

This  inclusionary  political  culture  was  less  prominent  during  the 
2009  presidential  elections  but,  after  those  elections,  once  again 
returned  to  the  fore.  Despite  Golkar's  position  as  the  second-largest 
party  after  Yudhoyono's  Democrat  Party  (PD),  Yudhoyono  decided  to 
jettison  Muhammad  Yusuf  Kalla  as  his  running  mate  for  reelection. 
Following  the  logic  of  the  inclusionary  political  culture,  all  of  Yud- 
hoyono's presidential  coalition  partners  expected  him  to  choose  one 
of  their  leaders  as  his  new  running  mate.  Instead,  Yudhoyono  chose 
the  nonpartisan,  technocratic  economist  Budiono,  who  had  served  as 
his  coordinating  minister  for  economic  policy  before  becoming  gov- 
ernor of  Bank  Indonesia.  Kalla  and  Megawati  failed  to  form  a  coali- 
tion of  the  second-  and  third-largest  parties,  instead  settling  for 
coalitions  with  Wiranto  of  the  People's  Conscience  Party  (Hanura 
Party)  and  Prabowo  Subianto  of  the  Great  Indonesia  Movement  Party 
(Gerindra  Party),  respectively.  Nonetheless,  after  Yudhoyono  won  the 
presidential  election  with  exactly  the  same  large  majority  as  in  2004 
(60.8  percent),  he  still  turned  to  Kalla  and  Megawati  to  negotiate  an 
inclusionary  cabinet.  Megawati  rebuffed  him,  and  so  the  cabinet 
formed  in  October  2009  did  not  include  representatives  from  the 
PDI-P,  the  Hanura  Party,  or  the  Gerindra  Party,  but  it  did  include  rep- 
resentatives from  Golkar  as  well  as  the  five  parties  that  nominated  the 
Yudhoyono-Budiono  ticket:  the  PD,  PKS,  National  Mandate  Party 
(PAN),  Development  Unity  Party  (PPP),  and  PKB. 

Consensus-Based  Decision  Making 

One  of  the  ironies  of  Indonesian  political  culture  is  that  while 
Suharto's  New  Order  paid  lip  service  to  the  achievement  of  consen- 
sus through  deliberation  as  being  an  integral  part  of  "Pancasila 
Democracy,"  in  reality  the  system  was  then  highly  centralized,  auto- 
cratic, and  nonparticipatory,  and  instead  it  is  the  new  democracy  that 
has  actually  adopted  consultative  consensus.  The  preference  for 
deliberation  and  consensus  is  partly  driven  by  the  exigencies  of 
shifting  inclusionary  coalitions  described  above.  However,  even  in 


256 


Government  and  Politics 


situations  in  which  a  strong  majority  coalition  already  exists,  Indo- 
nesian political  elites  have  preferred  to  continue  to  work  to  achieve 
consensus  where  practical. 

This  cultural  predilection  was  strongly  evident  in  the  MPR 
debates  over  constitutional  reforms  from  1999  to  2002  and  is  one  of 
the  main  reasons  those  reforms  took  three  years  to  achieve  rather 
than  one,  as  originally  planned.  In  this  case,  the  achievement  of  con- 
sensus also  has  an  instrumental  rationale:  because  the  constitution  is 
the  source  of  the  basic  rules  of  politics,  the  wider  the  acceptance  of 
those  rules,  the  more  likely  they  are  to  be  followed  in  practice,  con- 
tributing to  democratic  stability.  Nevertheless,  this  predilection  has 
also  manifested  itself  even  when  an  instrumental  rationale  is  lacking, 
such  as  in  the  DPR.  The  DPR  has  continued  the  New  Order  practice 
of  dividing  all  leadership  positions — from  speaker  down  to  deputy 
committee  chair — among  all  parties  proportional  to  each  party's 
share  of  seats,  rather  than  just  a  majority  coalition.  There  is  no  need 
to  form  an  all-party  coalition  in  support  of  the  speaker  or  the  presi- 
dent; rather,  this  practice  is  rooted  in  a  desire  to  give  every  party  a 
voice  in  the  legislative  process.  Legislators  have  also  seen  voting  by 
majority  rule  as  a  last  resort,  preferring  to  achieve  consensus  on  leg- 
islation among  all  party  blocs,  even  if  this  means  extended  delibera- 
tions and  compromises.  This  practice  has  been  one  of  the  factors 
contributing  to  the  DPR's  very  low  legislative  output. 

Traditional  Political  Culture 

Public  tolerance  of  President  Yudhoyono's  careful,  deliberative 
decision-making  style  and  of  the  slow,  consensus-based  legislative 
process  is  partly  due  to  the  way  these  political  practices  reflect 
shared  cultural  values  and  expectations  about  leadership.  In  a  nation 
as  ethnically  diverse  as  Indonesia — from  Melanesian  tribes  in  Papua 
to  Chinese-Indonesian  billionaires  in  Jakarta — and  with  its  popula- 
tion differentially  incorporated  into  the  modern  political  economy,  it 
is  difficult  to  identify  a  political  culture  shared  by  all  Indonesians 
(see  Sources  of  Local  Identification,  ch.  2).  Nevertheless,  there  are 
major  cultural  forces  at  work  that  do  influence  the  political  judg- 
ments of  large  groups  of  Indonesians. 

There  are  numerous  traditional  political  cultures  in  Indonesia,  but 
many  aspects  of  modern  Indonesian  government  and  bureaucracy  reflect 
Javanese  cultural  undeipinnings.  Even  though  Indonesia  is  a  cultural 
mosaic,  the  Javanese,  with  about  41  percent  of  the  total  population,  are  by 
far  the  largest  single  ethnic  group.  Moreover,  they  fill — to  a  degree  some- 
what greater  than  their  population  ratio — the  most  important  roles  in  gov- 
ernment and  the  military.  Javanese  cultural  predispositions  therefore 


257 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

influence  the  way  the  government  appeals  to  and  interacts  with  the  popu- 
lation. Although  the  Javanese  kingship  model  was  particularly  appropri- 
ate for  understanding  Suharto  and  the  authoritarian  New  Order,  it 
continues  to  have  relevance  in  democratic  Indonesia  (see  Javanese,  ch.  2). 

Political  power  on  Java  historically  was  deployed  through  a  patri- 
monial bureaucratic  state  in  which  proximity  to  the  ruler  was  the  key 
to  command  and  rewards.  This  power  can  be  described  in  terms  of  a 
patron-client  relationship  in  which  the  patron  is  the  bapak  (father  or 
elder).  The  terms  of  deference  and  obedience  to  the  ruler  are  con- 
ceived in  the  Javanese  gusti-kawula  (lord-subject)  formulation, 
which  describes  man's  relationship  to  God  as  well  as  the  subject's 
relationship  to  his  ruler.  The  reciprocal  trait  for  obedience  is  benevo- 
lence. In  other  words,  benefits  flow  from  the  center  to  the  obedient. 
By  extension,  government's  developmental  activities  are  a  boon  to 
the  loyal.  Bureaucratically,  Javanese  culture  is  suffused  with  an  atti- 
tude of  obedience — respect  for  those  more  senior,  conformity  to 
hierarchical  authority,  and  avoidance  of  confrontation — characteris- 
tics of  the  preindependence  priyayi  (see  Glossary)  class  whose  roots 
go  back  to  the  traditional  Javanese  courts. 

Javanism  (kejawen)  also  has  a  mystical,  magical  dimension  in  its 
religiously  syncretic  belief  system,  which  integrates  pre-Indian,  Indian, 
and  Islamic  beliefs.  Its  practices  include  animistic  beliefs,  which  invest 
sacred  heirlooms  (pusaka)  with  animating  spirits,  and  rites  of  passage 
whose  antecedents  are  pre-Islamic.  Javanism  also  encompasses  the 
introspective  ascetic  practices  of  kebatinan  (see  Glossary),  mysticism 
as  related  to  one's  inner  self,  that  seek  to  connect  the  microcosms  of 
the  self  to  the  macrocosms  of  the  universe  (see  Islam,  ch.  2).  The  poli- 
tics of  Javanism  have  been  defensive,  seeking  to  preserve  its  particular 
heterogeneous  practices  from  demands  for  Islamic  orthodoxy. 

Islamic  Political  Culture 

According  to  the  2000  census,  86.1  percent  of  the  population  (in 
2009  an  estimated  240.3  million  people)  identified  themselves  as 
Muslim,  making  Indonesia  the  largest  Muslim  nation  in  the  world, 
united  with  the  universal  Islamic  community  (ummah)  in  the  profes- 
sion and  practice  of  the  faith  (see  Religion  and  Worldview,  ch.  2). 
The  appeal  of  Islam  did  not  weaken  when  modern  secular  national- 
ism became  the  predominant  basis  for  the  independent  Indonesian 
state.  In  fact,  given  the  prominence  of  Islamic  proselytization  and 
reinvigoration,  the  people's  desire  to  maintain  Islamic  institutions 
and  moral  values  arguably  is  at  an  all-time  high  in  Indonesia.  There 
is,  however,  a  distinction  between  Islam  as  a  cultural  value  system 
and  Islam  as  a  political  movement.

Government  and  Politics 


Islam  in  Indonesia  is  not  monolithic.  Indonesia's  nominal  or  sta- 
tistical Muslims,  referred  to  as  abangan  (see  Glossary),  are  mostly, 
with  varying  degrees  of  self-awareness,  believers  in  kebatinan.  It  is 
notoriously  difficult  to  parse  out  the  percentage  of  Indonesian  Mus- 
lims who  are  abangan  and  those  who  are  santri  (see  Glossary),  the 
term  for  orthodox  believers.  What  is  clear  is  that  the  latter  have  been 
gaining  ground  since  the  1970s  and  are  probably  now  a  majority  of 
the  population  as  a  whole.  The  vote  totals  of  Muslim  and  Islamist 
political  parties,  about  37  percent  in  both  1999  and  2004  and  about 
26  percent  in  2009,  are  not  a  very  good  measurement  of  the  appeal 
of  orthodox  Islam,  as  many  santri  are  personally  pious  but  believe 
that  religion  should  be  kept  out  of  politics  and  thus  support  secular 
nationalist  parties  (see  Muslim  Parties,  this  ch.).  Furthermore,  the 
orthodox  are  themselves  divided  into  traditionalists  and  modernists, 
and  each  of  these  streams  then  subdivides  into  extremist,  conserva- 
tive, moderate,  and  liberal  camps  (see  Political  Dynamics,  this  ch.). 

The  principal  organization  reflecting  the  traditionalist  outlook  is 
Nahdlatul  Ulama  (literally,  "revival  of  the  religious  teachers"), 
founded  in  1926.  Nahdlatul  Ulama  has  its  roots  in  the  traditional  rural 
Islamic  schools  (pesantren)  of  central  and  eastern  Java.  Claiming 
more  than  40  million  members,  Nahdlatul  Ulama  is  the  largest  Mus- 
lim organization  in  the  world.  Modernist,  or  reformist,  Islam  in  Indo- 
nesia is  best  exemplified  by  the  Muhammadiyah  (Followers  of 
Muhammad),  which  claims  30  million  members.  The  latter  organiza- 
tion was  founded  in  1912,  when  the  spirit  of  the  Islamic  reform  move- 
ment born  in  Egypt  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  reached  Southeast 
Asia.  In  addition  to  their  reform  agenda,  modernists  sought  to  purify 
(critics  argue  Arabize)  Indonesian  Islam. 

Both  santri  streams  found  formal  political  expression  in  the 
postindependence  multiparty  system.  Masyumi  was  the  main  political 
vehicle  for  the  modernists.  However,  its  apparent  support  for  the 
PRRI-Permesta  regional  rebellions  between  1957  and  1961  led  to 
constraints  on  its  activities,  and  the  party  was  banned  in  1959.  Nahd- 
latul Ulama  directly  competed  as  a  party  in  the  politics  of  the  1950s 
and,  seeking  to  capitalize  on  Masyumi's  banning,  collaborated  with 
Sukarno  in  the  hope  of  winning  patronage  and  followers.  Nahdlatul 
Ulama  also  hoped  to  stop  the  seemingly  inexorable  advance  of  the 
secular  left  under  the  leadership  of  the  PKI.  Islamic  political  parties 
were  prohibited  from  advancing  an  explicitly  Islamist  message  in  the 
New  Order,  but  traditional  systems  of  communication  within  the 
community  of  believers,  including  instruction  in  Islamic  schools  and 
mosque  sermons,  passed  judgments  on  politics  and  politicians — the 
so-called  "hard"  dakwah  (vigorous  promotion  of  Islam). 


259 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  followers  of  the  hard  dakwah  form  a  minority,  albeit  a  vocal 
one.  Some  Islamists  might  be  disaffected  with  the  state;  however,  the 
goal  of  urban,  middle-class  Muslims,  who  share  in  the  benefits  of 
government  economic  policies  and  are  relatively  untouched  by  the 
preaching  of  rural  Muslim  teachers,  is  not  to  overthrow  democracy. 
They  want  to  transform  the  government  from  within  to  make  its  acts 
conform  more  with  Islamic  values,  a  focus  not  on  the  state  itself  but 
on  reforming  policies  and  practices  that  are  offensive.  The  issues 
that  energize  middle-class  Muslims  include  not  just  the  persistent 
Muslim  complaints  about  secularization,  Christianization,  and  moral 
decline,  but  also  contemporary  political  grievances  about  the  inequi- 
table distribution  of  income,  corruption,  and  concentration  of  wealth 
and  power  in  the  hands  of  Chinese  Indonesians  to  the  detriment  of 
indigenous  (pribumi — see  Glossary)  entrepreneurship.  These  kinds 
of  issues  cut  across  religious  boundaries  and  unite  moderate  middle- 
class  Muslims  with  more  secular  members  of  the  middle  class. 

Pancasila:  The  State  Ideology 

The  government  undertook  at  independence  the  major  effort  of 
subsuming  all  of  Indonesia's  political  cultures,  with  their  different 
and  often  incompatible  criteria  for  legitimacy,  into  a  national  political 
culture  based  on  the  values  set  forth  in  the  Pancasila.  The  preamble  of 
the  1945  constitution  establishes  the  Pancasila  as  the  embodiment  of 
basic  principles  of  an  independent  Indonesian  state.  These  five  princi- 
ples were  announced  by  Sukarno  in  a  speech  on  June  I,  1945.  In 
brief,  and  in  the  order  given  in  the  constitution,  the  Pancasila  princi- 
ples are  belief  in  one  supreme  God,  humanitarianism,  nationalism 
expressed  in  the  unity  of  Indonesia,  representative  democracy,  and 
social  justice.  Sukarno's  statement  of  the  Pancasila,  while  simple  in 
form,  resulted  from  a  complex  and  sophisticated  appreciation  of  the 
ideological  needs  of  the  new  nation.  In  contrast  to  Muslim  national- 
ists who  insisted  on  an  Islamic  identity  for  the  new  state,  the  framers 
of  the  Pancasila  insisted  on  a  culturally  neutral  identity,  compatible 
with  democratic  or  Marxist  ideologies,  and  overarching  the  vast  cul- 
tural differences  of  the  heterogeneous  population.  Like  the  national 
language,  Bahasa  Indonesia,  which  Sukarno  also  promoted,  the  Pan- 
casila did  not  come  from  any  particular  ethnic  group  and  was 
intended  to  define  the  basic  values  for  a  national  political  culture. 

The  Pancasila  has  its  modern  aspects,  although  Sukarno  presented 
it  in  terms  of  a  traditional  Indonesian  society  in  which  the  nation  par- 
allels an  idealized  village:  society  is  egalitarian,  the  economy  is  orga- 
nized on  the  basis  of  mutual  cooperation  (gotong  royong),  and 
decision  making  is  by  deliberation  (musyawarah)  leading  to  consen- 


260 


Government  and  Politics 


sus  {mufakat).  In  Sukarno's  version  of  the  Pancasila — further  defined 
by  Suharto — political  and  social  dissidence  constituted  deviant 
behavior. 

One  reason  why  both  Sukarno  and  Suharto  were  successful  in 
using  the  Pancasila  to  support  their  authority,  despite  their  very  dif- 
ferent policy  orientations,  is  the  generalized  nature  of  the  principles 
of  the  Pancasila.  The  Pancasila  has  been  less  successful  as  a  unifying 
concept  when  leadership  has  tried  to  give  it  policy  content.  Suharto 
greatly  expanded  a  national  indoctrination  program  established  by 
Sukarno  to  inculcate  a  regime-justifying  interpretation  of  the  Pan- 
casila in  all  citizens,  especially  schoolchildren  and  civil  servants. 
The  Pancasila  was  thus  transformed  from  an  abstract  statement  of 
national  goals  into  an  instrument  of  social  and  political  control.  To 
oppose  the  government  was  to  oppose  the  Pancasila.  To  oppose  the 
Pancasila  was  to  oppose  the  foundation  of  the  state.  The  effort  to 
enforce  conformity  to  the  government's  interpretation  of  Pancasila 
ideological  correctness  was  not  without  controversy.  The  issue  that 
persistently  tested  the  limits  of  the  government's  tolerance  of  alter- 
native or  even  competitive  systems  of  political  thought  was  the  posi- 
tion of  religion,  especially  Islam. 

Islam  and  the  Indonesian  state  had  a  tense  political  relationship 
from  the  very  outset  of  independence.  The  Pancasila 's  promotion  of 
monotheism  is  a  religiously  neutral  and  tolerant  statement  that  equates 
Islam  with  the  other  religious  systems:  Christianity,  Buddhism,  and 
Hindu-Balinese  beliefs.  However,  Muslim  political  forces  had  felt 
betrayed  since  signing  the  June  1945  Jakarta  Charter,  under  which 
they  accepted  a  pluralist  republic  in  return  for  agreement  that  the  state 
would  be  based  upon  belief  in  one  God  "with  Muslims  obligated  to 
follow  the  sharia."  The  decision  two  months  later  to  remove  this 
seven- word  phrase  from  the  preamble  of  the  1945  constitution,  to 
keep  predominantly  Christian  areas  of  eastern  Indonesia  from  break- 
ing away  from  the  nationalist  movement  and  declaring  their  own  inde- 
pendence, set  the  agenda  for  future  Islamic  politics.  At  the  extreme 
were  the  Darul  Islam  rebellions  of  the  1950s,  which  sought  to  estab- 
lish a  Muslim  theocracy. 

Orthodox  Muslim  groups  saw  the  New  Order's  emphasis  on  the 
Pancasila  as  an  effort  to  subordinate  Islam  to  a  secular  state  ideol- 
ogy, even  a  "civil  religion"  manipulated  by  a  regime  inherently 
biased  against  the  full  expression  of  Muslim  life.  By  the  1980s,  how- 
ever, within  the  legal  and  politically  acceptable  boundaries  of  Mus- 
lim involvement,  the  state  had  become  a  major  promoter  of  Islamic 
institutions.  The  government  even  subsidized  numerous  Muslim 
community  activities.  Within  the  overall  value  structure  of  the  Pan-

casila,  Islamic  moral  teaching  and  personal  codes  of  conduct  bal- 
anced the  materialism  inherent  in  secular  economic  development.  By 
wooing  Islamic  leaders  and  teachers,  the  state  won  broad  support  for 
its  developmental  policies.  There  is  no  question  but  that  Islam  was  a 
state-favored  religion  in  Indonesia,  but  it  was  not  a  state  religion. 
That  reality  defined  the  most  critical  political  issue  for  many  ortho- 
dox Muslims.  The  so-called  "hard"  dakwah,  departing  from  sermons 
and  texts  tightly  confined  to  matters  of  faith  and  Islamic  law,  was 
uncompromisingly  antigovernment.  The  Islamists  called  for  people 
to  die  as  martyrs  in  a  "struggle  until  Islam  rules."  This  call,  for  the 
government,  was  incitement  to  "extremism  of  the  right,"  subversion, 
and  terrorism.  The  government  reaction  to  radical  Islamic  provoca- 
tions was  unyielding:  arrest  and  jail. 

The  democratic  transition  has  entirely  dismantled  the  New  Order 
structures  that  institutionalized  politicization  of  the  Pancasila.  Although 
the  Pancasila  is  still  taught  in  schools,  the  national  indoctrination  pro- 
gram for  adults  and  the  agency  charged  with  managing  it  have  both 
been  abolished.  Most  importantly,  political  parties  and  social  organiza- 
tions are  no  longer  required  to  adopt  the  Pancasila  as  their  underlying 
ideological  principle  (asas  tunggal).  Prominent  Muslim  organizations 
in  particular  immediately  took  advantage  of  this  change.  For  instance, 
the  Development  Unity  Party  (PPP)  reestablished  Islam  as  its  ideologi- 
cal basis  and  returned  to  its  pre- 1984  party  symbol,  the  Kaaba  in 
Mecca.  Secular  nationalist  parties  and  organizations,  however,  have 
retained  the  Pancasila  as  their  ideological  basis.  In  the  early  twenty-first 
century,  the  Pancasila  thus  remains  alive  in  Indonesian  political  dis- 
course in  two  ways.  Harkening  back  to  the  pattern  in  the  1940s  and 
early  1950s,  it  is  one  among  several  ideological  strands  underpinning 
political  conflicts  that  have  many  other  dimensions  as  well:  economic, 
social,  regional,  and  ethnic.  On  occasion,  however,  it  is  still  used  as  a 
unifying  force  that  can  tie  all  Indonesians  together  within  a  national 
political  culture.  For  example,  President  Yudhoyono  has  made  several 
major  speeches  extolling  the  Pancasila's  virtues  in  this  regard.  While 
generally  still  aimed  at  countering  the  influence  of  Islamist  discourse, 
this  latter  usage  elevates  the  Pancasila  above  the  fray  of  mundane  polit- 
ical squabbles. 

The  Political  Process 

Many  political  parties  representing  all  parts  of  the  Indonesian  socio- 
cultural  spectrum  contest  national  and  local  elections.  Smaller  parties 
disappear,  and  larger  parties  split  and  recombine,  no  longer  because  of 
government  interference,  but  rather,  simply,  because  of  the  harsh  sink- 
or-swim  logic  of  the  free  political  marketplace:  election  results  and  the 


262 


Government  and  Politics 


internal  dynamics  of  these  parties.  In  other  words,  although  Indonesian 
democracy  is  not  yet  fully  consolidated  and  faces  many  challenges,  it 
is  well  on  its  way  to  becoming  "the  only  game  in  town." 

The  Multiparty  System:  Significant  Pluralism 

Indonesian  voters  have  clearly  rejected  the  controlled  party  politics 
of  Guided  Democracy  and  the  New  Order.  Since  1998  hundreds  of 
parties  have  been  founded;  48  qualified  to  take  part  in  the  1999  elec- 
tions, 24  for  the  2004  elections,  and  38  for  the  2009  elections  (the  lat- 
ter not  including  the  six  local  parties  that  contested  only  in  Aceh).  Of 
the  38  national  parties,  nine  won  seats  in  the  2009  DPR.  The  level  of 
political  pluralism  (as  measured  by  the  Laakso-Taagepera  Index  of 
effective  political  parties)  increased  from  4.7  in  1999  to  7.1  in  2004 
(compared  to  6.4  in  1955).  Efforts  to  engineer  the  electoral  framework 
in  order  to  consolidate  the  party  system,  by  reducing  district  magni- 
tude and  instituting  an  electoral  threshold  of  2.5  percent,  were  success- 
ful: the  level  of  pluralism  in  2009  dropped  to  6.1  effective  political 
parties.  This  remains,  however,  a  comparatively  high  level  of  plural- 
ism for  a  presidential  system.  Party  registration  criteria  in  essence  pro- 
hibit regional  parties  and  force  parties  to  be  national  in  scope.  The  first 
and  so  far  only  exception  to  this  rule  was  made  as  a  concession  to 
GAM  in  the  Aceh  peace  negotiations.  Ex-GAM  supporters  used  this 
exception  to  form  numerous  parties,  and  six  qualified  to  contest  the 
2009  provincial  and  district  legislative  elections. 

The  largest  political  parties  are  secular  nationalist  parties,  which 
espouse  Pancasila  as  their  ideological  foundation  and  have  developed 
platforms  that  appeal  to  all  Indonesians  regardless  of  religion.  Given 
an  overwhelming  Muslim-majority  population,  most  of  these  parties' 
supporters  are  Muslim  by  faith,  but  they  do  not  believe  in  mixing  faith 
and  politics.  These  parties  include  the  Golkar  Party  (the  New  Order 
ruling  party),  the  Indonesian  Democracy  Party-Struggle  (PDI-P),  and 
the  Democrat  Party  (PD).  Muslim  parties  draw  their  support  primarily 
through  informal  linkages  with  mass-based  Muslim  social  organiza- 
tions such  as  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  Muhammadiyah,  but  they  are  sec- 
ular nationalist  in  ideology  and  platform.  These  parties  include  the 
National  Awakening  Party  (PKB),  associated  with  Nahdlatul  Ulama, 
and  the  National  Mandate  Party  (PAN),  associated  with  Muhammadi- 
yah. Islamist  parties  are  those  that  proclaim  Islam  as  their  ideological 
foundation  and  base  their  platforms  on  Islam,  including  support  for 
Islamic  law.  This  category  includes  the  Development  Unity  Party 
(PPP)  and  the  Prosperous  Justice  Party  (PKS). 

Although  links  can  be  made  between  these  contemporary  parties 
and  their  predecessors  from  the  1950s,  two  differences  stand  out. 


263 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

First,  the  Muslim/Islamist  end  of  the  spectrum  is  much  more  divided 
and  moderate.  Second,  there  is  no  direct  heir  to  the  Indonesian  Com- 
munist Party  (PKI),  and  in  fact  parties  professing  Marxism-Leninism 
continued  to  be  outlawed  until  the  Constitutional  Court  declared  this 
ban  unconstitutional  in  2005.  Despite  this  decision,  it  is  not  likely 
the  PKI  will  be  revived  any  time  soon  because  of  the  strong  emo- 
tions it  engenders  among  many  Indonesians  and  because  its  former 
constituency  has  found  a  home  within  several  parties,  particularly 
Golkar,  the  PDI-P,  the  PD,  and  the  PKB.  Most  of  the  major  parties 
draw  their  strength  from  association  with  one  or  another  of  Indone- 
sia's socioreligious  streams  of  belief  (aliran  kepercayaari)  and  a 
popular  individual  leader.  The  parties  tend  to  be  highly  centralized 
and  riven  with  internal  factionalism.  It  is  very  common  for  factions 
that  lose  out  in  internal  party  leadership  elections  to  leave  to  form  a 
rival  party.  However,  few  of  these  splinter  parties  have  fared  well  in 
national  elections. 

Secular  Nationalist  Parties 

Golkar  Party 

The  Golkar  Party  is  the  revamped,  democratic  version  of  the  New 
Order  authoritarian  ruling  party  Golongan  Karya  (Golkar),  the  military- 
backed  organization  of  "functional  groups."  The  longer  original  name 
has  been  dropped,  and  now  the  party  is  simply  known  as  Golkar.  Its  tra- 
ditionally very  close  ties  to  the  military  and  civil  service  no  longer 
exist,  although  many  officers  and  bureaucrats  have  chosen  to  continue 
to  support  the  party  rather  than  join  another.  However,  this  support  is 
now  personal  and  private,  as  the  election  laws  prohibit  the  use  of  state 
resources  to  support  any  party,  and  individual  military  officers  and  gov- 
ernment officials  must  resign  their  positions  in  order  to  stand  as  politi- 
cal candidates.  Despite  these  new  restrictions  on  Golkar's  ability  to  tap 
its  traditional  constituencies,  the  party  enjoys  advantages  over  its  rivals 
as  a  result  of  its  national  network,  which  extends  to  every  village;  its 
experienced  politicians;  and  its  strong  fund-raising  capabilities.  The 
party  no  longer  commands  the  electoral  majorities  of  60  to  70  percent 
that  it  engineered  under  the  New  Order,  but  it  still  makes  a  strong 
showing,  winning  22.4  percent  of  the  vote  (120  of  500  DPR  seats)  to 
come  in  second  to  the  PDI-P  in  the  1999  legislative  elections,  the  larg- 
est share  of  the  votes  in  2004  (21 .6  percent,  128  of  550  DPR  seats),  and 
in  2009  the  second-largest  share  (14.5  percent  of  the  vote,  106  of  560 
DPR  seats).  Golkar  has  also  won  some  of  the  direct  elections  for  gover- 
nor, mayor,  and  bupati,  and  the  party's  chair,  Muhammad  Yusuf  Kalla, 
held  the  vice  presidency  from  2004  to  2009.

1999-2001,  Indonesia's  fourth  president,  2001-4, and  daughter  of  Sukarno)

Golkar  had  its  roots  in  Sukarno's  Guided  Democracy  as  an  army- 
sponsored  coalition  of  nearly  100  anticommunist  organizations  and 
Sukarno's  Indonesian  Nationalist  Party  (PNI)  to  balance  the  weight  of 
the  PKI.  After  1966  it  was  reorganized  by  Suharto  as  an  ostensibly 
nonpartisan  civilian  constituency  for  the  New  Order's  authority.  Its 
core  membership  was  the  military,  police,  civil  service,  and  employ- 
ees of  state-owned  enterprises.  Over  the  course  of  the  New  Order,  the 
balance  of  power  in  the  party  slowly  shifted  to  civilians,  particularly 
those  such  as  future  party  chairman  Akbar  Tanjung  who  cut  their 
organizational  teeth  in  the  Islamic  University  Student  Association 
(HMI)  and  later  the  Indonesian  Muslim  Intellectuals'  Association 
(ICMI).  As  chair  from  1983  to  1988,  Sudharmono,  who  served  as  vice 
president  of  Indonesia  from  1988  to  1993,  attempted  to  make  Golkar 
a  more  effective  political  instrument  by  shifting  from  a  "functional 
group"  basis  to  individual  cadre  membership.  As  a  mass-mobilizing, 
cadre  party  loyal  to  Suharto,  Golkar  emerged  as  an  autonomous  polit- 
ical force  in  society,  no  longer  fully  responsive  to  the  military. 

Following  Suharto's  resignation  in  May  1998,  at  a  special  party 
congress  in  July,  Golkar  took  its  first  major  step  toward  transforming 


265 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

itself  into  a  more  dynamic  and  viable  democratic  party  by  choosing 
Akbar  Tanjung  over  Lieutenant  General  (retired)  Edi  Sudrajat  as  its 
new  chair.  Akbar  retained  control  over  the  party,  installing  many  of 
his  HMI/ICMI  faction  colleagues  in  leadership  positions  and  steer- 
ing the  party  successfully  through  the  political  minefields  of  the 
1999  and  2004  elections,  until  losing  the  chairmanship  to  newly 
elected  Vice  President  Kalla  at  the  party  congress  in  December  2004. 
With  Kalla's  political  fortunes  declining  in  2009,  Golkar's  election 
of  outgoing  Coordinating  Minister  for  People's  Welfare  Aburizal 
Bakrie  as  its  new  chairman  in  October  2009,  just  weeks  before  the 
announcement  of  the  new  cabinet,  was  an  attempt  by  the  party  to 
retain  some  national  political  power.  Golkar  is  generally  stronger 
outside  Java  and  Bali,  as  reflected  by  two  of  its  most  recent  chairs: 
Akbar  is  from  Sumatera  Utara,  and  Kalla  is  from  Sulawesi  Selatan. 
Kalla  and  Bakrie  also  represent  an  important  constituency  within 
Golkar:  wealthy  pribumi  (see  Glossary)  private  businesspeople 
whose  family  fortunes  are  largely  a  product  of  Sukarno's  protection- 
ist economic  policies  and  Suharto's  patronage  politics. 

Indonesian  Democracy  Party-Struggle 

The  PDI-P  is  the  successor  party  to  one  of  the  two  other  parties 
besides  Golkar  allowed  to  exist  by  the  New  Order:  the  Indonesian 
Democracy  Party  (PDI).  The  PDI  emerged  in  1973  from  a  fusion  of 
two  Christian  parties:  the  Indonesian  Christian  Party  (Parkindo)  and 
the  Catholic  Party  (Partai  Katolik);  and  three  secular  parties:  the 
Indonesian  Nationalist  Party  (PNI),  the  League  of  the  Supporters  of 
Indonesian  Independence  (IPKI),  and  the  Party  of  the  Masses  (Partai 
Murba).  With  no  common  ideological  link  among  these  constituent 
parties  other  than  a  commitment  to  Pancasila,  the  PDI  was  highly  fac- 
tionalized,  torn  by  personality  disputes,  and  held  together  only  by 
direct  government  intervention  into  its  internal  affairs.  For  example, 
the  IPKI  had  been  strongly  anti-PKI  in  the  Old  Order  in  contrast  to 
the  once-leftist  Partai  Murba.  The  PNI,  strongest  in  Jawa  Timur  and 
Jawa  Tengah,  was  the  largest  of  the  five  parties  and  the  legatee  of  the 
late  President  Sukarno.  With  Sukarno's  gradual  public  rehabilitation 
as  an  "Independence  Proclamation  Hero"  and  the  father  of  Pancasila, 
the  PDI  was  not  reluctant  to  trade  upon  the  Sukarnoist  heritage  of  the 
PNI,  including  recruiting  several  of  Sukarno's  children  as  candidates 
and  campaigners.  Most  prominent  among  them  was  his  eldest  daugh- 
ter, Megawati  Sukarnoputri,  whose  presence  helped  expand  the  PDI's 
vote  total  in  the  1992  elections.  After  she  was  elected  party  chair  in 
1993,  Suharto  began  to  see  her  as  a  greater  threat  and  tried  to  have  her 
removed,  but  she  stood  her  ground.  In  1996  the  government  backed  a 


266 


Government  and  Politics 


rival  faction  to  forcibly  eject  Megawati  and  her  supporters  from  party 
offices.  She  responded  by  founding  the  PDI-P  to  distinguish  it  from 
the  New  Order-backed  PDI,  which  garnered  only  3  percent  of  the 
vote  in  the  1997  elections.  Because  the  PDI-P  was  not  allowed  to  run 
in  those  elections,  Megawati  instructed  her  supporters  to  punish  the 
rump  PDI  by  voting  for  the  PPP,  which  grew  enormously  as  a  result. 

Both  the  PDI-P  and  the  rump  PDI  competed  in  the  1999  elections, 
but  with  vastly  different  results.  The  PDI-P  won  the  largest  share 
with  33.7  percent  (153  DPR  seats),  while  the  PDI  languished  with 
only  0.6  percent  (two  seats).  Megawati  became  the  frontrunner  for 
the  October  1999  presidential  selection  process  in  the  MPR  but  lost  to 
Abdurrahman  Wahid,  who  then  helped  her  get  selected  as  vice  presi- 
dent. When  Wahid  was  removed  from  office  in  2001,  she  became 
president  until  2004,  when  she  was  defeated  in  direct  elections  by 
Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono.  The  PDI-P 's  vote  in  the  2004  legisla- 
tive elections  suffered  as  well,  losing  almost  half  of  its  support  to  fall 
to  18.5  percent  (109  DPR  seats),  as  a  result  of  public  disappointment 
with  her  performance  as  president,  her  husband  Taufik  Kiemas's  rep- 
utation for  corruption,  and  the  party  as  a  whole.  Despite  these  set- 
backs, Megawati  was  reelected  party  chair  at  the  2005  congress, 
prompting  some  disaffected  leaders  led  by  Laksamana  Sukardi  to  bolt 
and  found  the  Democracy  Renewal  Party  (PDP).  In  the  2009  legisla- 
tive elections,  the  PDI-P 's  support  dropped  further  to  14  percent  (94 
DPR  seats)  as  a  result  of  competition  from  the  Democrat,  Gerindra, 
and  Hanura  parties.  Megawati,  this  time  running  with  Prabowo  Subi- 
anto,  was  defeated  in  a  rematch  with  Yudhoyono  in  the  2009  presi- 
dential election. 

Democrat  Party 

The  Democrat  Party  (PD)  was  founded  by  then-Coordinating  Minis- 
ter of  Politics  and  Security  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  in  2001  to  be 
his  political  vehicle.  He  broke  with  the  usual  pattern  in  Indonesia,  how- 
ever, and  did  not  become  the  party's  chairman.  The  bulk  of  the  party's 
initial  cadres  were  mostly  mid-level  ex-Golkar  and  former  military 
leaders.  Although  the  party's  local  branch  structure  remained  weak  at 
the  time  of  the  April  2004  legislative  elections,  the  PD  still  managed  to 
capture  7.5  percent  of  the  vote  (57  DPR  seats),  and  thus  become  one  of 
the  seven  largest  parties,  largely  on  the  strength  of  Yudhoyono 's  per- 
sonal popularity.  Between  2004  and  2009,  the  success  of  the  party  and 
Yudhoyono 's  presidential  bid  attracted  new  cadres,  who  expanded  the 
party's  structure  into  a  truly  national  presence.  This  expansion,  com- 
bined with  Yudhoyono 's  continuing  popularity,  gave  the  PD  the  most 
votes  in  the  April  2009  legislative  elections,  with  20.9  percent  of  the 


267 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

vote  (148  of  560  DPR  seats).  The  party's  prospects  in  2014  and  beyond 
remain  unclear,  however,  with  Yudhoyono  no  longer  eligible  to  run  for 
reelection  at  that  time. 

Gerindra  and  Hanura  Parties 

The  two  smallest  of  the  nine  parties  to  win  DPR  seats  in  the  2009 
elections  were  new  parties  both  founded  by  retired  army  generals 
with  highly  tainted  human-rights  records.  The  Great  Indonesia  Move- 
ment Party  (Gerindra  Party)  is  the  political  vehicle  for  retired  Lieu- 
tenant General  Prabowo  Subianto,  the  son  of  famed  economist  and 
finance  minister  Sumitro  Joyohadikusumo  and  the  former  son-in-law 
of  Suharto.  Prabowo  has  a  particularly  cruel  reputation  from  his 
career  in  the  Army  Special  Forces  Command  (Kopassus)  and  has 
been  implicated  in  severe  human-rights  abuses  in  East  Timor,  the 
temporary  or  permanent  disappearance  and  death  of  23  prodemoc- 
racy  activists  in  1997  and  1998,  and  the  Jakarta  riots,  as  well  as  a 
coup  attempt  against  newly  installed  President  Habibie,  in  May  1998. 
Despite  this  record,  Prabowo  was  able  to  convince  three  of  the  activ- 
ists he  is  alleged  to  have  kidnapped  and  tortured  to  run  under  the  Ger- 
indra Party  banner,  and  the  party  won  4.5  percent  of  the  vote  and  26 
DPR  seats.  Prabowo  ran  as  Megawati's  vice  presidential  candidate, 
but  they  placed  a  distant  second  to  Yudhoyono. 

The  People's  Conscience  Party  (Hanura  Party)  was  founded  by 
retired  General  Wiranto,  who  helped  force  Suharto  from  power, 
quash  Prabowo 's  attempted  coup,  and  begin  military  reforms.  He 
also  was  in  command  during  the  Indonesian  army-backed  militia 
rampage  in  East  Timor  in  September  1999  as  well  as  during  several 
bloody  incidents  with  demonstrators  in  Jakarta.  In  2009  the  Hanura 
Party  won  3.8  percent  of  the  vote  and  17  DPR  seats.  Wiranto  ran  as 
Kalla's  vice  presidential  candidate,  but  the  ticket  won  only  12  per- 
cent of  the  vote  to  place  third. 

Muslim  Parties 

National  Awakening  Party 

Founded  by  Abdurrahman  Wahid  in  1998  as  the  heir  to  the  Nahd- 
latul  Ulama  political  party  from  the  1950s,  the  National  Awakening 
Party  (PKB)  is  the  most  successful  of  the  Muslim  parties  that  have 
tried  to  draw  on  Nahdlatul  Ulama 's  vast  organizational  strength. 
Although  formally  Nahdlatul  Ulama  is  not  associated  with  any  of 
these  parties,  it  is  the  backbone  of  them  all,  including  the  PKB. 
Nonetheless,  the  PKB  certainly  does  not  have  a  monopoly  on  the 
political  loyalties  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama  supporters,  who  are  scattered

among  nearly  all  the  major  and  some  minor  parties.  Following  the 
geographic  pattern  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama's  organizational  depth  and 
Wahid's  personal  cachet,  the  PKB's  electoral  strength  is  concen- 
trated in  Jawa  Timur  and  Jawa  Tengah. 

The  PKB  does  not  support  the  rigid  implementation  of  Islamic  law 
and  is  an  open  party  with  support  in  parts  of  Indonesia  with  significant 
Christian  populations,  such  as  in  Sulawesi  Utara,  Kalimantan  Barat,  and 
Papua.  Because  of  Wahid's  personal  control  over  the  PKB,  his  and  the 
party's  fortunes  moved  more  or  less  in  tandem.  He  used  the  PKB's  per- 
formance in  the  1999  legislative  elections  (third-largest  party  with  12.6 
percent  of  the  vote  and  5 1  DPR  seats)  as  a  springboard  to  build  a  coali- 
tion behind  his  successful  presidential  bid  that  year  in  the  MPR  voting. 
Wahid's  erratic  administration  reflected  poorly  on  the  PKB  as  well,  and 
the  party  lost  some  of  its  public  support,  as  well  as  access  to  patronage 
and  the  bully  pulpit,  when  he  was  removed  from  office  in  July  2001 .  As 
a  result,  in  2004  the  PKB  lost  two  percentage  points  of  its  1999  vote 
share,  dropping  to  10.6  percent  in  2004.  (Nonetheless,  because  all  five

of  the  major  parties  from  1999  lost  support  in  2004,  the  PKB  retained 
the  third-largest  party  share  of  the  popular  vote.)  After  Wahid  lost  the 
presidency,  the  party  began  to  splinter,  and  the  2004  election  results 
caused  a  major  split,  with  both  pro-  and  anti- Wahid  factions  claiming 
the  PKB's  mantle.  At  the  outset  of  the  new  administration,  the  party 
took  an  independent  stance  vis-a-vis  President  Yudhoyono,  sometimes 
supporting  and  sometimes  opposing  his  policies.  However,  by  2007  the 
PKB  had  swung  around  much  more  solidly  in  support  of  the  administra- 
tion because  of  Yudhoyono 's  success  and  Wahid's  complete  loss  of  con- 
trol over  the  party.  As  a  result  of  party  splintering,  reduced  support 
overall  for  Muslim  and  Islamist  parties,  and  greater  competition  from 
secular  nationalist  parties,  the  PKB  vote  share  was  more  than  halved  in 
2009  to  4.9  percent  (28  DPR  seats). 

National  Mandate  Party 

Paralleling  the  PKB's  relationship  with  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and 
Wahid,  the  National  Mandate  Party  (PAN)  is  strongly  associated  with 
Muhammadiyah  and  political-science  professor  Amien  Rais  from  Yog- 
yakarta.  Beginning  in  the  early  1990s,  Rais  became  a  thorn  in  Suharto's 
side,  calling  for  presidential  succession  and  highlighting  cases  of  cor- 
ruption and  other  malfeasance.  Despite  (or  perhaps  because  of)  this 
vocal  opposition,  he  was  elected  chair  of  Muhammadiyah  in  1995.  In 
1998  he  became  the  most  prominent  adult  face  of  the  student-led  refor- 
masi  (see  Glossary)  movement,  which  succeeded  in  forcing  Suharto's 
resignation.  (Wahid  had  had  a  stroke  in  January  1998,  and  Megawati 
remained  on  the  sidelines.)  Following  the  founding  of  the  PAN  in 
August  1998,  Rais  had  to  step  down  as  Muhammadiyah 's  chair. 
Although  founded  as  an  open  party,  with  Christians  and  ethnic  Chinese 
prominent  among  its  leadership,  the  PAN  also  has  a  significant  hard- 
line Islamist  wing.  As  that  wing  gained  ascendancy  within  the  party, 
many  of  the  PAN's  initial  secular  and  Christian  leaders  began  to  aban- 
don it.  While  few  of  these  leaders  were  linked  to  mass-based  organiza- 
tions that  could  deliver  votes,  they  were  among  the  key  intellectual 
capital  in  the  party,  and  their  departure  also  fostered  the  perception  of  a 
party  in  trouble. 

In  the  1999  elections,  the  PAN  fared  worse  than  had  been  expected, 
given  Rais's  prominence  in  opposing  Suharto,  winning  only  7.1  per- 
cent of  the  popular  vote  (34  DPR  seats).  Although  this  result  dashed 
his  presidential  ambitions,  it  was  enough,  combined  with  clever  polit- 
ical maneuvering,  for  Rais  to  be  elected  speaker  of  the  MPR.  From 
this  position,  Rais  chose  to  involve  himself  more  in  politicking 
against  presidents  Wahid  and  Megawati  than  in  the  constitutional- 
reform  process  being  undertaken  by  the  MPR.  This  strategy  may  have 


270 


Government  and  Politics 


hurt  the  PAN,  for  it  reinforced  the  public  perception  of  Rais  as  stri- 
dent, divisive,  and  having  abandoned  the  reformasi  movement  for 
sheer  power  politics.  In  addition,  the  PAN's  poor  showing  weakened 
Rais's  position  within  the  party,  enhancing  the  ascendancy  of  the  Isla- 
mist wing  and  leading  to  further  defections  by  members  of  the  secu- 
lar/Christian wing. 

The  Islamist  wing's  hypothesis  that  a  more  focused  albeit  more 
narrowly  based  party  would  attract  more  voters  than  a  less  focused, 
but  broader-based,  party  was  proven  wrong  in  the  2004  elections,  in 
which  the  PAN's  share  of  the  popular  vote  shrank  to  6.4  percent  (52 
DPR  seats),  making  it  the  smallest  of  the  seven  major  parties.  (The 
PAN's  support  in  2004  was  more  evenly  spread  around  the  country 
than  in  1 999,  and  so  its  share  of  DPR  seats  actually  increased  from 
7.4  percent  to  9.5  percent.)  Although  Rais  tried  his  hand  in  the  first 
direct  presidential  election,  he  lost  in  the  first  round  and  subsequently 
left  the  political  scene  after  completing  his  term  as  MPR  speaker  in 
October  2004.  He  was  replaced  as  PAN  chair  by  a  much  less  well- 
known  figure,  Sutrisno  Bachir,  and  returned  to  his  former  life  as  an 
academic  at  Universitas  Gadjah  Mada  in  Yogyakarta.  With  several  of 
its  leaders  holding  cabinet  posts  in  the  Yudhoyono  administration,  the 
PAN  mostly  supported  the  administration,  although  it  has  reserved 
the  right  to  criticize  on  occasion.  In  2009  the  PAN's  support  declined 
to  6.0  percent  of  the  vote  (46  DPR  seats),  because  of  waning  overall 
support  for  Muslim  and  Islamist  parties  as  well  as  greater  competition 
from  the  DP,  Gerindra,  and  Hanura  parties. 

Islamist  Parties 

Development  Unity  Party 

The  Development  Unity  Party  (PPP;  often  erroneously  referred  to  as 
the  United  Development  Party)  was  the  umbrella  grouping  formed 
when  the  government  compelled  four  Muslim  parties  to  merge  in  the 
1973  restructuring  of  the  party  system.  The  four  components  were  Nah- 
dlatul  Ulama,  the  Muslim  Party  of  Indonesia  (PMI),  the  Islamic  Associ- 
ation Party  of  Indonesia  (PSII),  and  the  Islamic  Educational  Movement 
(Perti).  The  PPP's  constituent  parties  neither  submerged  their  identities 
nor  merged  their  programs.  As  a  result,  no  single  PPP  leader  emerged 
with  a  platform  acceptable  to  all  the  sectarian  and  regional  interests  rep- 
resented by  the  PPP.  Despite  their  manifest  differences  representing 
divergent  santri  streams,  however,  the  PPP's  parties  had  the  common 
bond  of  Islam,  and  it  was  this  that  gained  them  the  government's  close 
attention. 


271 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  dominant  partners  were  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  the  PMI;  the  lat- 
ter was  a  resurrected  but  emasculated  version  of  Masyumi,  which  had 
been  banned  in  the  Sukarno  era  and  continued  to  be  proscribed  under 
Suharto.  The  return  of  modernist  Islamic  interests  (represented  by  the 
PMI)  to  mainstream  politics  was  stage-managed  by  the  government, 
which  apparently  favored  the  PMI  within  the  PPP  to  counterbalance 
the  appeal  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama.  In  1984  the  government  forced  the  PPP 
to  adopt  Pancasila  (as  opposed  to  Islam)  as  its  basic  ideological  princi- 
ple. The  decline  in  Nahdlatul  Ulama's  influence  in  the  PPP,  together 
with  constraints  on  the  Islamic  content  of  the  PPP's  message,  con- 
firmed the  traditionalists'  perception  that  Nahdlatul  Ulama  should 
withdraw  from  the  political  process  and  concentrate  on  its  religious, 
social,  and  educational  activities.  The  theme  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama's 
1984  congress  was  "Back  to  Nahdlatul  Ulama's  Original  Program  of 
Action  of  1926."  While  constitutionally  accepting  Pancasila  as  its  sole 
ideological  principle,  Nahdlatul  Ulama  opted  out  of  the  Pancasila  polit- 
ical competition  by  holding  that  political  party  membership  was  a  per- 
sonal decision  and  that  individual  Nahdlatul  Ulama  members  had  no 
obligation  to  support  the  PPP. 

Nahdlatul  Ulama's  withdrawal  from  the  PPP  combined  with  Mega- 
wati's rise  in  the  PDI  to  shift  some  of  the  opposition  votes  from  the 
PPP  to  the  PDI  in  the  1987  and  1992  elections.  In  the  1997  elections, 
after  her  forcible  ejection  from  the  PDI  offices  in  1996,  Megawati 
instructed  her  supporters  to  vote  for  the  PPP.  This  was  called  the 
"Mega-Bintang"  campaign  (bintang  means  "star,"  the  party  symbol 
for  the  PPP,  which  after  1984  was  no  longer  allowed  to  use  the  Kaaba 
in  Mecca  as  its  symbol),  and  it  greatly  weakened  the  PDI,  to  the  PPP's 
benefit.  One  consequence  of  these  election  results  was  that  in  late 

1998  and  early  1999,  as  the  DPR  debated  the  package  of  laws  for  the 

1999  democratic  elections,  the  PPP  positioned  itself  as  the  voice  of 
the  reformasi  movement  within  the  legislature  and  forced  several 
important  changes  to  those  laws.  For  instance,  Golkar  proposed  an 
electoral  system  it  called  "proportional  plus"  that  would  in  essence 
have  established  single-member  districts  in  many  parts  of  the  country. 
Given  Golkar's  overwhelming  resource  advantage  at  the  time,  it 
could  have  swept  many  of  these  seats  and  possibly  maintained  its  grip 
on  power.  Instead,  the  PPP  was  able  to  use  its  position  in  the  DPR  to 
mobilize  public  opposition  to  this  proposal,  which  was  dropped  in 
favor  of  retaining  proportional  representation  in  order  to  encourage 
political  pluralism.  In  light  of  the  founding  of  rival  parties  such  as  the 
PKB  and  the  PAN,  this  tactic  helped  save  the  PPP  from  fading  into 
political  obscurity  as  has  the  PDI. 


272 


Government  and  Politics 


In  1 999  the  PPP  was  allowed  to  restore  Islam  as  its  ideological  basis 
and  the  Kaaba  as  its  symbol,  and  it  won  10.7  percent  of  the  popular 
vote  (58  DPR  seats)  to  become  the  fourth-largest  party.  The  PPP  sup- 
ported Wahid  for  president  and  was  rewarded  with  several  cabinet 
positions.  During  the  constitutional-reform  process  following  those 
elections,  the  party  supported  the  reinsertion  of  language  calling  for 
Islamic  law  to  be  established  for  Indonesian  Muslims,  in  part  to  protect 
its  right  flank  from  smaller  but  harder-line  Islamist  parties.  This  is  one 
of  the  markers  that  distinguishes  "Muslim"  from  "Islamist"  parties:  the 
PKB  and  the  PAN  opposed  this  proposal,  which  eventually  was 
soundly  defeated.  Party  leadership  rivalries  caused  a  faction  to  break 
off  and  form  the  Reform  Star  Party  (PBR).  The  PBR  proved  to  be  one 
of  the  few  splinter  parties  to  gain  any  significant  share  of  votes  in  the 
2004  legislative  elections,  winning  2.4  percent  (13  DPR  seats).  The 
split,  combined  with  voter  disappointment  with  the  performance  of  all 
the  major  parties,  caused  the  PPP's  vote  share  to  drop  to  8.2  percent 
(58  DPR  seats),  but  it  still  maintained  its  position  as  the  fourth-largest 
party  by  popular  vote.  The  PPP  supported  a  rival  ticket  in  the  first 
round  of  the  2004  presidential  election,  although  it  threw  its  weight 
behind  Yudhoyono  and  Kalla  in  the  second  round  and  again  garnered 
several  cabinet  seats  as  a  result.  In  2009,  although  the  PBR  won  only 
1.2  percent  of  the  vote  and  no  DPR  seats  because  of  the  electoral 
threshold,  the  PPP  vote  share  slid  to  5.3  percent  (38  DPR  seats)  as  a 
result  of  overall  voter  dissatisfaction  with  Muslim  and  Islamist  parties. 

Prosperous  Justice  Party 

The  Prosperous  Justice  Party  (PKS)  contested  the  1999  elections 
as  the  Justice  Party  (PK),  founded  in  1998.  Because  the  PK  won  only 
1.4  percent  of  the  popular  vote  in  1999  (seven  DPR  seats),  the  law 
required  it  to  change  its  name  in  order  to  contest  the  2004  elections. 
The  PK  drew  on  networks  of  university  campus-based  Quranic  study 
groups  as  its  organizational  backbone.  Nearly  all  of  its  leaders  had 
advanced  degrees,  mostly  from  universities  in  the  Middle  East  and 
the  United  States.  The  party's  emphasis  on  Islamic  law  limited  its 
appeal  in  1999.  The  PK  spoke  frequently  of  its  vision  for  managing 
religious  pluralism  in  Indonesia  as  being  based  on  the  Medina  Char- 
ter, promulgated  in  AD  622  by  the  Prophet  Muhammad,  who  guar- 
anteed protection  for  Christian  and  Jewish  communities.  Many  non- 
Muslims  in  Indonesia,  however,  interpreted  this  as  a  form  of  second- 
class  citizenship  under  Islamist  rule.  Despite  the  party's  low  vote 
total,  President  Wahid  appointed  its  leader,  Nur  Mahmudi  Isma'il, 
minister  of  forestry.  Nur  Mahmudi  set  an  unusual  precedent  in  Indo- 
nesian politics  by  stepping  down  from  the  party  presidency  upon 


273 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

entering  the  government,  in  order  to  concentrate  on  his  role  as  a  min- 
ister. The  PK  also  enhanced  its  influence  by  joining  the  PAN  to  form 
the  Reformasi  Bloc  in  the  DPR  and  the  MPR. 

The  party  also  set  about  expanding  its  base  as  part  of  its  transfor- 
mation from  the  PK  to  the  PKS.  The  PKS  is  unusual  in  that  it  is  the 
only  true  cadre  party  in  Indonesia.  It  requires  prospective  members 
to  study  party  doctrine  and  regulations  and  to  take  an  oath  of  loyalty 
to  those  principles.  The  party  has  disciplined  or  expelled  members 
for  violating  these  principles.  Party  members  may  also  attend  regular 
training  programs.  The  party's  support  base  remains  more  heavily 
urban  and  more  highly  educated  than  the  general  voting  population, 
but  it  has  begun  to  make  inroads  in  rural  areas. 

The  PKS  quintupled  the  PK's  1999  share  of  the  vote  in  2004  to 
7.3  percent  of  the  popular  vote  (45  DPR  seats),  largely  by  emphasiz- 
ing themes  of  anticorruption  and  good  governance  in  its  campaign 
and  de-emphasizing  Islamic  law.  Although  all  the  parties  cam- 
paigned on  fighting  corruption,  the  PKS  came  across  as  the  most 
credible  in  this  regard,  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  party  exploited  its 
reputation  for  religiosity  as  a  source  of  morally  based  and  clean  gov- 
ernance, and  some  voters  differentiated  between  this  and  the  estab- 
lishment of  Islamic  law.  Second,  PK  leaders  and  legislators  had 
developed  a  track  record  in  the  1999-2004  term.  Minister  of  For- 
estry Nur  Mahmudi  attempted  to  purge  the  industry  of  some  of  its 
most  unsavory  practices  and  business  partners.  Although  he  did  not 
last  long  in  office,  and  his  efforts  met  with  only  limited  success,  they 
helped  burnish  the  PKS's  reformist  credentials.  Provincial  and  dis- 
trict legislators  across  the  country  had  continued  the  New  Order 
practice  of  voting  themselves  large  allowances,  often  ostensibly  for 
official  vehicles  or  uniforms.  PK  legislators  made  a  point  of  very 
publicly  returning  these  questionable  allowances  to  the  local  trea- 
sury or  donating  them  to  a  mosque  or  community  group.  The  party 
used  the  newspaper  clippings  describing  these  actions  in  its  2004 
campaign.  The  PKS  also  developed  a  reputation  for  conducting 
peaceful  and  orderly  campaign  rallies,  and  for  cleaning  up  after  its 
followers  when  the  rallies  were  over.  These  actions  made  the  party 
especially  popular  in  Jakarta,  where  it  won  the  largest  share  of  votes 
in  the  2004  legislative  elections. 

The  party's  success  landed  its  president,  Hidayat  Nur  Wahid,  the 
position  of  MPR  speaker  for  the  2004  term.  Following  party  regula- 
tions, he  stepped  down  from  his  leadership  role  upon  accepting  this 
government  position.  In  2005  Nur  Mahmudi  Isma'il  was  directly 
elected  mayor  of  Depok,  the  city  on  the  western  outskirts  of  Jakarta 
that  is  home  to  Universitas  Indonesia.  The  party  intended  to  use 


274 


Government  and  Politics 


these  positions  to  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  clean  governance, 
setting  its  sights  on  eventually  winning  the  presidency.  The  party  had 
to  contend,  however,  with  widespread  voter  suspicion,  among  both 
non-Muslims  and  moderate  Muslims,  that  the  PKS's  de-emphasis  of 
Islamic  law  was  simply  a  tactical  rather  than  a  truly  strategic  shift. 
The  party's  stated  support  for  such  radical  figures  as  Jemaah  Islami- 
yah  spiritual  leader  Abu  Bakar  Ba'asyir  reinforced  these  concerns. 
These  limits  on  the  party's  appeal  were  vividly  demonstrated  in 
2007,  when  it  failed  to  win  the  governor's  race  in  Jakarta  despite  its 
2004  plurality  victory  in  the  city's  legislative  elections. 

The  PKS  has  won  more  positions  in  various  levels  of  government, 
inevitably  finding  that  it  has  to  make  hard  choices  and  compromises, 
and  its  appeal  to  its  more  puritanical  core  constituency  has  begun  to 
suffer.  The  PKS  no  longer  enjoys  the  same  level  of  credibility  in 
fighting  corruption,  and  thus  it  has  lost  its  uniqueness  and  increas- 
ingly come  to  be  viewed  as  just  one  more  party  on  the  spectrum. 
Although  in  2009  it  bucked  the  overall  trend  of  major  parties  losing 
voter  support,  its  gains  were  hardly  as  spectacular  as  in  2004.  In 
2009  its  vote  share  rose  slightly  to  7.9  percent  (57  DPR  seats),  mak- 
ing the  PKS  Indonesia's  fourth-largest  party. 

Elections 

Indonesia  has  now  held  three  sets  of  democratic  national  elec- 
tions, in  1999,  2004,  and  2009,  following  decades  of  stage-managed 
elections  under  the  New  Order.  The  1999  elections  were  the  first 
democratic  national  elections  since  1955.  Local  direct  elections  for 
governor,  mayor,  and  bupati  have  been  held  on  a  rolling  basis  in  all 
parts  of  the  country  since  2005.  The  political  maturity  of  Indonesian 
voters,  combined  with  extensive  monitoring  by  civil-society  groups, 
helped  make  all  of  these  elections  largely  free  of  violence  and  fraud, 
despite  great  concerns  beforehand  to  the  contrary. 

To  be  eligible  to  participate  in  1999,  parties  had  to  be  national  in 
scope,  with  party  branches  established  in  at  least  one-third  of  the  prov- 
inces and  one-half  of  the  administrative  districts  within  those  provinces. 
A  reconstituted  General  Elections  Commission  (KPU)  administered  the 
elections.  It  consisted  of  48  representatives  of  the  parties  and  five  "gov- 
ernment" representatives.  (To  avoid  perceptions  of  continuity  with  the 
authoritarian  management  of  elections  under  the  New  Order,  the 
Habibie  government  chose  to  fill  these  positions  with  members  of  civil 
society  and  academia.)  Although  this  structure  functioned  well  to  signal 
a  clean  break  with  the  past  and  a  level  playing  field  for  all  parties,  it 
broke  down  both  in  the  run-up  to  the  elections  (when  many  of  the  party 
representatives  were  off  campaigning)  and  following  the  elections 


275 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

(when  most  of  the  48  parties  won  few  votes  or  seats  and  began  making 
unfounded  allegations  of  fraud  and  boycotting  KPU  meetings). 

Since  2002  the  KPU  has  consisted  of  nine  nonpartisan  commis- 
sioners selected  by  the  DPR  from  a  longer  list  of  candidates  nomi- 
nated by  the  president  from  civil  society  and  academia.  The  1999 
elections  continued  the  New  Order  practice  of  a  closed-list  propor- 
tional-representation system  with  the  provinces  as  the  electoral  dis- 
tricts for  the  DPR;  thus,  the  districts  ranged  in  size  from  four  seats 
(in  former  Timor  Timur  Province,  now  independent  Timor-Leste)  to 
82  seats  (Jawa  Barat).  These  were  simultaneous  elections  for  the 
national  DPR  and  the  provincial  and  local  DPRDs;  each  voter  used  a 
nail  to  punch  a  hole  in  one  of  the  48  party  symbols  on  each  of  the 
three  ballots.  These  legislative  elections  were  followed  by  the  presi- 
dential selection  process  within  the  MPR  in  October.  Governors, 
mayors,  and  bupatis  were  selected  by  their  respective  DPRD. 

The  2004  and  2009  elections  were  more  complicated  than  those  in 
1999.  There  were  three  electoral  processes:  legislative  elections  in 
early  April,  the  first  round  of  the  presidential  election  in  early  July,  and 
the  second  round  in  September  (necessary  in  2004  but  not  in  2009). 
The  vote  for  the  legislative  entities  consisted  of  four  separate  and 
simultaneous  elections,  not  just  three  as  in  1999  and  throughout  the 
New  Order.  In  addition  to  the  DPR  and  the  provincial  and  district 
DPRDs,  voters  now  also  elected  representatives  to  the  new  upper 
house  of  the  national  legislature,  the  Regional  Representative  Council 
(DPD). 

Two  reforms  addressed  the  complaint  that  representatives  in  the 
DPR  and  DPRDs  had  been  too  detached  from  their  constituents.  First, 
electoral  districts  were  limited  to  between  three  and  10  seats  (for  2009; 
in  2004  the  upper  limit  was  12  seats).  In  the  19  least  populated  prov- 
inces, this  rule  meant  that  the  province  remained  the  electoral  district. 
The  other  14  provinces  were  divided  along  municipality  and  regency 
boundaries  into  between  two  and  1 1  electoral  districts  in  order  to  fall 
into  the  mandated  seat  range.  (All  of  these  electoral  districts  consisted 
of  more  than  one  administrative  district;  in  no  case  was  an  electoral 
district  made  up  of  a  single  administrative  district.)  The  average  DPR 
district  across  the  77  electoral  districts  nationwide  had  approximately 
seven  representatives.  Second,  voters  could  choose  a  candidate  from 
anywhere  on  the  party's  list  rather  than  just  voting  for  a  party.  This 
open-list  proportional-representation  system  is  designed  to  make  rep- 
resentatives more  beholden  to  voters  than  to  party  leaders  for  their 
seats,  and,  in  fact,  nearly  20  percent  of  DPR  members  in  2009  (104  of 
560)  were  chosen  by  voters  from  lower  positions  on  the  candidate 
lists.  This  method  does  make  election  logistics  incredibly  compli-

cated;  ballots  look  like  newspapers,  and  each  electoral  district  has  to 
have  a  separate  ballot  listing  its  candidates. 

A  further  complication  for  voters  was  that  the  election  system  for 
the  DPD  was  entirely  different  from  that  for  the  DPR  and  DPRDs. 
DPD  candidates,  who  represented  entire  provinces,  campaigned 
more  as  individuals,  even  if  they  were  affiliated  with  a  political  party. 
(DPD  candidates  had  to  have  been  residing  in  the  province  they  rep- 
resented and  obtain  thousands  of  signatures  of  registered  voters  in 
order  to  be  nominated.  For  the  2004  elections,  candidates  were  not 
allowed  to  have  a  political-party  affiliation,  but  for  the  2009  elec- 
tions, candidates  could  be — but  did  not  have  to  be — partisan.)  Candi- 
dates' names  and  photographs  appeared  on  the  ballot.  Each  voter 
marked  one  candidate,  and  the  four  candidates  with  the  most  votes 
were  elected. 

The  DPR  elections  served  as  a  sort  of  primary  for  the  presidential 
election.  Parties  or  coalitions  thereof  with  at  least  20  percent  of  DPR 
seats,  or  25  percent  of  the  national  DPR  vote,  were  eligible  to  nomi- 
nate presidential  and  vice-presidential  tickets  (this  threshold  was  only 
3  percent  of  DPR  seats  in  2004).  In  2004  five  tickets  were  nominated:

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  and  Muhammad  Yusuf  Kalla  (winning 
33.6  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  first  round)  by  the  PD,  Indonesian  Jus- 
tice and  Unity  Party  (PKPI),  and  Star  and  Moon  Party  (PBB);  Mega- 
wati Sukarnoputri  and  Hasyim  Muzadi  (26.2  percent)  by  the  PDI-P; 
Wiranto  and  Salahuddin  Wahid  (22.2  percent)  by  Golkar;  Amien  Rais 
and  Siswono  Yudohusodo  (14.9  percent)  by  the  PAN,  PKS,  and  sev- 
eral smaller  parties;  and  Hamzah  Haz  and  Agum  Gumelar  (3.1  per- 
cent) by  the  PPP.  The  PKB  did  not  nominate  a  ticket  because  its 
presidential  candidate,  former  President  Wahid,  was  declared  physi- 
cally unfit  for  the  position  (a  new  criterion  instituted  in  reaction  to  his 
administration).  Because  no  ticket  won  more  than  50  percent  in  the 
first  round,  a  second  round  occurred  in  which  Yudhoyono  and  Kalla 
soundly  defeated  Megawati  and  Hasyim,  60.9  percent  to  39.1  per- 
cent, respectively.  Three  tickets  were  nominated  in  2009:  Yudhoyono 
and  Budiono  by  the  PD,  PKS,  PAN,  PPP,  and  PKB  (winning  60.8  per- 
cent of  the  vote  in  the  first  round);  Megawati  and  Prabowo  Subianto 
by  the  PDI-P  and  Gerindra  (26.8  percent);  and  Kalla  and  Wiranto  by 
Golkar  and  Hanura  (12.4  percent).  Because  Yudhoyono  and  Budiono 
won  more  than  50  percent  in  the  first  round,  a  second  round  was  not 
necessary. 

The  huge  rallies  of  motorcycles,  automobiles,  and  trucks  cruising 
around  cities,  hallmarks  of  previous  Indonesian  campaigning,  were 
banned  beginning  in  2004.  Mass  rallies  in  stadiums  and  other  venues 
were  still  one  of  the  most  popular  campaign  techniques,  although  the 
open-list  system  for  the  DPR  and  the  DPD  elections  did  prompt 
more  frequent  door-to-door  campaigning  than  had  been  the  case  pre- 
viously. Television  proved  to  be  a  significant  campaign  medium  in 
the  presidential  election,  and  Yudhoyono  used  it  particularly  effec- 
tively in  2004  to  overtake  other,  better-known  candidates.  Other  can- 
didates were  busy  lining  up  endorsements  from  political  parties  and 
political  elites,  but  Yudhoyono  tried  to  get  coverage  of  his  campaign 
rallies  on  the  news  every  evening.  In  this  way,  he  turned  a  nominat- 
ing coalition  that  together  had  won  only  11.4  percent  of  the  vote  in 
the  legislative  elections  in  April  into  convincing  victories  in  both 
rounds  of  the  presidential  election. 

Political  finance  continues  to  be  problematic  in  Indonesia.  Both 
parties  and  candidates  fund  raise  for  executive  and  legislative  elec- 
tions. Election  laws  include  limits  on  donations,  although  these  regu- 
lations are  poorly  enforced,  and  spending  is  not  limited.  Most  parties 
require  legislative  candidates  to  donate  to  party  coffers  in  exchange 
for  a  place  on  the  list;  as  a  general  rule,  the  higher  the  financial  dona- 
tion, the  closer  a  candidate  is  placed  to  the  top  of  the  list.  Even  in  an 
open-list  system,  placement  near  the  top  is  advantageous.  Similarly, 
most  parties  require  local  executive  candidates  to  donate  in  exchange

for  nomination,  a  situation  that  creates  incentives  for  elected  candi- 
dates to  engage  in  corruption  in  order  to  recoup  these  payments  and 
begin  amassing  funds  for  future  elections.  The  process  has  been  over- 
seen, in  all  the  national  and  local  elections  since  1999,  by  an  official 
Election  Oversight  Committee  (Panwaslu)  system.  However,  the  law 
has  granted  this  system  few  real  powers  except  to  be  a  repository  for 
complaints;  any  serious  matters  must  still  be  handled  by  the  police 
and  the  judicial  system.  The  system  is  also  underfunded,  hampering 
its  efficiency.  More  effective  monitoring  and  observation  of  the  elec- 
tions since  1999  have  been  conducted  by  political  parties,  domestic 
civil-society  groups,  the  media,  and  international  organizations.  The 
parties  and  domestic  groups  in  particular  have  mobilized  and  trained 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  volunteers  to  monitor  the  process  and  report 
election  results. 

Political  Dynamics 

Political  Opposition 

President  Yudhoyono's  first  term  in  office  was  marked  by  repeated 
natural  and  other  environmental  disasters.  These  included  the  Aceh 
earthquake  and  tsunami  in  December  2004,  the  Yogyakarta  earth- 
quake in  May  2006,  the  Lumpur  Sidoarjo  (Lusi)  mud  volcano  in  Jawa 
Timur  beginning  in  May  2006,  the  Pangandaran  earthquake  and  tsu- 
nami in  July  2006,  forest  fires  in  Sumatra  and  Kalimantan  that  caused 
choking  haze  in  Malaysia  and  Singapore  in  October  2006  and  2007, 
massive  floods  in  Jakarta  in  February  2007,  and  the  Tasikmalaya  and 
Padang  earthquakes  in  September  2009.  Despite  these  and  other  chal- 
lenges, Yudhoyono  remained  quite  popular;  public-opinion  polls  gen- 
erally gave  him  an  approval  rating  between  40  and  60  percent.  His 
continued  popularity  created  problems  for  the  formation  of  a  sus- 
tained opposition,  and  he  exploited  this  situation  to  shore  up  his  legis- 
lative support.  Having  only  Megawati  as  a  strong  challenger,  he  was 
easily  reelected  in  2009. 

The  Yudhoyono-Kalla  administration's  consolidation  of  its  politi- 
cal position  began  within  months  of  taking  office.  Golkar,  the  PDI-P, 
the  PKB,  and  the  PBR  had  formed  the  National  Front  in  opposition  to 
the  new  administration  and  had  swept  all  DPR  leadership  positions. 
At  Golkar's  December  2004  congress,  however,  Kalla  was  elected  to 
be  the  new  party  chairman  just  days  before  the  Aceh  tsunami.  This 
broke  up  the  National  Front  and  brought  the  largest  party  solidly 
behind  the  vice  president  (if  not  always  the  president  himself). 

Yudhoyono  also  managed  to  neutralize  the  PKB,  PAN,  and  PPP  so 
that  even  though  these  parties  were  not  solid  supporters,  neither  were 
they  strident  opponents.  The  PKB  has  suffered  from  internal  rivalries 


279

between  pro-  and  anti-Wahid  factions,  both  of  which  have  claimed 
control  of  the  party.  Wahid  remained  a  frequent  critic  of  the  president, 
although  even  his  own  faction  in  the  party  leadership  drew  closer  to 
the  administration  in  order  to  sideline  their  opponents  within  the 
party.  Wahid  himself  suffered  further  health  problems  and  died  in 
December  2009.  PAN  leaders  had  held  several  seats  in  the  cabinet 
since  the  beginning  of  the  Yudhoyono  administration,  but  the  party 
remained  at  arm's  length  from  the  president  until  its  founder,  one-time 
presidential  rival  and  frequent  critic  Amien  Rais,  stepped  down  as 
chair  and  retired  from  active  engagement  in  politics  at  the  party  con- 
gress in  2005.  A  similar  dynamic  occurred  within  the  PPP,  led  until 
the  party  congress  in  2007  by  former  Vice  President  Hamzah  Haz, 
another  of  Yudhoyono's  rivals  in  the  2004  election.  The  party  elected 
then-Minister  for  Cooperatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises 
Suryadharma  Ali  to  be  its  new  chairman  over  Arief  Mudatsir  Man- 
dan,  a  DPR  member  supported  by  Haz.  This  left  the  PDI-P  as  the 
only  one  of  the  seven  major  parties  remaining  as  a  consistent  member 
of  the  opposition.  Following  the  2009  elections,  the  PDI-P  was  joined 
in  opposition  only  by  the  two  smallest  parties  in  the  DPR,  Gerindra 
and  Hanura. 

Islam 

The  reformasi  period  has  witnessed  a  great  debate  among  four 
camps  within  Islam  in  Indonesia:  extremists,  conservatives,  moder- 
ates, and  liberals.  These  camps  exist  within  both  the  traditionalist 
and  modernist  streams  of  Islam  in  Indonesia.  The  smaller  and  more 
marginalized  of  these  camps  are  the  extremists  and  the  liberals  on 
the  right  and  left  fringes  of  the  debate,  respectively;  the  bulk  of  the 
debate  is  thus  in  the  center  of  this  spectrum  between  the  conserva- 
tives and  the  moderates. 

The  extremists  are  the  groups  and  individuals  that  have  been 
involved  in  acts  of  terrorism,  communal  violence,  and  small-scale 
thuggery  and  extortion;  what  sets  them  apart  from  the  other  three 
camps  is  their  use  of  violence.  These  groups  and  individuals  partici- 
pate in  the  debate  mainly  through  actions  rather  than  words;  surpris- 
ingly, their  information  campaigns  have  been  limited.  Terrorism  has 
mainly  been  associated  with  Jemaah  Islamiyah,  Al  Qaeda's  South- 
east Asian  affiliate,  whose  spiritual  leader  is  Abu  Bakar  Ba'asyir. 
Jemaah  Islamiyah  has  been  associated  with  the  five  most  prominent 
terrorist  bombings  in  Indonesia  in  recent  years:  in  the  Kuta  tourist 
district  in  southern  Bali  in  October  2002  and  October  2005,  the  JW 
Marriott  Hotel  in  Jakarta  in  August  2003,  the  Australian  Embassy  in 


280 


Government  and  Politics 


Jakarta  in  September  2004,  and  the  JW  Marriott  and  Ritz-Carlton 
hotels  in  Jakarta  in  July  2009. 

Communal  violence  has  been  associated  mainly  with  organizations 
such  as  Laskar  Jihad,  a  Java-based  group  that  involved  itself  in  the  con- 
flicts in  Maluku  and  Sulawesi  Tengah.  These  organizations  often  justi- 
fied their  actions  by  claiming  that  they  intervened  to  defend  Muslims 
from  physical  attack  by  Christians.  In  all  of  these  communal  conflicts, 
however,  while  religious  affiliations  were  used  to  mobilize  people  on 
all  sides,  the  roots  of  the  conflicts  were  much  deeper  and  more  com- 
plex; religion  was  and  continues  to  be  layered  with  ethnic,  economic, 
political,  and  personal  rivalries.  The  involvement  of  these  organizations 
thus  simply  served  to  polarize  and  extend  the  conflict  even  further. 

Thuggery  and  extortion  are  the  realm  of  groups  such  as  the 
Islamic  Defenders'  Front  (FPI),  which  consists  of  criminal  gangs 
posing  as  social  organizations  in  a  very  similar  manner  to  New 
Order-era  groups  such  as  Pancasila  Youth  (Pemuda  Pancasila).  The 
main  difference  is  that  the  FPI  uses  Islamic  rather  than  nationalist 
symbols  and  slogans  to  mobilize  supporters  and  neutralize  critics. 
The  FPI  and  similar  groups  have  raided  bars  and  discos,  held  violent 
demonstrations  at  the  offices  of  the  Indonesian  edition  of  Playboy, 
and  so  forth.  These  groups  likely  have  numerous  motives  for  their 
actions,  including  both  religious  convictions  and  the  desire  for  pro- 
tection money  in  exchange  for  leaving  such  businesses  alone. 

Conservatives  have  concentrated  their  efforts  on  incorporating 
Islamic  law  into  Indonesian  daily  life  in  various  ways.  Their  initial 
efforts  focused  on  reinserting  the  phrase  from  the  Jakarta  Charter  ("with 
Muslims  obligated  to  follow  the  sharia")  into  the  1945  constitution  as 
part  of  the  amendment  process  from  1999-2002.  This  proposal,  most 
strongly  supported  by  the  PK  and  the  PBB,  but  also  by  the  PPP  to  cover 
its  right  flank  from  these  two  smaller  parties,  was  soundly  defeated  in 
the  MPR  in  2002.  The  conservatives  then  took  advantage  of  decentral- 
ization to  win  approval  by  various  district  and  municipality  assemblies 
of  local  regulations  implementing  several  aspects  of  Islamic  law,  espe- 
cially those  commonly  used  to  regulate  women's  dress  and  behavior. 
These  regulations  may  be  unconstitutional,  as  religion  is  one  of  the  six 
major  policy  areas  reserved  for  the  central  government  under  decentral- 
ization; however,  as  of  2009  none  of  these  regulations  had  been  chal- 
lenged before  the  Constitutional  Court. 

Local  implementation  of  Islamic  law  became  institutionalized  in  the 
special-autonomy  law  for  Aceh,  despite  the  fact  that  this  was  not  a  pri- 
mary Acehnese  demand.  Resulting  developments  include  a  religious 
police  force  for  Aceh  and  the  drafting  of  regional  regulations,  such  as  a 
punishment  for  theft  that  involves  cutting  off  the  perpetrator's  hand. 


281 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Aceh  governor  Irwandi  Yusuf,  a  former  rebel  leader,  has  vowed  not  to 
enforce  such  regulations  even  if  they  are  approved. 

Moderates  still  represent  the  vast  majority  of  Indonesian  Muslims. 
Although  large  organizations  such  as  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  Muham- 
madiyah  are  internally  diverse,  including  conservatives,  moderates, 
and  liberals  among  their  members,  they  remain  dominated  by  moder- 
ates. Of  the  two,  however,  Muhammadiyah  has  tended  to  be  more 
conservative  than  Nahdlatul  Ulama.  As  the  dominant  majority  faced 
with  rising  extremism  and  a  newly  resurgent  conservative  minority, 
moderates  have  been  put  on* the  defensive.  They  have  often  struggled 
to  make  their  voices  heard  without  being  labeled  lackeys  of  the  West 
or  apostates.  The  main  distinction  between  conservatives  and  moder- 
ates is  that  the  former  want  Islamic  law  codified  and  enforced  as  part 
of  Indonesian  law,  whereas  the  latter  see  it  more  as  a  set  of  rules  for 
personal  behavior,  enforced  only  by  one's  faith  and  self-discipline. 
Moderates  are  also  much  more  likely  to  engage  with  non-Muslims  in 
interfaith  initiatives  and  to  speak  publicly  of  tolerance  of  differences 
and  the  equality  of  believers  of  all  faiths. 

There  is  a  small  but  highly  visible  group  of  mostly  young  intellec- 
tuals and  activists  from  both  the  traditionalist  and  modernist  streams 
that  can  be  characterized  as  liberals,  pushing  the  envelope  of  ijtihad 
(exegesis)  with  innovative  and  often  highly  controversial  ideas.  Con- 
sistent with  this  cutting-edge  profile,  the  most  prominent  organiza- 
tional home  for  this  group  is  virtual,  the  Liberal  Islam  Network 
(JIL),  an  online  discussion  forum.  The  JIL's  physical  headquarters  is 
in  the  Utan  Kayu  complex  in  East  Jakarta.  This  complex  was  estab- 
lished in  the  late  New  Order  period  by  Gunawan  Mohammad  (the 
leading  intellectual  and  journalist  who  helped  found  the  news  maga- 
zine Tempo)  as  an  incubator  for  a  wide  range  of  creative,  opposition- 
minded  young  people.  Many  conservatives  and  extremists  have  a 
visceral  negative  reaction  to  the  liberals  and  have  demonstrated  at 
the  Utan  Kayu  complex,  threatening  to  expel  and  shut  down  the  JIL 
and  calling  for  the  death  of  JIL  leader  Ulil  Abshar  Abdalla,  who 
temporarily  fled  the  country  for  his  own  safety. 

The  Military 

More  than  a  decade  after  the  beginning  of  the  democratic  transi- 
tion, the  Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces  (TNI)  retains  the  poten- 
tial for  significant  political  influence.  This  latent  influence  is  rarely 
used  in  public,  however,  and  may  not  even  be  that  effective  behind 
the  scenes.  Nonetheless,  it  exists.  The  sources  of  this  influence  are 
twofold:  institutional  and  cultural.  Although  the  military  has  been 
stripped  of  many  of  the  direct  powers  it  enjoyed  under  the  New 


282 


Government  and  Politics 


Order,  the  institutional  core  of  its  power — the  army's  territorial  sys- 
tem and  the  network  of  off-budget  companies,  foundations,  and 
cooperatives  supported  by  that  system — remains  intact  (see  Admin- 
istrative and  Command  Structure,  ch.  5).  The  Yudhoyono  adminis- 
tration has  made  an  inventory  of  these  military  enterprises,  with  the 
aim  of  transferring  them  all  to  civilian  state  control  for  privatization 
or  closure,  a  process  not  complete  in  2009.  No  serious  proposals 
have  been  made  to  dismantle  the  territorial  system  as  part  of  the 
effort  to  reorient  the  military  to  focus  on  external  defense.  It  is 
important  not  to  overstate  the  power  of  this  system,  which  is  more 
effective  as  a  subtle  threat  than  in  actual  use.  In  fact,  the  military  is 
small  relative  to  the  population  as  a  whole,  and  the  territorial  system 
is  staffed  by  the  more  poorly  trained  and  equipped  half  of  the  army, 
limiting  its  ability  to  move  in  more  than  a  few  cities  simultaneously. 
These  limitations  were  clearly  evident  in  1998  in  the  face  of  a 
nationwide,  grassroots  student  movement,  and  that  was  a  time  when 
the  military  still  enjoyed  its  more  direct  levers  of  power. 

The  cultural  source  of  the  military's  latent  political  influence  is 
the  public's  perception,  rightly  or  wrongly,  of  officers  as  firm  deci- 
sion makers  who  consider  the  national  interest  in  those  decisions,  as 
opposed  to  the  stereotype  of  bickering  civilian  politicians  who  take 
only  their  parochial  interests  into  consideration.  This  perception  also 
has  its  limitations,  for  the  public  does  not  prefer  just  any  officer. 
When  given  a  choice,  voters  have  clearly  expressed  their  preference 
for  those  with  less  baggage  in  terms  of  human-rights  violations  or 
corruption.  Thus,  while  it  is  a  sign  of  this  source  of  influence  that 
someone  with  retired  General  Wiranto's  dismal  human-rights  record 
could  gain  22.2  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  first  round  of  the  2004 
presidential  election,  missing  moving  forward  into  the  second  round 
by  only  four  percentage  points,  he  was  soundly  defeated  by  a  candi- 
date with  many  fewer  allegations  of  human-rights  violations  and 
much  greater  credibility  in  fighting  corruption,  retired  Lieutenant 
General  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono.  This  pattern  repeated  itself  in 
2009,  when  Wiranto  and  Prabowo  Subianto,  who  has  an  even  worse 
human-rights  record,  were  unable  to  help  their  presidential  tickets 
against  Yudhoyono.  At  the  subnational  level,  there  are  now  many 
fewer  governors,  mayors,  and  bupatis  with  a  military  background 
than  in  the  New  Order.  Furthermore,  these  individuals  (like  presi- 
dential and  legislative  candidates)  have  had  to  retire  from  the  armed 
forces  in  order  to  become  involved  in  politics,  and  their  election  does 
not  seem  to  have  directly  benefited  the  military  as  an  institution. 

Despite  the  limitations  on  the  military's  institutional  and  cultural 
sources  of  political  influence,  this  latent  power  could  be  called  upon 


283

were  Indonesia  to  have  a  populist  demagogue  leader,  somewhat 
along  the  lines  of  Venezuela's  Hugo  Chavez.  Under  the  right  circum- 
stances (such  as  economic  stagnation),  such  a  leader  could  offer  the 
Indonesian  public  relief  from  their  economic  woes  at  the  cost  of  a 
rollback  of  democratic  freedoms.  Recent  commanders  have  made 
significant  progress  in  instilling  a  culture  of  professionalism  and 
political  neutrality  in  the  military.  However,  more  reforms  will  be 
necessary  to  ensure  that  less  scrupulous  leaders  could  no  longer  use 
the  military  as  a  tool  of  political  repression. 

Communal  Violence 

One  of  the  greatest  fears  among  the  political  elite  in  1998  was  that 
Indonesia  would  break  apart  into  smaller  countries,  as  had  happened 
in  the  Soviet  Union  and  Yugoslavia.  This  did  not  happen,  but  in  var- 
ious parts  of  the  archipelago  other  developments  did  begin  to  mirror 
events  in  Yugoslavia  in  the  1990s.  Communities  that  had  previously 
coexisted  in  relative  harmony  rapidly  spiraled  into  conflict,  although 
in  Indonesia  none  of  these  tensions  ever  approached  the  scale  of 
communal  violence  in  the  former  Yugoslavia. 

Sporadic  incidents  had  already  begun  in  1996  when  the  New  Order 
still  appeared  quite  solid,  with  church  burnings  in  such  places  as 
Pasuruan  (in  Jawa  Timur)  and  Tasikmalaya  (in  Jawa  Barat).  The  scale 
and  geographic  spread  of  violence  ramped  up  significantly,  however, 
following  Suharto's  resignation,  as  the  national  government  became 
preoccupied  with  the  political  transition  and  security  forces  could  no 
longer  repress  long-simmering  local  grievances.  In  January  1999,  fol- 
lowing the  expulsion  of  Ambonese  gangs  from  Jakarta  to  Ambon,  as 
well  as  the  breakdown  of  informal  ethnic  power- sharing  agreements 
in  Maluku  Province,  a  minor  traffic  accident  in  Ambon  exploded  into 
terrible  and  sustained  violence  between  Muslims  and  Christians  in 
that  city.  Over  the  next  three  years,  several  thousand  members  of  both 
communities  were  killed,  and  parts  of  the  city  became  no-go  zones 
for  one  group  or  the  other.  Extremist  Muslim  groups  such  as  Laskar 
Jihad — allegedly  supported  by  like-minded  senior  military  officers — 
flocked  to  Ambon  and  played  a  major  role  in  the  dramatic  expansion 
of  violence  in  that  city.  The  violence  that  erupted  in  Kalimantan  Barat 
was  even  more  horrific,  as  indigenous  (Christian)  Dayaks  in  rural 
Sambas  District  went  on  a  rampage  against  Muslim  Madurese  in- 
migrants  who  had  taken  a  prominent  role  in  local  commerce  and  agri- 
culture. Hundreds  were  killed,  some  of  their  severed  heads  left  on 
poles  as  a  warning  to  others,  and  many  houses  burned  to  the  ground. 
Sustained  violence  also  erupted  between  Muslims  and  Christians  in 
Sulawesi  Tengah  around  the  cities  of  Poso  and  Tentena,  where  Laskar

Jihad  and  the  more  sinister  Jemaah  Islamiyah  terrorist  group  had 
established  a  training  camp.  At  the  end  of  the  first  decade  of  the 
twenty-first  century,  this  conflict  continues  to  fester,  with  sporadic 
incidents  of  violence  by  one  community  on  the  other. 

Many  of  these  conflicts  appear,  on  the  surface,  to  be  between  eth- 
nic or  religious  communities,  particularly  Muslims  and  Christians. 
However,  deeper  analysis  reveals  that  very  localized  struggles  over 
political  and  economic  power  are  the  underlying  cause.  Unfortu- 
nately, these  political  and  economic  struggles  have  often  been  framed 
by  conflict  entrepreneurs  as  being  rooted  in  ethnic  or  religious  cleav- 
ages, making  it  easier  to  mobilize  communities  against  one  another. 
External  forces  have  also  exacerbated  such  conflicts.  In  Ambon, 
security  forces  were  perceived  as  taking  sides,  the  army  with  Muslim 
communities  and  police  mobile  brigades  with  Christian  communities. 

Yusuf  Kalla  gained  greater  political  prominence  when,  as  coordi- 
nating minister  of  public  welfare  in  President  Megawati's  cabinet,  he 
helped  mediate  negotiations  to  resolve  the  longer-running  of  these 
conflicts  in  Poso  and  Ambon.  The  resulting  agreements  were  called 
Malino  I  (for  Poso)  and  Malino  II  (for  Ambon),  after  the  location  of 
the  negotiations.  Malino  II  has  largely  held,  but  peace  has  not  yet 
fully  returned  to  Poso.  Kalla  trumpeted  his  role  in  these  accords  in 
helping  Yudhoyono  win  the  2004  presidential  election  and  drew  on 
these  experiences  in  dealings  with  Aceh  as  vice  president. 

Civil  Society 

Indonesia's  post-New  Order  democracy  has  a  civil  society  that  is 
vibrant  but  that  also  has  fairly  shallow  roots  in  the  broader  citizenry, 
with  certain  important  exceptions.  Most  Indonesian  nongovernmental 
organizations  (NGOs)  are  small  urban  organizations  founded  and 
staffed  by  a  handful  of  former  student  activists  (see  Civil  Society,  ch. 
2).  They  tend  to  claim  to  speak  on  behalf  of  "the  people"  (rakyat) 
broadly  or  of  certain  communities,  but  often  they  have  not  bothered 
to  reach  out  to,  educate,  or  mobilize  those  communities.  Many  of 
these  organizations  fail  to  attract  significant  support  and  are  short- 
lived; those  with  larger  budgets  are  often  dependent  on  foreign-donor 
funding.  This  leaves  them  open  to  charges  by  conservative  national- 
ists that  they  are  puppets  of  foreign  governmental  interests. 

The  proliferation  of  NGOs  since  the  late  1970s  is  an  indicator  of 
the  increased  diversity  of  society,  the  growth  of  a  modern  middle 
class,  and  the  penetration  of  the  political  culture  by  issues  of  global 
concern.  These  organizations  raise  issues  ranging  from  human  rights 
and  the  rule  of  law  to  corruption  and  environmental  degradation. 
Despite  the  fact  that  most  NGOs  are  small  grassroots  organizations 


285 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

that  focus  on  economic  development  and  social-welfare  issues,  many 
of  the  more  prominent  NGOs  are  aggressively  intervening  in  areas  of 
agrarian  or  other  fundamental  human  rights.  In  the  1990s,  these  orga- 
nizations also  provided  a  new  outlet  for  student  activism,  confined 
since  the  1970s  to  nonpolitical  behavior.  University  students  found 
both  a  cause  and  a  vehicle  for  renewed  social  involvement.  This  repo- 
liticization  and  organizing  experience  laid  the  groundwork  for  the 
student  movement  of  1998  that  toppled  Suharto. 

Religious  organizations  of  all  denominations  are  the  primary 
exceptions  to  the  rule  regarding  the  shallow  nature  of  Indonesian 
civil  society.  These  organizations,  most  prominently  the  two  largest 
Muslim  associations,  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  Muhammadiyah,  had 
been  the  most  successful  at  resisting  New  Order  control.  It  is  not  a 
coincidence  that  two  of  the  most  prominent  leaders  of  the  reformasi 
movement,  Abdurrahman  Wahid  and  Amien  Rais,  were  the  national 
chairs  of  Nahdlatul  Ulama  and  Muhammadiyah,  respectively.  In  the 
1980s  and  1990s,  religious  organizations  also  had  spawned  dozens 
of  affiliated  NGOs,  as  younger  leaders  wanted  to  translate  their  faith 
into  social  activism  but  found  that  the  parent  organizations  were  not 
nimble  enough  to  do  so.  However,  the  parent  organizations'  national 
networks  and  penetration  down  to  the  village  level  became  a  valu- 
able resource  during  the  transition  to  democracy,  as  they  played  a 
prominent  role  in  such  activities  as  civic  and  voter  education  as  well 
as  election  monitoring.  This  involvement  demonstrated  to  both  Indo- 
nesian citizens  and  the  world  at  large  that  religion  (particularly 
Islam)  and  democracy  are  not  incompatible. 

The  legal  framework  supporting  a  healthy  civil  society  is  much 
stronger  than  during  the  Suharto  era.  President  Habibie  scrapped  the 
rule  forcing  all  organizations  to  adopt  Pancasila  as  their  sole  ideolog- 
ical basis.  The  new  chapter  in  the  constitution  on  human  rights  con- 
tains unequivocal  statements  guaranteeing  the  freedoms  of  speech 
and  assembly.  Equally  important,  these  clauses  do  not  just  exist  on 
paper  but  also  are  being  enforced.  For  instance,  in  two  separate  land- 
mark rulings  in  2006  and  2007,  the  Constitutional  Court  struck  down 
the  sections  of  the  criminal  code  that  outlawed  defamation  of  the 
president  and  other  political  leaders  and  criticism  of  the  state.  These 
sections  derived  from  Dutch  colonial  laws  designed  to  muzzle  nation- 
alist leaders,  and  authoritarian  and  democratic  leaders  alike  had  used 
them  against  government  critics. 

The  Media 

Indonesia's  new-found  freedoms  have  been  felt  most  strongly  by 
the  media.  Long  suppressed  and  harassed  by  the  New  Order,  the  Indo- 


286 


Government  and  Politics 


nesian  press  is  now  among  the  freest  and  liveliest  in  Asia.  The  trend 
toward  somewhat  greater  pluralism  and  openness  had  begun  in  the 
late  New  Order,  when  the  regime  allowed  the  founding  of  a  number  of 
new  television  and  radio  stations.  (The  television  stations  all  had  to  be 
Jakarta-based  at  first.)  Many  of  the  new  television  stations  enjoyed 
penetration  rates  of  around  70  to  80  percent  of  the  population  within  a 
few  years.  Although  the  television  licenses  were  all  given  to  various 
Suharto  family  members,  cronies,  and  other  wealthy  conglomerates, 
competition  for  advertising  revenue  and  a  large  potential  national 
audience  meant  that  some  of  these  stations  were  tempted  to  push  the 
boundaries,  especially  regarding  the  ban  on  news  programs  other  than 
those  produced  by  the  state-run  Television  of  the  Republic  of  Indone- 
sia (TVRI).  These  stations  were  very  lucrative,  so  it  became  difficult 
for  the  regime  to  punish  its  own  cronies  by  shutting  down  a  station  if 
it  crossed  the  line  by  broadcasting  independently  produced  news.  Sun 
Television  (SCTV)  and  Hawk  Television  Indonesia  (RCTI)  news  pro- 
grams, in  particular,  were  very  popular  with  viewers  across  the  coun- 
try as  an  alternative,  albeit  still  relatively  tame,  to  the  stultifying 
TVRI  (see  Post  and  Telecommunications,  ch.  3).  Broadcasting  is  reg- 
ulated by  the  government  through  the  Directorate  General  of  Radio, 
Television,  and  Film. 

Thousands  of  new  print  publications  and  radio  stations  have  started 
up  across  the  country,  and  more  television  broadcasters,  including 
regional  stations,  have  licenses  since  the  transition  to  democracy.  The 
government  cannot  revoke  these  publishing  and  broadcasting  licenses 
based  on  what  the  outlets  write  and  say.  President  Wahid  further  weak- 
ened the  government's  ability  to  control  the  media  when  he  abolished 
the  Department  of  Information  at  the  outset  of  his  administration.  The 
censorship  board  for  motion  pictures  remained  in  existence,  however, 
mainly  to  police  "public  morality"  (nudity,  sexuality)  rather  than  polit- 
ical statements,  and  President  Megawati  reestablished  the  Department 
of  Information  on  her  ascension  to  power.  In  the  absence  of  significant 
government  repression,  spurious  defamation  lawsuits  by  private  indi- 
viduals have  become  the  principal  means  of  stifling  media  scrutiny. 
The  most  prominent  of  these  cases  involved  businessman  Tomy 
Winata,  who  sued  Tempo  editor  in  chief  Bambang  Harymurti.  Hary- 
murti  was  convicted  and  given  a  one-year  prison  sentence,  which  the 
Supreme  Court  overturned. 

More  than  50  principal  daily  newspapers  are  published  throughout 
the  archipelago,  the  majority  in  Java.  Those  with  the  largest  reader- 
ship are  Kompas  (Jakarta),  circulation  of  523,000;  Suara  Merdeka 
(Semarang),  circulation  of  200,000;  Berita  Buana  (Jakarta),  circula- 
tion of  150,000;  Pikiran  Rakyat  (Bandung),  circulation  of  150,000; 


287 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

and  Sinar  Indonesia  Baru  (Medan),  also  with  a  circulation  of 
150,000.  The  largest  English-language  dailies,  both  published  in 
Jakarta  with  print  runs  of  40,000,  are  the  Jakarta  Post  and  the  Jakarta 
Globe.  The  principal  weekly  news  magazines  are  Tempo,  which  also 
produces  an  English-language  edition,  and  Gatra.  All  of  these  news- 
papers and  magazines  have  online  editions  as  well. 

Foreign  Policy 

Political  Considerations 

The  internal  dynamics  of  Indonesian  politics  since  independence 
have  been  linked  to  an  external  environment  perceived  as  inherently 
dangerous.  Indonesian  foreign  policy  has  had  as  its  most  important 
goals  security  of  the  state  and  territorial  integrity.  The  jurisdictional 
boundaries  of  the  state  were  greatly  expanded  with  the  incorporation 
of  the  "archipelago  principle"  into  the  new  international  law  of  the 
sea,  a  new  regime  codified  as  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the 
Sea  in  1982.  The  archipelago  principle  effectively  territorialized  all 
ocean  space  inside  straight  baselines  drawn  from  the  farthest  points 
of  the  most  distant  islands  of  Indonesia,  thus  giving  new  sanction  to 
the  Indonesian  doctrine  of  the  political  and  security  unity  of  archipe- 
lagic land  and  sea  space  (wawasan  nusantara),  first  promulgated  in 
the  1950s  (see  National  Territory:  Rights,  Responsibilities,  and  Chal- 
lenges, ch.  2). 

Sukarno's  response  to  challenge  was  to  attack  the  status  quo,  to 
"live  dangerously,"  to  cite  his  1964  Independence  Day  address,  "A 
Year  of  Living  Dangerously."  Beginning  with  Suharto,  the  approach 
of  subsequent  governments  has  been  one  of  cooperation  and  accom- 
modation in  order  to  gain  international  support  for  Indonesia's  polit- 
ical stability  and  economic  development  while,  at  the  same  time, 
maintaining  its  freedom  of  action.  Nonetheless,  Indonesia's  level  of 
engagement  with  the  rest  of  the  world  has  fluctuated,  mainly  depen- 
dent on  domestic  developments:  it  was  high  under  Sukarno,  in  the 
latter  half  of  Suharto's  three  decades  in  power,  and  again  in  the  early 
twenty-first  century,  but  low  in  the  first  half  of  the  New  Order  and  in 
the  transitional  period  after  the  1997-98  Asian  financial  crisis. 

Sukarno  relished  leading  the  "new  emerging  forces"  against  the 
"old  established  forces,"  whereas  subsequent  governments  have 
turned  to  the  Western  developed  economies  for  assistance.  From 
1 967  to  1991,  countries  aiding  Indonesia  organized  as  a  consortium 
in  the  Inter-Governmental  Group  on  Indonesia  (IGGI — see  Glos- 
sary), subsequently  reorganized  in  1992  without  the  Netherlands — 
and  with  Japan  as  chair — as  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia 


288 


Government  and  Politics 


(CGI — see  Glossary).  These  countries,  along  with  the  World  Bank 
and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (see  Glossary),  gave  massive  eco- 
nomic assistance,  amounting  in  the  2006  budget  to  more  than 
US$5.4  billion  in  loans  and  grants.  Even  after  the  Indonesian  gov- 
ernment disbanded  the  CGI  in  2007,  foreign  assistance  continues  on 
a  bilateral  basis.  The  pragmatic,  low-profile  style  of  post-Sukarno 
administrations  has  been  a  far  cry  from  the  radical  internationalism 
and  confrontational  anti-imperialism  of  his  foreign  policy,  although 
there  has  been  some  continuity  in  a  nationalism  that  colored  Indone- 
sia's perceptions  of  its  role  in  the  region.  The  promotion  of  Islamic 
international  political  interests  has  not  been  high  on  the  Indonesian 
foreign-policy  agenda,  despite  Indonesia's  having  the  world's  largest 
Muslim  population.  Indonesia  is  a  member  of  the  Organization  of 
the  Islamic  Conference  (OIC),  but,  unlike  Malaysia,  has  not  aspired 
to  a  major  role  in  that  organization. 

Following  two  decades  of  New  Order  "low-profile"  foreign  policy, 
by  Suharto's  fourth  term  (1983-88)  a  more  assertive  Indonesian  voice 
on  foreign  policy  was  heard,  as  Jakarta  began  to  reaffirm  its  claim  to  a 
leadership  position,  both  regionally  and  worldwide,  corresponding  to 
its  geographic  vastness,  resource  endowment,  population,  and  political 
stability.  After  an  international  rehabilitative  period,  Indonesia  rejoined 
the  community  of  nations,  broke  the  Jakarta-Phnom  Penh-Hanoi-Bei- 
jing-Pyongyang axis,  ended  the  Indonesian-Malaysian  Confrontation 
(Konfrontasi — see  Glossary),  worked  to  strengthen  ASEAN,  forged 
cooperative  nonthreatening  links  with  its  neighbors,  and  became  a 
moderating  voice  in  developing  world  forums.  By  the  early  1990s, 
Indonesia,  which  American  scholar  Donald  K.  Emmerson  could  still 
describe  as  "invisible"  in  1987,  had  become  apparent  both  as  a  regional 
power  and  a  major  developing  world  voice  in  the  global  political  and 
economic  arenas.  In  1992  Indonesian  foreign  policy  reflected  a  proud 
national  identity  and  what  British  scholar  Michael  Leifer  called  its 
"sense  of  regional  entitlement." 

Indonesia's  full  reemergence  on  the  world  stage  was  highlighted  in 
September  1992  when  it  hosted  the  Nonaligned  Movement  summit,  an 
acknowledgment  of  its  credentials  to  speak  authoritatively  in  the 
developing  world.  Indonesia  had  hosted  the  Asia-Africa  Conference 
in  Bandung  in  1955  and  was  a  founding  member  of  the  Nonaligned 
Movement  in  1961.  Its  adherence  to  and  promotion  of  the  ideals  of 
nonalignment  had  been  one  of  the  few  consistencies  between  the  for- 
eign policies  of  the  Old  Order  and  New  Order  governments.  At  the 
same  time,  Indonesia  was  the  only  founding  member  that  had  not 
hosted  a  Nonaligned  Movement  summit,  as  a  result  of  the  unpopular- 
ity in  the  developing  world  of  some  of  its  policy  positions:  its  domestic 


289 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

anticommunism,  cold  relations  with  China,  incorporation  of  East 
Timor  as  Timor  Timur  Province,  and  solidarity  with  ASEAN  on  the 
Cambodian  issue.  Suharto  used  the  summit  to  begin  the  effort  of  shift- 
ing the  Nonaligned  Movement  agenda  from  its  traditional  concerns  to 
the  economic  and  social  issues  confronting  the  developing  world.  The 
Jakarta  Message,  the  summit's  final  communique,  reflected  Suharto's 
call  in  his  opening  speech  for  a  constructive  dialog  between  the  devel- 
oped and  developing  nations,  warning  that  North-South  polarization 
loomed  as  "the  central  unresolved  issue  of  our  time."  In  an  expression 
of  Indonesia's  pride  in  its  own  development,  Suharto  offered  technical 
assistance  to  countries  with  food  and  population  problems.  As  chair- 
man of  the  Nonaligned  Movement,  Suharto  brought  the  Jakarta  Mes- 
sage to  the  1992  session  of  the  UN  General  Assembly. 

All  of  this  new-found  constructive  activism  ended  in  1997-98  as  the 
economy  collapsed  under  the  weight  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  and 
Suharto  was  forced  to  resign.  With  the  exception  of  President  Habibie's 
engagement  with  the  UN  on  a  referendum  for  East  Timor,  Indonesia 
once  again  slipped  into  the  shadows  of  the  world  stage  as  it  sorted  out 
its  economic  woes  and  domestic  political  transition.  This  shroud  of 
invisibility  only  began  to  lift — for  all  the  wrong  reasons — in  October 
2002,  with  the  first  Bali  bombing  and  the  subsequent  roughly  annual 
terrorist  attacks  in  Jakarta  and  Bali  from  2003  to  2005,  which  contrib- 
uted to  making  Southeast  Asia  the  "second  front"  in  President  George 
W.  Bush's  "global  war  on  terrorism."  Only  under  President  Yudhoyono 
has  Indonesia  once  again  returned  to  a  constructively  activist  foreign 
policy  profile.  This  shift  has  been  most  evident  in  Indonesia's  contribu- 
tion of  troops,  including  Yudhoyono 's  elder  son,  Agus  Harimurti,  a 
junior  army  officer,  to  the  UN  peacekeeping  force  in  Lebanon  after  the 
2006  war  between  Israel  and  Hezbollah.  Indonesian  military  or  police 
contingents  also  were  deployed  in  Congo  and  Sudan.  The  shift  has  also 
been  reflected  in  Yudhoyono 's  offers  to  assist  with  resolution  of  con- 
flicts in  Iraq,  Iran,  the  Korean  Peninsula,  and  Burma. 

Participation  in  ASEAN 

Since  its  founding  on  August  8,  1967,  ASEAN  has  been  a  major 
focus  of  Indonesia's  regional  international  relations,  and  Jakarta  is 
the  site  of  ASEAN 's  general  secretariat.  Founding  members  Indone- 
sia, Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand  helped  con- 
struct a  regional  multinational  framework  to  facilitate  economic 
cooperation,  diminish  intra-ASEAN  conflict,  and  formulate  ASEAN 
positions  regarding  potential  external  threats.  Brunei  joined  in  1984, 
and  ASEAN  further  expanded  in  the  late  1990s  with  the  accession  of 
Vietnam  (1995),  Laos  and  Burma  (1997),  and  Cambodia  (1999).  In 


290 


2009  the  organization  was  considering  Timor-Leste's  application  for 
membership. 

These  countries  were  not  always  so  cooperative  with  one  another. 
In  1963  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia  both  tried  to  prevent  or  delay 
the  formation  of  the  Federation  of  Malaysia,  the  Philippines  because 
it  had  its  own  claim  to  Sabah  (formerly  North  Borneo)  and  Indonesia 
because  it  suspected  a  British  imperialist  plot.  Indonesia  soon  turned 
to  political  and  military  confrontation,  an  attempt  to  undermine  the 
new  state  of  Malaysia.  Sukarno's  radical  anti-Western  rhetoric,  com- 
bined with  the  growing  strength  of  the  PKI,  marked  Indonesia  as  a 
disturber  of  the  regional  international  order  rather  than  a  coopera- 
tive, peaceful  contributor  to  it. 

By  1967  Indonesia's  disruptive  stance  had  changed.  ASEAN  pro- 
vided a  framework  for  the  termination  of  the  Confrontation,  allow- 
ing Indonesia  to  rejoin  the  regional  community  of  nations  in  a 
nonthreatening  setting.  Furthermore,  the  five  founding  members  of 
ASEAN  now  shared  common  policies  of  domestic  anticommunism. 
The  ASEAN  process  of  decision  making  by  consensus  allowed 
Indonesia  to  dictate  the  pace  of  change  within  the  organization. 
Some  observers  asserted  that  ASEAN  moved  only  at  the  pace  of  its 
slowest  member,  which  often  was  Indonesia.  With  ASEAN  increas- 
ingly seen  as  a  symbol  of  regional  peace  and  stability,  its  strength 
became  an  end  in  itself  in  Indonesian  foreign  policy.  Suharto  became 
ASEAN's  elder  statesman  by  the  time  of  ASEAN 's  Fourth  Summit, 
held  in  Singapore  January  27-29,  1992.  He  was  the  only  head  of 
government  at  ASEAN's  1967  establishment  to  attend  the  ASEAN 


291 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

First  Summit,  held  in  Bali,  February  23-24,  1976,  who  was  still  head 
of  government  in  the  early  1990s.  In  the  meantime,  Indonesia  had 
played  a  key  role  in  resolving  the  Cambodian  conflict,  setting  the 
stage  for  ASEAN's  expansion  to  encompass  nearly  all  of  the  region 
by  the  end  of  the  millennium. 

Indonesia,  ASEAN,  and  the  Cambodian  Conflict 

The  official  ASEAN  response,  formulated  by  Indonesia,  to  Viet- 
nam's December  1978  invasion  of  Cambodia,  was  to  deplore  the 
invasion  and  call  for  the  withdrawal  of  foreign  forces  from  Cambo- 
dia. Indonesia  and  other  ASEAN  members  immediately  placed  the 
issue  on  the  agenda  of  the  UN  Security  Council.  However,  deep  dif- 
ferences soon  arose  between  Indonesia  and  Thailand.  Although  com- 
pelled to  make  a  show  of  solidarity  with  Thailand  by  its  interest  in 
sustaining  ASEAN,  Indonesia  began  to  see  the  prolongation  of  the 
war  in  Cambodia,  the  "bleeding  Vietnam  white"  strategy,  as  not 
being  in  its  or  the  region's  interests.  Although  never  retreating  from 
ASEAN's  central  demands  of  Vietnamese  withdrawal  from  Cambo- 
dia and  Khmer  self-determination,  Indonesia  actively  sought  to 
engage  the  Khmers  and  Vietnamese  and  their  external  sponsors  in  a 
search  of  a  settlement  that  would  recognize  legitimate  interests  on  all 
sides.  Indonesia  opened  what  came  to  be  called  "dual-track"  diplo- 
macy, in  which  it  pursued  bilateral  political  communication  with 
Vietnam  while  maintaining  its  commitment  to  the  ASEAN  formula. 
By  1986  ASEAN  had  accepted  Indonesia  as  its  official  "interlocu- 
tor" with  Vietnam.  From  1982  to  the  signing  of  the  Final  Act  of  the 
Paris  International  Conference  on  Cambodia  on  October  23,  1991, 
Indonesian  diplomacy  played  a  central  role  in  peace  negotiations 
that  led  to  the  deployment  of  forces  of  the  UN  Transitional  Authority 
in  Cambodia  (UNTAC). 

Indonesia's  sense  of  achievement  and  pride  in  its  role  in  bringing 
peace  to  Indochina  was  reflected  in  three  events.  On  November  12, 
1990,  Suharto  arrived  in  Hanoi  for  the  first  meeting  between  an 
ASEAN  head  of  government  and  a  Vietnamese  counterpart  since  Pre- 
mier Pham  Van  Dong  visited  Thailand's  Prime  Minister  Kriangsak 
Chomanan  in  1977.  On  March  15,  1992,  Japan's  Akashi  Yasushi,  the 
UN  undersecretary  general  for  disarmament  and  newly  appointed 
head  of  UNTAC,  arrived  in  Phnom  Penh  to  be  greeted  by  a  color 
guard  of  Indonesian  troops  who  were  part  of  the  first  full  battalion- 
sized  contingent  of  UNTAC  peacekeepers  dispatched  to  Cambodia.  At 
the  peak  deployment  of  foreign  peacekeeping  forces  in  late  1992, 
Indonesia  had  the  largest  force  in  Cambodia  with  nearly  2,000  mili- 
tary and  police  personnel,  representing  10  percent  of  the  total.  Finally,

in  mid- 1991,  fresh  from  diplomatic  success  in  helping  to  end  the 
Cambodian  civil  war,  Indonesia  took  the  initiative  in  seeking  to  open 
multilateral  negotiations  on  competitive  South  China  Sea  claims, 
especially  those  claims  involving  jurisdictional  disputes  over  the 
Spratly  Islands.  Indonesia's  gradually  assertive  role  in  the  Cambodian 
peace  effort  demonstrated  that  Jakarta  was  not  entirely  willing  to  place 
its  commitment  to  ASEAN  solidarity  above  its  own  national  interests. 
According  to  leading  Indonesian  academic  Dewi  Fortuna  Anwar,  the 
"challenge  for  Indonesian  foreign  policy  in  the  future  is  how  to  main- 
tain a  balance  between  an  ASEAN  policy  which  requires  goodwill  and 
trust  of  the  other  members,  and  satisfying  some  of  the  internationalist 
aspirations  of  a  growing  number  of  the  Indonesian  political  elite." 

Reorienting  ASEAN  in  a  Post-Cold  War  Context 

The  resolution  of  the  Cambodian  conflict,  combined  with  the  dra- 
matically altered  balance  of  power  in  the  region,  raised  the  question 
of  what  new  political  cement  might  hold  ASEAN  together  in  the 
post-Cold  War  environment  throughout  the  1990s  and  2000s.  Com- 
petitive claims  by  the  nations  involved  in  the  jurisdictional  competi- 
tion in  the  South  China  Sea  had  the  potential  for  conflict  but  did  not 
pose  a  direct  threat  to  ASEAN's  collective  security  interest,  as  had 
the  Vietnamese  invasion  and  occupation  of  Cambodia  (see  Relations 
with  East  Asia,  this  ch.).  The  answer  has  come  in  the  nature  of  the 
post-Cold  War  environment  itself:  global  unipolarity  combined  with 
regional  multipolarity.  The  end  of  the  global  bipolarity  of  the  Cold 
War  has  resulted  in  the  hegemony  of  the  United  States  and  ended  the 
ability  of  Southeast  Asian  states  to  play  off  one  superpower  against 
the  other.  Regional  solidarity  has  come  to  be  seen  as  the  appropriate 
response  to  counterbalance  a  global  hegemon.  The  importance  of 
regional  solidarity  has  been  enhanced  by  the  political,  military,  and 
economic  rise  since  the  1980s  of  China  and  more  recently  of  India, 
joining  longtime  powers  Russia,  Japan,  and  Australia  in  increasing 
Asia's  geostrategic  complexity.  Indonesia  has  decided  that  only  as 
part  of  a  regional  bloc  can  it  (and  Southeast  Asia  as  a  whole)  fend  for 
itself  in  this  increasingly  competitive  environment. 

Indonesia  has  been  solidly  supportive  of  ASEAN's  response,  which 
has  been  first  to  expand  to  encompass  nearly  all  of  Southeast  Asia  (in 
the  1990s)  and  then  to  deepen  both  its  internal  cooperation  as  well  as 
its  relationships  with  regional  and  global  powers  (in  the  twenty-first 
century).  To  facilitate  internal  cooperation,  the  member  states  in  2003 
streamlined  the  organization's  various  efforts  into  three  pillars:  the 
ASEAN  Security  Community,  building  on  the  1971  Zone  of  Peace, 
Freedom,  and  Neutrality  (ZOPFAN),  the  1976  Treaty  of  Amity  and 


293 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Cooperation  in  Southeast  Asia  (TAC),  and  the  1997  Treaty  on  the 
Southeast  Asia  Nuclear  Weapon-Free  Zone;  the  ASEAN  Economic 
Community  Blueprint;  and  the  ASEAN  Socio-Cultural  Community. 
This  legal  and  institutional  framework  was  further  strengthened  with 
the  adoption  of  the  ASEAN  Charter,  which  came  into  force  on 
December  15,  2008.  External  relationships  include:  since  1987  allow- 
ing non-Southeast  Asian  states  to  accede  to  the  TAC  (those  that  have 
done  so  include  Australia,  Britain,  China,  France,  India,  Japan,  Mon- 
golia, New  Zealand,  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North 
Korea),  Pakistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Russia,  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea),  Sri  Lanka,  Timor-Leste,  and  the  United  States);  estab- 
lishing the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum  (ARF)  in  1994;  and  inaugurating 
ASEAN  Plus  Three  (China,  Japan,  and  South  Korea)  in  1999. 

Indonesia's  support  for  the  internal  and  external  expansion  of 
ASEAN 's  reach  represented  an  important  shift  in  its  strategic  think- 
ing; in  ASEAN's  first  three  decades,  Indonesia  was  reluctant  to  cede 
any  significant  authority  to  the  supranational  organization  or  to  tie 
other  powers  too  closely  to  it;  for  example,  Indonesia  had  previously 
resisted  the  urging  of  some  ASEAN  members  that  the  organization 
formally  adopt  a  more  explicit  common  political-security  identity. 
Indonesia  successfully  opposed  Singapore's  proposal  at  the  ASEAN 
Fourth  Summit  in  1992  that  would  have  invited  the  UN  Security 
Council's  five  permanent  members  to  accede  to  the  TAC.  In  part, 
Indonesian  ambivalence  about  an  ASEAN  security  role,  together  with 
its  reluctance  to  mesh  its  economy  with  an  ASEAN  regional  econ- 
omy, had  arisen  from  Indonesia's  desire  to  keep  its  options  open  as  it 
pursued  its  interests,  not  just  as  an  ASEAN  member,  but  as  an 
increasingly  important  Asia-Pacific  regional  power. 

The  economic  and  political  turmoil  generated  by  the  1997-98 
Asian  financial  crisis  sidetracked  Indonesia's  efforts  to  enhance  its  sta- 
tus as  an  important  middle  power  for  about  a  decade.  In  the  aftermath 
of  that  crisis,  as  well  as  in  the  context  of  post-Cold  War  global  and 
regional  power  structures,  Indonesia  has  concluded  that  its  own  politi- 
cal and  economic  security  interests  are  best  served  by  strengthening 
ASEAN.  To  avoid  a  repeat  of  the  financial  crisis,  within  the  organiza- 
tion Indonesia  has  supported  the  Roadmap  for  Financial  and  Monetary 
Integration  of  ASEAN  (a  part  of  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community), 
and  externally  the  ASEAN  Plus  Three  forum  has  launched  the  Chiang 
Mai  Initiative  to  address  regional  financial  stability. 

Indonesia's  fundamental  interests  have  not  changed  substantially, 
and  Indonesian  nationalism  retains  a  xenophobic  streak.  One  of  the 
country's  most  consistent  foreign-policy  goals  has  been  to  reduce 
regional  dependence  on  external  military  powers.  It  has  also  worked 
assiduously  to  dampen  or  end  regional  conflicts  that  often  have  cre- 


294 


Government  and  Politics 


ated  openings  for  greater  external  meddling  in  the  region's  affairs. 
What  has  changed  is  Indonesia's  perception  of  the  most  effective 
means  to  serve  these  interests.  As  a  valuable  instrument  for  wielding 
noncoercive  regional  influence  and  gaining  attention  in  the  wider 
international  arena,  ASEAN  has  become  one  of  the  platforms  from 
which  Indonesia  can  enhance  its  profile  as  a  middle  power  with  inter- 
national aspirations. 

Relations  with  Neighboring  Nations 

Fears  on  the  part  of  Indonesia's  neighbors  in  previous  decades  that 
its  desire  to  play  a  larger  international  role  would  also  carry  with  it  an 
inclination  to  become  a  regional  hegemon  have  been  much  reduced  in 
the  twenty-first  century.  Indonesia's  abandonment  of  support  for  the 
East  Timorese  pro-integration  militias  after  their  forcible  ejection  into 
West  Timor  (Nusa  Tenggara  Timur  Province)  in  late  1999  by  the  UN- 
mandated  International  Force  in  East  Timor  (INTERFET,  1999- 
2000),  its  positive  response  to  the  independent  government  of  Timor- 
Leste's  proffer  of  peace,  and  its  efforts  to  convince  Burma's  junta  to 
pursue  meaningful  national  reconciliation  have  helped  erase  the  mem- 
ories of  Sukarno's  and  Suharto's  more  expansive  foreign  policies. 

Timor-Leste 

Timor-Leste,  the  former  Portuguese  Timor  and  then  East  Timor, 
was  incorporated  into  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  in  1976  as  Timor 
Timur  Province,  although  Portugal  never  recognized  what  it  saw  as 
forcible  annexation.  The  status  of  East  Timor  also  remained  on  the 
UN  agenda.  Indonesia  had  invaded  in  December  1975  in  reaction  to  a 
chaotic  decolonization  process  that  had  led  to  civil  war.  The  human 
cost  of  the  civil  war,  Indonesian  military  actions,  and  the  famine  that 
followed  was  heavy.  Estimates  of  Timorese  deaths  between  1975  and 
1999  because  of  the  conflict  range  from  100,000  to  250,000,  out  of  a 
total  population  of  less  than  1  million.  The  ability  of  the  Revolution- 
ary Front  for  an  Independent  East  Timor  (Fretilin — see  Glossary)  to 
mount  a  low-intensity  resistance,  the  draconian  countermeasures 
adopted  by  Indonesian  military  forces  against  suspected  Fretilin  sym- 
pathizers, and  charges  of  Indonesian  aggression  combined  to  make 
the  status  of  East  Timor  a  continuing  foreign-policy  problem  for 
Indonesia  through  the  late  1990s. 

When  President  Habibie  took  over  in  May  1998,  his  advisers  sug- 
gested bold  initiatives  to  address  the  problem.  In  early  1999,  Habibie 
announced  that  Indonesia  would  allow  the  UN  to  administer  a  refer- 
endum in  the  province  on  August  30.  Although  formally  the  question 
posed  to  the  East  Timorese  was  whether  or  not  they  supported  having 


295 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

special  autonomous  status  within  Indonesia,  it  was  understood  that  a 
"No"  vote  meant  support  for  independence.  The  referendum  offer  was 
apparently  based  on  faulty  intelligence  that  claimed  majority  support 
in  the  province  for  integration.  Instead  of  emphasizing  the  benefits  of 
remaining  a  province  of  Indonesia,  the  military  and  intelligence  appa- 
ratus supported  pro-integration  militia  forces  that  used  threats  and 
force  in  an  attempt  to  frighten  the  populace  into  a  pro-Indonesia  vote. 
The  use  of  cellular  phones,  camcorders,  and  the  Internet  brought 
scenes  of  violence  and  intimidation  to  the  outside  world  and  caused  a 
storm  of  criticism  against  ^Indonesia's  government  and  its  armed 
forces.  Despite  the  intimidation,  the  referendum  itself  proceeded 
smoothly,  with  98.6  percent  turnout  and  78.5  percent  voting  against 
integration.  Within  days  of  the  referendum,  as  these  results  became 
increasingly  clear,  the  pro-integration  militias  went  on  a  rampage, 
implementing  a  well-planned  scorched-earth  campaign.  Although  ini- 
tial reports  of  mass  killings  later  turned  out  to  be  exaggerated,  hun- 
dreds of  thousands  of  Timorese  were  internally  displaced  or  became 
refugees  streaming  across  the  land  border  into  West  Timor.  Army  and 
militia  forces  destroyed  much  of  East  Timor's  infrastructure  in  the 
process.  The  situation  only  stabilized  when  INTERFET,  led  by  Aus- 
tralia, arrived  to  restore  order.  The  UN  then  established  a  civilian 
administration,  the  UN  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor 
(UNTAET),  to  run  the  country  and  prepare  it  for  independence,  which 
came  on  May  20,  2002. 

Despite  the  brutal  history  shared  by  Indonesia  and  Timor-Leste, 
the  two  nations'  relations  since  2002  have  been  surprisingly  cordial. 
Given  Timor-Leste 's  small  size,  geographic  isolation,  and  depen- 
dence on  Indonesia  for  imports  of  foodstuffs,  fuel,  and  other  vital 
commodities,  it  has  not  wished  to  antagonize  its  much  more  power- 
ful neighbor.  Indonesia,  to  its  credit,  since  September  1999  has  not 
attempted  further  military  or  militia  interference  in  Timor-Leste  and 
has  welcomed  the  latter's  offer  of  reconciliation  as  a  way  to  counter 
criticism  by  international  human-rights  groups,  block  attempts  to  set 
up  an  international  criminal  tribunal,  and  burnish  its  reputation  on 
the  world  stage.  However,  Indonesia  has  not  been  cooperative  in  the 
various  efforts  regarding  truth,  justice,  and  accountability  for  the 
serious  crimes  against  humanity  that  took  place  in  the  province 
between  1975  and  1999  (see  East  Timor,  ch.  5). 

Papua  New  Guinea 

In  1975  Papua  New  Guinea  gained  independence  from  an  Australian- 
administered  UN  trusteeship.  Since  then  the  760-kilometer-long  border  it 
shares  with  Indonesia's  Papua  Province  has  been  a  focus  of  mutual  sus- 


296 


Government  and  Politics 


picion.  Indonesia  has  sought  through  diplomacy  and  intimidation  to  pre- 
vent Papua  New  Guinea  from  becoming  a  cross-border  sanctuary  for 
Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM)  separatists.  Port  Moresby's  policy  on 
the  border  situation  was  conditioned  by  fears  of  Indonesian  expansion- 
ism and  sympathy  for  West  Papuan  efforts  to  defend  their  cultural  iden- 
tity against  Indonesianization.  The  Papua  New  Guinea  government  was 
also  keenly  aware  of  the  military  imbalance  between  the  two  countries. 

Talks  to  draw  up  a  new  agreement  to  regulate  relations  and  define 
rights  and  obligations  along  the  border  culminated  in  the  signing  on 
October  27,  1986,  of  the  Treaty  of  Mutual  Respect,  Cooperation,  and 
Friendship.  The  treaty  was,  in  effect,  a  bilateral  nonaggression  pact 
in  which  the  two  sides  agreed  to  "avoid,  reduce  and  contain  disputes 
or  conflicts  between  their  nations  and  settle  any  differences  that  may 
arise  only  by  peaceful  means"  (Article  2),  and  promised  that  they 
"shall  not  threaten  or  use  force  against  each  other"  (Article  7).  The 
treaty  also  provided  a  basis  for  building  a  lasting  framework  of 
peace  and  cooperation.  The  structure  for  peace  was  enhanced  by  the 
1987  ASEAN  decision  to  allow  Papua  New  Guinea  to  become  the 
first  non- ASEAN  country  to  accede  to  the  TAC.  Indonesia  has  con- 
tinued, however,  to  block  Papua  New  Guinea's  promotion  from 
observer  status  to  full  ASEAN  membership. 

The  1986  treaty  left  many  issues  unresolved.  It  did  not  solve,  for 
example,  the  problem  of  Indonesian  Papuan  refugees  in  Papua  New 
Guinea.  Furthermore,  Papua  New  Guinea  did  not  agree  to  joint  security 
operations  in  the  border  regions,  and  Indonesia  did  not  give  categorical 
assurance  that  its  military,  in  all  circumstances,  would  not  cross  the 
border.  Criticism  of  Jakarta's  policies  in  Papua  persisted  in  Port 
Moresby.  In  addition,  Indonesia  was  accused  of  covert  intervention  in 
Papua  New  Guinea's  domestic  politics.  Nevertheless,  the  tension  and 
threat- filled  atmosphere  that  clouded  the  first  decade  of  bilateral  rela- 
tions dissipated  considerably.  In  1990  the  two  countries  signed  a  new 
10-year  border  agreement.  In  January  1992,  in  the  course  of  a  state  visit 
by  Papua  New  Guinea's  prime  minister,  Rabbie  Namaliu,  the  defense 
ministers  of  the  two  countries  signed  a  "status  of  forces"  agreement 
regulating  rights  and  obligations  when  on  each  other's  territory. 
Although  the  two  parties  denied  that  the  agreement  provided  for  joint 
security  operations,  the  possibility  of  rights  for  Indonesian  "hot  pur- 
suit" seemed  to  exist.  At  that  time,  Namaliu,  reviewing  the  course  of 
relations  since  the  1986  treaty,  said,  "ties  have  never  been  better." 

Further  improvement  in  the  bilateral  relationship  was  marked  by 
Vice  President  Megawati's  state  visit  to  celebrate  the  twenty-fifth 
anniversary  of  Papua  New  Guinea's  independence  on  September  16, 
2000,  at  which  time  the  two  countries  signed  a  trade  agreement. 


297 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesia  and  Papua  New  Guinea  also  established  a  joint  commis- 
sion to  improve  bilateral  communications;  the  first  meeting  took 
place  on  June  6-8,  2004.  At  the  same  time,  the  two  foreign  ministers 
agreed  to  the  establishment  of  a  mechanism  for  occasional  joint  cab- 
inet meetings.  Nonetheless,  despite  Papua  New  Guinea's  status  as 
one  of  only  three  countries  with  which  Indonesia  shares  a  land  bor- 
der, Indonesia  places  a  much  higher  priority  on  its  relationships  with 
its  other  neighbors,  such  as  Singapore,  Malaysia,  and  Australia. 

Singapore  and  Malaysia  » 

Singapore,  ASEAN 's  own  ethnic  Chinese  financial  and  economic 
powerhouse,  is  geostrategically  locked  in  the  often  suspicious  embrace 
of  its  Indonesian  and  Malaysian  neighbors.  More  than  40  years  after 
the  end  of  Confrontation,  a  racially  tinged,  jealous  Indonesian  ambiva- 
lence toward  Singapore  remains  strong.  On  the  one  hand,  Jakarta  has 
sought  to  link  Singapore's  capital,  technology,  and  managerial  exper- 
tise to  its  own  abundant  natural  resources,  land,  and  labor  in  an  eco- 
nomically integrative  process.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  relationship 
has  been  perceived  as  imbalanced  or  harmful,  old  suspicions  have  been 
revived.  For  instance,  the  Indonesian  government  has  welcomed  Singa- 
porean investment  in  its  telecommunications  sector.  However,  because 
those  investments  issue  from  Singaporean  government-owned  firms 
and  have  involved  purchases  of  shares  of  the  two  leading  Indonesian 
telecommunications  firms,  Indosat  and  Telkomsel,  the  investments 
have  come  under  the  scrutiny  of  Indonesia's  Commission  for  the  Over- 
sight of  Business  Competition  (KPPU).  Former  MPR  speaker,  2004 
presidential  candidate,  and  PAN  chair  Amien  Rais,  well-known  as  a 
sometimes  virulent  economic  nationalist,  has  publicly  supported  the 
KPPU's  scrutiny  of  the  investments.  There  is  also  great  resentment  in 
Indonesia  that  Singapore  has  served  as  the  most  prominent  offshore 
haven  for  Indonesian  crony  capital  flight,  exacerbating  the  1997-98 
financial  crisis,  and  for  harboring  the  fleeing  cronies  themselves.  In 
April  2007,  the  two  countries  signed  an  extradition  treaty,  which  was 
warmly  welcomed  in  Indonesia  as  a  means  of  helping  bring  to  justice 
some  of  the  worst  offenders  in  the  financial  crisis.  However,  a  streak  of 
nationalism  surfaced  again  in  the  DPR,  where  enough  members 
objected  to  certain  provisions  of  a  parallel  defense  arrangement  that  the 
DPR  refused  to  approve  the  treaty. 

This  pattern  of  ambivalence  has  been  replicated  at  the  subnational 
level  over  the  now  largely  stalled  development  of  the  SIJORI  growth 
triangle,  which  includes  Singapore,  Malaysia's  state  of  Johor,  and 
Indonesia's  Riau  Province  (see  Industry,  ch.  3).  Through  the  1990s, 
Indonesia  continued  to  perceive  the  growth  triangle  in  terms  of  func- 


298 


Government  and  Politics 


tional  interdependence  in  joint  economic  development  at  the  maritime 
core  of  ASEAN,  and  local  and  regionalized  economic  cooperation 
strengthened  a  common  interest  in  good  relations.  Since  the  turn  of  the 
century,  however,  Indonesia  has  viewed  aggressive  Singapore  private 
and  state  capital  as  taking  on  exploitative  characteristics,  threatening 
to  turn  Indonesian  cheap  labor,  land,  and  water  into  a  colonial-style 
dependency.  Jakarta  has  thus  banned  any  further  exports  of  sand  that 
had  been  feeding  Singapore's  unquenchable  construction  appetite. 

New  interdependencies  between  Indonesia  and  Singapore  have  also 
been  forged  in  the  unlikely  area  of  security  cooperation,  although 
these  have  demonstrated  their  limits  as  well.  An  unprecedented  degree 
of  military  cooperation  through  personnel  exchanges,  joint  military 
exercises,  and  a  joint  air-combat  range  has  allowed  Singapore  to  dem- 
onstrate its  value  as  an  ally  in  a  South  China  Sea  security  environment 
(see  Branches  of  Service,  ch.  5).  Influential  nongovernmental  Indone- 
sian voices  openly  promoted  military  trilateralism  among  Indonesia, 
Singapore,  and  Malaysia.  In  1995  Indonesia  and  Singapore  signed  a 
treaty  allowing  the  use  of  Indonesian  airspace  and  territorial  waters  for 
training  by  Singapore's  air  force  and  navy.  Negotiations  began  in  2005 
to  extend  this  treaty  into  a  broader  bilateral  defense  cooperation  agree- 
ment, which  was  bundled  into  a  package  with  the  extradition  treaty. 
Nonetheless,  the  new  defense  treaty,  signed  with  much  fanfare  in  April 
2007,  was  set  aside  in  October  because  of  objections  raised  by  the 
DPR  during  the  ratification  process  that  it  only  benefited  Singapore. 
The  treaty  was  still  pending  at  the  decade's  end. 

In  the  years  after  the  end  of  Confrontation,  Indonesian-Malaysian 
relations  improved  as  both  governments  became  committed  to 
development  and  cooperation  in  ASEAN.  This  new  warmth  was 
reinforced  by  the  natural  affinities  of  race,  religion,  culture,  and  lan- 
guage. Although  intensive  and  extensive  bilateral  ties  have  generally 
promoted  good  relations,  these  have  been  tested  by  irritants  such  as 
Indonesian  concerns  about  Malaysia's  handling  of  illegal  Indonesian 
temporary  workers,  and  Malaysian  (and  Singapore)  concerns  about 
chronic  haze  during  the  dry  season  produced  by  Indonesian  planta- 
tion owners  setting  fires  to  clear  the  land  for  planting.  The  more  con- 
ciliatory tone  set  by  Malaysian  prime  minister  Abdullah  Badawi 
helped  in  overcoming  these  irritants. 

Australia 

The  most  problematic  of  Indonesia's  neighborly  relations  are  those 
with  Australia.  The  tension  inherent  in  the  population  differential 
between  the  two  countries  in  such  close  geostrategic  proximity  is 
exacerbated  by  their  very  different  political  cultures.  Criticism  of

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesia  under  Suharto  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  by  the  Australian 
press,  academics,  and  politicians  provoked  angry  retorts  from  Jakarta. 
More  recently,  East  Timor  and  Papua  have  been  the  primary  irritants 
in  the  bilateral  relationship.  Since  1975  Australia  had  served  as  one  of 
the  primary  locations  for  the  East  Timorese  diaspora,  and  many  Indo- 
nesians suspected  Australia  of  wanting  to  break  up  the  country  by 
supporting  East  Timor's  independence  movement,  including  during 
the  1999  referendum.  For  many  Indonesians,  these  suspicions  were 
confirmed  when  Australian  troops  were  the  first  to  arrive  in  Dili  in 
September  1999  and  made  up  the  largest  contingent  within  INTER- 
FET,  which  was  commanded  by  an  Australian.  Indonesian  fears  that 
Australian  attention  had  turned  to  Papua  once  Timor-Leste  achieved 
independence  were  heightened  when  Australia  granted  temporary 
protection  visas  to  43  Papuan  asylum  seekers  who  landed  on  Cape 
York  Peninsula  in  northeastern  Australia  in  January  2006,  a  decision 
denounced  by  Jakarta  in  harsh  terms. 

The  victimization  of  Australians  in  the  first  Bali  bombing  in  2002 
and  the  Australian  Embassy  bombing  in  Jakarta  in  2004  did  not  elicit 
substantial  Indonesian  public  sympathy,  although  the  Indonesian  gov- 
ernment did  allow  for  significant  assistance  by  Australian  crime 
investigators.  Bilateral  relations  were  particularly  poor  under  Prime 
Minister  John  Howard  because  of  his  close  relationship  with  President 
George  W.  Bush,  illustrated  by  Howard's  strong  support  for  the  war  in 
Iraq  and  the  persistent  misperception  that  he  had  once  stated  that  Aus- 
tralia was  America's  "deputy  sheriff'  in  Asia.  The  implicit  long-term 
Indonesian  "threat,"  as  it  appeared  in  Australia's  defense-planning 
documents,  underlined  a  latent  suspicion  in  Jakarta  that  Australian 
policy  toward  Indonesia  was  based  on  fear,  not  friendship.  This  per- 
ception had  to  be  constantly  allayed  by  official  Australian  visits  to 
Jakarta,  and  it  was  the  driving  force  behind  the  signing  of  a  bilateral 
security  pact  in  2006  (see  Foreign  Military  Relations,  ch.  5). 

The  Philippines 

The  Philippines  is  a  contiguous  state  and  an  ASEAN  partner,  yet 
Indonesia's  relations  with  it  are  more  distant  than  with  its  other  imme- 
diate neighbors.  The  Philippines'  aligned  status  with  the  United  States 
and  its  territorial  dispute  with  Malaysia  over  the  sovereignly  of  Sabah 
inhibit  a  close  relationship  with  Indonesia  and  other  ASEAN  members. 

Nonetheless,  when  President  Ferdinand  Marcos  resigned  in  1986, 
Jakarta  joined  other  ASEAN  states  in  welcoming  a  peaceful  transfer 
of  power  to  Corazon  Aquino.  Jakarta  was  the  first  capital  visited  by 
the  Philippines'  new  president,  unprecedentedly  even  before  Wash- 
ington, and  Suharto  took  the  opportunity  to  press  the  urgency  of 


300 


Government  and  Politics 


defeating  the  communist  New  People's  Army  in  the  Philippines.  To 
show  support  for  Aquino's  government,  Suharto  insisted  that  the  1987 
ASEAN  Manila  Summit  meeting  go  forward  despite  apprehensions  in 
other  ASEAN  capitals  about  the  security  situation.  Jakarta  was  not 
displeased  that  Aquino  was  succeeded  in  1992  by  Fidel  Ramos,  who, 
as  chief  of  staff  of  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  Philippines  and  later  sec- 
retary of  national  defense,  was  well  known  to  the  Indonesian  mili- 
tary's senior  leadership.  In  more  recent  years,  Indonesia  has  been 
concerned  about  chronic  political  instability  in  the  Philippines  under 
presidents  Joseph  Estrada  and  Gloria  Macapagal- Arroyo. 

Most  worrisome  for  Jakarta  is  the  seeming  inability  of  the  Philip- 
pines to  put  an  end  to  its  internal  wars.  Indonesia  viewed  the  growth 
of  the  New  People's  Army  as  destabilizing  for  the  region.  Moreover, 
the  Muslim  insurrection  in  the  south  of  the  Philippines  has  had  impli- 
cations for  global  terrorism,  regional  territorial  integrity,  and  Indone- 
sian Muslim  politics.  Post-September  11,  2001,  revelations  that 
Indonesian  terrorists  had  trained  in  camps  in  Mindanao  and  regularly 
traveled  between  the  Philippines  and  Indonesia  have  prompted 
greater  security  cooperation  between  the  two  countries,  although 
Indonesia  was  uncomfortable  with  the  George  W.  Bush  administra- 
tion's designation  of  Southeast  Asia  as  the  "second  front  in  the  global 
war  on  terrorism"  and  with  the  U.S.  military's  significant  engagement 
in  Mindanao  as  a  result. 

Relations  with  East  Asia 

China 

Bilateral  relations  between  Indonesia  and  China  have  warmed  con- 
siderably since  the  resumption  of  diplomatic  ties  in  1990,  although 
residual  suspicion  remains  about  China's  ultimate  security  and  eco- 
nomic goals  in  the  region.  Trade  that  once  had  to  be  transshipped 
through  Singapore  or  Hong  Kong  has  become  direct  and  has  increased 
exponentially.  China  has  become  an  important  market  for  Indonesia's 
natural  gas  and  minerals.  There  have  even  been  efforts  to  improve 
bilateral  defense  and  security  cooperation  through  direct  military-to- 
military  ties.  Nonetheless,  Indonesia  has  largely  preferred  to  contain 
China's  regional  expansionism  via  ASEAN  rather  than  bilaterally,  by 
establishing  forums  such  as  ASEAN  Plus  Three  in  1997  and  support- 
ing China's  accession  to  the  TAC  in  2003. 

Indonesia's  diplomatic  relations  with  China  were  suspended  in 
1967  in  the  aftermath  of  the  1965  attempted  coup  d'etat.  Beijing  was 
suspected  of  complicity  with  the  PKI  in  planning  the  coup  and  was 
viewed  by  the  new  military-dominated  government  as  a  threat 
through  its  possible  support  of  a  resurgent  underground  PKI,  both 


301

directly  and  through  a  "fifth  column"  of  Chinese  Indonesians.  Jakarta 
repeatedly  demanded  an  explicit  disavowal  by  Beijing  of  support  for 
communist  insurgents  in  Southeast  Asia  as  its  sine  qua  non  for  a  nor- 
malization process.  Underlying  the  Indonesian  policy  was  unease 
about  China's  long-range  goals  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  break  in  rela- 
tions persisted  until  1990,  when,  in  the  face  of  shifting  global  and 
regional  realities  as  well  as  renewed  mutual  confidence,  the  two 
countries  resumed  their  formal  ties.  An  exchange  of  visits  by  Chinese 
premier  Li  Peng  to  Jakarta  in  August  1990  and  by  Suharto  to  Beijing 
in  November  1 990  symbolized  the  dramatic  alteration  that  had  taken 
place.  In  particular,  normalization  was  driven  by  four  factors:  China's 
market  reforms  had  made  it  less  threatening  ideologically  and  more 
formidable  as  an  economic  force;  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  had  weak- 
ened the  Soviet  Union  and  thus  strengthened  China's  regional  posi- 
tion; Indonesia's  deep  involvement  in  the  Cambodian  peace  process 
was  hampered  by  a  lack  of  direct  relations  with  the  Khmer  Rouge's 
main  sponsor;  and  Indonesia's  desire  to  mediate  the  South  China  Sea 
disputes  was  similarly  hampered  in  the  absence  of  direct  relations 
with  the  largest  party  to  the  disputes. 

Japan 

The  quality  of  Indonesia-Japan  relations  is  best  measured  by  statis- 
tics on  trade,  investment,  and  the  flow  of  assistance.  In  2008  Japan 
was  the  single-largest  destination  of  Indonesia's  exports,  the  second- 
largest  source  (after  China)  of  its  imports,  the  single-largest  foreign 
investor,  and  by  far  the  most  important  donor  of  development  assis- 
tance (see  The  Changing  Nature  of  Trade  and  Aid,  ch.  3).  In  return,  as 
the  dominant  foreign  economic  presence  in  Indonesia,  Japan  is  subject 
to  all  the  expectations  and  resentments  attendant  on  that  status,  for 
example,  Indonesia  has  sought  greater  technology  transfer  as  part  of 
Japanese  investment.  The  association  of  Japanese  firms  with  politi- 
cally well-connected  Indonesians  has  led  to  charges  of  exploitation. 
With  their  memories  of  World  War  II  and  the  anti- Japanese  demon- 
strations during  Prime  Minister  Tanaka  Kakuei's  1974  visit,  the  Indo- 
nesian leadership  was  keenly  sensitive  to  the  possibility  of  a  disruptive 
anti-Japanese  backlash  (see  Rise  of  the  New  Order,  1966-98,  ch.  1). 
However,  the  issues  of  Japan's  version  of  World  War  II  history  and  of 
comfort  women,  so  critical  to  its  relations  with  China  and  South 
Korea,  do  not  weigh  as  heavily  in  the  relationship  with  Indonesia. 

In  the  long  term,  the  critical  issue  for  Indonesia  in  the  early 
twenty-first  century  is  access  to  Japan's  markets  for  manufactured 
goods.  Yet,  Indonesia  shares  the  ASEAN- wide  concern  about  the 
implications  for  Southeast  Asia  of  Japanese  remilitarization  and  was 


302 


Government  and  Politics 


ambivalent  about  Japanese  military  participation  in  UN  peacekeep- 
ing operations  in  Cambodia.  From  Tokyo's  point  of  view,  there  is 
only  an  indirect  linkage  between  Japan's  economic  presence  and  the 
political  relationship  between  the  two  countries,  but  Japan  is  aware 
of  Indonesia's  geostrategic  straddling  of  the  main  commercial  routes 
to  the  Middle  East  and  Europe.  In  addition,  Japan  struggles  in  Indo- 
nesia, as  elsewhere  in  the  region  and  the  world,  to  compete  with  a 
resurgent  China. 

Relations  with  the  United  States 

Indonesian  relations  with  the  United  States  are  in  some  respects 
the  warmest  they  have  ever  been.  Ironically,  this  rapport  came  at  a 
time  when  Southeast  Asia  as  a  whole,  including  Indonesia,  had 
dropped  significantly  in  terms  of  U.S.  global  priorities.  The  funda- 
mental underpinning  of  the  warm  relations  is  Indonesia's  successful 
transition  to  democracy.  Not  only  do  the  two  countries  now  share  a 
political  system  and  political  values,  but  also  human-rights  violations 
and  restrictions  on  bilateral  military  ties  have  become  a  much  less 
prominent  impediment  to  good  relations.  It  has  certainly  also  helped 
that  President  Yudhoyono  spent  several  stints  in  his  military  career 
obtaining  training  and  education  in  the  United  States,  including  at 
Fort  Benning  in  1975  and  1982  and  at  Fort  Leavenworth  in  1990-91, 
during  which  time  he  earned  a  master's  degree  in  management  from 
Webster  University,  which  has  a  campus  at  Fort  Leavenworth.  The 
2008  election  as  president  of  Barack  H.  Obama,  who  lived  in  Jakarta 
for  several  years  as  a  child,  has  dramatically  raised  expectations  of 
even  closer  ties  with  the  United  States.  The  importance  of  these  ties 
to  the  Obama  Administration  was  signaled  in  February  2009  by  Sec- 
retary of  State  Hillary  Clinton's  addition  of  Indonesia  to  the  Northeast 
Asian  itinerary  of  her  first  overseas  trip. 

To  the  extent  Indonesia  was  a  priority  for  the  United  States  under 
the  George  W.  Bush  administration,  it  was  primarily  through  a  security 
lens.  This  focus  included  counterterrorism,  maritime  security,  Indone- 
sia's utility  as  a  voice  for  moderation  in  the  Muslim  world,  and  nontra- 
ditional  security  threats  such  as  avian  influenza.  The  2002-5  bombings 
in  Jakarta  and  Bali  drove  home  for  both  Indonesia  and  the  United 
States  that  international  terrorism  is  a  significant  problem  in  Southeast 
Asia.  Indonesian  security  forces,  particularly  the  police,  provided 
unprecedented  access  to  American  investigators  and  trainers,  resulting 
in  the  killing  or  capture  and  conviction  of  hundreds  of  militants.  Mari- 
time security  mainly  focuses  on  the  Strait  of  Malacca,  where  the 
emphasis  is  on  piracy  and  international  shipping,  and  on  the  Sulawesi- 
Sulu  corridor,  where  the  focus  is  on  counterterrorism.  The  United 


303 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

States  also  appreciated  Indonesian  support  in  March  2007  for  UN 
Security  Council  Resolution  1747  on  Iran's  nuclear- weapons  program. 

Indonesia,  for  its  part,  resented  the  narrow  focus  of  American  inter- 
est in  it.  Indonesia  certainly  shares  many  of  these  security  concerns, 
but  its  interests  in  the  bilateral  relationship  are  much  broader,  includ- 
ing reviving  military  ties,  increasing  trade  and  investment,  addressing 
climate  change,  and  expanding  access  to  American  educational  insti- 
tutions for  Indonesian  postsecondary  students.  Under  rules  known  as 
the  Leahy  Amendment,  the  U.S.  Congress  totally  cut  off  bilateral  mil- 
itary sales  and  assistance  following  the  violence  accompanying  the 
East  Timor  referendum  in  1999.  This  cutoff  expanded  restrictions  put 
in  place  after  the  1991  Santa  Cruz  Massacre  in  Dili.  Indonesia  has 
made  the  case  that  these  sanctions  are  anachronistic  given  its  transition 
to  democracy.  The  George  W.  Bush  administration  began  to  reestab- 
lish the  military  relationship,  but  the  U.S.  Congress  continues  to  back 
some  restrictions  in  response  to  pressure  from  human-rights  groups 
(see  Post-Suharto  Reforms,  ch.  5).  Indonesia's  interests  in  a  broader 
bilateral  relationship  were  given  concrete  form  in  President  Yud- 
hoyono's  proposal  for  a  "comprehensive  partnership"  in  a  November 
2008  speech  at  the  United  States-Indonesia  Society  (USINDO)  in 
Washington,  DC.  The  emphasis  of  this  partnership  would  not  be  on 
U.S.  assistance  to  Indonesia,  which  would  nonetheless  continue,  but 
rather  on  global  and  regional  issues  that  the  two  countries  could  help 
solve  together.  The  Obama  administration,  while  maintaining  the  sig- 
nificant levels  of  security  cooperation  established  under  the  Bush 
administration,  welcomed  this  initiative  by  proposing  that,  in  addition 
to  existing  security  concerns,  the  partnership  should  focus  on  energy, 
the  environment,  and  climate  change;  economic,  trade,  and  investment 
cooperation;  democracy  and  good  governance;  education;  and  health. 

The  United  States  is  the  second-largest  destination  (after  Japan)  of 
Indonesia's  exports,  and  the  third-largest  source  (after  China  and 
Japan)  of  its  imports.  American  investment  in  Indonesia's  oil,  gas, 
and  mining  sectors  is  significant  but  remains  quite  low  in  other  sec- 
tors as  a  result  of  American  companies'  concerns  about  corruption, 
low  labor  productivity,  an  inflexible  labor  law,  and  uncertain  con- 
tract enforcement.  Indonesia  has  assumed  global  leadership  on  envi- 
ronmental issues  by  hosting  the  UN  Climate  Change  Conference  in 
Bali  in  December  2007  and  has  continued  to  press  the  United  States 
on  this  issue.  Finally,  after  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks 
on  the  United  States,  Washington  tightened  its  visa  policies,  making 
it  much  harder  for  foreign  students  wishing  to  study  in  America,  par- 
ticularly from  Muslim-majority  countries  such  as  Indonesia.  This 
change,  combined  with  the  slow  decline  over  several  decades  in 


304 


Government  and  Politics 


American  scholarships  for  foreign  students,  has  made  it  much  more 
difficult  for  Indonesians  to  access  U.S.  institutions  of  higher  learn- 
ing. Indonesia  places  a  high  priority  on  education  as  a  means  to  spur 
its  development,  and  the  United  States  remains  a  favorite  destination 
for  Indonesian  students.  All  of  these  issues  are  important  to  resolve 
in  further  improving  the  bilateral  relationship,  but  none  has  yet  been 
a  serious  impediment  to  the  increasingly  warm  connection. 

Consolidating  Democracy,  Contributing  to 
Global  Peace 

Indonesia  has  made  substantial  progress  toward  democratization 
since  1998.  It  has  successfully  navigated  a  transition  to  democracy, 
minimizing  the  military's  direct  political  influence,  amending  the 
constitution,  holding  multiple  credible  elections,  and  embarking  on  an 
unprecedented  decentralization  of  power.  It  is  also  making  significant 
progress  in  consolidating  this  new  democracy,  and  the  2009  election 
cycle  was  another  significant  milestone  in  this  regard.  Addressing 
corruption,  improving  economic  performance,  strengthening  local 
governance,  and  fixing  the  judicial  system  will  also  contribute  to 
democratic  consolidation.  Indonesia  has  rebounded  from  the  depths 
of  the  1997-98  Asian  financial  crisis,  but  its  growth  rates  need  to  be 
higher  in  order  to  reduce  poverty  and  make  the  leap  to  the  next  level 
of  development.  A  stable  democracy  and  a  prosperous  economy 
would  provide  Indonesia  with  strong  foundations  for  its  dream  of 
playing  a  middle-power  role  regionally  and  even  globally  in  some 
interest  areas.  Its  peacekeeping  role  in  Lebanon  in  2007,  as  well  as  its 
offers  to  help  address  conflicts  in  the  Korean  Peninsula,  Burma,  Iran, 
and  Iraq,  are  emblematic  of  the  constructive  role  Indonesia  envisions 
for  itself  in  a  post-Cold  War,  post-September  1 1  world.

Chapter  5.  National  Security 


PC-40  type  fast  patrol  craft  underway 


INDONESIA'S  MILITARY  AND  NATIONAL  POLICE  have  under- 
gone important  changes  since  the  Suharto  era  ended  in  1998;  how- 
ever, they  retain  a  role  in  national  society  that  is  perhaps  unique  in 
the  world.  Historically,  the  Indonesian  military  has  been  involved  in 
many  affairs  of  state  that  elsewhere  are  not  normally  associated  with 
the  armed  forces.  Since  the  Netherlands  recognized  Indonesian  sov- 
ereignty in  1949,  the  military  has  been  the  dominant  political  institu- 
tion in  Indonesia.  In  comparison  with  the  armed  forces  of  nations  of 
comparable  background  and  state  of  development,  the  Indonesian 
military  is  cautious  in  its  exercise  of  traditional  military  authority 
over  society.  However,  until  discarded  in  1999,  its  doctrine  of 
dwifungsi  (dual  function)  gave  the  military  a  role  in  virtually  every 
aspect  of  civil  society,  from  village-level  politics  through  the  full 
spectrum  of  security  and  intelligence  missions.  This  legacy  has  been 
a  major  factor  in  the  military's  effort  to  define  its  role  in  the  course  of 
the  nation's  transition  from  autocracy  to  democracy  in  the  post- 
Suharto  era. 

From  Suharto's  assumption  of  power  in  1966  to  his  forced  retire- 
ment 32  years  later,  the  armed  forces  accepted  and  supported  the  ratio- 
nale behind  his  regime,  namely,  that  economic  and  social  development 
was  the  nation's  first  priority  and  that  social  and  political  stability  was 
absolutely  essential  if  that  goal  were  to  be  achieved.  Regime  protection 
and  maintenance  of  internal  stability  were  the  primary  missions  of  the 
Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces  (see  Glossary).  The  armed  forces 
are  currently  called  Tentara  Nasional  Indonesia  (TNI  but  earlier  ABRI; 
for  these  and  other  acronyms,  see  Table  A).  They  were  eminently  suc- 
cessful in  this  regard,  leading  the  nation  out  of  a  period  of  political  and 
social  upheaval  in  the  mid-1960s  into  a  period  of  relatively  long-lasting 
domestic  order  and  unprecedented  economic  growth.  The  price  paid  by 
society  was  tight  control  of  the  citizenry,  intolerance  of  criticism  or 
other  forms  of  opposition  to  the  regime,  and  heavy  censorship  of  the 
news  media. 

Suharto's  resignation  from  the  presidency  in  May  1998  came 
amid  a  combination  of  regional  economic  recession  and  popular  dis- 
content. The  long-serving  president's  removal  gathered  even  greater 
impetus  from  his  inattentiveness  to  outbreaks  of  violence  concen- 
trated mainly  in  Jakarta,  and  from  the  popular  perception  that  he  and 
his  family  were  involved  in  corrupt  activities.  The  armed  forces 
establishment,  Suharto's  primary  instrument  of  political  control  for 
more  than  three  decades,  was  also  a  crucial  element  in  his  fall  from 


309 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

power.  The  military  leadership  declined  to  take  control  of  the  gov- 
ernment to  keep  Suharto  in  office  and  acted  with  restraint  while 
overseeing  a  constitutional  transfer  of  leadership  to  his  vice  presi- 
dent, Bacharuddin  J.  (B.  J.)  Habibie.  Many  analysts  felt  at  the  time 
that  the  ambitious  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces,  General 
Wiranto,  believed  that  Habibie  would  resign  along  with  Suharto  and 
that  he  himself  would  be  asked  to  take  the  presidency  in  a  move 
eerily  similar  to  Suharto's  own  accession  to  power  in  1966.  In  many 
subsequent  public  interviews,  Wiranto  said  that  he  had  been  asked 
twice  by  Suharto  to  take  power  but  had  declined  to  do  so.  Wiranto 
subsequently  was  credited  with  supporting  the  constitutional  change 
of  leadership. 

The  fall  of  Suharto  prompted  a  reconsideration  of  the  military's  role 
in  government  and  society  over  the  long  period  of  his  rule.  A  free 
press  and  a  newly  empowered  national  legislature — the  People's  Con- 
sultative Assembly  (MPR) — focused  on  abuses  by  the  military  during 
the  Suharto  years.  Revelations  of  human-rights  abuses,  improper  use 
of  power,  corruption,  economic  intimidation,  and  other  unprofessional 
conduct  caused  the  military  acute  embarrassment  and  loss  of  prestige. 
But  the  years  immediately  following  Suharto's  fall  brought  disorga- 
nized civilian  government,  widening  corruption,  and,  in  a  number  of 
different  parts  of  the  country,  religious  and  ethnic  violence  on  a  scale 
not  seen  for  a  generation.  The  apparent  inability  of  the  civilian  admin- 
istration to  impose  order  on  society,  combined  with  widespread  yearn- 
ing for  the  stability  that  had  characterized  most  of  the  Suharto  era, 
resulted  in  popular  demands  for  a  more  effective  and  decisive  govern- 
ment. By  assuming  a  lower  profile  and  engaging  in  a  series  of  reforms, 
the  military  regained  much  of  its  lost  stature.  Furthermore,  it  remained 
the  most  organized  and  disciplined  element  of  Indonesian  society. 

Throughout  the  Suharto  years,  the  central  government  had  provided 
insufficient  funding  for  the  military,  with  only  about  one-third  of  its 
administrative  and  operational  costs  covered  by  the  defense  budget. 
The  rest  of  the  military's  financial  requirements  were  met  by  receipts 
from  its  extensive  business  empire  or  diversions  from  other  govern- 
ment institutions.  But  the  1997-98  financial  crisis,  compounded  by 
arms  embargoes  imposed  by  Indonesia's  traditional  military  suppliers, 
had  an  immediate  effect  on  force  readiness.  Within  a  few  years,  the 
armed  forces'  primary  weapons  systems  had  deteriorated  as  a  result  of 
lack  of  maintenance  and  an  inability  to  purchase  spare  parts  for  major 
systems.  International  reaction  to  human-rights  violations  perpetrated 
during  the  1990s  in  East  Timor  (Timor  Timur  Province;  since  May  20, 
2002,  the  independent  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste)  had  par- 
ticularly severe  consequences,  prompting  the  United  States  and  other 


310 


National  Security 


nations  to  embargo  arms  sales  and  military  training.  Indonesia  conse- 
quently turned  to  nontraditional  suppliers,  primarily  in  Eastern  Europe 
and  Asia,  to  upgrade  its  aging  ground,  air,  and  naval  systems.  Even  so, 
the  deterioration  of  the  TNI's  capabilities  was  demonstrated  by  the 
military's  deficient  performance  in  the  aftermath  of  the  December  26, 
2004,  tsunami  that  devastated  the  coast  of  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh 
(called  Nanggroe  Aceh  Darussalam,  1999-2000,  in  an  effort  to 
assuage  separatist  sentiment  in  the  region).  Although  the  TNI's  per- 
sonnel performed  very  well  on  the  ground,  where  the  large  military 
presence  turned  largely  from  combat  to  recovery  efforts  and  other 
forms  of  civic  action,  its  air-transport  systems  were  woefully  unpre- 
pared to  confront  such  a  massive  natural  disaster.  That  outcome,  along 
with  the  visible  deterioration  of  the  TNI's  capabilities,  figured  heavily 
in  the  U.S.. decision  to  reestablish  military  ties  with  Indonesia. 

The  inauguration  in  October  2004  of  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono 
as  Indonesia's  sixth  president,  and  the  fourth  since  the  fall  of  Suharto, 
came  at  an  important  juncture  for  Indonesia's  national-security  pos- 
ture. The  election  of  a  retired  general  by  a  majority  of  more  than  60 
percent  of  the  votes  cast  reflected  not  only  respect  for  him  as  a  leader 
perceived  to  be  free  of  corruption,  but  also  a  yearning  for  a  more 
focused  and  active  government.  President  Yudhoyono  benefited  from 
his  reputation  as  a  "thinking  general,"  who  supported  reform  of  the 
military  and  whose  independence  from  preceding  administrations 
appealed  to  an  electorate  weary  of  continued  corruption,  inefficiency, 
and  generally  uninspired  government. 

The  biggest  challenge  facing  Yudhoyono  as  he  began  his  adminis- 
tration may  have  been  to  meet  excessive  popular  expectations  while 
showing  competence  with  the  practical  matters  of  government.  The 
national  leadership  would  have  to  address  the  issues  of  economic 
growth  and  political  change  in  a  security  environment  made  more 
tenuous  by  the  threat  of  international  and  domestic  terrorism,  as  well 
as  by  long-standing  separatist  rebellions  at  its  eastern  and  western 
extremes,  Papua  Province  and  the  Special  Region  of  Aceh.  With  its 
transition  to  democracy  reinforced  by  peaceful  and  honest  legislative 
and  presidential  elections,  Indonesia  still  had  to  address  the  signifi- 
cant domestic  security  issues  of  separatism;  sectarian  and  ethnic  vio- 
lence and  its  causes;  and  Islamic  extremism,  the  effect  of  which  was 
to  help  sustain  international  terrorism.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 


Historical  Context 

Independence  and  the  Sukarno  Period,  1945-65 

The  Indonesian  armed  forces  grew  out  of  the  diverse  experience  of 
the  Dutch  colonial  period  (the  early  seventeenth  through  the  early 
twentieth  centuries),  the  Japanese  occupation  (1942^45)  during 
World  War  II,  and  the  struggle  for  independence  (1945^9).  During 
the  colonial  period,  a  small  number  of  Indonesians  were  recruited 
into  the  Royal  Netherlands  Indies  Army  (KNIL).  Subsequently,  Japa- 
nese occupation  forces  recruited  Indonesians,  often  former  KNIL  sol- 
diers, for  use  as  military  auxiliaries  {heiho)  and  as  supply  and  support 
personnel  attached  to  the  Japanese  army.  These  Indonesian  enlisted 
personnel  frequently  were  sent  to  the  front  in  the  Pacific,  the  Philip- 
pines, and  other  war  zones,  such  as  Burma.  The  deteriorating  military 
situation  in  1943  led  the  Japanese  occupation  authorities  to  organize 
an  indigenous  volunteer  self-defense  force  called  the  Defenders  of 
the  Fatherland  (Peta).  In  Java  some  37,000  Peta  recruits,  including 
officers,  received  training  in  combat  tactics.  The  number  of  such 
troops  trained  in  Sumatra,  where  the  forces  were  usually  known  by 
their  Japanese  name — Giyugun  (volunteer  army) — is  unknown,  but 
knowledgeable  sources  estimate  about  one-third  of  the  number 
trained  for  Java's  Peta. 

Along  with  former  heiho  and  KNIL  troops,  Peta  provided  the 
emergent  Indonesian  state  with  a  ready  source  of  trained  military  per- 
sonnel following  Japan's  defeat  in  1945.  This  force  was  supple- 
mented by  large  numbers  of  young  people  with  experience  in  various 
paramilitary  youth  corps  that  had  been  organized  by  the  Japanese; 
they  mobilized  the  population  and  provided  a  recruiting  base  for  Peta. 

An  embryonic  military  organization,  with  these  elements  as  its 
nucleus,  the  People's  Security  Forces  (BKR),  was  formed  on  August 
22,  1945.  Just  five  days  earlier,  on  August  17,  Sukarno  and  Moham- 
mad Hatta  had  proclaimed  Indonesian  independence.  Thousands  of 
members  of  various  local  militias  (laskar)  also  joined  the  newly  con- 
solidated national  armed  forces.  From  the  beginning,  the  Western 
ideal  of  a  politically  neutral  military  had  few  proponents.  Many  of 
those  who  joined  the  new  force,  called  the  Indonesian  National 
Armed  Forces  (TNI)  from  1947  to  1962  (also  APRIS— Armed 
Forces  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Indonesia — from  1949  to  1950 
and  APR! — Armed  Forces  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia — in  1950), 
were  nationalists  who  sought  both  military  victory  and  political 
change  for  their  nation. 

The  disparate  forces  fought  a  largely  guerrilla-style  war  against  the 
returning  Dutch  troops.  Commanded  by  the  young  and  charismatic 


312 


General  Sudirman,  the  newly  formed  army  avoided  entrapment  and 
fought  on  even  after  the  Dutch  forces  captured  Sukarno  and  the  civil- 
ian government  at  Yogyakarta.  Sudirman,  Indonesia's  youngest-ever 
general,  was  the  first  commander  in  chief  of  Indonesia's  armed 
forces.  He  led  the  army  in  battle  from  1945  to  1949  even  though  he 
suffered  from  tuberculosis  and  had  to  be  carried  from  place  to  place 
in  a  modified  palanquin.  He  remained  in  command  until  his  death  in 
January  1950  at  the  age  of  35.  Sudirman  has  been  honored  as  the 
founding  father  of  the  Indonesian  military  ever  since,  a  national  hero 
whose  spirit  and  nationalism  are  invoked  as  key  ingredients  of  the 
Indonesian  military  ethos. 

Experiences  during  the  armed  struggle  against  the  Dutch  strength- 
ened the  military's  political  involvement  in  national  affairs.  Faced 
with  better-trained  and  better-equipped  Dutch  forces,  the  Indone- 
sians conducted  a  guerrilla  war  in  which  fighters  had  to  rely  heavily 
on  the  support  of  the  local  population.  This  tie  to  the  populace  rein- 
forced the  concept  of  perjuangan  (the  struggle),  which  stressed  reli- 
ance on  the  people  for  support,  intelligence,  and  succor  against  both 
external  threats  and  internal  divisiveness.  This  concept  was  at  the 
heart  of  army  chief  of  staff  and  former  KNIL  soldier  General  Abdul 
Haris  Nasution's  ideas  about  guerrilla  warfare  or  total  people's  war. 
Dwifungsi,  later  used  by  Suharto  to  justify  his  use  of  the  armed 
forces  as  the  primary  pillar  of  support  of  his  lengthy  rule,  referred  to 
the  military's  right,  drawn  from  the  revolutionary  experience,  to  fill 
both  military  and  civilian  political  and  civil  roles  in  society. 

An  attempt  by  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party  (PKI)  to  seize 
power  at  Madiun,  East  Java,  in  September  1948  turned  the  military 
against  the  communist  movement.  Considered  a  treasonous  and 


313 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

treacherous  betrayal  because  it  occurred  during  the  independence 
struggle  against  the  Dutch,  the  incident — commonly  called  the  Madiun 
Affair — caused  a  deep  and  permanent  suspicion  within  the  military, 
not  only  of  communism  but  of  leftist  movements  in  general. 

At  the  end  of  the  independence  war  in  1949,  the  government  had 
as  many  as  500,000  armed  fighters  potentially  at  its  disposal.  Demo- 
bilization reduced  this  number  to  200,000  by  mid- 1950,  when  the 
military  was  officially  designated  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  Republic 
of  Indonesia  (APRI).  The  first  priority  of  the  military  leadership  was 
to  form  some  semblance  of  a  unified  structure  from  numerous  dispa- 
rate elements — many  of  them  loyal  to  local  leaders  and  regional 
power  holders — and  to  establish  central  control  over  these  elements. 
General  Nasution  made  progress  in  this  direction,  overseeing  the 
restructuring  of  operational  units  in  all  three  military  services,  in 
accordance  with  organizational  charts  borrowed  from  Western  armed 
forces,  and  instituting  formal  training  programs.  Similar  changes 
occurred  in  the  structure  of  the  National  Police  of  Indonesia  (Polri). 

After  1955,  Nasution  initiated  a  series  of  personnel  transfers  and 
instituted  several  reforms  to  gain  control  over  local  commanders. 
Between  1950  and  1958,  several  opponents  of  Nasution's  policies 
joined  local  rebellions  in  the  Outer  Islands  (see  Glossary;  The  Road 
to  Guided  Democracy,  1957-  65,  ch.  1).  Any  one  of  these  disparate 
movements,  such  as  the  Universal  Struggle  (Permesta)  rebellion  in 
central  and  western  Sumatra  and  Sulawesi,  the  Darul  Islam  (House 
of  Islam)  rebellion  in  western  Java,  and  the  establishment  of  the 
short-lived  Republic  of  South  Maluku  (RMS),  could  have  fatally 
splintered  the  young  republic,  had  it  succeeded.  Deploying  to  the 
rebellious  regions,  the  army  overcame  these  various  uprisings,  its 
members  often  fighting  against  former  comrades.  These  operations 
were  another  national  success  cited  by  the  armed  forces  in  justifying 
a  leadership  role  in  national  affairs. 

The  armed  forces'  position  in  the  government  became  institution- 
alized during  the  period  of  Sukarno's  Guided  Democracy  (1957-65). 
Vowing  that  it  would  neither  be  a  "dead  tool  of  the  government"  nor 
assume  total  control  of  the  nation,  the  military  took  what  General 
Nasution  referred  to  as  the  "middle  way,"  working  cooperatively 
with  the  civilian  leadership  through  its  representation  in  the  cabinet, 
the  MPR,  and  the  civil  service.  The  services  became,  along  with  the 
PKI,  a  "junior  partner"  to  Sukarno  in  ruling  the  nation.  Uniformed 
personnel  held  positions  throughout  the  nation  down  to  the  village 
level,  in  both  the  administration  of  martial  law  and  the  management 
of  economic  enterprises  (mostly  nationalized  former  Dutch  proper- 
ties), and  in  the  deployment  of  regional  cadre  units  assigned  to 
mobilize  local  resistance  in  the  event  of  a  threat  to  national  security. 


314 


National  Security 


To  support  the  activist  foreign  policy  of  the  Guided  Democracy 
period,  especially  the  1962  campaign  against  Dutch  forces  in  West 
New  Guinea  (also  called  West  Irian  or  Irian  Barat,  and  renamed  Irian 
Jaya — Victorious  Irian — in  1972  by  the  national  government;  now 
called  Papua  and  Papua  Barat)  and  the  1963-66  armed  Confronta- 
tion (see  Glossary),  or  Konfrontasi,  with  Malaysia,  Sukarno  rapidly 
enlarged  the  armed  forces  (see  Relations  with  Neighboring  Nations, 
ch.  4).  Most  affected  were  the  formerly  tiny  air  force  and  navy, 
which  greatly  expanded  and  acquired  advanced  arms  and  equipment 
by  means  of  military  credits  from  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  Soviet- 
bloc  states  of  Eastern  Europe.  By  the  mid-1960s,  Indonesia  had  one 
of  the  largest  and  best-equipped  armed  forces  in  Southeast  Asia. 

Trying  to  contain  the  army's  expanding  political  influence  in  the 
early  1960s,  Sukarno  encouraged  the  air  force,  navy,  and  police  (the 
latter  was  a  fourth  branch  of  the  armed  forces  until  1999)  to  act  inde- 
pendently of  the  army.  The  army  leadership  became  alarmed  by  the 
resulting  divisions  among  the  services,  the  growing  influence  of  the 
PKI  in  all  four  branches,  and  Sukarno's  increasing  support  for  the 
PKI.  Tension  within  the  armed  forces  increased  following  proposals 
by  the  PKI  in  early  1965  to  place  political  advisers  in  each  military 
unit  (as  in  the  Chinese  and  Soviet  systems)  and  to  establish  a  "fifth 
force"  of  armed  peasants  and  workers  outside  the  control  of  the 
existing  armed  services. 

Suharto's  New  Order,  1966-98 

An  attempted  coup  d'etat  on  the  last  day  of  September  1965  by 
alleged  communist  sympathizers  in  the  military — the  September  30 
Movement  (Gestapu) — was  the  seminal  event  in  the  evolution  of  the 
modern  Indonesian  armed  forces.  The  details  of  the  event  remain 
clouded  and  controversial  even  as  post- Suharto  research  continues.  The 
accepted  government  version  is  that  General  Suharto,  at  the  time  not 
widely  regarded  as  part  of  the  most  powerful  senior  military  elite,  orga- 
nized quick  and  effective  resistance  to  a  PKI-organized  attempted 
coup.  The  precise  nature  and  significance  of  his  role  in  this  crucial 
affair  remain  matters  of  considerable  debate,  but  whatever  the  truth, 
Suharto  rose  rapidly  to  a  position  of  paramount  national  power. 
Sukarno  was  obliged  to  relinquish  de  facto  authority  to  Suharto  in 
March  1966,  and  Suharto  was  appointed  acting  president  one  year  later. 
Along  with  unrestrained  violence,  in  which  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
civilians  died,  and  a  subsequent  wave  of  arrests,  the  coup  attempt  led  to 
the  suppression  of  the  PKI.  The  expansionist  military  doctrine  of  the 
Sukarno  era  was  ended,  and  national  expenditures  began  to  be  focused 
on  economic  development. 


315 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  military  establishment,  led  by  the  army,  has  been  the  coun- 
try's premier  institution  since  1966,  when,  in  its  own  view,  it 
answered  the  summons  of  the  people  and  moved  to  center  stage. 
Comprising  the  three  military  services  and  the  police,  the  armed 
forces  operated  according  to  the  dwifungsi  doctrine,  enacted  into  law 
in  1982,  which  gave  the  military  a  dual  role — traditional  responsibil- 
ity as  defenders  of  the  nation,  plus  duty  as  a  sociopolitical  force  pro- 
moting stability,  order,  and  national  development.  Under  this  very 
broad  charter,  active-duty  and  retired  military  personnel  were 
assigned  throughout  the  gdvernment  to  posts  filled  in  most  other 
countries  by  civil  servants  or  politically  appointed  civilians.  Military 
personnel  most  frequently  received  postings  as  provincial  governors, 
district  heads,  members  of  legislative  bodies,  functionaries  in  a  vari- 
ety of  civilian  governmental  departments,  and  ambassadors.  The 
armed  forces  became  a  dominant  factor  in  the  social — including 
even  sports  and  entertainment — and  political  life  of  the  country  and 
acted  as  a  major  executive  agent  of  government  policies. 

To  understand  fully  the  role  of  the  armed  forces  in  contemporary 
Indonesian  society,  one  must  understand  the  absolute  priority  the 
government  and  the  military  leadership  gave  to  internal  security  and 
national  stability  during  the  New  Order  (1966-98).  Having  experi- 
enced attempted  coups  in  1948  and  1965,  which  they  identified  as 
communist-inspired,  as  well  as  a  number  of  regional  separatist  strug- 
gles and  instability  created  by  radical  religious  movements,  the  New 
Order  government  had  little  tolerance  for  public  disorder. 

The  Suharto  government  brought  the  nation  unprecedented  stabil- 
ity, remaining  in  firm  control  and  without  serious  challenge  from 
1966  to  1998.  The  leadership  remained  alert  to  real  or  potential  sub- 
versive threats,  maintaining  surveillance — and  sometimes  control — 
over  the  activities  and  programs  of  a  wide  range  of  groups  and  insti- 
tutions. The  government  was  acutely  sensitive  to  any  signs  of  oppo- 
sition to  its  policies.  In  general,  it  seemed  to  label  as  subversive 
anything  not  supportive  of  the  national  ideology,  the  Pancasila  (see 
Glossary;  Pancasila:  The  State  Ideology,  ch.  4).  The  extent  of  change 
in  the  years  after  the  fall  of  Suharto  can  be  fully  realized  only  by 
comparing  that  environment  of  close  control  of  society  and  repres- 
sion of  dissent  with  the  openness  experienced  in  the  period  after 
1998,  with  its  robust  free  news  media  and  aggressive  debate  in  the 
national  legislature. 

Separatist  insurgencies  have  long  been  the  most  serious  threat  to 
national  security.  The  Suharto  government  referred  to  such  insurgent 
activity  as  a  Security  Disturbance  Movement  (GPK).  Three  such 
movements,  the  Revolutionary  Front  for  an  Independent  East  Timor 


316 


National  Security 


(Fretilin — see  Glossary)  in  Timor  Timur  Province,  the  Free  Aceh 
Movement  (GAM)  in  Aceh,  and  the  Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM) 
in  Papua  Province,  have  important  roles  in  the  nation's  modern  secu- 
rity history  (see  Post-Suharto  Reforms,  this  ch.). 

Groups  advocating  the  establishment  of  an  Islamic  state,  either 
over  the  whole  national  territory  or  over  discrete  areas,  were  an  occa- 
sional security  threat  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Such  organizations  as 
Darul  Islam,  Bangsa  Islam  Indonesia  (Indonesian  Nation  of  Islam), 
and  Komando  Jihad  (Commando  Jihad)  carried  out  insurgency  and 
terrorist  operations  against  the  secular  state.  Komando  Jihad  was  held 
responsible  for  bombings  of  churches  and  theaters  in  1976  and  1977, 
attacks  on  police  stations  in  1980  and  1981,  and  the  1981  hijacking  to 
Bangkok  of  a<}aruda  Indonesia  domestic  flight. 

During  the  1980s,  Indonesia's  rapid  economic  development — 
with  annual  growth  rates  approaching  9  percent — caused  social  pres- 
sures on  society  that  brought  new  domestic  tensions.  These  changes, 
including  improved  educational  opportunities,  rising  expectations, 
industrialization,  unemployment,  and  crowded  cities,  were  blamed 
for  generating  urban  crime,  student  and  political  activism,  and  labor 
strikes.  One  example  of  government  action  to  address  these  issues 
occurred  in  the  early  1980s,  when  an  alarming  rise  in  violent  crime 
in  Jakarta  and  other  large  cities  on  Java  prompted  the  notorious 
undercover  "Petrus"  {penembakan  misterius — mysterious  shoot- 
ings— or  pembunuhan  misterius — mysterious  killings)  campaign,  in 
which  known  criminals  were  killed  by  handpicked  execution  squads 
and  their  bodies  dumped  in  public  places  as  a  warning.  Despite  the 
number  of  killings,  which  human-rights  groups  estimated  at  6,000  to 
8,000  nationwide,  most  of  the  public  expressed  cautious  approval  of 
the  Petrus  campaign,  usually  accompanied  by  criticism  of  the  police 
for  being  unable  to  stop  the  rise  in  crime. 

Government  operations  had  driven  extremist  groups  underground 
by  the  early  1990s.  Interestingly,  some  of  these  groups  had  eked  out 
an  existence  for  decades,  undercover  and  largely  through  family 
connections  and  generational  transfers,  before  reemerging  in  the  late 
1990s  as  a  recruiting  base  for  resurgent  domestic  and  international 
terrorist  organizations  (see  Terrorism,  this  ch.). 

Violent  ethnic  disputes  generally  were  kept  to  a  minimum  during 
the  Suharto  years  because  of  the  assurance  of  a  quick  and  brutal 
response  by  security  forces.  Most  such  outbreaks  were  directed  against 
Indonesians  of  Chinese  descent.  The  nation's  ethnic  Chinese  minority, 
estimated  at  4  million  or  more  in  the  early  twenty-first  century,  has 
evoked  popular  resentment  since  the  colonial  era,  when  Chinese  indi- 
viduals often  served  as  business  intermediaries  between  the  Dutch  elite

and  the  indigenous  population  (see  Ethnic  Minorities,  ch.  2).  In  the 
modern  period,  resentment  has  continued  over  Chinese  Indonesians' 
wealth  and  domination  of  the  economy,  including  their  roles  as  inter- 
mediaries for  foreign  investors  and  as  advisers  and  silent  partners  for 
senior  armed  forces  personnel  and  civilian  government  leaders  with 
business  interests.  These  ethnic  Chinese  businesspeople,  known  as 
cukong  (see  Glossary),  were  particularly  important  in  the  Suharto  fam- 
ily's increasingly  rapacious  commercial  arrangements. 

Anti-Chinese  feeling  surfaced  violently  in  the  turmoil  immedi- 
ately preceding  Suharto's  May  1998  resignation,  when  large  num- 
bers of  ethnic  Chinese  homes  and  businesses  were  destroyed,  and 
dozens  of  ethnic  Chinese  women  were  raped  by  mobs  of  rioters.  The 
violence  caused  a  major  flight  of  ethnic  Chinese  capital  from  Indo- 
nesia, which  worsened  the  economic  depression  that  started  in  1997. 
The  continued  slow  repatriation  of  that  capital  remains  an  important 
reason  for  Indonesia's  delayed  economic  recovery  (see  Postcrisis 
Reform,  ch.  3). 

The  absence  of  a  perceived  external  threat  has  been  widely  cred- 
ited with  allowing  Indonesia  to  concentrate  on  its  internal  defense 
and  national  development  priorities.  Successive  armed  forces  com- 
manders stressed  military  readiness  and  training  even  as  economic 
realities  constrained  new  equipment  purchases.  Until  2007,  when 
new  armored  personnel  carriers  were  purchased  from  France  to  sup- 
port Indonesia's  United  Nations  (UN)  deployment  to  Lebanon,  the 
only  major  acquisition  for  the  ground  forces  was  the  1981  purchase, 
through  the  U.S.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  program,  of  new  105- 
millimeter  towed  howitzers.  New  acquisitions  for  the  other  services 
during  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s  included  F-5  fighter  and  A-4 
ground-attack  aircraft  for  the  air  force  and  used,  but  still  serviceable, 
ships  for  the  navy.  Twelve  F-16  fighters,  also  purchased  from  the 
United  States,  were  not  delivered  until  1989.  Over  the  years,  the 
armed  forces  had  been  seriously  weakened  by  national  spending  pri- 
orities that  stressed  economic  development  and  relegated  defense 
spending  to  a  much  lower  priority  than  in  most  developing  nations. 
The  low  priority  given  to  defense  spending  continued  into  the  early 
years  of  the  twenty-first  century.  This  situation  has  compromised  the 
military's  readiness  posture  even  further,  because  income  from  the 
military  business  empire  is  far  less  than  in  the  past,  as  a  result  of  the 
1 990s  regional  recession,  corruption,  and  inept  management  (see  Par- 
ticipation in  the  Economy,  this  ch.).  In  2008,  for  example,  the  lower 
house  of  the  national  legislature,  the  People's  Representative  Council 
(DPR),  provided  the  TNI  and  Department  of  Defense  (Dephan)  with 
less  than  one-third  of  the  funding  requested. 


318 


National  Security 


Suharto  deliberately  underfunded  the  military  for  several  reasons. 
First,  national  development  claimed  first  priority  for  funding.  Second, 
there  was,  realistically,  no  external  threat  to  Indonesia's  security  and 
thus  no  need  for  top-of-the-line  military  arms.  Third,  by  requiring  the 
military  to  rely  on  its  extensive  business  empire  for  an  estimated  two- 
thirds  of  its  operational  and  administrative  requirements,  Suharto 
encouraged  off-budget  income  and  expenditures  and  accepted  the 
inevitable  corruption  as  a  way  to  ensure  the  loyally  of  the  military 
through  financial  gain.  The  major  disadvantage  of  this  system  was 
that  it  loosened  the  central  government's  control  over  the  armed 
forces.  A  military  that  obtains  two-thirds  of  its  funding  from  its  own 
resources  is  far  less  responsive  to  government  control  than  a  military 
establishment*  fully  funded  by  the  central  government.  It  is  for  this 
reason  that  proponents  of  military  reform  focused  on  the  need  to  gain 
civilian  governmental  control  over  the  military  business  empire  (see 
Defense  Spending  and  the  Defense  Industry,  this  ch.). 

Post-Suharto  Reforms 

The  military  establishment  was  pilloried  by  both  the  press  and  the 
populace  over  a  series  of  revelations  of  human-rights  abuses  that 
came  out  after  the  fall  of  Suharto  in  May  1998.  Furthermore,  the 
armed  forces  leadership  had  become  disillusioned  by  years  of 
demands  by  Suharto  for  unprofessional  conduct,  such  as  intervention 
in  most  aspects  of  civil  society  and  tight  control  over  every  aspect  of 
political  activity.  Indonesia's  military  leaders  responded  to  these 
developments  by  embarking  on  a  process  of  change.  The  armed 
forces  assumed  a  lower  political  profile  and  began  a  revision  of  doc- 
trine to  meet  some — but  by  no  means  all — of  the  calls  for  reform. 
This  process  of  change  was  a  major  part  of  national  reformasi  (see 
Glossary),  and  both  the  process  and  the  pace  of  change  became  sub- 
jects of  analysis  and  criticism  (see  The  Political  Process,  ch.  4). 

The  military  introduced  reforms  in  an  attempt  to  meet  the  new 
demands  of  a  democratic  society.  The  National  Police,  which  had 
been  a  coequal  branch  of  the  armed  forces  since  1960,  was  separated 
from  the  military  in  1999  and  placed  under  the  president.  The  name 
of  the  military  establishment  was  changed  from  Armed  Forces  of  the 
Republic  of  Indonesia  (ABRI)  to  Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces 
(TNI).  The  name  change  signaled  a  change  in  focus  by  which  the 
National  Police  took  the  country's  internal  security  as  its  primary 
responsibility.  The  Department  of  Defense  and  Security  (Hankam) 
was  redesignated  simply  the  Department  of  Defense  (Dephan),  a 
move  that  underscored  how  the  military's  primary  mission  had 
changed  (see  fig.  12).

The  TNI  leadership  discarded  dwifungsi  and  replaced  it  with  a  doc- 
trine called  the  New  Paradigm  (Paradigma  Baru),  which  emphasized 
"leading  from  behind"  rather  than  domination  of  the  political  process. 
Constitutional  reforms  eliminated  the  TNFs  blocs  of  reserved  seats  in 
the  national  and  local  legislatures.  The  TNI  redirected  its  primary  mis- 
sion from  internal  security  to  external  defense,  although  the  DPR's 
passage  of  a  new  military  law  in  2004  granted  the  armed  forces  signif- 
icant responsibilities  for  counterterrorism  and  counterinsurgency, 
because  of  the  inability  of  the  understaffed  and  poorly  trained  police  to 
meet  these  intense  challenges  to  domestic  security. 

In  1999  Indonesia  took  one  of  the  initial  steps  toward  democratic 
civilian  control  of  the  military  when,  for  the  first  time  since  the 
1950s,  President  B.  J.  Habibie  appointed  a  civilian  academic — 
Yuwono  Sudarsono — as  minister  of  defense.  Other  civilians  followed 
him  in  that  post  during  the  presidencies  of  Abdurrahman  Wahid  and 
Megawati  Sukarnoputri.  In  2004  President  Susilo  Bambang  Yud- 
hoyono  appointed  Sudarsono  as  minister  of  defense  a  second  time. 
Despite  starting  a  trend  of  civilian  ministers  of  defense,  however,  the 
TNI  commander  retained  full  command  authority  and  remained 
directly  responsible  to  the  president.  The  DPR  recognized  the  concept 
of  civilian  leadership  of  the  armed  forces,  however,  and  it  included 
this  principle  in  the  2004  military  law  but  did  not  specify  when,  or 


320 


National  Security 


how,  it  would  be  implemented.  Military  officers  now  must  resign 
from  the  armed  forces  before  taking  civilian  government  positions. 
The  military  withdrew  from  day-to-day  politics  and  remained  neutral 
in  the  legislative  and  presidential  elections  of  1999,  2004,  and  2009. 

East  Timor 

East  Timor  was  a  colony  of  Portugal  for  more  than  350  years.  The 
Portuguese  first  came  to  the  island  of  Timor  in  the  sixteenth  century, 
finding  sandalwood  in  considerable  quantity.  The  colony  was  later 
made  profitable  by  the  introduction  of  coffee,  which  remains  the 
island's  principal  crop.  Portuguese  traders,  backed  by  small  detach- 
ments of  soldiers,  quickly  conquered  or  established  relations  with  a 
number  of  small  Timorese  kingdoms.  The  Dutch  arrived  on  the 
island  in  the  early  seventeenth  century,  and  surrogates  of  the  govern- 
ments of  Portugal  and  the  Netherlands  competed  for  power  and 
influence  for  200  years.  The  partition  of  the  island  of  Timor  into 
Dutch  and  Portuguese  colonies  in  1859  laid  the  basis  for  economic 
and  social  hardship  that  lasted  into  the  early  twenty-first  century. 

In  1974,  after  a  liberal  military  coup  d'etat  in  Lisbon,  the  Portuguese 
government  withdrew  from  its  overseas  colonial  empire.  Concerned 
after  the  fall  of  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  and  Laos  to  communist  armies, 
Indonesia — as  well  as  some  other  regional  and  international  powers, 
especially  Australia  and  the  United  States — feared  that  East  Timor's 
leftist  Fretilin,  the  dominant  political  power  in  East  Timor,  might  pro- 
vide a  haven  for  communist  infiltration.  Indonesia  consequently  engi- 
neered a  formal  request  by  four  of  the  five  East  Timorese  political 
parties  for  integration  into  Indonesia,  known  as  the  Balibo  Declaration. 
On  November  28,  1975,  Fretilin  declared  East  Timor's  independence 
from  Portugal;  nine  days  later,  Indonesia's  armed  forces  launched  a 
full-scale  invasion,  and  East  Timor  was  incorporated  as  Indonesia's 
twenty-seventh  province.  ABRI  treated  its  military  campaign  against 
Fretilin  guerrillas  as  an  internal  security  operation,  and  the  province 
was  closed  to  the  news  media  and  foreign  observers  until  1988. 

The  UN  never  recognized  Indonesian  sovereignty  over  the  terri- 
tory, and  Australia  was  the  only  country  to  formally  recognize  the 
integration  of  East  Timor  into  Indonesia.  The  United  States  took  a 
middle  position  that  accepted  the  integration  of  East  Timor  into 
Indonesia  but  held  that  the  Balibo  Declaration  and  a  subsequent  "ref- 
erendum" were  not  legitimate.  This  political  issue  dogged  Indonesia 
for  years.  Fretilin  forces  withdrew  to  the  rugged  mountains  of  the 
interior  and  waged  guerrilla  warfare  against  the  Indonesian  army. 
During  the  next  20  years,  at  least  100,000  and  possibly  as  many  as 
250,000  East  Timorese  died  in  combat  or  from  disease  and  privation. 


321 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

The  majority  of  East  Timorese  did  not  support  integration.  It 
quickly  became  apparent  that  discontent  was  far  more  widespread 
than  the  Indonesian  government  and  armed  forces  acknowledged 
publicly.  Although  Indonesian  military  operations  reduced  Fretilin's 
strength  to  only  several  hundred  armed  partisans,  the  resistance 
movement  was  supported  by  what  the  armed  forces  termed  the 
klandestin,  a  large  clandestine  apparatus  that  provided  intelligence, 
shelter,  food,  and  supplies.  The  Indonesian  army  was  unable  to  sub- 
due the  military  force,  even  though  over  the  years  it  killed  or  captured 
a  succession  of  Fretilin  military  and  political  leaders.  ABRI  was 
never  able  to  win  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  East  Timorese  people 
because  of  mutual  mistrust  and  misunderstanding,  and  the  persistent 
use  of  the  military  to  force  the  civilian  populace  into  submission.  A 
series  of  major  human-rights  abuses  and  atrocities  kept  an  interna- 
tional focus  on  East  Timor.  Western  criticism  increased  as  improved 
communications  and  access  to  the  province  revealed  the  extent  of  the 
army's  violence  against  civilians. 

In  November  1991,  Indonesian  soldiers  killed  between  50  and  250 
civilians  and  wounded  others  participating  in  a  funeral  procession  at 
the  Santa  Cruz  Cemetery  in  Dili,  East  Timor's  capital.  This  incident 
proved  to  be  the  turning  point  that  focused  international  opposition  to 
Indonesian  military  operations  in  East  Timor.  In  an  effort  to  address 
the  problem,  the  army  implemented  for  the  first  time  the  principle  of 
command  responsibility.  The  respected  armed  forces  commander  in 
chief,  General  Edi  Sudrajat,  disciplined  five  levels  in  the  military 
chain  of  command  involved  in  the  incident,  including  two  generals — 
the  highest  ranking  in  the  East  Timor  operations — and  a  number  of 
field-grade  officers.  The  platoon  leaders  involved  were  court  mar- 
tialed  and  imprisoned.  But  both  the  military  and  the  civilian  govern- 
ment, apparently  obeying  orders  from  Suharto  himself,  persistently 
failed  to  give  a  full  accounting  of  the  number  of  civilians  killed  or  the 
disposition  of  the  remains  of  the  dead.  The  attack  at  Santa  Cruz  Cem- 
etery, and  the  government's  refusal  to  reveal  the  true  number  of  civil- 
ians killed  in  the  incident,  led  to  a  dramatic  decline  in  military-to- 
military  relations  between  the  United  States  and  Indonesia,  including 
an  end  to  the  International  Military  Education  and  Training  (IMET) 
Program  for  Indonesia. 

In  January  1999,  President  Habibie  proposed  an  expansive  local 
autonomy  package  for  East  Timor.  He  added  controversy  to  the  issue 
by  promising  "separation"  of  East  Timor  if  the  people  voted  against 
his  proposal.  There  followed  a  campaign  of  vicious  intimidation  by 
pro-Indonesian  militia  groups,  supported  by  elements  of  the  Indone- 
sian army,  intended  to  persuade  the  populace  to  approve  the  auton- 


322 


National  Security 


omy  package.  Despite  the  intense  intimidation,  however,  on  August 
30,  1999,  the  East  Timorese  voted  against  autonomy  by  a  margin  of 
78.5  percent  to  21.5  percent,  and  thus  began  a  process  of  transition 
toward  independence. 

The  violence  worsened  following  the  vote  against  autonomy.  As 
they  withdrew,  pro-Indonesia  militia  forces,  in  many  cases  assisted  by 
Indonesian  troops,  systematically  destroyed  most  of  the  town  centers 
and  infrastructure  of  East  Timor.  Estimates  vary,  but  militias  and  sol- 
diers may  have  killed  more  than  1,300  civilians  and  forced  more  than 
200,000  people  across  the  border  into  Indonesian  West  Timor  (Nusa 
Tenggara  Timur  Province).  Violence  was  so  widespread,  and  the  Indo- 
nesian security  forces  so  deeply  involved,  that  worldwide  pressure 
compelled  Indonesia  to  accept  the  entry  of  an  international  body  of 
armed  peacekeepers.  The  International  Force  in  East  Timor  (INTER- 
FET),  led  by  Australian  troops  and  recognized  by  the  UN — although  it 
was  not  designated  as  a  UN  force — restored  order  in  East  Timor.  In 
October  1999,  the  MPR  formally  detached  East  Timor  from  Indone- 
sia. The  next  month,  INTERFET  turned  over  control  to  the  UN  Tran- 
sitional Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET),  which,  along  with 
the  advisory  Timorese  National  Council,  ran  the  territory  until  inde- 
pendence— as  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste — on  May  20, 
2002. 

The  egregious  behavior  of  army-backed  militias,  and  the  unwill- 
ingness of  armed  forces  commander  in  chief  General  Wiranto  to 
accept  any  responsibility  for  it  or  to  discipline  those  involved, 
caused  Australia,  Britain,  the  United  States,  and  other  nations  to  fur- 
ther limit  military  relations  with  Indonesia.  The  United  States  sus- 
pended arms  sales,  halted  the  few  remaining  education  and  training 
programs,  and  imposed  political  conditions  on  the  restoration  of  mil- 
itary-to-military relations.  Only  after  the  December  2004  tsunami 
struck  Aceh  did  the  United  States  restore  Indonesia's  eligibility  for 
IMET  funding  and  allow  the  sale  of  spare  parts  for  transport  aircraft 
under  Foreign  Military  Financing  (FMF)  beneficial  pricing. 

Separatist  Rebellions 

The  primary  threat  to  Indonesia's  national  security  has  been  posed 
by  separatist  guerrilla  insurgencies  in  East  Timor,  Aceh,  and,  to  a 
lesser  extent,  Papua  and  by  extremist  and  terrorist  organizations.  The 
separation  of  East  Timor  in  1999  removed  what  Indonesia's  former 
foreign  minister  Ali  Alatas  once  injudiciously  described  as  "a  pebble 
in  Indonesia's  shoe."  The  peaceful  political  settlement  of  the  Aceh 
separatist  insurgency  ended  a  major  security  threat  as  well.  Indone- 
sia's primary  security  threat  is  now  posed  by  Islamic  extremist  and 


323 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

terrorist  organizations  opposed  to  the  moderate  secular  government 
system  in  Indonesia.  Jemaah  Islamiyah  (Congregation  of  Islam),  a 
regional  terrorist  organization  with  links  to  Al  Qaeda,  whose  goal  is 
to  create  a  Muslim  state  in  Southeast  Asia,  has  conducted  several  ter- 
rorist attacks  around  the  country  and  has  been  deeply  involved  in 
communal  violence  in  Maluku  and  Sulawesi  Tengah  provinces. 

Aceh 

Aceh,  on  the  northern  end  of  the  island  of  Sumatra,  was  for 
decades  the  most  troubled  and  insecure  province  of  Indonesia,  with  a 
history  of  opposition  to  outside  rule  from  its  time  as  an  independent 
sultanate.  Acehnese  maintained  a  broad  range  of  grievances  against 
the  central  government  that  included  a  desire  to  keep  a  greater  per- 
centage of  the  revenue  from  the  rich  natural  resources  in  the  prov- 
ince, resentment  over  brutal  tactics  by  police  and  military  forces,  and 
a  desire  for  more  native  Acehnese  to  be  employed  in  the  lucrative 
natural  resources  sector. 

A  small  minority  of  Acehnese  have  demanded  independence.  The 
separatist  Free  Aceh  Movement  (GAM)  began  guerrilla  warfare  in 
Aceh  in  the  mid-1970s.  Its  political  and  military  wings  were  distinct. 
A  succession  of  GAM  military  commanders  had  given  allegiance  to 
the  GAM's  political  leader,  Hasan  di  Tiro,  a  longtime  refugee  in 
Sweden.  However,  years  of  separation  and  the  resentment  caused  by 
the  relative  safety  of  political  leaders  in  Europe  while  GAM  person- 
nel in  Aceh  faced  daily  danger,  led  to  a  split  that  persists  to  this  day. 
Attacks  on  public  facilities  and  transportation,  reprisal  operations  by 
both  sides,  and  a  lack  of  skill  in  combating  insurgency  on  the  part  of 
the  military  and  the  police  contributed  to  a  high  level  of  noncomba- 
tant  casualties  and  insecurity  throughout  the  province.  By  2000  the 
GAM  had  made  extensive  advances  in  the  countryside  and  was  pro- 
viding government  services  in  several  areas  of  the  province. 

The  first  three  post- Suharto  administrations  attempted  to  negoti- 
ate a  political  settlement  with  the  GAM.  In  early  2002,  President 
Megawati  Sukarnoputri  authorized  negotiations  for  a  political  settle- 
ment while  maintaining  military  pressure  on  the  GAM.  In  December 
2002,  the  two  sides  signed  the  Cessation  of  Hostilities  Agreement. 
The  situation  on  the  ground  was  fragile  from  the  start,  and  the  agree- 
ment collapsed  in  May  2003  over  the  basic  issue  of  the  future  of 
Aceh — whether  it  should  be  a  province  of  Indonesia  or  an  indepen- 
dent state. 

In  May  2003,  after  the  collapse  of  the  agreement,  the  central  gov- 
ernment implemented  a  year  of  martial  law  in  Aceh,  and  combat 
operations  resumed  immediately.  The  subsequent  joint  military- 


324

police  action  was  the  largest  security  operation  since  Indonesia's 
1975  invasion  of  East  Timor,  with  an  estimated  30,000  military  per- 
sonnel and  20,000  police  deployed  against  the  GAM.  Security  oper- 
ations resulted  in  the  death,  capture,  or  surrender  of  thousands  of 
alleged  GAM  cadre  and  supporters  and  drove  armed  GAM  bands 
into  remote  areas  of  the  province.  Human-rights  organizations 
charged  that  many  of  the  casualties  were  innocent  civilians.  Because 
of  heavy  casualties,  the  GAM  reverted  to  classic  guerrilla  warfare 
tactics.  Nonetheless,  it  remained  a  potent  military  adversary  and 
political  force. 

When  the  devastating  earthquake  and  tsunami  struck  Aceh  in 
2004,  more  than  166,000  people  died.  The  tragedy  struck  both  sides 
of  the  insurgency,  with  heavy  casualties  among  both  guerrillas  and 
government  security  forces  and  their  families.  The  sheer  magnitude 
of  the  tragedy  created  the  conditions  conducive  to  a  comprehensive 
political  settlement.  As  a  result  of  the  tragedy  and  the  relief  opera- 
tions that  followed,  Aceh  finally  reached  the  beginning  of  a  compre- 
hensive solution  to  the  long-running  insurgency.  After  secret  talks 
between  representatives  of  the  Indonesian  government  and  the  GAM, 
by  mutual  agreement  between  Indonesian  President  Yudhoyono  and 
the  GAM  leadership,  representatives  of  the  two  sides  met  in  Helsinki, 
Finland,  under  the  auspices  of  Crisis  Management  Initiative  (CMI),  a 
nongovernmental  organization,  led  by  the  former  Finnish  president, 
Martti  Ahtisaari. 

Both  sides  made  significant  concessions:  The  GAM  agreed  to 
accept  the  principle  of  autonomy  and  dropped  its  demand  for  complete 
independence,  while  the  Indonesian  government  agreed  to  allow 
GAM  members  to  run  for  elective  office.  The  two  sides  signed  a  peace 
agreement  on  August  15,  2005.  Disarmament  of  GAM  forces  and

removal  of  police  and  military  forces  went  smoothly,  with  decommis- 
sioning and  demobilization  completed  on  schedule  by  December  27, 
2005.  The  GAM  formally  dissolved  itself  in  January  2006,  although  it 
is  possible  that  remnants  continue  to  exist.  Indonesia's  legislature 
passed  a  revised  local  autonomy  law  for  Aceh  in  June  2006,  which 
contained  many  of  the  provisions  in  the  Helsinki  agreement.  Acehnese 
political  leaders  vowed  to  continue  to  strive  for  additional  legislative 
concessions  in  the  future. 

Successful  province-wide  elections  took  place  in  December  2006, 
in  which  former  GAM  figures  competed  for  office  with  existing 
political  parties.  The  election  for  governor  resulted  in  a  resounding 
victory  for  a  former  GAM  spokesman,  who  defeated  seven  other  can- 
didates and  won  almost  40  percent  of  the  total  votes  cast.  His  closest 
competitor  received  only  1 7  percent.  The  election  was  significant  for 
several  reasons.  First,  it  was  peaceful,  with  virtually  no  violence  dur- 
ing the  campaign  and  vote.  Second,  the  victor  was  a  "local  GAM" — 
one  who  stayed  in  Aceh  during  the  insurgency — who  defeated  candi- 
dates representing  the  long-exiled  international  GAM  leadership. 
Third,  the  winner  defeated  candidates  supported  by  the  existing  polit- 
ical parties  in  Aceh.  And  fourth,  there  was  no  challenge  to  his  victory, 
and  national  leaders  and  legislators  in  Jakarta  pledged  support  for  his 
tenure  in  office.  District-level  elections  held  at  the  same  time  brought 
many  former  GAM  fighters  into  political  office  as  well  (see  Elec- 
tions, ch.  4).  By  2009  Aceh's  government  and  administration  func- 
tioned much  as  those  in  other  provinces,  although  disputes  over  the 
application  and  enforcement  of  Islamic  law  or  sharia  (see  Glossary) 
were  here  more  strident  than  anywhere  else  in  the  nation. 

Papua 

Indonesia  no  longer  faces  a  significant  secessionist  movement  in 
its  easternmost  provinces  of  Papua  and  Papua  Barat.  Rather,  the 
rapid  changes  at  the  start  of  the  twenty-first  century  have  exacerbated 
the  preexisting  problems  of  poverty,  high  unemployment,  environ- 
mental degradation,  and  the  poor  quality  of  many  government  ser- 
vices. The  greatest  threat  to  security  is  posed  not  by  secessionist 
violence  but  by  increased  social,  ethnic,  and  religious  tensions 
between  the  indigenous  Papuan  population  and  the  swelling  tide  of 
non-Papuans  from  elsewhere  in  Indonesia,  drawn  by  opportunities  in 
the  commercial,  agricultural,  and  extractive  industries  in  the  two 
provinces. 

The  remaining  small  secessionist  movement  in  Papua  is  remote 
and  fragmented.  The  Free  Papua  Organization  (OPM)  formed  in 
1969  and  has  been  conducting  a  low-level  armed  insurgency  since 


326 


National  Security 


then.  The  OPM  is  fragmented  into  several  factions  whose  goals 
range  from  independence  to  a  merger  with  neighboring  Papua  New 
Guinea,  autonomy,  or  better  treatment  by  the  central  government. 
The  influx  of  new  residents  resettled  under  the  government's  now- 
defunct  Transmigration  Program  (see  Glossary)  caused  resentment 
among  the  indigenous  population  and  brought  new  recruits  into  both 
the  OPM's  political  and  military  structures.  However,  since  the  early 
2000s  that  resentment  has  manifested  itself  in  mostly  urban  political 
demonstrations,  and  the  OPM  has  steadily  lost  strength.  Indonesian 
military  operations  in  Papua  have  claimed  many  lives  over  the  years, 
and  nonviolent  pro-independence  OPM  spokespersons  have  been 
jailed  on  charges  of  subversion. 

The  fight  between  the  OPM  and  the  security  forces  pits  a  rudimen- 
tary force  against  a  high-technology  police  and  military.  The  remain- 
ing OPM  guerrilla  bands  were  concentrated  in  the  hinterlands  of 
Jayapura,  Merauke,  Mimika,  and  Paniai  by  late  2008.  The  guerrillas 
coordinate  few,  if  any,  of  their  operations;  instead,  they  select  and 
strike  at  targets  as  resources  and  opportunities  become  available. 
OPM  targets  include  small  police  and  military  posts  and  patrols  and 
unarmed,  nonmilitary  groups,  such  as  civilian  timber  workers.  The 
last  significant  attack  by  the  OPM  occurred  in  2002,  when  a  force  led 
by  admitted  OPM  guerrillas  attacked  a  group  of  mostly  American 
teachers  near  Tembagapura,  site  of  a  huge  open-face  mine  operated 
by  Freeport-McMoRan  Copper  and  Gold — known  locally  as  P.  T. 
Freeport-Indonesia — and  protected  by  Indonesian  military  and 
police,  who  are  paid  by  Freeport.  Two  Americans  and  one  Indonesian 
were  killed,  and  eight  Americans  and  Indonesians  were  wounded.  By 
2006  the  leaders  of  the  attack  had  been  captured,  tried,  and  convicted 
of  assault  and  murder.  There  were  other  attacks,  also  near  the  Free- 
port  mine  in  2009. 

The  OPM  is  believed  to  have  fewer  than  1,000  armed  guerrillas. 
Many  of  its  unarmed  supporters  have  turned  their  attention  to  peace- 
ful urban  demonstrations  to  express  grievances.  Active,  full-time 
OPM  activity  is  limited  to  those  guerrillas  living  in  the  jungles  fight- 
ing with  spears,  bows,  arrows,  bush  knives,  and  stolen  and  captured 
guns,  mostly  of  military  and  police  origin.  The  OPM  is  viewed  as  a 
political  movement  with  an  extremely  limited  military  capability  that 
poses  no  threat  to  Jakarta.  However,  it  is  another  centripetal  force 
encouraging  the  fragmentation  of  Indonesia.  The  central  government 
maintains  approximately  10,000  military  and  police  in  Papua.  The 
missions  of  these  forces  include  the  destruction  of  OPM  military 
units,  general  law  and  order  and  security,  and  protection  of  the  desig- 
nated strategic  industry  locations  that  include  the  Freeport  mine  at

Ethnic  and  Religious  Conflict 

A  key  characteristic  of  Suharto's  New  Order  regime  was  the  prev- 
alence of  security  and  order  throughout  the  nation.  Any  outbreak  of 
violence  between  ethnic  or  religious  groups  was  quickly  and  sternly 
repressed.  Tensions  simmered  below  the  surface,  however,  and  after 
Suharto's  fall  in  1998,  ethnic  and  religious  conflict  erupted  in  several 
regions.  Security  forces  were  initially  ineffective  in  regaining  con- 
trol because  the  police,  poorly  trained,  poorly  equipped,  and  under- 
staffed, were  ill  prepared  to  handle  large-scale  unrest.  The  TNI, 
stung  by  accusations  of  human-rights  abuses,  and  resentful  of  the 
change  in  mission  responsibility,  was  reluctant  to  intervene  without  a 
formal  request  for  assistance  from  local  authorities. 

In  Kalimantan  Barat  Province,  the  relative  harmony  that  had  pre- 
vailed among  native  Malays,  ethnic  Chinese,  and  Dayaks  for  genera- 
tions was  upset  by  the  influx  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Madurese 
under  the  Transmigration  Program  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Commu- 
nal violence  in  the  1 990s  was  triggered  by  Dayak  discontent  with  the 
Madurese  community's  hold  on  the  economic  balance  of  power  in  the 
region,  and  by  a  perception  that  the  Madurese  were  illegally  taking 
Dayak  land.  Hundreds  of  settlers  were  killed  in  the  Sambas  area  of 
Kalimantan  Barat  in  early  1999  and  the  Sampit  area  of  Kalimantan 
Tengah  Province  in  February  2001.  By  April  2001,  almost  100,000 
Madurese,  many  of  whom  had  resided  in  Kalimantan  for  several  gen- 
erations, had  been  evacuated  to  Madura  and  Java.  Dayak  leaders  and 
government  officials  conducted  reconciliation  talks,  but  the  return  of 
the  Madurese  was  slow  to  occur. 

Conflict  broke  out  in  Maluku  Province  in  1999  after  a  seemingly 
minor  clash  between  a  bus  driver  and  a  passenger  who  refused  to  pay 
his  fare  exploded  into  wide-ranging  Muslim-Christian  violence  in 
Ambon  that  quickly  expanded  throughout  the  Maluku  Islands.  More 
than  5,000  people  were  killed  between  1999  and  2002.  Islamic  mili- 
tants in  Jakarta  called  for  jihad  to  support  their  coreligionists  on  the 
islands.  Similar  Muslim-Christian  violence  flared  around  the  Sulawesi 
Tengah  city  of  Poso  during  the  same  period.  Hard-line  civilian  and 
military  sympathizers,  who  wanted  to  destabilize  the  regime  of  then- 
President  Abdurrahman  Wahid,  collaborated  to  organize,  train,  equip, 
and  arm  the  Laskar  Jihad  (Jihad  Militia)  and  arranged  the  unimpeded 
transfer  of  several  thousand  members  of  the  militia  to  both  Ambon  and 
Poso.  This  caused  a  major  escalation  of  the  conflict.  The  government 
declared  a  civil  emergency,  one  step  short  of  martial  law.  In  February 


328 


National  Security 


2002,  leaders  of  the  Christian  and  Muslim  communities  in  Poso  and 
Maluku  Province  signed  two  separate  peace  agreements  aimed  at  end- 
ing three  years  of  sectarian  fighting.  Both  agreements  were  brokered 
by  Muhammad  Yusuf  Kalla,  who,  two  years  later,  was  elected  vice 
president  of  Indonesia.  The  level  of  conflict  quickly  fell,  but  sporadic 
violence  remained  endemic  to  the  entire  region. 

Terrorism 

Religious  extremism  has  disturbed  Indonesia's  domestic  security 
as  far  back  as  the  1950s  and  1960s,  when  organizations  such  as 
Darul  Islam  and  Bangsa  Islam  Indonesia  fought  for  the  establish- 
ment of  an  Islamic  state.  It  was  not  until  the  early  twenty-first  cen- 
tury that  terrorism,  both  domestic  and  international,  was  recognized 
as  a  major  internal  threat.  In  2000  dozens  of  people  died  in  a  series 
of  urban  terrorist  attacks  on  the  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  and  on 
churches  and  shopping  malls  on  Sumatra  and  Java.  In  Singapore  and 
Malaysia,  authorities  uncovered  plots  by  the  regional  terrorist  orga- 
nization Jemaah  Islamiyah.  Suspects  arrested  in  Singapore  revealed 
the  existence  of  Jemaah  Islamiyah  cells  in  Indonesia. 

Indonesian  authorities  initially  ignored  intelligence  warnings 
about  terrorists  inside  Indonesia.  Then,  on  October  12,  2002,  Jemaah 
Islamiyah  terrorists  bombed  two  nightclubs  in  Kuta,  Bali,  killing  202 
people  and  injuring  around  300,  many  of  them  foreign  tourists.  Sub- 
sequent Jemaah  Islamiyah  attacks  in  Jakarta  in  August  2003  and 
September  2004,  as  well  as  other  bombings  in  Bali  in  October  2005, 
killed  49  more  and  injured  458,  almost  all  Indonesians.  These 
attacks  finally  led  to  recognition  throughout  Indonesia  that  Islamist 
terrorists  were  active  in  the  country.  Indonesian  and  international 
investigators  tied  earlier  domestic  terrorist  attacks  to  Jemaah  Islami- 
yah as  well,  and  Indonesian  leaders  acknowledged  the  threat  posed 
by  international  as  well  as  domestic  terrorists.  In  late  2004,  the  Yud- 
hoyono  government  adopted  a  more  confrontational  policy  against 
terrorism,  which  appeared  likely  to  remain  a  significant  threat  to 
Indonesia's  security. 

Several  security  units  have  been  specifically  assigned  a  counter- 
terrorism  mission.  The  newest  of  these  is  the  National  Police  counter- 
terrorism  unit,  usually  called  Detachment  88,  which  was  formed  in 
2002  with  extensive  funding,  training,  and  equipment  from  the 
United  States.  It  has  both  investigative  and  tactical-response  capabil- 
ities (see  The  National  Police,  this  ch.).  Detachment  88  has  been  suc- 
cessful in  tracking  down  and  arresting  scores  of  accused  and 
suspected  terrorists  and  support  personnel.  Several  high- value  terror- 
ists were  killed  in  armed  shootouts.  The  Indonesian  judicial  system 


329 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

has  convicted  and  imprisoned  dozens  of  terrorists  since  2005.  The 
three  men  who  planned  the  Bali  bombings  were  executed  in  Novem- 
ber 2008  after  more  than  three  years  of  investigation,  trials,  convic- 
tions, and  legal  appeals.  Indonesian  authorities  have  made  important 
progress  against  both  organized  terrorist  organizations,  such  as 
Jemaah  Islamiyah,  and  affiliated  splinter  terrorist  cells. 

Each  of  the  three  branches  of  the  TNI  has  at  least  one  special  oper- 
ations unit  with  a  counterterrorism  mission.  The  largest  of  these,  Unit 
81,  is  part  of  the  Army  Special  Forces  Command  (Komando  Pasukan 
Khusus — Kopassus).  There  are  also  smaller  counterterrorism  units  in 
the  air  force  and  navy.  Unit  8 1  is  highly  trained  in  intelligence,  detec- 
tion, and  tactical-assault  counterterrorist  tactics.  The  navy's  "frog- 
man" unit  trains  for  counterterrorism  raids  against  such  maritime 
targets  as  offshore  oil  platforms,  docks  and  harbor  targets,  and  ships 
that  have  been  seized  by  terrorists. 

The  Armed  Forces  in  National  Life 

The  armed  forces  did  not  initially  seek  to  play  a  dominant  political 
position,  even  though  they  played  a  role  in  the  establishment  of  the 
republic,  in  the  formative  years  of  Indonesian  parliamentary  democ- 
racy. Circumstances,  rather  than  deliberate  planning,  pressed  the  armed 
forces  to  gradually  enlarge  their  role  in  national  life.  As  it  consolidated 
each  stage  of  its  growing  political  power,  however,  the  military  leader- 
ship grew  protective  of  its  gains.  Suharto  skillfully  used  the  military  as 
his  primary  instrument  of  power  during  his  32-year  rule.  In  return,  the 
military  leadership  was  handsomely  rewarded.  The  inculcation  of  Pan- 
casila  and  the  institutionalization  of  dwifungsi  brought  the  military  to 
its  most  powerful  position  in  the  early  1990s. 

Some  influential  senior  officers  had,  however,  become  concerned 
by  the  mid-1990s  that  the  prestige  and  honor  of  the  military  were 
being  compromised  by  excessive  involvement  in  the  day-to-day 
political  and  social  affairs  of  the  nation.  Many  moderate  officers 
pressed  for  change,  including  former  armed  forces  commander  in 
chief  General  Edi  Sudrajat,  former  National  Defense  Institute  com- 
mandant Lieutenant  General  Sofian  Effendi,  the  late  Lieutenant 
General  Agus  Wirahadikusumah,  and  leading  military  intellectual 
Lieutenant  General  Agus  Wijoyo.  All  four  became  leaders  in  the 
military  reform  movement  after  their  retirement. 

Suharto's  forced  resignation  in  May  1998  was  discreetly  facilitated 
by  the  military  leadership,  which  refused  to  seize  power  to  protect  the 
president's  position.  From  its  earliest  days,  the  Indonesian  military 
had  never  contemplated  a  coup  d'etat  in  Indonesia;  that  tradition  and 
the  growing  reformist  element  in  the  military  played  an  important

role  in  keeping  the  armed  forces  from  taking  power  even  though 
Suharto  reportedly  offered  the  presidency  to  General  Wiranto,  then 
the  armed  forces  commander  in  chief.  Since  then,  the  armed  forces 
have  supported  the  transition  to  democracy,  implemented  a  number  of 
reforms,  displayed  a  more  moderate  face  to  the  populace,  and  main- 
tained discipline  and  a  leadership  image  in  contrast  to  that  of  the 
often  corrupt  and  hapless  post- Suharto  civilian  officialdom.  The  TNI 
remains  the  most  powerful  element  in  Indonesian  society  and  retains 
significant  influence  over  the  country's  political  life. 

Political  and  Administrative  Role 

Indonesia's  transition  from  autocracy  to  democracy  has  been 
lengthy  and  difficult,  with  various  power  centers  vying  for  a  role  in 
the  new  political  environment.  Enlightened  leadership  by  Admiral 
Widodo  Adi  Sucipto  (appointed  by  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid 
as  the  first  naval  officer  to  head  the  armed  forces)  and  General 
Endriartono  Sutarto,  whose  tenure  as  TNI  commander  in  chief 
spanned  the  presidencies  of  Megawati  Sukarnoputri  and  the  early 
months  of  the  first  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  administration,  con- 
firmed the  relatively  restrained  and  more  moderate  role  of  the  mili- 
tary at  the  beginning  of  the  twenty-first  century.  The  armed  forces' 
perception  of  their  political  role  has  developed  into  that  of  a  national 
institution  above  partisan  interests  and  closely  tied  to  the  people, 
with  a  duty  to  foster  conditions  of  order  and  security  in  which  the 
habits  of  a  stable  and  institutionalized  political  process  can  develop. 
This  self-perception  identifies  a  force  far  different  from  the  one  that 
fought  for  independence  in  the  1940s,  evolved  through  the  tumultu- 
ous political  changes  of  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  subsequently 
engaged  in  a  complex  process  of  give-and-take  with  the  autocratic 
Suharto  during  his  long  rule. 

Participation  in  the  Economy 

The  military  has  never  been  as  dominant  in  the  economic  sphere 
as  in  the  political  sphere.  Total  military  expenditures  as  a  percentage 
of  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  began  a  steady 
decline  in  the  1960s,  with  the  military  share  of  the  budget  shrinking 
from  29  percent  in  1970  to  just  over  1  percent  by  2009. 

The  military's  primary  means  of  economic  influence  derives  from 
operation  of  a  business  empire,  comprising  both  legal  and  illicit 
enterprises,  which  had  its  beginnings  in  the  struggle  for  indepen- 
dence. It  expanded  in  December  1957,  when  Dutch  enterprises  and 
agricultural  estates  were  taken  over  by  local  trade  unions  and  imme- 
diately put  under  direct  military  supervision.  December  1958  legisla- 


332 


National  Security 


tion  led  to  the  nationalization  of  these  enterprises  and  estates  during 
the  first  half  of  1959.  This  involvement  in  commercial  enterprises 
projected  the  military,  especially  the  army,  into  a  new  sphere  of 
activity,  where  it  acquired  entrepreneurial  expertise,  a  vast  patron- 
age, and  a  source  of  enrichment  for  many  of  its  personnel.  By  the 
1990s,  the  military  business  empire  may  have  provided  as  much  as 
two-thirds  of  the  total  military  budget.  However,  the  region-wide 
economic  crisis  that  began  in  1 997  had  a  significant  adverse  effect 
on  the  TNI's  income  from  off-budget  sources.  While  the  policy  of 
economic  involvement  continued  through  the  1990s  and  into  the 
twenty-first  century,  it  was  estimated  that  the  large  military  business 
empire,  and  diversions  from  other  budgetary  resources,  had  declined 
significantly  in  the  first  decade  of  the  2000s.  Although  no  definitive 
information  has  ever  been  provided  on  the  amount  of  funds  received 
from  the  military's  business  enterprises,  it  was  estimated  to  have 
shrunk  to  less  than  half  of  the  total  funding  received  by  the  TNI. 

Engaged  in  enterprises  such  as  air  and  highway  transportation, 
shopping  centers,  and  mines,  many  military-owned  businesses  oper- 
ate in  the  open  market  much  like  any  private  company.  In  an  effort  to 
gain  greater  control  over  the  military-run  business  empire,  in  2004 
the  DPR  mandated  that  such  military  businesses  be  civilianized  by 
2009,  a  process  that  was  not  100-  percent  completed  on  schedule.  The 
TNI  will  continue  to  operate  military-supervised  cooperatives  (simi- 
lar to  the  U.S.  military's  post-exchange  and  commissary  systems). 

Far  more  controversial  than  these  legitimate  enterprises  are  the 
illicit  businesses  run  by  both  the  military  and  the  police.  Accurate 
information  on  such  activities  is  understandably  difficult  to  obtain. 
Both  the  armed  forces  and  the  police  allegedly  are  involved  in  illegal 
businesses  ranging  from  extortion,  gambling,  and  "security  protec- 
tion" rackets  to  more  substantial  enterprises  such  as  illegal  logging, 
support  of  renegade  mining  operations,  and  trafficking  in  marijuana. 
Subsequent  to  the  separation  of  the  police  and  the  military  in  1999, 
there  have  been  occasional  outbreaks  of  violence  as  personnel  from 
the  two  institutions  strive  to  protect  "turf  and  at  the  same  time 
poach  on  the  illegal  enterprises  of  the  other  side. 

Another  kind  of  military  enterprise  was  the  service-owned  fac- 
tory, which  had  as  its  primary  purpose  the  production  of  ordnance 
and  equipment  for  the  armed  forces.  By  the  mid-1980s,  however,  the 
government  had  taken  over  and  managed  as  public-sector  enterprises 
such  major  concerns  as  the  navy's  P.  T.  PAL  shipyard  in  Surabaya, 
Jawa  Timur  Province,  and  the  army's  munitions  factories. 

While  they  cannot  be  singled  out  from  other  actors  in  the  national 
economy,  the  armed  forces  of  the  early  twenty-first  century  continue 


333 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

to  face  the  problem  of  coping  with  a  legacy  of  corruption.  The  mili- 
tary, though,  is  still  viewed  by  Indonesian  society  as  generally  less 
corrupt  than  other  sectors  of  the  government.  Nonetheless,  the  low 
salaries  of  military  personnel  require  that  they  take  up  "constructive 
employment"  to  make  ends  meet. 

Total  People's  Defense 

Indonesia's  military  operations  rely  on  a  well-developed  doctrine 
of  national  security  called  Total  People's  Defense  (Hankamrata). 
Based  on  experiences  during  the  struggle  for  independence,  this  doc- 
trine proclaims  that  Indonesia  can  neither  afford  to  maintain  a  large 
military  apparatus  nor  compromise  its  hard-won  independence  by 
sacrificing  its  nonaligned  status  and  depending  on  other  nations  to 
provide  its  defense.  Instead,  the  nation  will  defend  itself  through  a 
strategy  of  territorial  guerrilla  warfare  in  which  the  armed  forces, 
deployed  throughout  the  nation,  serve  as  a  cadre  force  to  rally  and 
lead  the  entire  population  in  a  people's  war  of  defense.  Military  plan- 
ners envision  a  three-stage  war,  comprising  a  short  initial  period  in 
which  an  invader  might  defeat  conventional  Indonesian  resistance 
and  establish  its  own  control,  a  long  period  of  unconventional, 
regionally  based  fighting,  and  a  final  phase  in  which  the  invaders 
eventually  are  repelled. 

The  success  of  this  strategy,  according  to  the  doctrine,  requires 
that  a  close  bond  be  maintained  between  citizen  and  soldier  to 
encourage  the  support  of  the  entire  population  and  enable  the  mili- 
tary to  manage  all  war-related  resources.  The  people  would  provide 
logistical  support,  intelligence,  and  upkeep  in  this  scenario,  and,  as 
resources  permit,  some  civilians  would  be  organized,  trained,  and 
armed  to  join  the  guerrilla  struggle.  To  support  these  objectives,  the 
TNI  maintains  the  army's  territorial  organization,  comprising  12 
military  regional  commands  (Komando  Daerah  Militer — Kodams) 
encompassing  an  estimated  two-thirds  of  the  army's  strength.  The 
territorial  commands  parallel  the  civilian  governmental  structure, 
with  units  at  the  province,  district,  and  village  level.  Armed  forces 
personnel  also  engage  in  large-scale  civic-action  projects  involving 
community  and  rural  development  in  order  to  draw  closer  to  the  peo- 
ple, ensure  the  continued  support  of  the  populace,  and  develop 
among  army  personnel  a  detailed  knowledge  of  the  region  to  which 
they  are  assigned.  (Finally,  and  doctrine  aside,  the  territorial  struc- 
ture provided  the  base  upon  which  most  of  the  army  business  empire 
flourished.) 

Attention  to  potential  external  threats  grew  during  the  1970s  as 
planners  became  concerned  with  the  growing  military  power  of  the

newly  unified  Socialist  Republic  of  Vietnam  and  its  allies,  including 
the  Soviet  Union.  At  the  same  time,  China  began  publishing  maps 
that  made  a  claim  to  virtually  all  of  the  South  China  Sea,  including 
the  Natuna  Islands,  a  chain  off  the  western  tip  of  Kalimantan.  Indo- 
nesia responded  with  a  major  intraservice  military  exercise  (Latihan 
Gabungan — LatGap — Joint  Exercise)  in  the  Natuna  Islands.  China 
soon  withdrew  the  map,  and  relations  between  the  two  countries 
remained  stable. 

Political  developments  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  subse- 
quently relieved  tensions  in  Southeast  Asia.  These  developments 
included  efforts  to  bring  peace  to  Cambodia,  during  which  Indone- 
sia's three-battalion  deployment  was  the  largest  military  contribution 
to  the  UN  Transitional  Authority  in  Cambodia  (UNTAC);  the  with- 
drawal of  Vietnamese  troops  from  Cambodia;  and  the  reduced  per- 
ception of  a  general  threat  from  Vietnam  and  China.  Nonetheless,  the 
potential  for  regional  conflict — for  example,  over  territorial  claims  in 
the  Spratly  Islands  in  the  South  China  Sea — continued  to  trouble  stra- 
tegic planners  (see  Foreign  Policy,  ch.  4).  In  the  post-Cold  War  era, 
Indonesia  has  quietly  continued  to  support  the  maintenance  of  a  U.S. 
regional  security  presence  to  prevent  a  vacuum  that  could  be  filled  by 
potentially  less  benevolent  outsiders. 

Defense  Spending  and  the  Defense  Industry 

Indonesia  is  unique  among  developing  countries,  and  unusual 
among  other  Asian  countries,  in  the  relatively  low  priority  given  to 


335

defense  spending.  In  2009  there  were  some  302,000  personnel  in 
Indonesia's  active  armed  forces,  and  the  military  budget  totaled 
US$3.4  billion,  about  the  same  military  budget  and  force  level  as 
Thailand,  a  country  with  less  than  one-third  of  Indonesia's  popula- 
tion, and  Burma  (Myanmar),  which  has  only  one-quarter  of  Indone- 
sia's population.  Singapore,  with  a  population  less  than  2  percent  of 
Indonesia's,  has  more  than  72,000  active-duty  military  personnel — a 
force  more  than  nine  times  larger  than  Indonesia's  on  a  per-capita 
basis.  The  results  of  Indonesia's  relatively  limited  commitment  to  the 
military  are  aged  weapons  systems,  poor  maintenance,  and  low  levels 
of  combat  readiness.  The  TNI's  readiness  posture  was  also  badly 
affected  by  the  arms  embargo  imposed  by  the  United  States  and  other 
arms  suppliers.  Chronic  poor  maintenance  was  compounded  by  Indo- 
nesia's inability  to  purchase  spare  parts,  which  resulted  in  the  inoper- 
ability  of  most  of  the  air  force  C-130  transport  fleet,  most  of  the 
transport  helicopter  fleet,  and  many  of  the  navy's  logistics  and  trans- 
port ships.  The  effect  of  these  shortcomings  was  sadly  demonstrated 
in  the  TNI's  inability  to  respond  quickly  to  the  devastation  caused  by 
the  2004  tsunami. 

By  the  late  1970s,  Indonesia  had  retired  most  of  the  Soviet-bloc 
military  hardware  left  over  from  the  Sukarno  era.  Between  1977  and 
1982,  national  allocations  to  the  Department  of  Defense  and  Security 
and  armed  forces  doubled  in  absolute  terms,  and  modest  upgrades 
took  place  in  all  three  military  services.  Ensuing  years  saw  the  mili- 
tary portion  of  the  budget  stabilize  at  between  6  and  7  percent  of  the 
overall  state  budget.  However,  with  the  military  having  to  obtain  as 
much  as  two-thirds  of  its  total  revenues  from  its  own  business 
empire,  the  official  budget  figures  were  misleading. 

The  last  quarter  of  the  twentieth  century  saw  the  purchase  of  mate- 
riel such  as  F-5  and  F-16  fighter  aircraft  (in  1978  and  1988,  respec- 
tively) and  ground  attack  aircraft  (in  1981);  several  used  frigates 
and  destroyers;  and  tanks,  armored  personnel  carriers,  and  towed 
howitzers.  The  most  controversial  acquisition  was  the  purchase,  in 
the  mid-1990s,  of  nearly  the  entire  navy  of  the  former  Democratic 
Republic  of  Germany  (East  Germany — DDR).  While  the  price  for  the 
39  ships  was  relatively  low,  the  costs  to  upgrade,  acclimatize,  and 
maintain  these  aging  vessels  soon  became  prohibitive.  The  purchase 
strained  the  defense  budget  for  many  years,  and  by  the  early  twenty- 
first  century  most  of  the  ships  were  no  longer  operational.  This  pur- 
chase was  arranged  by  then-Minister  of  Research  and  Technology  B. 
J.  Habibie,  thus  straining  his  relationship  with  the  military. 

Many  traditional  military  suppliers  began  to  reduce  the  scope  and 
breadth  of  military  relations  with  Indonesia  in  the  1990s,  to  protest

human-rights  abuses  in  East  Timor.  The  violence  there  in  1999 
caused  the  United  States,  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  Australia  to 
cease  arms  sales  entirely.  As  a  result,  Indonesia's  military  equipment 
deteriorated  dramatically  because  of  a  lack  of  spare  parts  and  mainte- 
nance. Only  after  the  December  2004  tsunami  disaster  in  Aceh  did 
those  countries  resume  progress  toward  normalization  of  their  respec- 
tive military-to-military  relations.  Because  of  that  experience  and  to 
avoid  the  potential  of  any  future  military  embargo,  Indonesia  has 
deliberately  broadened  its  sources  of  military  equipment  and  weap- 
ons systems.  In  the  early  twenty-first  century,  Indonesia  completed 
agreements  to  acquire  major  weapons  systems  from  Russia,  China, 
several  East  European  nations,  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea), 
and  the  Netherlands,  among  others. 

Indonesia  is  far  from  self-sufficient  in  the  production  of  weapons 
and  defense-related  materiel.  Domestic  facilities  remain  inadequate 
for  the  repair  of  certain  complex  weapons  systems,  and  equipment 
inventories  often  represent  considerable  overstatements  of  what  is 
actually  in  functioning  order.  Moreover,  although  defense  guidelines 
favor  the  standardization  of  weaponry  and  other  defense  materiel, 
such  as  communications  equipment  and  ground  and  air  transport  sys- 
tems, the  armed  forces  still  possess  and  continue  to  procure  equip- 
ment from  a  variety  of  sources.  This  situation  has  caused  serious 
problems  in  obtaining  and  stocking  spare  parts  and  training  technical 
maintenance  personnel. 

Major  defense  industries  were  transferred  from  the  armed  forces 
to  civilian  control  in  the  1980s.  Under  a  new  policy,  these  plants  also 
served  the  commercial  and  civilian  sectors.  For  example,  when  fully 
operational  in  the  1990s,  the  aircraft  industry  produced  parts  and 
equipment  for  commercial  aviation.  Although  the  aircraft  industry 
was  for  decades  the  favorite  project  of  Suharto  and  his  minister  for 
research  and  technology  (and  successor  as  president),  B.  J.  Habibie, 
it  was  another  money- wasting  effort  that  cost  hundreds  of  billions  of 
dollars.  After  Suharto's  1998  resignation,  the  aircraft  industry  stag- 
nated; and,  by  the  early  2000s,  it  was  producing  very  little,  not  even 
spare  parts.  The  army's  former  munitions  plants,  by  contrast,  became 
very  successful,  manufacturing  commercial  explosives  for  the  min- 
ing and  petroleum  industries  as  well  as  defense-related  products.  R 
T.  Pindad,  another  former  army  plant,  now  produces  much  of  the 
TNI's  small  arms  as  well  as  several  models  of  wheeled  and  armored 
vehicles.  The  R  T.  PAL  shipyard  also  manufactures  commercial 
ships  and  maritime  equipment,  in  addition  to  naval  vessels.

Personnel 

The  size  of  the  armed  services — approximately  302,000  in 
2009 — is  small  in  relation  to  Indonesia's  large  population.  The  mili- 
tary is  also  small  in  comparison  to  the  forces  of  other  nations  of 
comparable  population,  and  in  comparison  to  the  forces  of  other 
Asian  countries.  The  army  is  by  far  the  dominant  branch  of  the  Indo- 
nesian military,  with  approximately  233,000  personnel;  the  navy  and 
marine  corps  total  about  45,000  and  the  air  force,  about  24,000. 

The  Indonesian  constitutipn  states  that  every  citizen  has  the  right 
and  obligation  to  defend  the  nation.  Conscription  is  provided  for  by 
law,  but  in  light  of  limited  civilian-sector  employment  opportunities, 
the  armed  forces  have  been  able  to  attract  sufficient  numbers  to  main- 
tain mandated  strength  levels  without  resorting  to  a  draft.  By  2008 
almost  all  service  members  were  volunteers  who  had  met  the  criteria 
set  for  conscription.  However,  officer  specialists,  such  as  physicians, 
are  occasionally  conscripted  for  short-term  service.  Most  enlisted 
personnel  are  recruited  in  their  own  regions  and  generally  train  and 
serve  most  of  their  time  in  units  near  their  homes.  Each  service  has 
small  women's  units  (see  Women  in  the  Armed  Forces,  this  ch.). 

The  combined  officer  corps  for  the  three  services  was  estimated  to 
total  some  53,000  personnel  in  2008.  Until  2005  the  mandatory  retire- 
ment age  for  officers  was  55,  but  a  2004  military  act  passed  by  the 
DPR  provided  for  a  gradual  extension  to  age  60.  Virtually  all  career 
noncommissioned  officers  (NCOs)  serve  20  years  and  retire  in  their 
mid-forties,  thereafter  often  going  into  private  business.  With  person- 
nel strength  mandated  to  remain  static,  a  steady  balance  between  new 
officer  accessions  and  losses  (through  death,  attrition,  and  retirement) 
seems  likely  to  be  maintained. 

For  the  first  20  years  of  independence,  entry  into  the  officer  corps 
was  very  competitive.  According  to  both  patriotic  and  traditional  val- 
ues, a  military  education  and  military  career  were  regarded  as  highly 
desirable.  Since  the  late  1970s,  however,  the  armed  forces  have  expe- 
rienced difficulty  attracting  a  sufficient  number  of  the  best-qualified 
candidates  to  the  Armed  Forces  Military  Academy  (Akmil),  the 
national  service  academy  at  Magelang,  Jawa  Tengah  Province.  Field 
commanders  have  long  complained  of  not  getting  enough  high-quality 
young  officers  from  Akmil.  Improved  job  opportunities  in  Indonesia's 
advancing  economy  have  persuaded  many  of  the  brightest  and  best- 
qualified  high-school  graduates  to  attend  civilian  degree-granting  uni- 
versities (Akmil  does  not  grant  academic  degrees).  In  the  late  1990s, 
the  armed  forces  began  to  expand  their  source  of  officers  by  institut- 
ing a  program  similar  to  the  U.S.  Reserve  Officers'  Training  Corps 


338 


National  Security 


(ROTC)  and  experimented  with  educating  a  small  number  of  cadets  in 
overseas  civilian  colleges. 

The  armed  forces  have  maintained  cohesion  and  a  professional 
esprit  de  corps,  in  spite  of  problems  with  officer  recruitment.  Matura- 
tion through  institutionalization,  increased  education,  and  an  empha- 
sis on  national  (rather  than  regional)  loyalty  have  produced  a  military 
that  is  a  far  cry  from  the  factionalized  and  ideologically  diverse  force 
that  existed  at  the  time  of  the  1965  coup  attempt.  Uniting  the  services 
under  a  strong  central  command  and  eliminating  "warlordism"  and 
regionalism  by  routine  rotational  assignments  have  contributed  to  this 
cohesion  and  minimized  the  impact  of  the  occasional  emergence  of 
personality-driven  cliques. 

The  senior  officer  corps  reflects  the  ethnic  composition  of  the 
national  population.  The  TNI  does  not  publish  data  on  ethnicity  in  its 
personnel  rosters,  but  a  review  of  the  names  of  60  top  officers  in  TNI 
headquarters  and  the  three  services  suggested  that  in  2008  about  55 
percent  were  from  Java  (ethnically  Javanese,  Sundanese,  or  Madurese), 
a  proportion  approximately  reflective  of  the  national  population.  There 
is  a  continued  trend  toward  assignments  based  on  ability  rather  than 
ethnic  or  religious  considerations. 

Organization  and  Equipment  of  the  Armed 
Forces 

Administrative  and  Command  Structure 

The  TNI  consists  of  three  military  services — the  army,  navy,  and 
air  force.  The  Department  of  Defense  (Dephan)  is  responsible  for 
planning,  acquisition,  and  management  tasks,  but  has  no  command  or 
control  of  troop  units  (see  fig.  13).  As  part  of  the  post-Suharto  reform 
program,  each  of  Suharto's  successors  as  president  has  appointed  a 
civilian  as  minister  of  defense.  However,  each  of  these  ministers  has 
remained  outside  the  military  chain  of  command.  A  major  goal  of 
political  reformers  is  to  restructure  the  chain  of  command  to  place  the 
TNI  under  genuine  civilian  control.  This  intent  was  reflected  in  the 
policy  guidance  contained  in  the  military  law  passed  by  the  DPR  in 
2004,  but  there  was  no  time  schedule  for  effecting  such  a  major 
change.  The  TNI  commander  retains  command  and  control  of  all 
armed  forces,  in  the  meantime,  and  continues  by  tradition  to  be  the 
senior  Indonesian  military  officer.  Since  the  separation  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  Defense  from  the  armed  forces  headquarters  in  1985,  the 
department's  staff  has  been  composed  largely  of  active-duty  and 
retired  military  personnel.  The  structure  of  Dephan  consists  of  the 
offices  of  the  minister  of  defense,  a  secretary  general,  an  inspector

general,  and  five  directors  general,  as  well  as  several  functional  cen- 
ters and  institutes.  In  2009  the  minister  of  defense  was  a  civilian, 
while  the  secretary  general  was  an  active-duty  military  officer.  The 
inspector  general  and  five  directors  general  were  a  mix  of  active  and 
retired  senior  military  officers. 

The  role  of  the  individual  armed  services  has  not  changed  since 
1969,  when  the  heads  of  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force  were  reduced  to 
chiefs  of  staff.  At  that  time,  operational  control  of  almost  all  military 
units  was  vested  in  the  armed  forces  commander  in  chief.  The  head- 
quarters of  each  military  service  functions  primarily  as  an  administra- 
tive and  support  center. 

The  TNI  staff  and  its  functions  remain  directly  subordinate  to  the 
commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces,  who  remains,  in  turn,  directly 
responsible  to  the  president,  who  holds  the  formal  title  of  supreme 
commander  of  the  armed  forces.  Directly  under  the  TNI  commander 
are  the  chief  of  the  general  staff  (Kasum),  the  TNI's  next  most  senior 
officer;  the  inspector  general;  the  assistant  for  general  planning;  and 
the  heads  of  a  number  of  agencies  and  institutes.  The  TNI  Kasum  has 
assistants  for  communications  and  electronics,  intelligence,  logistics, 
operations,  personnel,  and  territorial  affairs.  The  TNI  general  staff 
supports  the  headquarters  of  each  of  the  three  services,  and  its  person- 
nel are  drawn  from  all  three  services. 

The  army  territorial  structure  focuses  on  the  12  military  regional 
commands  (Kodams),  with  the  chain  of  command  flowing  directly 
from  the  armed  forces  commander  in  chief  to  the  Kodam  commanders, 
and  from  them  to  subordinate  army  territorial  commands  (see  fig.  14). 
The  senior  operational  air  force  commands  are  the  National  Air 
Defense  Command  (Kohanudnas)  and  the  East  Operations  Command 
and  West  Operations  Command  (Komando  Operasi — Ko-Ops).  The 
navy  has  an  Eastern  Fleet  and  a  Western  Fleet  (each  called  an  Armada). 

The  armed  forces  commander  in  chief  exercises  control  over  most 
of  the  combat  elements  of  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force  through  the  12 
army  Kodams,  the  two  air  force  Ko-Ops,  and  the  two  navy  Armadas. 
The  commander  in  chief  also  exercises  operational  control  over  the 
air  force's  Kohanudnas  and  the  two  army  strike  force  commands — the 
Army  Strategic  Reserve  Command  (Kostrad)  and  the  Army  Special 
Forces  Command  (Kopassus). 

Kostrad  was  formed  in  the  early  1960s  during  the  West  Irian  cam- 
paign. It  was  from  his  position  as  Kostrad  commander  that  Suharto 
organized  opposition  to  the  1965  coup  attempt.  The  powerful  post  has 
been  filled  since  then  by  officers  considered  particularly  loyal  to  the 
president.  In  2009  Kostrad  had  a  strength  of  approximately  40,000 
personnel.  It  consists  of  two  divisions,  each  containing  airborne  and

infantry  brigades;  a  separate  airborne  brigade;  one  cavalry  brigade; 
two  field  artillery  regiments;  and  several  combat  support  and  service 
support  units.  In  early  2005,  the  armed  forces  commander  in  chief 
announced  plans  to  expand  the  independent  brigade,  based  near 
Makassar,  Sulawesi  Selatan  Province,  into  a  third  division  to  be  based 
primarily  in  Papua. 

Kopassus  numbered  some  5,000  military  personnel  in  2009,  iden- 
tifiable by  their  distinctive  red  berets.  Organized  into  three  opera- 
tional groups,  a  counterterrorism  unit,  and  a  training  center,  Kopassus 
personnel  receive  training  in  intelligence  gathering,  special  opera- 
tions techniques,  sabotage,  and  airborne  and  seaborne  landings. 

There  are  official  and  unofficial  militia-style  paramilitary  forma- 
tions throughout  Indonesia  in  addition  to  the  regular  armed  forces. 
Once  a  formidable  force  estimated  between  70,000  and  100,000 
strong,  the  official  militia  units  have  been  largely  disbanded  or  inte- 
grated into  the  army.  The  far  more  dangerous  unofficial  militia-style 
units  act  as  surrogate  forces,  usually  for  Kopassus,  and  have  a  reputa- 
tion for  violence  and  intimidation.  Many  are  little  more  than  criminal 
gangs  protecting  their  "turf,"  often  around  markets  and  shopping  cen- 
ters, where  they  collect  "security  and  protection"  money.  They  also 
have  provided  manpower  for  political  demonstrations  and  intimida- 
tion. Militia  units  trained  by  army  cadre  were  responsible  for  much  of 
the  wave  of  violence  that  swept  East  Timor  in  1999. 

Military  Education 

The  TNI  operates  a  central  military  academy  headquarters  charged 
with  curriculum  standardization,  but  the  three  service  academies  are 
under  the  control  of  their  respective  service  chiefs  of  staff.  Cadets 
begin  a  one-year  training  program  at  the  Armed  Forces  Military  Acad- 
emy (Akmil)  in  Magelang,  which  is  followed  by  three-year  courses  in 
the  specialized  branches  of  Akmil  run  by  each  service.  The  army 
branch,  referred  to  simply  as  the  Military  Academy,  is  located  in 
Magelang  as  well.  The  Air  Force  Academy  is  located  in  Yogyakarta 
and  the  Naval  Academy,  in  Surabaya. 

The  TNI  also  maintains  a  joint  headquarters  for  the  Armed  Forces 
Command  and  Staff  School  (Mako  Sesko)  and  the  three  service  com- 
mand and  staff  schools,  but  control  of  the  individual  command  and 
staff  colleges  is  under  the  service  chiefs  of  staff.  Cohort  ties  formed  at 
the  service  academies  and  at  the  command  and  staff  school  are  strong 
unifying  elements  among  officers.  The  joint  TNI  Command  and  Staff 
College  (Sesko  TNI)  trains  officers  at  the  lieutenant  colonel  level, 
and  the  National  Resiliency  Institute  (Lemhanas)  provides  training  at 
the  colonel  and  brigadier  general  levels.  Half  of  each  Lemhanas  class 


343 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

is  filled  by  senior  civil  servants  and  leaders  of  the  business  commu- 
nity. In  2009  Dephan  established  the  Indonesian  Defense  University 
(Universitas  Pertahanan  Indonesia),  modeled  on  the  U.S.  National 
Defense  University  in  Washington,  DC.  It  is  the  first  military  school 
in  Indonesia  to  award  academic  degrees. 

Branches  of  Service 

Army 

The  Army  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (TNI-AD)  historically 
has  been  the  dominant  military  service,  headed  by  the  army  chief  of 
staff,  a  four-star  general.  His  staff  includes  a  vice  chief  of  staff,  an 
inspector  general,  and  assistant  chiefs  of  staff  for  logistics,  opera- 
tions, personnel,  planning  and  budget,  security,  and  territorial  affairs. 
Army  strength  in  2009  was  approximately  233,000. 

The  chief  of  staff  is  responsible  for  personnel,  training,  administra- 
tion, and  logistical  support  of  the  army.  Commanders  and  staff  of  each 
Kodam  are  responsible  for  administration,  logistics,  personnel,  train- 
ing, and  the  general  welfare  of  assigned  and  attached  combat  units. 
Each  Kodam  is  divided  into  successively  smaller  administrative  units. 
These  include  the  Military  Resort,  or  Garrison,  Command  (Korem); 
Military  District  Command  (Kodim);  and  Military  Subdistrict  Com- 
mand (Koramil).  At  the  bottom  of  the  structure,  noncommissioned 
officers  (NCOs)  are  assigned  to  every  village  in  the  country,  where 
they  are  known  as  the  village  NCO  (babinsa). 

Military  operations  are  rarely,  if  ever,  conducted  in  any  formation 
larger  than  a  battalion.  Each  Korem  has  control  of  at  least  one  battalion, 
and  one  or  more  battalions  come  under  the  direct  control  of  the  Kodam. 
Army  doctrine  distinguishes  between  centrally  controlled  units  and 
regionally  controlled  units.  Centrally  controlled  units  are  found  in 
Kostrad  and  Kopassus.  Regionally  controlled  units  by  definition  are 
those  assigned  to  the  12  Kodams.  The  battalions  have  a  planned 
strength  of  nearly  700  personnel,  although  many — those  in  the  Kodams 
in  particular — are  under  strength.  Each  Kodam  has  at  least  one  desig- 
nated quick-reaction  force  battalion;  these  are  the  best-trained  and  - 
equipped  units  in  the  territorial  structure.  Both  types  of  battalions  have 
experienced  frequent  temporary  deployments  to  areas  of  insecurity, 
including  East  Timor  (prior  to  1999),  Aceh  (prior  to  2005),  and  Papua. 

The  army  has  an  aviation  arm  that  performs  liaison  and  limited 
transport  duties.  The  unit  operates  several  rotary-wing  squadrons 
with  helicopters  of  various  national  origins  and  one  composite  fixed- 
wing  squadron  composed  mostly  of  light  aircraft  and  small  trans- 
ports, such  as  the  domestically  produced  CASA-235.

National  Security 


The  army  is  equipped  with  a  variety  of  weapons  systems  acquired 
from  several  European  and  Asian  countries  and  the  United  States,  as 
well  as  domestically  manufactured  items.  Because  of  funding  con- 
straints, emphasis  is  placed  on  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  older 
equipment.  The  mainstays  of  the  armored  force  are  its  French-built 
AMX-13  light  tanks  and  the  variant  AMX-VCI  reconditioned  armored 
personnel  carrier,  mostly  acquired  in  the  late  1970s.  Domestic  industry 
supplies  nearly  all  of  the  army's  small-arms  requirements,  although  a 
substantial  number  of  M-16  rifles  purchased  from  the  United  States  in 
the  1980s  remained  in  the  inventory  two  decades  later.  Domestically 
produced  arms  include  Belgian-licensed  FNC  rifles,  submachine  guns, 
and  machine  guns.  Ammunition  is  in  short  supply. 

Although  army  recruits  receive  their  basic  training  in  a  local  train- 
ing facility  located  in  each  Kodam  area,  specialist  corps  training  is 
provided  at  the  appropriate  national  corps  centers.  NCOs  must  attend 
training  courses  and  pass  examinations  in  their  specialized  fields 
prior  to  promotion.  The  army  maintains  a  large  tactical  training  area 
at  Baturaja,  Sumatera  Selatan  Province,  where  selected  units  undergo 
small-unit  training  on  a  rotational  basis. 

Navy 

The  Navy  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (TNI-AL)  became  a  sepa- 
rate service  in  1946,  after  the  National  Revolution  began.  Its  vessels 
come  from  a  variety  of  countries,  including  the  United  States.  The 
fleet  includes  submarines  from  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany, 
light  frigates  from  the  Netherlands  and  Britain,  and  fast-attack  craft 
from  South  Korea.  In  1992  the  Indonesian  government  acquired  39 
used  ships  of  various  types  from  the  navy  of  the  former  Democratic 
Republic  of  Germany  (East  Germany).  The  acquisition  proved  to  be  a 
mistake  of  major  proportions.  The  ships  were  in  poor  condition,  not 
suited  for  operations  in  the  tropics,  and  difficult  to  staff  and  maintain. 
By  2005  many  of  them  had  been  mothballed.  The  Indonesian  navy 
itself  produces  numerous  small  coastal  craft  in  national  shipyards. 

In  2009  the  fleet  consisted  of  more  than  90  ships  and  numerous 
smaller  vessels.  The  newest  warships  are  four  Sigma-class  corvettes 
from  the  Netherlands,  three  of  which  were  delivered  by  2008  and  the 
fourth,  by  2009.  As  newer  warships  and  patrol  craft  entered  the  inven- 
tory, the  navy  decommissioned  older  vessels.  Nevertheless,  the  navy 
was  underequipped  and  under  strength  for  its  mission  of  protecting  the 
nation's  huge  maritime  expanse  against  piracy,  poaching,  and  smug- 
gling. Specifically,  it  needed  a  large  infusion  of  fast-patrol  craft  to 
cover  its  wide  internal  seas  and  coastlines,  as  well  as  increased  sealift 


345 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

capacity  to  move  marine  corps  and  army  units  and  equipment  to  trou- 
ble spots  across  the  archipelago. 

Structurally,  the  navy  comprises  the  headquarters  staff  at  Jakarta 
under  the  overall  command  of  the  navy  chief  of  staff,  two  fleet  com- 
mands (the  Eastern  Fleet  at  Surabaya  and  the  Western  Fleet  at 
Jakarta),  the  marine  corps,  a  small  air  arm,  and  a  military  sealift 
command  (see  fig.  15).  About  45,000  uniformed  personnel  were 
serving  in  the  navy  in  2009,  including  about  20,000  marines.  The 
marines  are  organized  into  two  divisions  (formerly  designated  as  bri- 
gades), one  stationed  in  Jakarta  and  the  other  in  Surabaya.  A  third 
independent  brigade  is  planned  to  become  the  core  of  a  third  divi- 
sion, once  funds  and  manpower  become  available.  The  marine  corps 
is  equipped  with  light  tanks,  armored  personnel  carriers,  and  anti- 
aircraft guns.  Most  of  the  corps'  heavy  equipment  consists  of  badly 
outdated  former  Soviet-origin  armored  vehicles. 

The  navy  began  maintaining  a  small  air  arm  in  1958.  Headquartered 
at  Surabaya,  it  had  about  1,000  personnel  in  2009.  It  is  equipped  pri- 
marily for  naval  reconnaissance  and  coastal  patrol  duties,  flying  three 
squadrons  of  light  airplanes,  as  well  as  several  transports  and  helicop- 
ters. The  military  sealift  command  coordinates  the  navy's  logistical 
support  systems. 

The  navy's  missions  include  providing  strategic  sealift  for  the 
army  and  marine  corps  and  support  for  operations  responding  to  natu- 
ral disasters.  Other  responsibilities  include  patrolling  the  strategic 
straits  through  which  a  major  portion  of  the  world's  shipping  passes 
between  the  Pacific  and  Indian  oceans,  particularly  the  Strait  of  Ma- 
lacca. That  crucial  waterway  carries  an  estimated  80  percent  of  com- 
mercial and  military  traffic  between  the  Pacific  and  Indian  oceans. 
Formerly  a  haven  for  piracy,  the  Strait  of  Malacca  is  now  patrolled  by 
the  cooperative  efforts  of  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Singapore,  and 
piracy  incidents  have  declined.  Another  naval  mission  focuses  on 
halting  smuggling  and  illegal  fishing,  both  of  which  are  especially 
prevalent  near  the  Natuna  Islands  and  in  the  seas  around  Sulawesi 
and  Maluku.  In  support  of  this  latter  mission,  the  navy  announced 
plans  in  the  late  1980s  to  construct  a  number  of  limited-role  bases  in 
isolated  areas  in  the  eastern  and  western  sections  of  the  national  terri- 
tory. Funding  restrictions,  however,  have  kept  this  project  from  ful- 
fillment. Some  new  bases  have  been  built,  including  Tual  in  the 
southeastern  part  of  Maluku  Province,  and  the  naval  stations  on  Biak 
and  Manokwari  in  Papua  Barat  Province  have  been  upgraded.  Patrol 
activity  in  the  Sulu  Sea  and  Sulawesi  Sea  (Celebes  Sea)  has  increased 
as  part  of  operations  to  detect  and  interdict  movement  by  terrorists 
and  maritime  criminal  activities  where  the  maritime  borders  of  Indo- 
nesia, Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines  meet.

National  Security 


The  P.  T.  PAL  shipyard,  operated  since  the  1980s  by  the  civilian 
government,  along  with  other  facilities  in  Surabaya,  continues  to  be 
the  navy's  primary  training,  repair,  and  industrial  center.  Smaller- 
craft  construction  facilities  are  located  at  shipyards  in  Jakarta,  Sema- 
rang  (Jawa  Tengah  Province),  Manokwari  (Papua  Barat  Province), 
and  Ambon  (Maluku  Province).  P.  T.  PAL  also  constructs  commer- 
cial ships  in  a  variety  of  sizes  and  types.  The  navy  has  begun  an 
innovative  acquisition  program  by  which  individual  provincial  gov- 
ernments fund  the  purchase  of  fast-patrol  craft  to  be  turned  over  to 
the  navy.  Those  ships  are  used  for  maritime  security,  generally  in  the 
territorial  waters  bordering  the  donor  province. 

Air  Force 

The  Air  Force  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  (TNI-AU),  like  the  navy, 
was  established  as  a  separate  service  in  1946.  The  influence  and  capa- 
bility of  the  air  force  decreased  sharply  after  the  1965  coup  attempt.  The 
service  was  heavily  purged  because  of  the  alleged  involvement  of  its 
chief  of  staff,  General  Omar  Dhani,  in  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party 
(PKI).  Significant  modernization  did  not  get  under  way  until  the  late 
1970s,  with  acquisition  of  F-5  and  A-4  aircraft  from  the  United  States, 
and  in  the  1980s,  with  the  acquisition  of  F-16  fighters  from  the  United 
States  and  Hawk  fighters  from  Britain.  The  imposition  in  the  late  1990s 
of  arms  embargoes  by  the  United  States  and  other  countries  in  response 
to  Indonesia's  human-rights  violations,  particularly  in  East  Timor, 
resulted  in  a  very  low  readiness  level  in  the  air  force.  In  the  early  2000s, 
Indonesia  began  to  seek  nontraditional  suppliers,  purchasing  Sukhoi  jet 
fighters  from  Russia  and  obtaining  jet  trainers  from  Singapore  (by  dona- 
tion) and  South  Korea  (primarily  through  countertrade).  The  United 
States  ended  its  arms  embargo  of  Indonesia  in  2005,  and  the  air  force 
began  a  high-priority  program  to  restore  the  readiness  of  its  C-130 
transport  fleet  and  the  F-16  fighter  force. 

Air  force  strength  was  about  24,000  in  2009.  Approximately  4,000 
of  these  personnel  formed  four  battalions  of  "quick-action"  paratroop- 
ers. Structurally,  the  air  force  consists  of  a  headquarters  staff  in  Jakarta 
supporting  the  chief  of  staff;  three  operational  commands:  Ko-Op  1/ 
West,  Ko-Op  II/East,  and  the  National  Air  Defense  Command;  and  two 
support  commands:  the  Air  Materiel  Command  and  the  Air  Training 
Command  (see  fig.  16).  The  Air  Materiel  Command  is  headquartered 
in  Bandung,  Jawa  Barat  Province,  and  the  Air  Training  Command  is  in 
Surabaya,  Jawa  Timur  Province.  Air  operations  are  covered  by  two 
area  commands,  with  the  boundary  between  Jawa  Tengah  and  Jawa 
Timur  provinces  being  the  east-west  dividing  line.  The  largest  of  the 
operational  commands  is  Ko-Op  II,  headquartered  in  Makassar, 


347

Sulawesi  Selatan  Province.  Ko-Op  I  is  headquartered  in  Jakarta.  The 
National  Air  Defense  Command,  also  headquartered  in  Jakarta,  has 
operational  control  over  all  fighter  and  counterinsurgency  aircraft. 

Most  of  the  major  weapons  systems  operated  by  the  air  force  are 
manufactured  in  the  United  States.  The  C-130  Hercules,  OV-10F 
Bronco,  F-5E  Tiger  II,  A^4E  Skyhawk,  and  F-16  Fighting  Falcon 
aircraft  are  all  U.S. -made.  Aircraft  manufactured  elsewhere  include 
the  British  Hawk  and  Russian  Sukhoi  fighters.  The  air  force  also 
deploys  several  B-737  aircraft  for  maritime  reconnaissance,  a  num- 
ber of  domestically  produced  small  transports,  and  a  fleet  of  helicop- 
ters. During  the  modernization  period  of  the  1980s,  the  air  force  also 
purchased  the  Automated  Logistics  Management  System  (ALMS) 
from  the  United  States  to  upgrade  its  ability  to  track  and  requisition 
spare  parts  and  other  materials. 


348 


National  Security 


In  1980  the  air  force  enunciated  a  forward  defense  strategy  that 
required  it  to  build  or  upgrade  air  bases  throughout  Indonesia  as  well 
as  main  bases  in  Java.  Most  of  those  upgrades  affected  civilian  air- 
fields also  used  by  the  air  force.  A  major  upgrade  at  Ranai  Air  Base  in 
the  Natuna  Islands  provided  a  post  for  improved  surveillance  of  the 
South  China  Sea.  Iswahyudi  Air  Base  in  Jawa  Timur  Province  was 
upgraded  to  enable  it  to  handle  modern  jet  fighter  aircraft.  Acquisi- 
tion of  the  F-16  and  Hawk  systems  resulted  in  further  upgrades  at 
Pekanbaru  Air  Base,  Riau  Province,  and  at  Hasanuddin  Air  Base  near 
Makassar,  Sulawesi  Selatan  Province. 

New  pilots  generally  begin  flight  instruction  in  propeller-driven 
T-34  Turbo-Mentors.  A  squadron  of  British  Aerospace  T-53  Hawks 
is  used  for  advanced  training.  Acquisition  of  the  KT-1  Wongbee 
from  South  Korea,  the  SF260  SIAI  Marchetti  from  Singapore,  and 
training  versions  of  the  F-16  has  significantly  expanded  the  training 
base.  However,  competition  with  higher-paying  civilian  airlines  has 
led  to  a  chronic  shortage  of  pilots  and  aviation  support  personnel. 

Conditions  of  Service 

Compensation  of  all  TNI  personnel  is  on  a  sliding  scale  according 
to  rank  and  is  uniform  nationally  and  across  the  three  services.  Offi- 
cers and  enlisted  personnel  receive  housing  for  married  service  mem- 
bers of  appropriate  rank,  subsistence  items  and  rations  paid  in  kind, 
and  a  variety  of  allowances  in  addition  to  base  pay.  Especially  at  the 
lower  ranks,  compensation  is  so  low  that  the  need  for  supplementary 
income  is  a  significant  factor  in  service  members'  involvement  in 
outside,  often  unsavory,  employment. 

The  retirement  age  for  officers  was  55  until  passage  of  the  2004 
military  laws,  which  raised  the  retirement  age  to  60  effective  in  2009. 
Retirement  at  age  42  is  mandatory  for  enlisted  personnel.  The  presi- 
dent has  the  authority  to  grant  an  unlimited  number  of  one-year 
extensions  to  active  duty;  these  usually  go  to  officers  in  key  leader- 
ship posts.  Officers  are  eligible  for  small  pensions  at  age  48;  those 
who  have  failed  to  gain  promotion  to  lieutenant  colonel  are  required 
to  retire  at  that  time.  Two  years  before  retirement,  personnel  can  be 
placed  on  preretirement  status,  in  which  they  draw  full  pay  and  allow- 
ances while  beginning  to  develop  civilian  careers. 

Women  in  the  Armed  Forces 

Each  branch  of  the  TNI  and  the  National  Police  has  a  women's 
component:  the  Women's  Army  Corps,  the  Navy  Women's  Corps, 
the  Air  Force  Women's  Corps,  and  the  Women's  Police  Corps. 
According  to  official  publications,  women  members  of  the  armed 


349 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

forces  are  "set  to  work  at  places  and  in  functions  conforming]  to 
their  feminine  disposition."  More  specifically,  women  are  assigned 
to  administrative  work,  intelligence  work,  English-language  instruc- 
tion, and  activities  to  improve  the  health  and  social  conditions  of 
armed  forces  members  and  their  families. They  also  specialize  in  the 
welfare  of  women  and  children.  Despite  the  advance  of  women  in 
the  civilian  workplace,  including  one  former  president,  several  cabi- 
net members  and  legislators,  and  important  business  leaders,  women 
do  not  advance  to  comparable  rank  in  the  armed  forces.  Women 
police  officers  are  said  to  "play  an  important  role  in  solving  prob- 
lems [of]  drug  addicts  and  juvenile  delinquents."  Some  police  com- 
mands in  large  cities  also  have  rape/gender-based  violence  units 
staffed  by  female  officers,  but  these  are  still  rare. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

Grade  and  rank  structure  is  standard  throughout  the  three  military 
services  and  corresponds  to  that  common  to  most  military  systems. 
One  title  unique  to  Indonesia  is  panglima,  a  traditional  heroic  rank 
revived  during  the  National  Revolution.  Although  panglima  is  often 
translated  as  "commander,"  it  has  a  stronger  connotation  of  honor 
and  power.  In  the  1980s,  tradition  evolved  to  limit  the  title  panglima 
to  the  armed  forces  commander  in  chief  and  the  Kostrad  and  Kodam 
commanders. 

Uniforms  of  the  three  services  are  distinguished  by  color  and 
style,  with  variations  in  headgear  and  other  details  distinguishing 
some  elite  troops,  who  wear  berets  of  various  colors.  Army  working 
and  ceremonial  uniforms  are  olive  drab.  Air  force  uniforms  are 
medium  blue,  and  navy  uniforms  are  navy  blue.  Rank  insignia  are 
standardized  among  the  services  (see  fig.  17;  fig.  18).  In  ceremonial 
and  service  dress,  officers  wear  rank  insignia  on  the  shoulder  epau- 
let. Field-uniform  insignia  were  moved  in  1991  from  the  front  of  the 
fatigue  shirt  to  the  collar  tip.  Rank  insignia  are  worn  on  the  sleeves 
by  NCOs  and  enlisted  personnel. 

Foreign  Military  Relations 

Consistent  with  its  foreign  policy  of  nonalignment,  Indonesia  does 
not  maintain  defense  pacts  with  other  nations.  It  has  security  agree- 
ments with  a  broad  range  of  countries  (not  including  the  United 
States),  and  it  does  participate  in  combined  military  exercises  with 
several  other  countries.  Over  the  years,  Indonesia  also  has  contributed 
troop  contingents — some  including  either  military  or  police  personnel 
or  both — to  most  UN  peacekeeping  forces  deployed  to  global  trouble 


350

spots.  Among  other  places,  Indonesia  has  sent  forces  to  the  Suez 
Canal-Sinai  Peninsula  area  (1957  and  1973-79),  Democratic  Repub- 
lic of  the  Congo  (1960-64),  Iran-Iraq  border  (1988-90),  Namibia 
(1989-90),  Kuwait-Iraq  border  (1991),  Somalia  (1991),  Cambodia 
(1991-93),  Bosnia-Herzegovina  (2000),  and  Lebanon  (2006-8). 

Indonesia  was  a  founding  member  of  the  Association  of  Southeast 
Asian  Nations  (ASEAN — see  Glossary),  and  although  the  organiza- 
tion was  not  established  as  a  defense  alliance,  there  is  a  history  of  mil- 
itary cooperation  between  Indonesia  and  its  ASEAN  partners.  This 
cooperation  is  manifested  both  frequently  and  bilaterally  and  includes 
exchanges  of  military  representatives  at  national  defense  institutions, 
periodic  security  consultations,  and  a  series  of  joint  military  exercises 
with  individual  ASEAN  states.  ASEAN  countries  pledge  their  sup- 
port for  the  security  of  each  of  the  other  ASEAN  nations  but  stop 
short  of  discussing  formation  of  a  military  alliance.  The  Indonesian 
government  stresses  that  defense  cooperation  among  ASEAN  nations 
is  a  function  of  each  nation's  right  to  protect  itself  and  that  bilateral 
cooperation  will  not  lead  to  any  bilateral  or  ASEAN-wide  defense 
pact.  Indonesia  plays  a  leading  role  in  the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum 
(ARE),  a  non-treaty  security  umbrella  organization  that  includes 
nations  and  organizations  as  members — including  the  United  States, 
China,  the  EU,  and  Russia — that  are  not  ASEAN  states. 

Indonesia  also  conducts  combined  military  exercises  with  non- 
ASEAN  nations,  including  Australia,  Britain,  France,  India,  New  Zea- 
land, and  the  United  States.  During  the  1980s,  defense  officials  sug- 
gested that  joint  border  patrols  might  be  set  up  with  Papua  New 
Guinea,  and  the  two  countries  signed  a  status-of-forces  agreement  in 
January  1992.  Indonesian  troops  sometimes  cross  the  border  from 
Papua  Province  into  Papua  New  Guinea  in  pursuit  of  armed  insurgents. 

Indonesia  has  maintained  military-assistance  agreements  with  sev- 
eral countries.  It  received  funded  security  assistance  from  the  United 
States  every  year  between  1950  and  1992  except  1965  and  1966, 
when  relations  were  at  a  low  ebb.  Most  security-assistance  programs 
were  restored  after  2005.  Grant  aid  for  military  equipment,  which 
ended  in  1978,  averaged  US$13  million  per  year  and  was  used  mainly 
to  procure  logistics  equipment,  communications  systems,  and  combat 
materiel  for  internal  security.  The  United  States  also  provided  grant 
aid  training  under  the  International  Military  Education  and  Training 
(IMET)  program  from  1950  until  1992,  when  the  U.S.  Congress  cut 
the  aid  in  reaction  to  the  human-rights  situation  in  East  Timor.  In  that 
42-year  period,  more  than  4,000  Indonesian  military  personnel 
received  IMET  training  in  the  United  States.  The  IMET  program 
resumed  in  2005.  U.S.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  credits  were

periodically  made  available  to  Indonesia  starting  in  1974  and  have 
helped  defray  the  cost  of  procuring  U.S. -made  military  equipment. 
U.S.  Foreign  Military  Financing  (FMF)  provides  grants  or  loans  for 
the  acquisition  of  U.S.  military  articles,  services,  and  training  by 
Indonesia.  Indonesia  has  also  received  military  aid  from  Australia, 
Britain,  France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  and  Russia,  among  others. 
In  the  early  1960s,  Indonesia  acquired  equipment  from  the  Soviet 
Union,  and  though  most  of  it  was  inoperative  by  the  1970s,  Jakarta 
continued  to  make  payments  to  the  Russian  government  after  the 
demise  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991.  Since  the  late  1990s,  Russia  has 
again  become  an  important  arms  supplier  for  the  Indonesian  armed 
forces,  including  a  US$1  billion  loan  that  Indonesia  is  using  to  buy, 
among  other  items,  attack  and  transport  helicopters  and  jet  fighters. 

The  military  relationship  with  the  United  States  went  into  decline 
starting  in  1992  and  worsened  in  1999,  when  the  United  States  sus- 
pended all  military  cooperation  programs  to  protest  the  TNI's  support 
of  militia  forces  that  rampaged  across  East  Timor  in  the  wake  of  that 
former  province's  vote  for  independence.  Australia,  Britain,  and  sev- 
eral other  countries  also  reduced  or  suspended  their  military  pro- 
grams with  Indonesia  at  the  same  time.  However,  the  terrorist  attacks 
against  the  United  States  on  September  11,  2001,  began  the  slow 
return  of  some  cooperation  programs  because  of  the  perceived  need 
to  enlist  the  support  of  the  world's  most  populous  Muslim  nation  in 
the  global  war  against  terrorism.  The  December  2004  earthquake  and 
tsunami  that  devastated  parts  of  Aceh  prompted  the  U.S.  government 
to  reexamine  its  policy  of  isolating  the  TNI  from  training,  education, 
and  other  aspects  of  the  military-to-military  relationship.  In  March 
2005,  the  United  States  began  FMS  sales  of  nonlethal  spare  parts  for 
transport  aircraft.  By  2008  Indonesia  had  regained  eligibility  to  par- 
ticipate in  most  aspects  of  a  military-to-military  relationship  with  the 
United  States. 

Security  and  Intelligence  Agencies 

Only  very  general  information  has  been  made  public  regarding 
the  organization  and  activities  of  Indonesia's  intelligence  and  secu- 
rity bodies.  In  2001  the  name  of  the  central  intelligence-gathering 
institution  was  changed  from  the  National  Intelligence  Coordinating 
Body  (Bakin)  to  the  National  Intelligence  Agency  (BIN).  Primarily 
cosmetic,  the  name  change  was  designed  to  reflect  the  changes  asso- 
ciated with  the  end  of  the  Suharto  era.  BIN  analyzes  both  domestic 
and  foreign  intelligence  gathered  by  its  own  personnel  as  well  as  by 
the  military  services  and  the  police.  It  is  directly  under  the  control  of 


354 


National  Security 


the  president  and  maintains  its  own  communications  network  out- 
side the  civilian  and  military  administrations. 

In  2004,  after  a  series  of  devastating  terrorist  bombings  in  Indonesia, 
the  president  strengthened  the  authority  of  the  BIN  chief  to  coordinate 
all  intelligence  activities  conducted  by  the  military,  police,  and  civilian 
intelligence  agencies.  In  practice,  such  coordination  has  proved  diffi- 
cult to  achieve  because  of  inherent  conflicts  of  interest  and  zealous  pro- 
tection of  turf  by  the  various  agencies.  BIN  also  was  authorized  to 
establish  branch  offices  at  the  provincial  level  throughout  Indonesia, 
and  to  direct  all  counterterrorism  intelligence  operations. 

The  TNI's  agency  for  intelligence  collection  relating  to  external 
defense  and  internal  security,  processing,  and  operational  functions  is 
the  Armed  Forces  Strategic  Intelligence  Body  (Bais).  Commanded  by 
a  major  general,  Bais  is  directly  subordinate  to  the  TNI  commander. 

The  National  Police 

The  National  Police  of  Indonesia  (Polri)  has  been  financed, 
directed,  and  organized  by  the  central  government  since  1945.  Polri 's 
main  duties  are  to  maintain  public  order  and  security.  However,  its 
personnel  strength  is  far  below  the  UN-prescribed  police-to-populace 
ratio  of  1:350  (the  Indonesian  ratio  is  approximately  1:630).  For 
many  decades,  Polri  was  a  fourth  branch  of  the  armed  forces,  then 
known  as  ABRI.  In  1999,  after  the  fall  of  Suharto,  the  police  force 
was  separated  from  the  military  and  placed  directly  under  the  presi- 
dent. As  part  of  this  reorganization,  the  police  did  away  with  military 
ranks  and  titles  and  adopted  standard  international  police  nomencla- 
ture. In  the  10  years  since  Polri  ceased  being  part  of  the  armed  forces, 
it  has  enjoyed  a  resurgence  in  professionalism  and  an  increase  in 
strength.  In  2009  Polri's  estimated  strength  was  around  280,000. 

The  national  chief  of  police  is  the  highest-ranking  police  officer  in 
the  nation.  Like  the  TNI  commander,  he  is  appointed  by  the  president 
and  must  be  confirmed  by  the  DPR.  Assigned  to  Polri  headquarters  in 
Jakarta  are  a  deputy  police  chief,  extensive  staff,  and  several  separate 
administrative  bodies  that  handle  specialized  police  functions.  Polri 
has  its  own  territorial  organization,  with  a  police  unit  and  police  chief 
for  each  province  (Regional  Police — Polda).  Each  Polda  unit  is  admin- 
istratively subdivided  at  the  district,  subdistrict,  and  village  levels. 
Polda  Metrojaya,  which  has  responsibility  for  metropolitan  Jakarta,  is 
subdivided  into  precincts,  sections,  and  police  posts. 

Each  province  is  assigned  police  units  varying  in  strength  and 
composition  according  to  the  needs  dictated  by  the  characteristics  of 
the  different  areas  within  that  province.  These  forces  are  organized  as 
municipal  police  forces  or  rural  units  and  are  under  the  operational 


355 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

direction  of  the  Polda  commander,  who  in  turn  is  directly  responsible 
to  Polri  headquarters.  All  police  elements  are  charged  with  support- 
ing the  local  government  in  their  respective  areas. 

Polri  has  maintained  its  centralized  chain  of  command  but  has  also 
been  made  responsive  to  the  individual  provincial  governors  since  the 
rise  of  sustained  democratic  governance.  Each  governor  is  authorized 
to  call  on  the  police  to  respond  to  emergencies,  for  example,  and  both 
the  police  chief  of  an  affected  region  and  the  governor  may  request 
military  assistance  if  police  resources  prove  insufficient. 

Police  forces  are  functionally  organized  into  a  number  of  special- 
ized elements.  The  largest  of  these  is  the  uniformed  police,  which 
includes  both  the  general  police,  who  perform  conventional  police 
duties  relating  to  the  control  and  prevention  of  crime  and  the  protection 
of  property,  and  the  traffic  police,  who  patrol  the  nation's  roadways 
and  supervise  the  licensing  of  drivers  and  the  registration  of  motor 
vehicles.  Also  part  of  the  uniformed  force  are  the  Women's  Police 
Corps,  which  has  been  increasingly  integrated  into  the  Polri  structure. 
Female  police  officers  have  been  transformed  from  their  old  orienta- 
tion, which  was  primarily  directed  toward  the  provision  of  social  ser- 
vices, to  a  situation  in  which  female  police  officers  are  involved  in 
virtually  every  aspect  of  Polri  missions,  including  counterterrorism  and 
antiriot  duties.  The  first  female  provincial  police  chief  was  appointed 
in  2007,  in  Banten  Province.  Elite  units  of  special  police  enforce  order 
in  terrorist  situations  beyond  the  capability  of  the  regular  forces.  These 
units  had  about  14,000  personnel  in  2009,  were  better  armed  and  more 
mobile  than  the  general  police,  and  lived  in  separate  barracks  under 
stricter  discipline.  The  special  police  wear  the  same  uniform  as  other 
police  but  are  distinguished  by  special  badges.  Plainclothes  police  have 
the  primary  responsibility  for  criminal  investigations,  especially  in 
complex  cases  or  in  cases  involving  several  jurisdictions.  They  also 
handle  forensics,  intelligence,  security,  and  the  technical  aspects  of 
crime  fighting,  such  as  fingerprinting  and  identification. 

A  small  unit,  the  Sea  and  Air  Police,  patrols  the  national  waters 
and  airspace,  providing  tactical  aid  to  other  elements  by  regulating 
traffic,  guarding  against  smuggling  and  illegal  fishing,  and  supply- 
ing personnel  transport.  The  unit  also  participates  in  disaster  relief. 
Its  equipment  includes  a  few  helicopters  and  light  airplanes  and  var- 
ious small  seacraft. 

The  Mobile  Brigade,  one  of  the  oldest  Polri  units,  was  formed  in 
late  1945.  Its  original  tasks  were  disarming  remnants  of  the  Japanese 
Imperial  Army  and  protecting  the  chief  of  state  and  the  capital  city. 
The  brigade  fought  in  the  Revolution,  and  its  troops  took  part  in  the 
military  confrontation  with  Malaysia  in  the  early  1960s  and  in  the  con- 


356 


National  Security 


flict  in  East  Timor  from  the  mid-1970s  through  1999.  The  Explosive 
Ordnance  Devices  Unit,  formed  in  1981,  is  part  of  the  Mobile  Brigade. 

The  exigencies  of  fighting  separatist  insurgents  in  Aceh  and  Papua 
required  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Mobile  Brigade.  Between  1998  and 
2005,  it  grew  from  7,500  to  approximately  34,000  personnel.  Such  a 
rapid  expansion  brought  problems  in  training  and  discipline,  and  the 
Mobile  Brigade  has  come  to  be  regarded  by  many  observers  as  the 
least  disciplined  and  most  brutal  of  all  forces  deployed  against  insur- 
gents. It  is  essentially  a  paramilitary  organization  trained  and  organized 
along  military  lines.  The  brigade  is  used  primarily  as  a  deploy  able 
combat  force  in  emergencies,  aiding  in  police  operations  requiring 
quick  action.  It  also  works  in  domestic  security  and  defense  operations 
and  has  special  riot-control  equipment.  Elements  of  the  force  also  are 
trained  for  airborne  operations. 

The  need  to  forge  a  capable  police  counterterrorism  unit  in  response 
to  the  spread  of  international  terrorism  resulted  in  the  establishment  in 
2002  of  another  elite  element,  the  National  Police  counterterrorism 
unit,  better  known  as  Detachment  88.  This  unit  was  largely  funded  and 
trained  by  the  United  States  and  graduated  its  first  cadre  in  2003.  It  has 
the  capability  to  conduct  counterterrorism  and  modern  forensic  inves- 
tigations, and  it  includes  a  quick-reaction  counterterrorist  team. 
Detachment  88  has  been  particularly  successful  in  its  counterterrorist 
operations.  Its  personnel,  supported  by  technical  assistance  and  train- 
ing from  the  United  States  and  Australia  in  particular,  have  captured  or 
killed  many  of  the  most-wanted  terrorists  in  the  country,  including 
those  responsible  for  bombings  in  Bali  and  Jakarta,  terrorism  in 
Sulawesi  Tengah  Province,  and  attacks  against  civilian  targets  else- 
where in  Indonesia. 

Rank-and-file  police  service  is  voluntary.  Recruits  must  have  at 
least  a  sixth-grade  education  and  pass  a  competitive  examination. 
Other  qualifications  include  physical  fitness  and  good  moral  character. 
After  three  years'  service  as  ordinary  police,  personnel  with  only 
junior  secondary-school  diplomas  can  enter  training  to  become  NCOs. 
Those  with  three  years'  experience  as  NCOs  are  eligible  for  further 
training  to  enable  them  to  become  candidate  officers  and  eventually 
enter  the  officer  corps.  The  majority  of  the  police  officer  corps  enters 
the  force  as  graduates  of  the  National  Police  Academy,  located  near 
Sukabumi,  Jawa  Barat  Province.  The  Polri  working  and  ceremonial 
uniforms  are  dark  brown. 

Advanced  training  in  vocational  and  technical  subjects  is  available 
to  regular  police,  NCOs,  and  officers.  Promotions  often  are  based  on 
performance  in  advanced  education.  The  Police  Command  and  Staff 
School  at  Semarang,  Jawa  Tengah  Province,  offers  advanced  training

in  administration  and  logistics  to  police  officers  assigned  to  command 
units  at  the  subdistrict,  district,  and  Polda  levels. 

The  Criminal  Justice  System 

The  nation's  criminal  jurisprudence  and  its  institutions  of  criminal 
justice  derive  from  Indonesia's  experience  as  an  independent  state 
and  from  the  Dutch  colonial  heritage.  Dutch-based  criminal  law  is 
one  of  three  systems  of  law  in  operation  in  the  nation  since  the  nine- 
teenth century,  the  other  two  being  a  system  of  European-derived 
commercial  codes  and  civil  law  based  on  customary  law  (adat), 
which  includes  Islamic  law  or  sharia  (see  Islam,  ch.  2).  Criminal  law 
is  the  only  one  of  these  three  systems  that  is  essentially  codified  and 
applied  uniformly  throughout  the  national  territory.  Criminal  justice 
is  administered  through  a  system  that  includes  a  hierarchy  of  trial 
and  appellate  courts  with  the  Supreme  Court  at  the  top  of  the  pyra- 
mid; a  prosecutorial  arm  of  the  national  government;  and  an  inde- 
pendent bar.  Indonesians  and  outside  observers  have  long  considered 
the  criminal  justice  system  one  of  the  most  corrupt  branches  of  the 
Indonesian  government. 

Several  factors  limit  the  use  of  formal  legal  channels  in  dealing 
with  activity  defined  as  criminal.  Owing  in  large  part  to  a  general 
shortage  of  trained  legal  personnel,  the  infrastructure  of  the  criminal 
justice  system  is  more  extensive  in  urban  locales  and  in  Java  than  in 
rural  or  remote  areas.  In  any  case,  the  system's  procedures  often  do 
not  apply  to  military,  security,  and  intelligence  organizations,  which 
in  practice  sometimes  deal  with  both  political  and  ordinary  crime. 
Indonesians  do  not  always  resort  to  the  formal  legal  system  to  resolve 
their  conflicts,  however,  because  many  do  not  share  Western  views 
regarding  the  nature  of  individual  rights  and  the  efficacy  of  law  and 
procedural  justice  but  prefer  to  settle  disputes  by  arbitration  or  accom- 
modation. Retribution  and  revenge,  moreover,  are  still  common  ways 
of  settling  disputes,  especially  away  from  the  big  cities  and  towns. 

In  rural  areas,  many  conflicts,  including  some  (mostly  minor) 
criminal  cases,  are  settled  by  village  chiefs.  Complaints  often  go 
unfiled  with  authorities,  even  in  villages  and  cities,  and  cases  fre- 
quently settle  out  of  court  in  order  to  save  time  and  money  or  to 
avoid  attracting  public  or  official  attention.  In  criminal  cases,  such 
settlements  typically  entail  accommodation  between  the  accused  and 
the  police  or  prosecutors,  whose  roles  in  the  criminal  justice  system 
are  generally  more  critical  than  those  of  courts  or  judges.  Wealth  and 
status  are  apt  to  be  important  factors  in  the  outcome.

Crime  and  Political  Offenses 

Indonesia,  like  many  nations,  has  experienced  a  rising  crime  rate 
as  a  by-product  of  increased  urbanization  and  the  social  and  eco- 
nomic dislocations  associated  with  national  development.  The  scope 
of  the  crime  problem  is  difficult  to  gauge,  but  conditions  such  as 
large  numbers  of  unemployed  or  underemployed  people  in  the  cities, 
a  lack  of  jobs  for  high  school  and  university  graduates,  and  a  break- 
down in  traditional  systems  of  social  control  often  are  cited  as 
responsible  for  the  increase  in  crime.  By  the  start  of  the  twenty-first 
century,  the  annual  increase  in  crime  was  moderate.  Both  the  author- 
ities and  the  public,  however,  continued  to  be  concerned  about  the 
increasingly  violent  nature  of  Indonesian  society. 

Certain  categories  of  crime  are  handled  under  special  statutes  out- 
side the  penal  code  under  Indonesian  law.  After  the  fall  of  Suharto, 
offenses  such  as  bribery,  the  assessment  of  pungli  (a  contraction  of 
pungutan  liar — illegal  levies),  and  the  diversion  of  public  funds  for 
private  use  by  business  figures  or  officials  were  grouped  in  a  special 
class  of  crimes  under  the  jurisdiction  of  anticorruption  courts  and  the 
Commission  to  Investigate  Public  Officials'  Wealth.  The  transition 
to  democracy  also  included  abolition  of  an  internal  subversion  act 
that  had  been  used  to  jail  critics  of  the  Suharto  government. 

Criminal  Law  and  Proceedings 

The  Indonesian  criminal  code  in  force  at  independence  was  basi- 
cally the  Netherlands  Indies  Criminal  Code,  adopted  in  1918,  plus 
certain  amendments  promulgated  by  the  revolutionary  government 
in  1946.  Known  as  the  Code  of  Criminal  Law,  since  1958  it  has  been 
applied  uniformly  throughout  the  national  territory. 

The  Code  of  Criminal  Law  has  three  chapters.  Chapter  I  defines 
the  terms  and  procedures  to  be  followed  in  criminal  cases  and  speci- 
fies mitigating  circumstances  that  may  affect  the  severity  of  a  sen- 
tence. Chapters  II  and  III,  respectively,  define  the  categories  of 
felonies  and  misdemeanors  and  prescribe  the  penalties  for  each  type 
of  offense.  The  distinction  between  felonies  and  misdemeanors  gen- 
erally conforms  to  that  in  Western  countries.  Several  other  statutes 
dealing  with  criminal  offenses  are  also  in  force,  the  most  significant 
of  which  are  laws  concerning  economic  offenses,  subversive  activi- 
ties, and  corruption. 

Penalties  for  major  offenses  include  death  (infrequently  imposed, 
for  treason,  drug  trafficking,  and — since  2002 — terrorism,  among  other 
crimes),  imprisonment  for  periods  up  to  life,  local  detention,  and  fines. 
Total  confiscation  of  property  is  not  permitted.  Penalties  for  minor 


359 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

crimes  and  misdemeanors  include  deprivation  of  specified  rights,  for- 
feiture of  personal  property,  and  publication  of  the  sentence  of  the 
court.  Punishments  listed  in  the  code  are  the  maximum  allowable; 
judges  have  discretionary  authority  to  impose  a  lesser  punishment. 

New  guidelines  on  criminal  proceedings  were  promulgated  on 
December  31,  1981.  These  new  guidelines,  known  collectively  as  the 
Code  of  Criminal  Procedures,  replaced  a  1941  code  that  was  itself  a 
revision  of  an  1848  Dutch  colonial  regulation  that  stipulated  legal 
procedures  to  be  used  in  both  criminal  and  civil  cases.  Both  national 
jurists  and  government  officials  had  complained  that  statutory  ambi- 
guity in  the  old  code  and  certain  of  its  provisions  in  some  cases  had 
led  to  abuses  of  authority  by  law  enforcement  and  judicial  officials. 
Under  the  old  system,  several  authorities,  including  the  police,  the 
regional  military  commands,  and  the  public  prosecutors,  shared  pow- 
ers of  arrest,  detention,  and  interrogation — an  often  confusing  situa- 
tion that  sometimes  led  plaintiffs  to  file  complaints  with  the  particular 
agency  they  believed  would  deal  most  favorably  with  their  case.  Indi- 
viduals could  be  arrested  and  detained  on  suspicion  alone,  and  there 
were  broad  limits  on  how  long  a  suspect  could  be  held  before  being 
charged  or  brought  to  trial.  Moreover,  the  accused  could  request  legal 
counsel  only  when  that  individual's  case  was  submitted  to  a  judge, 
and  not  during  any  pretrial  proceedings. 

The  1981  code  represents  a  considerable  step  forward  in  the  estab- 
lishment of  clear  norms  of  procedural  justice.  Under  it,  criminal 
investigation  powers  lie  almost  entirely  with  the  police.  A  suspect  can 
be  held  only  24  hours  before  the  investigating  officials  present  their 
charges  and  obtain  a  detention  order  from  a  judge.  Specific  limits  are 
established  on  how  long  a  suspect  can  be  held  before  a  trial.  The  1981 
code  expressly  grants  the  accused  the  right  to  learn  the  charges 
against  him  or  her,  to  be  examined  immediately  by  investigating  offi- 
cials, and  to  have  the  case  referred  to  a  prosecutor,  submitted  to  a 
court,  and  tried  before  a  judge.  The  accused  also  has  the  right  to 
obtain  legal  counsel  in  all  of  the  proceedings.  Should  it  turn  out  that  a 
person  has  been  wrongly  charged  or  detained  under  the  1981  code, 
that  individual  has  the  right  to  sue  for  compensation  and  for  the  resto- 
ration of  rights  and  status. 

Administration  of  Criminal  Justice 

The  prosecutorial  function  rests  with  the  attorney  general,  who 
holds  the  position  of  supreme  public  prosecutor.  The  president  some- 
times grants  the  attorney  general  cabinet-level  status,  and  the  attorney 
general  has  direct  access  to  the  president.  The  Attorney  General's 
Office  is  separate  from  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Human  Rights. 


360

The  public  prosecutor's  principal  functions  are  to  examine  charges 
of  felonious  conduct  or  misdemeanors  brought  by  individuals  or 
other  parties,  and  then  either  to  dismiss  a  charge  or  refer  it  for  trial  to 
the  state  court  having  jurisdiction.  The  prosecutor's  office  is  also 
responsible  for  presenting  the  case  against  the  accused  in  court  and 
for  executing  the  sentence  of  the  court. 

The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedures  of  1981  made  a  clear  division 
between  the  investigation  function,  solely  the  preserve  of  the  police, 
and  the  prosecution  function,  which  remained  with  the  prosecutor's 
office.  The  only  exception  was  in  the  case  of  "special  crimes,"  a  cate- 
gory that  was  not  further  defined  but  that  was  believed  to  be  reserved 
for  unusually  sensitive  cases  such  as  espionage  and  subversion,  in 
which  the  prosecutor  could  also  take  an  investigatory  role.  Continu- 
ing tension  between  the  prosecutor  and  the  police  was  evident  during 
debate  over  a  new  prosecution  service  law  in  1991.  The  law  as  passed 
gave  the  attorney  general  the  power  to  conduct  limited  investigations 
in  cases  that  were  determined  to  be  incomplete.  The  1991  law  also 
established  deputy  and  associate  attorney  general  positions  responsi- 
ble for  civil  cases  and  administrative  affairs. 

The  court  system  has  four  branches:  general  courts,  religious 
courts,  military  courts,  and  administrative  courts  (see  The  Judiciary, 
ch.  4).  All  criminal  cases  are  tried  in  the  general  courts.  The  Code  of 


361 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Criminal  Procedures  set  forth  rules  to  determine  the  court  in  which  a 
case  must  be  tried,  should  military  and  general  court  jurisdiction 
combine  or  overlap.  In  2004  the  armed  forces  accepted  Supreme 
Court  jurisdiction  over  the  military  court  system,  and  in  2007  the 
DPR  introduced  legislation  stipulating  that  all  crimes  committed  by 
military  personnel  outside  of  operational  military  duties  will  be  pros- 
ecuted in  the  civil  court  system.  The  TNI  has  opposed  this  new  law 
by  claiming  that  the  civilian  court  system  neither  understands  the  mil- 
itary justice  system  nor  is  capable  of  taking  over  responsibility  for 
prosecution  of  military  personnel  accused  of  nonmilitary  crimes.  Ser- 
vice members  remain  subject  solely  to  the  military  legal  system  for 
all  crimes  allegedly  committed  while  in  the  pursuit  of  military  duties. 

Penal  System 

Indonesia's  prisons  are  administered  by  the  Department  of  Cor- 
rections within  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Human  Rights  and 
include  three  categories  of  prisons  based  mainly  on  the  number  of 
inmates  they  can  hold.  The  nine  largest  prisons,  designated  Class  I, 
hold  prisoners  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  or  death. 

The  U.S.  Department  of  State's  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights 
Practices  for  2009  found  prison  conditions  harsh  throughout  the  Indo- 
nesian penal  system.  Poor  food,  unsanitary  conditions,  and  inadequate 
medical  care  were  common,  as  were  mistreatment  and  corruption. 
"Money  talks,"  and  wealthy  inmates  were  able  to  purchase  better 
prison  accommodations,  food,  and  treatment.  Overcrowding  in  ancient 
and  inadequate  facilities  also  occurred.  The  report  indicated  that  those 
conditions  had  existed  for  a  very  long  time  and  noted  the  need  for  bet- 
ter training  of  prison  personnel  and  renovation  of  prison  facilities. 

Several  specialized  prisons  for  women  and  two  for  youths  are 
located  in  Java.  Where  it  is  not  possible  to  confine  such  prisoners  in 
separate  institutions,  as  is  usually  the  case  outside  Java,  efforts  are 
made  to  segregate  juvenile  from  adult  offenders  and  females  from 
males  in  separate  sections  of  the  same  institution.  Ordinarily,  prison- 
ers are  permitted  visits  by  family  members  and  may  receive  limited 
amounts  of  food  and  other  articles  to  supplement  the  minimal  supplies 
they  are  issued.  Under  some  circumstances,  prisoners  are  permitted  to 
spend  their  nights  at  home.  Most  prisons  try  to  provide  medical  care 
of  some  kind,  although  it  is  generally  regarded  as  insufficient. 

Rehabilitation  provisions  include  literacy  classes,  moral  and  reli- 
gious training,  and  workshops  to  teach  crafts  and  skills.  Some  pris- 
ons operate  small  industries  or  agricultural  enterprises  that  sell  their 
products  on  the  local  market.  Proceeds  are  used  to  pay  a  small  wage 
to  the  working  inmates,  to  buy  recreational  equipment,  and  to  main-

tain  buildings  and  grounds.  In  some  prisons,  inmates  work  in  fields 
outside  the  prison  confines. 

Narcotics  and  Counternarcotics  Operations 

Production  of  narcotics,  particularly  opiate-derived  products  from 
the  "Golden  Triangle"  where  Thailand,  Burma,  and  Laos  meet,  sub- 
stantially increased  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Despite  its  proximity, 
Indonesia  is  neither  a  major  producer  nor  a  major  user  of  illicit  drugs, 
although  there  is  an  increasingly  broad  niche  for  designer  drugs,  such 
as  methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA,  or  Ecstasy),  among 
wealthy  youth  in  the  larger  cities.  There  is,  however,  considerable 
concern  on  the  part  of  the  national  leadership  and  police  officials  that 
Indonesia  might  become  an  important  drug-trafficking  center  as 
major  drug  routes  in  mainland  Southeast  Asia  shift  to  take  advantage 
of  Indonesia's  relatively  innocent  reputation. 

Bali,  which  has  become  a  booming  international  tourist  destination, 
provides  a  base  for  individual  traffickers  and  transactions.  Although 
there  is  no  extradition  treaty  between  the  United  States  and  Indonesia, 
Indonesian  authorities  are  cooperative  in  deporting  drug  suspects,  par- 
ticularly if  the  International  Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol)  is 
involved.  During  1991,  for  example,  a  suspected  American  drug  traf- 
ficker was  deported  to  the  United  States  with  the  cooperation  of  the 
U.S.  Drug  Enforcement  Administration,  the  National  Police  of  Indo- 
nesia, and  Interpol.  In  addition,  there  have  been  periodic  police  cam- 
paigns in  Aceh  and  Sumatera  Utara  Province,  which  are  historically 
the  country's  leading  producers  of  marijuana  (some  of  which  has  long 
been  used  traditionally  in  the  local  cuisine). 

Narcotics  trafficking  is  a  severe  offense  in  Indonesia,  as  is  the 
case  in  neighboring  Singapore  and  Malaysia.  A  considerable  number 
of  traffickers — mostly  foreigners — have  received  death  sentences 
from  the  courts;  most  executions  in  Indonesia  are  for  crimes  involv- 
ing narcotics  trafficking. 

National  Security  in  the  Contemporary  Era 

Indonesia  has  changed  dramatically  since  the  fall  of  Suharto  in 
1998,  and  the  military  and  police  forces  have  changed  with  the  coun- 
try. No  longer  an  autocracy,  Indonesia  is  now  the  world's  third-largest 
democracy.  The  Indonesian  military  has  implemented  an  impressive 
array  of  reforms  that  have  removed  the  armed  forces  from  an  intrusive 
role  in  virtually  every  aspect  of  civil  society  and  taken  them  out  of 
day-to-day  political  involvement.  At  the  same  time,  the  military  is  still 
the  most  powerful  institution  in  Indonesia  and  will  likely  remain  so  for 


363 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

some  time.  This  is  due  both  to  the  slow  development  of  viable  civilian 
institutions — repressed  during  the  32-year  rule  of  Suharto — and  the 
military's  inherent  power.  Similarly,  the  National  Police  is  evolving, 
thanks  to  extensive  international  assistance  and  a  core  of  reform- 
minded  police  leaders  determined  to  improve  both  the  image  of  the 
police  force  and  its  professionalism  in  maintaining  law  and  order. 

Indonesia  is  the  most  populous  Muslim-majority  nation  in  the 
world,  and  its  practice  of  Islam  the  world's  most  moderate.  The 
dynamic  changes  since  1998  have  shown  that  democracy  and  Islam 
can  coexist  peacefully  in  a  multi-ethnic,  multi-religious  society.  The 
world's  fourth  most  populous  country,  Indonesia  can  play  a  major 
role  in  international  and  regional  political,  economic,  and  social 
affairs.  By  2008  Indonesia  had  become  a  valued,  long-standing  par- 
ticipant in  the  war  against  international  terrorism. 

Neither  the  armed  forces  nor  the  police  has  implemented  the  full 
range  of  reforms  called  for  by  their  most  vocal  critics.  Vested  inter- 
ests remain  in  play,  and  resistance  to  change  is  as  natural  to  the  Indo- 
nesian security  forces  as  to  those  of  other  countries.  But  a  new 
president  and  minister  of  defense,  a  newly  empowered  MPR,  South- 
east Asia's  most  free  press  establishment,  and  a  civilian  society  anx- 
ious to  realize  its  potential  have  combined  to  make  continued  change 
in  the  security  and  military  institutions  inevitable.  Greater  civilian 
control  over  military  and  police  forces,  realizable  only  when  much 
better  budget  control  can  be  achieved,  is  a  longer-term  goal  that 
might  take  as  long  as  10  to  20  years  to  attain. 

Many  challenges  remain.  The  military  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  the 
police  have  an  ingrained  culture  of  impunity  that  can  be  broken  only 
by  implementation  of  clear  accountability  for  misdeeds,  successful 
implementation  of  the  rule  of  law,  and  reform  of  the  national  judicial 
system.  These  are  system- wide  reform  objectives  not  achievable  by 
the  military  and  police  alone.

Several  works  treat  the  development  of  the  Indonesian  armed  forces 
before  1970,  the  most  balanced  and  comprehensive  being  Ulf  Sund- 
haussen's  The  Road  to  Power:  Indonesian  Military  Politics  1945- 
1967.  Ernst  Utrecht's  The  Indonesian  Army:  A  Socio-Political  Study  of 
an  Armed  Privileged  Group  in  the  Developing  Countries  offers  a 
detailed  and  often  critical  view  from  the  perspective  of  a  former  insider. 
Ruth  T.  McVey's  two-part  "The  Post-Revolutionary  Transformation  of 
the  Indonesian  Army"  focuses  mainly  on  the  military's  shortcomings  in 
its  early  years.  The  Indonesian  Tragedy,  by  Brian  May,  and  The  Army 


364 


National  Security 


and  Politics  in  Indonesia,  by  Harold  A.  Crouch,  are  more  concerned 
with  the  causes  and  effects  of  the  1965  coup  attempt;  they  also  evaluate 
the  armed  forces  in  a  somewhat  negative  light.  The  National  Struggle 
and  the  Armed  Forces  in  Indonesia,  a  collection  of  essays  by  ABRTs 
former  official  historian,  Nugroho  Notosusanto,  presents  the  viewpoint 
of  the  armed  forces  and  the  government  regarding  ABRTs  historical 
development,  its  role,  and  its  doctrine.  The  most  comprehensive  look  at 
Indonesian  military  organization,  the  dwifungsi  concept,  and  the  role  of 
the  military  in  Indonesian  society  is  Robert  Towry's  1986  work  The 
Armed  Forces  of  Indonesia. 

A  number  of  books  examine  recent  developments.  Kevin  O'Rourke's 
Reformasi:  The  Struggle  for  Power  in  Post-Suharto  Indonesia  provides 
background  on  economic  and  political  issues  as  well  as  details  on  the 
chaos  surrounding  Suharto's  resignation.  Adam  Schwarz's  A  Nation  in 
Waiting:  Indonesia  in  the  1990s  covers  Indonesian  political  maneuver- 
ing during  that  decade.  Two  recent  accounts  of  the  issues  facing  the  TNI 
in  the  transition  to  democracy  are  The  Military  and  Democracy  in  Indo- 
nesia: Challenges,  Politics,  and  Power,  by  Angel  Rabasa  and  John  B. 
Haseman,  and  Toward  a  Stronger  U.S.— Indonesia  Security  Relationship, 
by  John  B.  Haseman  and  Eduardo  Lachica.  Readers  interested  in 
detailed  histories  of  the  TNI's  intelligence-gathering  and  special  opera- 
tions will  find  Kenneth  J.  Conboy's  books  of  particular  interest,  includ- 
ing Kopassus:  Inside  Indonesia's  Special  Forces',  Intel:  Inside  Indo- 
nesia s  Intelligence  Services;  and  Elite:  The  Special  Forces  of  Indonesia 
1950-2008.  A  particularly  useful  account  of  modern  Indonesian  history 
is  Indonesian  Destinies,  by  Theodore  Friend. 

Current  reportage  is  available  in  the  Indonesian  chapter  of  Jane  s 
Sentinel  Security  Risk  Assessments:  Southeast  Asia,  regularly  updated 
and  available  on-line  by  subscription  (http://sentinel.janes.com/)  or  in 
hard  copy.  The  Van  Zorge  Report,  published  fortnightly  in  Jakarta, 
provides  excellent  reportage  and  analysis  on  all  aspects  of  Indonesian 
political,  economic,  and  security  affairs.  The  periodically  updated 
"Current  Data  on  the  Indonesian  Military  Elite,"  compiled  in  Cornell 
University's  journal  Indonesia,  is  helpful  in  keeping  up  with  the  most 
current  assignments  of  senior  military  officers.  The  periodic  reports  on 
Indonesia  published  by  the  International  Crisis  Group  are  distinctive 
for  their  depth  and  accuracy  of  research  and  reporting.  Data  on  the  size 
and  composition  of  the  armed  forces  are  collected  by  the  International 
Institute  for  Strategic  Studies  in  its  annual  publication,  The  Military 
Balance,  and  in  an  annual  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  resource,  the 
Congressional  Presentation  Document.  Dephan  offers  a  public  Indo- 
nesian-language Web  site  (http://www.dephan.go.id),  part  of  which 
includes  its  Defense  Media  Centre  with  an  English-language  option.

Glossary 


abangan — Refers  to  people  who  are  nominally  Muslim  but  who  are 
generally  followers  of  kebatinan  (q.v.).  The  word  is  derived  from  the 
Javanese  abang,  which  means  "red." 

Asian  Development  Bank — Established  in  1967,  the  bank  assists  in 
economic  development  and  promotes  growth  and  cooperation  in 
regional  member  countries.  The  bank  is  owned  by  its  48  regional 
member  governments,  including  Indonesia,  as  well  as  1 8  nonregional 
members  in  Western  Europe  plus  the  United  States. 

Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) — Founded  in  1967  for 
the  purpose  of  promoting  regional  stability,  economic  development, 
and  cultural  exchange.  ASEAN's  founding  members  were  Indonesia, 
Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand.  Brunei  joined 
ASEAN  in  1984,  Vietnam  joined  in  1995,  Laos  and  Burma  in  1997, 
and  Cambodia  in  1999.  Papua  New  Guinea  has  observer  status,  and 
there  are  1 1  dialogue  partners:  Australia,  Canada,  China,  the  European 
Union,  India,  Japan,  South  Korea,  New  Zealand,  Russia,  the  United 
States,  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP). 
Timor-Leste  has  requested  to  be  considered  for  membership.  The 
ASEAN  Regional  Forum  (ARF)  was  established  in  1994  to  foster 
constructive  dialogue  and  consultation  on  political  and  security  issues 
of  common  interest  and  concern.  In  2009  it  had  26  members,  including 
the  10  ASEAN  member  states,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  Timor-Leste. 

Bahasa  Indonesia — The  Indonesian  national  language,  also  known  as 
Indonesian;  an  Austronesian  language  thought  to  have  its  roots  in 
Riau  Malay  and  80  percent  cognate  with  Standard  Malay.  The  so- 
called  perfected  or  new  spelling  of  Bahasa  Indonesia — ejaan  yang 
disempurnakan  (EYD) — was  adopted  in  1972. 

Confrontation  (Konfrontasi) — In  1963  then-President  Sukarno  ordered 
"confrontation"  with  the  emerging  new  state  of  Malaysia,  in  part  to 
distract  attention  from  Indonesia's  increasingly  dire  economic  straits. 
Guerrilla  warfare  and  intelligence  operations  involving  Indonesian 
forces,  British  commandos,  and  the  nascent  Malaysian  armed  forces 
ensued,  mostly  on  both  sides  of  the  two  countries'  land  border  on 
Kalimantan;  went  on  for  two  years;  and  was  only  halted  after 
Sukarno  lost  power  in  October  1965.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  (CGI) — Formed  after  the  March  1992 
demise  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Group  on  Indonesia  (IGGI;  q.v). 
Except  for  the  Netherlands,  the  membership  was  the  same  as  for  the 
IGGI.  The  Indonesia  government  disbanded  the  CGI  in  2007. 

cukong — A  Chinese  term  from  Hokkien  dialect,  meaning  "master"  but 
taken  in  the  Indonesian  context  to  mean  a  Chinese  businessman  or 
middleman  cooperating  closely  with  native  Indonesian  legal  license 
holders,  especially  the  military,  during  the  New  Order  period. 

exclusive  economic  zone — Per  Act  No.  3  of  1983,  enacted  October  18, 
1983,  the  outer  strip  bordering  the  Indonesian  territorial  sea  as  deter- 
mined by  the  law  applicable  to  the  Indonesian  waters,  covering  the 
seabed,  the  subsoil  of  the  seabed,  and  the  water  above  it  with  an 
outermost  limit  of 200  nautical  miles,  measured  from  the  baseline  of  the 
Indonesian  territorial  sea.  Within  this  zone,  Indonesia  claims  sovereign 
rights  to  conduct  the  exploration,  exploitation,  management,  and  con- 
servation of  the  living  and  nonliving  resources  on  the  seabed  and  in  the 
subsoil  thereof,  as  well  as  the  water  above  it,  including  other  activities  for 
the  purpose  of  economic  exploration  and  exploitation  of  the  zone,  such  as 
the  generation  of  power  by  means  of  water,  current,  and  wind. 

fiscal  year  (FY) — Calendar  year.  Prior  to  2001,  the  fiscal  year  ran  from 
April  1  to  March  3 1 .  The  change  meant  that  FY  2000  covered  only  nine 
months. 

Free  Aceh  Movement  (Gerakan  Aceh  Merdeka — GAM) — A  separatist 
group  that  fought  for  Acehnese  independence  between  1976  and  2005. 
Also  known  as  Aceh  Sumatra  National  Liberation  Front  (ASNLF;  see 
table  A). 

Fretilin  (Frente  Revolucionaria  do  Timor  Leste  Independente;  Rev- 
olutionary Front  for  an  Independent  East  Timor) — A  guerrilla 
movement  that  fought  for  the  independence  of  East  Timor.  Fretilin 
was  established  in  1974,  suppressed  during  the  ensuing  25  years,  but 
endured  Indonesian  occupation  and  emerged  as  the  first  governing 
party  of  independent  East  Timor  in  1999. 

Gini  index — The  Gini  coefficient  expressed  as  a  percentage.  The  Gini 
coefficient  measures  the  extent  to  which  the  distribution  of  income  (or,  in 
some  cases,  consumption  expenditure)  among  individuals  or  house- 
holds within  an  economy  or  society  deviates  from  a  perfectly  equal 
distribution.  It  measures  the  degree  to  which  two  frequency  (percentage) 
distributions  correspond.  The  Gini  index  is  a  number  between  0  and  1, 
where  0  means  perfect  equality  (everyone  has  the  same  income)  and  1 
means  perfect  inequality  (one  person  has  all  the  income,  everyone  else

earns  nothing).  It  was  developed  by  Corrado  Gini  (1884-1965),  an 
Italian  statistician. 

Golkar — Originally  golongan  karya,  which  literally  means  functional 
groups  within  society,  such  as  peasants,  workers,  and  women,  but  later 
taken  to  be  Golongan  Karya  or  Golkar  (an  organization  of  functional 
groups),  the  government  party  during  Suharto's  New  Order.  The 
Golkar  Party,  with  many  changes,  is  one  of  many  parties  in  the  post- 
New  Order  period. 

gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — A  value  measure  of  the  flow  of  domestic 
goods  and  services  produced  by  an  economy  over  a  period  of  time, 
such  as  a  year.  Only  output  of  goods  for  final  consumption  and 
intermediate  production  are  assumed  to  be  included  in  the  final  prices. 
GDP  is  sometimes  aggregated  and  shown  at  market  prices,  meaning 
that  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  are  included:  when  these  direct  taxes 
and  subsidies  have  been  eliminated,  the  result  is  GDP  at  factor  cost. 
The  word  gross  indicates  that  deductions  for  depreciation  of  physical 
assets  have  not  been  made.  Income  arising  from  investments  and 
possessions  owned  abroad  is  not  included,  only  domestic  production — 
hence  the  use  of  the  word  domestic  to  distinguish  GDP  from  gross 
national  product  (GNP;  q.v.). 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — The  gross  domestic  product  {q.v.)  plus  net 
income  or  loss  stemming  from  transactions  with  foreign  countries, 
including  income  received  from  abroad  by  residents  and  subtracting 
payments  remitted  abroad  to  nonresidents.  GNP  is  the  broadest  measure- 
ment of  the  output  of  goods  and  services  by  an  economy.  It  can  be 
calculated  at  market  prices,  which  include  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies. 
Because  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  are  only  transfer  payments,  GNP 
often  is  calculated  at  factor  cost  by  removing  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies. 

Indonesian  Communist  Party  (Partai  Komunis  Indonesia — PKI) — 
Founded  in  1913  as  the  Indies  Social-Democratic  Association  (ISDV), 
which  became  the  Communist  Association  of  the  Indies  (PKH)  in  1920 
and  was  renamed  the  Indonesian  Communist  Party  in  1924.  The  PKI 
flourished  during  the  Sukarno  years  of  the  1950s  and  early  1960s. 
Accused  of  attempting  a  coup  d'etat  on  September  30,  1965,  during 
which  five  senior  military  officers  were  killed,  the  party  was 
suppressed  in  an  ensuing  pogrom  by  the  armed  forces  and  ordinary 
citizens.  The  actual  role  of  the  PKI  in  the  September  30  incident  is  still 
the  subject  of  historical  examination  in  the  wake  of  the  resignation  of 
former  president  Suharto  in  May  1998.

Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Indonesian  National  Armed  Forces  (Tentara  Nasional  Indonesia — TNI) — 
This  official  designation  of  the  Indonesian  armed  forces  was  adopted  in 
April  1999  after  the  National  Police  of  Indonesia  (Kepolisian  Republik 
Indonesia — Polri)  was  removed  from  the  armed  forces  (it  had  been  a  co- 
equal fourth  branch  since  1960).  The  former  name  for  the  armed  forces, 
from  1962  to  1999,  was  Angkatan  Bersenjata  Republik  Indonesia 
(ABRI;  Armed  Forces  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia).  TNI  was  also  used 
between  1947  and  1962  for  the  army. 

Inter-Governmental  Group  on  Indonesia  (IGGI) — An  international  group  of 
lenders  established  in  1967  by  the  Netherlands  to  coordinate  multilateral 
aid  to  Indonesia.  The  other  members  included  the  Asian  Development 
Bank  (q.v.\  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  United  Nations 
Development  Programme,  World  Bank,  Australia,  Belgium,  Britain, 
Canada,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  Switzerland,  and 
the  United  States.  In  March  1992,  Indonesia  announced  that  it  was 
rejecting  further  IGGI  aid  as  long  as  the  Netherlands  was  a  member  of 
the  organization.  The  IGGI  was  replaced  by  the  Consultative  Group  on 
Indonesia  (q.v.\  with  the  original  members  minus  the  Netherlands. 

kebatinan  (mysticism) — An  amalgam  of  animist,  Hindu-Buddhist,  and 
Islamic  (especially  Sufi)  mystical  elements  that  combine  to  form 
Javanese  mysticism.  Not  a  single  body  of  faith,  but  an  aliran,  a 
"stream"  of  beliefs  held  by  a  number  of  groups,  kebatinan  is  officially 
recognized  by  the  government,  and  its  schools  are  administered  by  the 
Department  of  National  Education  rather  than  by  the  Department  of 
Religious  Affairs.  Also  known  as  kejawen,  agama  Jawa,  or  Javanism. 

Konfrontasi — Confrontation  (q. v.). 

Laakso-Taagepera  Index — A  commonly  used  measure  to  determine  the 
effective  number  of  political  parties  when  parties  vary  substantially  in 
their  vote  or  share  of  seats.  It  is  named  after  political  scientists  Markku 
Laakso  and  Rein  Taagepera,  who  developed  the  index  in  1979. 

Nonaligned  Movement — Established  in  September  1961  with  the  aim  of 
promoting  political  and  military  cooperation  apart  from  the  traditional 
East  and  West  blocs.  Indonesia  was  among  the  original  members;  as  of 
2009,  there  were  118  members,  15  observers,  and  24  guests.  Indonesia 
held  the  chair  of  the  Nonaligned  Movement  from  1992  to  1995. 

Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC) — Founded 
in  Baghdad,  Iraq,  on  September  14, 1960,  by  Iran,  Iraq,  Kuwait,  Saudi 
Arabia,  and  Venezuela  with  the  aim  of  coordinating  petroleum 
policies  of  its  member  countries.  OPEC  membership  increased  with 
the  addition  of  Qatar  in  1961,  Indonesia  and  Libya  in  1962,  the  United

Arab  Emirates  in  1967,  Algeria  in  1969,  Nigeria  in  1971,  Ecuador  in 
1973,  Gabon  in  1975,  and  Angola  in  2007.  Ecuador  suspended  its 
membership  from  1992  to  2007;  Gabon  terminated  its  membership  in 
1995;  Indonesia,  when  it  became  a  net  importer  of  oil,  suspended  its 
membership  effective  January  2009. 

Outer  Islands — Older  term  used  by  some  sources  to  refer  to  all  islands  of  the 
Indonesian  archipelago  other  than  Java  and  Madura.  Other  sources, 
however,  use  the  term  to  refer  to  all  islands  except  Java,  Madura,  Bali, 
and  Sumatra;  still  others  say  except  Java  and  Bah  or  exclude  Java, 
Madura,  and  Bali.  The  term  as  translated  from  Dutch — buitengewesten — 
means  outer  territories  or  regions,  while  a  similar  term  from  Bahasa 
Indonesia  (q.v.ytanah  seberang — means  land  (or  lands)  over  there,  or 
across  the  seas.  The  term  is  sometimes  considered  pejorative  by  those 
people  living  on  the  islands  indicated 

Pancasila — State  philosophy  based  on  five  interrelated  principles:  belief  in 
one  supreme  God;  just  and  civilized  humanitarianism;  nationalism  as 
expressed  in  the  unity  of  Indonesia;  popular  sovereignty  arrived  at 
through  deliberation  and  representation  or  consultative  democracy;  and 
social  justice  for  all  the  Indonesian  people.  The  Pancasila  was  announced 
by  Sukarno  on  June  1,  1945.  From  Sanskrit:  panca  (five)  and  sila 
(principle).  It  became  the  country's  official  doctrine  under  Suharto,  when 
all  military  and  civil  servants  were  required  to  attend  a  course  on 
Pancasila  principles.  While  still  a  part  of  the  national  doctrine,  its 
importance  has  waned  in  the  post-Suharto  years. 

pribumi — Literally,  an  indigene,  or  native.  A  term  coined  in  the  post- 
colonial  period  to  replace  the  Dutch  word  inlander,  a  term  that  also 
meant  "native"  but  which  did  not  refer  to  Arabs,  Chinese,  or  Eurasians 
who  might  have  been  bom  in  the  Indies.  The  distinction  between 
pribumi  and  non-pribumi  has  had  significant  implications  for 
economic  development  policy. 

priyayi — Traditional  aristocratic,  bureaucratic  elite  of  Java. 

reformasi — An  Indonesian  blanket  term  for  democratic  reforms  initiated 
and  implemented  by  all  elements  of  government  after  the  1998  fall  of 
Suharto,  up  until  around  2004. 

Repelita  (Rencana  Pembangunan  Lima  Tahun) — A  five-year  economic 
development  plan:  Repelita  I  (FY  [q.v.]  1969-73),  Repelita  H  (FY  1974- 
78),  Repelita  m  (FY  1979-83),  Repelita  IV  (FY  1984^-88),  Repelita  V 
(FY  1989-93),  and  Repelita  VI  (FY  1994-98). 

rupiah  (Rp) — Basic  unit  of  currency.  The  exchange  rate  was  fixed  at  Rp415 
to  US$1  from  1971  to  1978,  when  the  rupiah  was  devalued  to  Rp625. 


409 


Indonesia:  A  Country  Study 

Following  two  devaluations  in  1983  and  1986,  the  rupiah  was  gradually 
depreciated  at  an  average  rate  of  about  5  percent  per  year  up  to  the 
financial  crisis  in  1997-98,  when  the  Indonesian  currency  was  floated, 
and  the  exchange  rate  fell  dramatically.  During  the  recovery  after  the 
crisis,  the  rupiah  stabilized  at  a  level  of  about  Rp 11,000-12,000  per 
US$  1 ,  and  in  the  early  twenty-first  century  it  improved  to  about  Rp8,000- 
9,000  per  US$  1 .  At  the  end  of  July  20 1 1 ,  the  interbank  exchange  rate  was 
valued  at  Rp8,481.76  per  US$1,  or  Rpl  =  US$0.00012.  The  rupiah  is 
issued  in  1,  25,  50,  100,  200,  500,  and  1,000  coins  and  1,000,  5,  000,

santri — Orthodox  Muslims.  In  the  Javanese  context,  the  santri  are  also 
sometimes  referred  to  as  putihan  (white  ones),  an  allusion  to  their 
purity,  especially  as  contrasted  to  abangan  (q.v.)  in  Javanese. 

sharia  (Arabic;  syariah  in  Bahasa  Indonesia,  q.v.) — Islamic  canon  law. 
Among  Shia  (q.v.)  Muslims,  the  sharia  includes  the  Quran  and  the 
authenticated  sayings  of  the  Prophet  ihadith)  and  the  Twelve  Imams. 

Shia  (or  Shiite) — A  member  of  the  smaller  of  two  great  divisions  of  Islam. 
The  Shias  supported  the  claims  of  Ali  and  his  line  to  presumptive  right 
to  the  caliphate  and  leadership  of  the  Muslim  community,  and  on  this 
issue  they  divided  from  the  Sunnis  (q.v.)  in  the  first  great  schism  of 
Islam.  Later  disagreements  have  produced  further  schisms  among  the 
Shias.  Shias  revere  12  imams,  most  of  whom  are  believed  to  be  hidden 
from  view. 

Sufi — From  suf,  the  Arabic  word  for  "wool."  The  term  derives  from  the 
practice  of  wearing  a  woolen  robe,  a  sign  of  dedicating  oneself  to  the 
mystical  life,  known  in  Islam  as  becoming  a  Sufi.  Sufis,  who  seek 
mystical  union  with  God,  have  been  condemned  by  some  Sunni  (q.v.) 
legal  schools. 

Sunni — From  the  Arabic  sunna  meaning  "custom,"  with  the  connotation  of 
orthodoxy  or  tradition  based  on  the  Prophet  Muhammad's  example.  One 
of  the  two  great  divisions  of  Islam,  the  Sunnis  supported  the  traditional 
method  of  election  to  the  caliphate  and  accepted  the  Umayyad  line.  On 
this  issue,  they  divided  from  the  Shia  {q.v.)  discipline  in  the  first  great 
schism  within  Islam. 

Supersemar  (Surat  Perintah  Sebelas  Maret) — The  Letter  of  Instruction  of 
March  11,  1966,  in  which  Sukarno  signed  over  his  executive  authority, 
in  the  wake  of  the  September  30, 1965,  coup  attempt,  to  General  Suharto. 

Transmigration  Program — A  voluntary  rural  resettlement  plan  that  sought 
to  move  large  numbers  of  Javanese  to  Indonesia's  underpopulated 
Outer  Islands  (q.v);  transmigrasi  in  Bahasa  Indonesia  (q.v.).

highly  decorated  flat  leather  puppets. 

World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) — Established  in  1994  as  successor  to 
the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)  and  effective
