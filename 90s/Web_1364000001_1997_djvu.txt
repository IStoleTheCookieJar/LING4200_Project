ABOUT THIS RELEASE 


The Treasury Macro-economic (TRYM) Model of the Australian economy has been 
developed and is used within the Commonwealth Treasury of Australia. The TRYM Model 
was designed to assist in policy analysis and forecasting at the macro-economic level. It can 
be used as a tool to assist with understanding the workings of the Australian economy and 
with economic research and analysis. 


The TRYM documentation covers both the macro-economic theory behind the Model as well 
as the technical detail of the equations and identities specified. 


Note: This documentation is provided free with the TSP version of the Model 
(1364.0.15.001). See also 1364.0.15.001.
