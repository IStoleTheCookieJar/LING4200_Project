Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared  by 
the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress  under 
the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  sponsored  by  the 
Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  page  of  this  book  lists  the  other 
published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country, 
describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national 
security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelation- 
ships of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  cultural 
factors.  Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social 
scientists.  The  authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of 
the  observed  society,  striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static 
portrayal.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make 
up  the  society,  their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  com- 
mon interests  and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature 
and  extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not 
be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States  govern- 
ment position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to 
adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity.  Corrections, 
additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  readers  will  be  wel- 
comed for  use  in  future  editions.

United  States  Department  of  State  for  assistance  in  locating  illus- 
tration material.  The  expert  photography  of  Charles  Sudetic  and 
Sam  and  Sarah  Stulberg  provided  vivid  new  images  of  Bulgaria 
for  users  of  the  handbook.

Preface 


Beginning  in  1989,  Bulgaria  passed  through  a  time  of  political, 
social,  and  economic  transition  that  changed  many  of  its  basic  in- 
stitutions and  subjected  society  to  stresses  unknown  in  the  forty- 
five  years  of  totalitarian  communist  rule.  Events  that  occurred  after 
the  ouster  of  Todor  Zhivkov  in  1989  demanded  a  new  and  updated 
version  of  Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study.  Although  Bulgaria  was  one  of 
the  most  closed  communist  societies  until  1989,  subsequent  relax- 
ation of  tensions  and  restrictions  has  made  available  an  increasing 
amount  of  reliable  information  about  both  the  communist  and  the 
post-Zhivkov  eras.  Scholarly  articles  and  periodical  reports  have 
been  especially  helpful  in  compiling  this  new  treatment  of  the  coun- 
try. The  most  useful  of  those  sources,  together  with  a  smaller  num- 
ber of  key  monographs,  are  cited  at  the  end  of  each  chapter. 

The  authors  of  this  edition  have  described  the  changes  in  Bul- 
garia occurring  in  the  last  twenty  years,  with  special  emphasis  on 
the  last  three.  They  have  used  the  historical,  political,  and  social 
fabric  of  the  country  as  the  background  for  these  descriptions  to  en- 
sure understanding  of  the  context  of  the  important  recent  events 
that  have  shaped  the  Bulgaria  we  see  today.  The  authors'  goal  was 
to  provide  a  compact,  accessible,  and  objective  treatment  of  five  main 
topics:  historical  setting,  society  and  its  environment,  the  economy, 
government  and  politics,  and  the  military  and  national  security. 

In  all  cases,  Bulgarian  personal  names  have  been  transliterated 
from  Cyrillic  according  to  a  standard  table;  place-names  are 
rendered  in  the  form  approved  by  the  United  States  Board  on  Geo- 
graphic Names;  in  the  case  of  Sofia,  the  conventional  international 
variant  is  used  instead  of  the  transliterated  form  (Sofiya).  Unlike 
the  previous  edition  of  the  Bulgaria  study,  this  volume  adds  the 
diacritic  (w)  to  the  letter  "u"  to  distinguish  the  distinctive  Bulgar- 
ian vowel  from  the  conventional  "u"  also  used  in  Bulgarian.  On 
maps,  English-language  generic  designations  such  as  river,  plain, 
and  mountain  are  used.  Organizations  commonly  known  by  their 
acronyms  (such  as  BCP,  the  Bulgarian  Communist  Party)  are  in- 
troduced first  by  their  full  English  names. 

Measurements  are  given  in  the  metric  system;  a  conversion  table 
is  provided  in  the  Appendix.  A  historical  chronology  is  provided 
at  the  beginning  of  the  book,  and  a  glossary  and  bibliography  ap- 
pear at  the  end.  To  amplify  points  in  the  text  of  chapters  2  and 
3,  tables  in  the  Appendix  provide  statistics  on  performance  and 
trends  in  the  economy  and  various  aspects  of  Bulgarian  society.

xxi 


Topography:  Mostly  hills  interspersed  with  plateaus,  with  major 
flatlands  in  north  (Danubian  Plateau,  extending  across  entire  coun- 
try) and  center  (Thracian  Plain).  Main  mountain  ranges  Balkan 
(extending  across  center  of  country  from  west  to  east,  forming  cen- 
tral watershed  of  country)  and  Rhodope  (west  to  east  across  southern 
section  of  country);  Rhodope  includes  two  major  groups,  Pirin  (far 
southwest)  and  Rila  (west  central). 

Climate:  Divided  by  mountains  into  continental  (predominant  in 
winter,  especially  in  Danubian  Plain)  and  Mediterranean  (predom- 
inant in  summer,  especially  south  of  Balkan  Mountains).  Rainfall 
also  variable,  with  largest  amounts  at  higher  elevations. 

Society 

Population:  1990  estimate  8,989,172;  1990  growth  rate  negative 
0.35  percent;  1989  population  density  eighty-one  per  square  kilo- 
meter.

Health:  In  post-World  War  II  era,  state  health  care  facilities  be- 
came available  to  large  part  of  population  through  polyclinic  sys- 
tem, with  all  medical  services  free.  In  1990  state  control  removed

or  US$5,300  per  capita  in  1990.  Growth  rate  of  gross  domestic 
product  (GDP)  2.8  percent  1985-89,  after  continuous  shrinkage 


xxu 


through  1980s.  Economic  growth  slowed  in  1991  because  of  large- 
scale  restructuring  of  economy  from  centralized  planning  to  priva- 
tized market  system. 

Energy:  Critical  shortage  of  conventional  fuels  beginning  with  in- 
terruption of  supplies  from  Soviet  Union  in  1990;  heavy  reliance 
on  nuclear  power  from  Kozloduy  Nuclear  Power  Plant.  Some  small 
hydroelectric  power  plants.  Main  coal  source  Maritsa  Basin  (low- 
calorie,  high-pollutant  lignite);  little  domestic  natural  gas,  oil,  or 
hard  coal. 

Industry  and  Mining:  Dramatic  postwar  growth  in  chemical,  elec- 
tronics, ferrous  metals,  and  machinery  industries,  at  expense  of 
light  industries  such  as  food  processing  and  textiles.  Relatively  nar- 
row industrial  base  concentrated  in  several  industrial  centers,  with 
inefficient  use  of  fuels  and  raw  materials.  Major  mining  centers 
confined  to  lignite,  iron  ore,  zinc,  copper,  and  lead. 

Agriculture:  Redistribution  of  land  from  large-scale  state  farms 
to  private  ownership  begun  1991 ;  private  plots,  much  more  produc- 
tive per  hectare,  vital  to  domestic  food  supply.  Major  crops:  corn, 
tomatoes,  tobacco  (fourth  largest  exporter  in  world),  attar  of  roses 
(world's  largest  exporter),  grapes,  wheat,  barley,  sugar  beets,  oil- 
seeds, soybeans,  and  potatoes.  Most  numerous  livestock:  pigs, 
sheep,  and  chickens. 

Exports:  US$16  billion  in  1989,  of  which  60.5  percent  machinery 
and  equipment,  14.7  percent  agricultural  products;  10.6  percent 
manufactured  consumer  goods;  8.5  percent  raw  materials,  metals, 
and  fuels.  Largest  export  markets  in  1989  Soviet  Union,  German 
Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany),  Czechoslovakia,  Iraq, 
Libya. 

Imports:  US$15  billion  in  1989,  of  which  raw  materials  and  fuels

Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany),  Federal  Republic  of  Ger- 
many (West  Germany),  Austria. 

Balance  of  Payments:  Hard  currency  trade  surpluses  maintained 
through  1985,  when  hard  currency  shortage  caused  recurring  major 
trade  deficits.  Economic  crisis  of  1990-91  caused  moratorium  on 
hard-currency  interest  payment  on  foreign  debt  (US$10  billion  in 
1990). 

Exchange  Rate:  Floating  exchange  rate  established  1990,  ending

Assistance  (Comecon).  First  conversion  tables  issued  by  Bulgarian 
National  Bank  in  1991;  official  conversion  value  in  1991,  18  leva 
to  U.S.  dollar. 

Inflation:  Removal  of  price  controls  on  selected  categories  of  goods 
in  1991  led  to  severe  but  uneven  price  rises.  On  average,  housing 
rose  by  3.7  times,  clothing  three  times,  food  six  times  in  1991  com- 
pared with  1989. 

Fiscal  Year:  Calendar  year. 

Fiscal  Policy:  Governmental  economic  planning  system  remained 
centralized  under  noncommunist  administration  in  1991.  Profit  tax- 
es (50  percent  on  profits  of  nonagricultural  enterprises  in  1990) 
most  important  state  revenue  source.  Also  turnover  taxes  on  re- 
tail sales,  excises  on  tobacco  and  alcohol,  and  individual  income

Membership  in  Intervision  East  European  television  network  and 
access  to  French  satellite  broadcasts. 

Government  and  Politics 

Government:  Strong  central  government,  with  system  of  nine 
provinces  (consolidated  in  1987  from  28  districts),  run  by  people's 
councils  with  limited  autonomy  and  authority  over  local  services, 
publicly  owned  enterprises,  and  administration.  After  ouster  of 
Todor  Zhivkov  in  1989,  communist  party  retained  control  of 
government  but  titles  of  head  of  state  and  party  chief  were  sepa- 
rated. First  noncommunist  government  elected  1991.  Since  1990, 
president  was  head  of  state,  prime  minister  was  chief  executive  and 
head  of  fourteen-member  Council  of  Ministers  (cabinet).  Uni- 
cameral legislature  (National  Assembly,  Narodno  subranie)  with 
400  delegates;  election  law  simplified  in  1991  for  direct  represen- 
tation by  district.  Legislative  decision  making  slowed  by  distribu- 
tion of  seats  between  Union  of  Democratic  Forces  (UDF)  and 
Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  (BSP;  formerly  Bulgarian  Communist 
Party,  BCP). 

Politics:  Until  1989,  BCP  had  complete  control  in  one-party  sys- 
tem with  only  nominal  opposition.  Opposition  parties  legalized  after 
Zhivkov  ouster  in  1989.  In  1990  BCP/BSP  lost  control  of  Council 
of  Ministers  when  internal  splits  and  strong  opposition  forced  resig- 
nation of  its  last  government,  replaced  by  caretaker  coalition  govern- 
ment representing  major  parties.  UDF,  coalition  of  over  twenty 
parties  and  movements,  assumed  leading  role  in  1991 ;  with  Move- 
ment for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  it  formed  working  legislative  major- 
ity after  1991  election  and  controlled  Council  of  Ministers. 
Numerous  smaller  parties,  notably  Bulgarian  Agrarian  National 
Union  and  Bulgarian  Social  Democratic  Party,  remained  active. 

Foreign  Relations:  After  collapse  of  Soviet-dominated  Warsaw  Pact 
and  Comecon  in  1991,  sought  acceptance  into  European  commu- 
nity and  improved  relations  with  Balkan  neighbors.  In  absence  of 
Warsaw  Pact  protection,  national  security  sought  through  detente 
with  former  enemy  Turkey  and  Western  support.  International 
image  improved  by  major  reform  in  diplomatic  corps  in  1991. 


xxv 


International  Agreements  and  Memberships:  Member  of  United 
Nations  and  most  of  its  specialized  agencies.  Also  member  of  In- 
ternational Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Bank,  and  General 
Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT). 

National  Security 

Armed  Forces:  Included  army,  air  force,  and  navy;  until  1990 
under  complete  control  of  BCP.  Administered  in  three  military  dis- 
tricts with  president  as  commander  in  chief,  advised  by  National 
Security  Council,  and  chain  of  command  through  Ministry  of  Na- 
tional Defense  to  General  Staff.  Commission  on  National  Secur- 
ity provided  legislative  oversight  of  national  security  decisions.  In 
1990  army  had  97,000  active-duty  personnel,  including  65,000  con- 
scripts; the  air  force  22,000,  of  which  16,000  were  conscripts;  the 
navy  10,000  active-duty  personnel,  half  of  which  were  conscripts. 
In  1991  total  active-duty  personnel  reduced  to  107,000,  over  80 
percent  of  which  conscripts.  Significant  manpower  reductions  and 
organizational  streamlining  continued  in  1992. 

Major  Military  Units:  In  1990,  army  organized  in  eight  motor 
rifle  divisions  and  five  tank  brigades.  Major  force  structure  change 
in  1991-92,  reducing  tank  and  mechanized  infantry  in  favor  of 
defensive  systems  (antitank,  air  defense).  In  1991  navy,  also  being 
downsized,  had  small  diesel  submarines,  small  frigates,  corvettes, 
missile  craft,  patrol  vessels,  coastal  and  inshore  minesweepers,  ad- 
ministered from  Varna  with  bases  at  Atiya,  Balchik,  Burgas,  and 
Sozopol.  Air  force  had  three  MiG  interceptor  regiments,  two  MiG 
fighter  regiments,  limited  numbers  of  fighter  and  other  helicop- 
ters. Soviet  SS-23  missile  launchers  remained  in  Bulgaria  in  1992. 

Military  Budget:  In  1990  defense  expenditures  estimated  as 
equivalent  of  US$1.7  billion,  about  3.6  percent  of  GNP. 

Internal  Security  Forces:  Drastic  reform  of  State  Security  forces 
undertaken  after  ouster  of  Todor  Zhivkov  in  1989,  to  end  their 
role  as  independent  state  enforcers  of  social  discipline.  In  1991  Na- 
tional Service  for  the  Defense  of  the  Constitution  charged  with  iden- 
tifying subversive  or  terrorist  activities.  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs 
reorganized,  and  its  domestic  and  foreign  surveillance  arms  cut 
deeply  and  put  under  strict  civilian  control  in  1991 .  Power  of  militia 
(national  police  force,  formerly  chief  enforcer  of  totalitarian  rule) 
greatly  reduced  in  1990.

Introduction 


FOR  MOST  OF  ITS  HISTORY,  Bulgaria  has  been  a  small, 
agricultural  nation  whose  location  at  the  nexus  of  the  European 
and  Asian  continents  brought  strong  cultural  and  political  influences 
from  both  east  and  west.  Because  of  its  location  in  the  Balkans, 
on  the  border  of  Asiatic  Turkey,  and  just  across  the  Black  Sea  from 
the  Russian  and  Soviet  empires,  Bulgaria  received  much  attention 
from  the  commercial,  political,  and  military  powers  surrounding 
it.  Some  of  that  attention  was  beneficial;  much  of  it  was  harmful. 
In  spite  of  foreign  influences,  which  included  centuries  of  occupa- 
tion by  the  Byzantine  and  Ottoman  empires  and  absolute  loyalty 
to  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  twentieth  century,  Bulgarian  cultural 
and  social  institutions  maintained  a  unique  national  identity  that 
was  again  struggling  to  reemerge  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet 
Empire  in  1989. 

When  Bulgaria  achieved  autonomy  within  the  Ottoman  Empire 
in  1878,  it  was  completely  without  modern  political  and  social  in- 
stitutions with  which  to  govern  itself  and  deal  with  the  outside  world. 
Over  the  next  seventy  years,  the  process  of  inventing  those  in- 
stitutions was  rocky  and  uneven,  both  internally  and  in  foreign 
relations.  In  spite  of  a  very  progressive  constitution,  Bulgaria's  con- 
stitutional monarchy  was  plagued  by  frequent  changes  of  gov- 
ernment and  governmental  philosophy  until  World  War  II.  The 
impact  of  a  world  depression  and  being  on  the  losing  side  of  both 
world  wars  also  hindered  Bulgaria's  development  before  another 
expanding  power,  the  Soviet  Union,  incorporated  it  into  another 
empire  as  a  result  of  Soviet  victory  in  World  War  II.  Then,  when 
it  emerged  from  the  shadow  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1989,  Bulgaria 
was  faced  again  with  inventing  institutions  that  would  enable  its 
society,  its  economy,  and  its  government  to  prosper  in  a  world  that 
had  been  evolving  apart  from  them  for  many  years. 

The  Byzantine  and  Ottoman  occupations  eclipsed  the  signifi- 
cant cultural  developments  of  two  golden  ages  (in  the  tenth  and 
thirteenth  centuries)  when  independent  Bulgarian  kingdoms  domi- 
nated their  region.  Despite  the  centuries  of  occupation,  village  cul- 
tural and  church  life  retained  basic  elements  of  ethnic  identity  that 
fostered  a  national  revival  as  Ottoman  power  dwindled  in  the  eigh- 
teenth and  nineteenth  centuries. 

After  finally  regaining  its  independence  at  the  end  of  the  nine- 
teenth century,  modern  Bulgaria  stood  in  the  shadow  of  European

power  politics  through  the  first  nine  decades  of  the  twentieth  cen- 
tury. In  that  period,  three  successive  major  geopolitical  antagonisms 
largely  determined  Bulgaria's  place  in  the  world:  the  Ottoman  Em- 
pire versus  Slavic  Europe,  the  Axis  powers  versus  the  Allies,  then 
the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary)  opposing  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty 
Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary).  In  all  three  cases,  Bulgaria 
stood  as  a  minor  player  placed  at  the  critical  frontier  separating 
the  sides.  Besides  those  conditions,  Bulgaria's  location  amid  the 
constant  turmoil  of  the  Balkans  also  shaped  domestic  life  and  for- 
eign policy,  even  in  the  relatively  uneventful  postwar  totalitarian 
years. 

For  the  first  forty-five  years  of  the  post- World  War  II  era,  Bul- 
garia was  the  East  European  country  most  closely  allied  to  the  Soviet 
Union,  as  well  as  the  Warsaw  Pact  member  most  dependent  eco- 
nomically on  Soviet  aid.  During  that  time,  all  aspects  of  life  that 
a  totalitarian  government  could  control  were  redrawn  according 
to  the  Soviet  model — from  overemphasis  on  heavy  industry  to  the 
content  of  works  of  literature.  When  the  totalitarian  era  ended  in 
1989,  it  left  behind  many  of  the  rigid  structures  and  stereotypes 
formed  by  such  imitation.  Although  Bulgaria  had  strayed  from  the 
prescribed  Soviet  path  in  noncontroversial  areas  such  as  glorifica- 
tion of  the  nation's  1,300-year  history  and  token  decentralization 
of  economic  planning,  the  machinery  of  independent  national  policy 
making  was  decidedly  rusty  when  the  post-Soviet  era  suddenly 
dawned. 

At  that  point,  Bulgaria  was  seemingly  more  independent  of  the 
power  struggles  of  stronger  neighbors  than  ever  before  in  its  his- 
tory. But  this  liberation  also  deprived  the  nation  of  the  economic 
and  military  security  those  neighbors  had  provided.  The  early  1990s 
saw  a  major  reshaping  of  the  economic  power  balance  on  the  Eu- 
ropean continent.  Because  most  of  Eastern  Europe  emerged  from 
the  economic  and  political  dominance  of  the  Soviet  Union  at  the 
same  time,  competition  among  the  former  Soviet  client  states  for 
new  economic  and  political  positions  was  very  keen.  In  this  new 
context,  Bulgaria,  a  nation  of  about  9  million  persons  located  at 
the  periphery  of  Europe,  required  particular  energy  and  leader- 
ship to  establish  itself  as  an  integral  part  of  Europe.  At  the  same 
time,  energy  and  leadership  were  necessarily  diverted  to  solving 
internal  ethnic  and  political  problems — most  notably  the  integra- 
tion into  society  of  a  substantial  and  vocal  Turkish  minority  and 
the  cultivation  of  an  efficient  government  structure  based  on  coa- 
litions among  Bulgaria's  traditionally  numerous  political  parties. 
In  the  background  of  those  issues  was  an  economy  impoverished 


xxx 


by  decades  of  dependence  on  resources  from  the  Soviet-led  Come- 
con  (Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance — see  Glossary)  and 
poorly  balanced  Soviet-style  central  economic  planning. 

Before  World  War  II,  Bulgarian  society  was  overwhelmingly 
agricultural,  supported  by  rich  farmland  that  grew  a  variety  of 
grains,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  tobacco  for  domestic  use  and  export. 
Well  into  the  twentieth  century,  rural  life  remained  steeped  in  vil- 
lage traditions  that  had  not  changed  for  many  centuries,  even  under 
Ottoman  rule.  Cities  such  as  Sofia  and  Plovdiv  were  islands  of  com- 
mercial activity  and  points  of  contact  with  other  cultures.  The  fast- 
paced  industrialization  and  agricultural  collectivization  programs 
of  the  postwar  communist  regimes  brought  four  decades  of  intense 
migration  into  urban  areas;  in  1990  two  of  every  three  Bulgarians 
lived  in  a  city  or  town.  The  migration  process  also  reduced  the 
isolation  of  remaining  rural  populations,  which  maintained  con- 
tact with  friends  and  relatives  in  the  cities.  Despite  this  process, 
however,  the  traditional  dichotomy  between  cities  and  villages  was 
still  quite  visible  in  the  national  elections  of  1990  and  1991:  Bul- 
garia's urban  population  largely  supported  economic  and  political 
reform  platforms,  whereas  the  rural  regions  expressed  skepticism 
about  reform  by  supporting  the  more  conventional  programs  of 
the  Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  (BSP,  formerly  the  Bulgarian  Com- 
munist Party  (BCP)). 

Besides  speeding  urbanization,  postwar  industrial  policy  put  most 
means  of  production  under  central  BCP  control.  The  state  also  took 
over  the  Bulgarian  financial  system,  and  agriculture  underwent  a 
series  of  collectivization  phases  between  1947  and  1958.  Follow- 
ing the  standard  recipe  for  centralized  economic  planning,  heavy 
industry  received  a  high  proportion  of  state  investment  compared 
with  agriculture  and  consumer  production.  The  ever-increasing 
quotas  of  five-year  plans  for  all  those  sectors,  however,  reflected 
unrealistic  expectations.  Although  later  five-year  plans  aimed  at 
more  realistic  goals,  the  centralized  Bulgarian  economic  system 
failed  consistently  to  increase  output,  although  it  devoted  huge 
amounts  of  resources  to  the  effort.  Throughout  the  communist  era, 
heavy  industries  lacked  incentives  because  of  state  subsidies,  and 
state-run  agriculture  never  matched  the  productivity  of  small  pri- 
vate plots.  The  Zhivkov  government  trumpeted  major  economic 
reform  programs  in  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s,  but  they  all  re- 
mained within  the  restrictions  of  the  centralized  system,  contributing 
nothing  to  Bulgaria's  economic  advancement. 

As  in  the  other  East  European  countries,  central  planning  of  the 
economy  produced  severe  environmental  damage  in  Bulgaria. 
Damage  was  more  localized  in  Bulgaria  because  its  designated  role 


xxxi 


in  Comecon  required  fewer  "smokestack  industries"  than  that  of 
Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  or  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East 
Germany).  Nevertheless,  cities  such  as  Ruse,  Dimitrovgrad,  and 
Srednogorie  suffered  severe  environmental  deterioration  from 
manufacturing  activities  under  the  communist  regimes,  which  dis- 
regarded pollution  in  the  name  of  progress.  In  1988  public  con- 
cern over  environmental  quality  spawned  the  first  Bulgarian  protest 
groups,  which  played  a  central  role  in  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov 
and  then  evolved  into  permanent  opposition  parties  with  strong 
public  support. 

In  October  1991,  the  Grand  National  Assembly  passed  a  Law 
on  Protection  of  the  Environment,  and  the  next  cabinet  included 
a  member  of  the  Ekoglasnost  environmental  group  as  minister  of 
the  environment.  Despite  these  measures,  however,  the  critical  need 
for  economic  growth  in  the  postcommunist  era  hindered  environ- 
mental recovery  efforts.  In  1992  auto  emissions,  heavy  industry 
emissions,  and  power  plants  remained  beyond  government  con- 
trol although  they  contributed  heavily  to  air  pollution;  excessive 
use  of  chemicals  in  agriculture  polluted  many  Bulgarian  lakes  and 
streams;  and  reliance  on  nuclear  power  generated  by  unsafe  equip- 
ment threatened  a  major  radiation  crisis. 

Besides  industrialization  and  urbanization,  other  important 
changes  had  occurred  under  the  conventional  communist  totalitar- 
ian dictatorships  that  ruled  Bulgaria  under  Georgi  Dimitrov 
(1947-49),  Vulko  Chervenkov  (1949-56),  and  Todor  Zhivkov 
(1956-89).  Centuries  before,  the  Russian  Empire  had  fought  the 
first  in  a  long  series  of  wars  with  the  Turks.  Those  wars  conferred 
on  Russia  the  stature  of  protector  of  the  Slavs  in  the  Ottoman  Em- 
pire. In  1944,  as  Axis  power  retreated  in  Europe,  a  strong  Rus- 
sophile  element  remained  in  Bulgarian  society.  Accordingly, 
Bulgarians  welcomed  the  arrival  of  the  Red  Army,  whose  presence 
ended  Bulgaria's  participation  as  an  Axis  ally  in  World  War  II  and 
laid  the  foundation  of  the  postwar  political  system.  Interwar  com- 
mercial and  cultural  relations  with  Western  Europe  (especially  Ger- 
many and  Italy)  were  curtailed  when  the  postwar  communist 
regimes  intensified  Bulgaria's  traditionally  close  ties  with  the  Rus- 
sian Empire/Soviet  Union.  In  1949  this  policy  shift  was  codified 
by  Bulgaria's  membership  in  Comecon,  which  created  a  new  net- 
work of  East  European  trade  relationships  and  subsidies  dominated 
by  the  Soviet  Union. 

Between  1947  and  1989,  Bulgarian  foreign  and  economic  pol- 
icy followed  scrupulously  the  policies  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Inter- 
mittent periods  of  rapprochement  and  hostility  between  the  Soviet 
Union  and  the  West  were  mirrored  in  relations  between  Bulgaria 


xxxn 


and  the  NATO  countries  of  Europe.  Thus,  for  example,  Zhivkov 
pulled  back  from  newly  invigorated  relations  with  Western  Europe 
in  order  to  lend  vigorous  support  to  the  Soviet  invasions  of  Czecho- 
slovakia in  1968  and  Afghanistan  in  1979.  Bulgaria  also  followed 
the  Soviet  lead  in  assisting  developing  nations  and  supporting  wars 
of  national  liberation. 

The  Bulgarian  constitutions  of  1947  and  1971  borrowed  heav- 
ily from  Soviet  constitutional  models,  and,  especially  in  its  early 
stages,  the  Bulgarian  centrally  planned  economy  followed  Soviet 
guidelines.  Periods  of  economic  experimentation  also  coincided  in 
the  two  countries;  Zhivkov's  first  large-scale  restructuring  of  the 
Bulgarian  system  occurred  in  the  early  1960s,  at  the  same  time 
that  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  experimented  with  unorthodox  economic 
methodology  in  the  Soviet  Union.  Zhivkov  was  able  to  experiment 
more  freely  because  the  Bulgarian  system  was  much  smaller  and 
more  homogeneous  and  because  Bulgaria  had  earned  a  place  as 
the  most  trusted  and  loyal  of  the  Comecon  member  nations.  By 
the  mid-1980s,  economic  imitation  of  the  Soviet  Union  had  turned 
earlier  skepticism  into  cynicism  in  large  parts  of  the  Bulgarian 
public. 

The  communist  regimes  of  the  postwar  era  did  accomplish  sig- 
nificant improvement  in  national  education  and  health  care. 
Although  the  basic  structure  of  prewar  Bulgarian  education  re- 
mained intact  after  1947,  the  primary  goal  of  centralized  educa- 
tion planning  was  to  bring  Marxist  theory  to  as  many  Bulgarians 
as  possible;  hence  promotion  of  literacy  and  expansion  of  primary 
and  secondary  education  proceeded  much  more  rapidly  under  the 
communist  regimes.  On  a  basic  level,  those  goals  were  reached 
through  a  combination  of  rapid  urbanization  of  the  population  and 
mandatory  training  for  children  and  adults.  But  the  state  educa- 
tion program  was  a  carefully  regimented,  technology-oriented  im- 
itation of  the  Soviet  Union's  system.  After  Zhivkov,  the  public 
education  system  and  universities  officially  banned  political  indoc- 
trination and  activity  in  their  institutions.  Because  many  teachers 
and  textbooks  remained  from  the  era  when  only  the  party  line  was 
acceptable,  however,  transition  efforts  encountered  stubborn 
resistance  in  some  quarters. 

The  communist  era  had  provided  very  basic  health  care  in  state 
regional  clinics  available  to  most  Bulgarians.  Under  the  socialist 
health  system,  indicators  such  as  average  life  expectancy,  infant 
mortality  rate,  and  physicians  per  capita  improved  steadily  between 
1947  and  1989.  Nevertheless,  post-Zhivkov  governments  embarked 
on  decentralization  and  modernization  programs  to  improve  special- 
ized care  and  raise  the  incentives  for  health  care  personnel  and 


xxxni 


entrepreneurs  in  private  facilities.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  new  pro- 
grams underwent  a  difficult  transition  period  that  yielded  uneven 
results. 

The  overthrow  of  Zhivkov's  orthodox  communist  regime  in  1989 
produced  especially  dramatic  changes  in  Bulgarian  political  and 
economic  life.  By  the  mid-1980s,  the  Zhivkov  regime  already  had 
wielded  power  for  thirty  years;  by  that  time,  the  regime's  inability 
to  deal  with  new  political  and  economic  realities  was  obvious  to 
many  Bulgarians,  especially  the  educated  classes.  Zhivkov  took 
token  political  restructuring  measures  in  the  late  1980s,  but  by  1988 
formidable  opposition  groups  were  forming  around  such  issues  as 
environmental  standards  and  the  chronic  failure  of  the  economic 
system  to  raise  the  standard  of  living.  In  1989  Zhivkov's  heavy- 
handed  campaign  to  assimilate  or  exile  Bulgaria's  large  Turkish 
minority  depleted  the  labor  force  and  evoked  strong  protest  from 
the  international  community  and  many  groups  within  Bulgaria. 
Shortly  after  an  all-European  environmental  conference  in  Sofia 
provided  an  international  audience  for  protesting  groups,  the  Bul- 
garian Communist  Party  (BCP)  ousted  Zhivkov  to  avoid  losing 
power  entirely. 

Although  the  BCP  strategy  succeeded  in  the  short  run,  Zhiv- 
kov's communist  successors  were  unable  to  meet  the  multitude  of 
demands  that  society  unleashed  upon  them  once  the  symbol  of 
monolithic  state  power  had  disappeared.  Having  lost  the  solid  sup- 
port of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  by  1990,  the  BCP 
hesitated  between  full  commitment  to  political  and  economic  re- 
form and  maintaining  its  still  formidable  grip  on  such  sectors  of 
Bulgarian  society  as  management  of  heavy  industry  and  adminis- 
tration of  provincial  government.  A  few  months  after  Zhivkov's 
ouster,  the  party  had  changed  its  name  to  the  Bulgarian  Socialist 
Party  (BSP)  and  introduced  a  series  of  government  reform  pro- 
grams. But  opposition  groups,  combined  in  the  Union  of  Demo- 
cratic Forces  (UDF),  refused  to  form  a  coalition  government  with 
the  BSP  or  to  support  BSP  reform  proposals.  Because  the  UDF 
represented  a  growing  majority  of  Bulgarian  society,  by  the  end 
of  1990  the  UDF  strategy  of  non-participation  had  forced  a  politi- 
cal stalemate  and  resignation  of  the  last  communist-dominated  cabi- 
net, headed  by  Andrei  Lukanov.  This  development  negated  the 
broad  100-day  economic  reform  plan  that  Lukanov  had  proposed 
in  the  fall  of  1990. 

The  old  central  planning  system  that  remained  in  place  in  1990 
had  included  excessive  emphasis  on  heavy  industry,  distorted  pric- 
ing, declining  agricultural  productivity,  and  isolation  from  foreign 
markets.  By  the  end  of  1990,  those  failures  had  brought  the  Bulgarian 


xxxiv 


economy  to  a  severe  crisis  that  included  a  drop  of  11.5  percent  in 
net  material  product  (NMP — see  Glossary),  drastic  increases  in 
unemployment,  curtailment  of  all  payments  to  foreign  creditors, 
and  a  drop  in  the  standard  of  living. 

The  period  following  Lukanov's  fall  was  one  of  extreme  crisis; 
social  unrest  was  very  high,  but  political  factions  could  not  find 
an  acceptable  compromise  course.  Finally,  Dimitur  Popov,  a  judge 
with  no  political  affiliation,  became  prime  minister  of  a  coalition 
cabinet  that  would  run  the  government  until  the  1991  national  elec- 
tions chose  a  new  National  Assembly.  Resolution  of  this  crisis  was 
due  in  large  part  to  the  negotiating  skills  of  President  Zheliu  Zhelev. 

In  1991  Bulgaria  experimented  with  government  coalitions  to 
promote  major  reform  programs.  Important  legislative  packages 
included  depoliticization  of  the  army,  the  police,  courts,  state  prose- 
cutors, and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs;  amnesty  for  political 
prisoners;  restoration  of  property  to  political  emigres  and  victims 
of  repression;  and  reform  of  the  local  government  system  that  re- 
mained a  stronghold  of  socialist  bureaucrats.  In  1991  such  reform 
legislation  encouraged  loans  from  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary) 
and  other  Western  sources. 

In  mid- 1991,  all  political  factions  agreed  that  economic  reform 
was  the  government's  top  priority,  but  BSP  members  of  parlia- 
ment obstructed  reform  proposals  that  would  bring  temporary  but 
severe  economic  dislocation.  Instead,  they  favored  a  more  gradu- 
al approach  that  would  not  threaten  party  members  still  entrenched 
in  state  industrial  policy  making.  Although  the  National  Assem- 
bly passed  major  legislation  in  1991  on  land  redistribution,  pri- 
vate commercial  enterprises,  and  foreign  investment,  the  key  step 
of  enterprise  privatization  remained  unresolved  in  early  1992,  and 
the  land  act  required  wholesale  revision. 

Privatization  brought  many  difficult  dilemmas  for  a  system  that 
until  recently  had  been  centrally  planned.  The  new  government 
had  to  distinguish  state  enterprises  worth  rehabilitation  from  those 
that  should  be  replaced  by  totally  new  private  enterprises.  Resti- 
tution was  needed  for  Bulgarians  whose  capital  property  had  been 
seized  by  the  communist  state,  but  resolution  of  claims  proved  ex- 
tremely complex.  And  rapid  privatization  inevitably  displaced  large 
numbers  of  workers  from  former  state  enterprises,  damaging 
productivity,  national  morale,  and  earning  power.  In  February 
1992,  the  World  Bank  cited  the  lack  of  privatization  legislation  in 
delaying  a  loan  of  $US250  million.  Both  the  Popov  government 
and  the  government  of  Filip  Dimitrov  that  followed  spent  months 
in  fruitless  debate  of  redistribution  and  regulation  of  large  indus- 
tries formerly  operated  by  the  state.

A  vital  economic  support  element,  energy  supply,  became  a  crit- 
ical problem  in  late  1991  when  the  Soviet  Union  first  ended  coal 
supply  and  later  when  Russia  ended  subsidized  electric  power  supply 
to  Bulgaria  following  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union.  Because 
Bulgaria's  domestic  energy  base  was  quite  inadequate  to  support 
an  industrial  system  designed  when  outside  energy  supplies  were 
plentiful  and  cheap,  economic  recovery  depended  on  the  single 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Kozloduy — a  facility  judged  unsafe  by  both 
domestic  and  international  authorities  in  1991.  Lacking  foreign  cur- 
rency to  import  fuels,  however,  Bulgarian  policy  makers  placed 
their  hopes  on  Kozloduy' s  shaky  technology  to  provide  as  much 
as  half  the  country's  electricity  throughout  the  1990s. 

Political  developments  in  1991  made  accelerated  economic  re- 
form more  likely.  Remaining  Zhivkov-era  officials  finally  lost  some 
of  their  power  to  obstruct  the  transition  away  from  authoritarian 
government  and  a  centrally  planned  economy.  After  considerable 
delay,  in  July  the  Grand  National  Assembly,  which  had  been  elected 
specifically  to  draft  a  new  constitution,  produced  a  document  ap- 
proved by  a  majority,  but  far  from  all,  of  its  legislators.  Some  con- 
stituent groups  in  UDF  refused  to  sign  because  they  believed  the 
constitution  defended  interests  of  the  BSP,  which  was  still  the 
majority  party  at  that  point.  Among  vital  innovations  in  the  con- 
stitution were  government  by  separation  of  powers,  specification 
of  the  principles  of  a  market  economy,  and  full  protection  of  citizens' 
private  property  rights. 

The  constitution  also  set  conditions  for  election  of  a  new  Na- 
tional Assembly  under  reformed  election  laws.  The  new  laws  sim- 
plified the  extremely  cumbersome  system  used  in  1990  and  reduced 
the  size  of  the  National  Assembly  from  400  to  240.  In  the  national 
election  of  October  1991,  Bulgarian  politics  followed  its  long  tra- 
dition of  fragmentation  when  forty-two  parties  and  other  groups 
posted  candidates.  Of  that  number,  thirty-five  failed  to  receive 
enough  votes  for  representation  in  the  legislature.  UDF  candidates, 
running  on  three  separate  tickets,  together  won  a  plurality  but  not 
a  majority  of  seats.  The  BSP  held  the  next  largest  block  of  seats, 
making  the  twenty-four-vote  block  of  the  Movement  for  Rights  and 
Freedoms  (MRF)  capable  of  swinging  majority  votes  for  the  UDF 
or  obstructing  reform  legislation.  Because  the  MRF  represented 
the  substantial  ethnic  Turkish  minority,  many  Bulgarians  feared 
that  the  UDF  would  be  coerced  into  pro-Turkish  positions.  The 
MRF  blunted  some  criticism  by  announcing  support  of  most  of 
the  UDF  reform  platform,  however,  shortly  after  the  election. 

The  fourteen-member  cabinet  formed  by  Prime  Minister 
Dimitrov,  leader  of  the  UDF,  was  young  (average  age  forty-nine), 


xxxvi 


professional,  and  included  no  BSP  or  MRF  members.  Among 
Dimitrov's  structural  reforms  in  the  cabinet  (reduced  from  seven- 
teen to  fourteen  members)  was  abolition  of  the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Economic  Relations,  formerly  a  stronghold  of  Zhivkovite 
officials.  For  the  first  time,  a  civilian  was  named  minister  of  defense. 
Key  cabinet  figures  were  Minister  of  Defense  Dimitur  Ludzhev, 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Stoian  Ganev,  and  Minister  of  Inter- 
nal Affairs  Iordan  Sokolov.  As  in  previous  cabinets,  economic  policy 
was  divided  among  several  ministries.  Dimitrov,  who  introduced 
no  formal  program  when  he  was  appointed,  listed  ending  infla- 
tion, raising  productivity,  and  stabilizing  the  economy  as  his  chief 
goals. 

Despite  the  triumph  of  nonsocialist  factions  in  the  October  elec- 
tions, however,  the  Bulgarian  government  remained  unsettled  in 
the  winter  of  1991-92.  Key  constituent  groups  such  as  labor  unions 
and  the  Turkish  population  continued  to  be  somewhat  aloof  from 
the  UDF  coalition  as  1992  began,  and  the  coalition  itself  was  con- 
stantly strained  by  the  diversity  of  its  membership.  In  1992  the 
former  communists  remained  the  country's  largest  party,  and  the 
oversized  government  bureaucracy  created  by  the  communist  re- 
gimes still  controlled  many  parts  of  the  national  administration. 
But,  unlike  his  predecessor,  Dimitrov  had  no  opposition  ministers 
in  his  cabinet,  and  the  UDF  possessed  a  legislative  majority  if  it 
could  avoid  internal  fragmentation  and  keep  the  loyalty  of  the  MRF. 

With  the  environmental  demonstrations  of  1988,  Bulgarian  so- 
ciety renewed  a  long-dormant  tradition  of  public  protest,  and  such 
activities  continued  during  the  crisis  years  of  1990-92.  The  vola- 
tile ethnic  issue  of  Turkish  minority  rights  evoked  many  boycotts 
and  protests  by  both  Turks  and  Bulgarians  between  1990  and  1992. 
And  industrial  strikes,  most  organized  by  the  Podkrepa  labor  union, 
protested  working  conditions  and  unemployment  throughout  1991 
and  early  1992. 

Although  Bulgarian  society  was  ethnically  relatively  homogene- 
ous, especially  compared  with  neighboring  Yugoslavia,  the  Turk- 
ish minority  of  about  one  million  (estimates  varied  from  900,000 
to  1.5  million  in  1991)  continued  to  present  a  delicate  political 
problem  in  1992.  Bulgarian-Turkish  animosity  was  based  on  the 
indelible  Bulgarian  memory  of  five  centuries  of  occupation  and  cul- 
tural suppression  by  the  Ottoman  Empire.  On  the  Turkish  side, 
hostility  was  based  on  more  recent  memories  of  forced  assimila- 
tion and  restriction  of  human  rights  by  the  Zhivkov  regime.  The 
Zhivkov  government  had  justified  repression  of  the  Turkish  minor- 
ity by  appealing  to  ethnic  Bulgarian  fears  that  empowering  Turks 
within  Bulgaria  would  once  again  threaten  Bulgarian  security.

When  Zhivkov  fell,  restoration  of  long-withheld  civil  rights  became 
a  central  issue  in  the  newly  open  political  atmosphere. 

Minority  rights  found  expression  in  the  new  political  order;  the 
MRF  was  formed  to  advance  those  rights,  and  the  UDF  somewhat 
cautiously  advocated  full  use  of  the  Turkish  language  in  schools 
and  full  civil  rights  for  all  Turkish  citizens  of  Bulgaria.  Especially 
in  eastern  Bulgaria  where  the  Turkish  population  was  largest,  a 
strong  undercurrent  of  hostility  grew  in  1991  and  1992  between 
ultranationalist  Bulgarians  and  their  Turkish  neighbors.  Only  a 
Supreme  Court  decision  allowed  the  MRF  to  post  candidates  in 
the  1991  election,  and  the  issue  of  restoring  the  teaching  of  Turk- 
ish in  Bulgarian  schools  remained  quite  sensitive  in  1992.  In  late 
1991,  the  BSP,  shorn  of  its  parliamentary  majority,  accelerated 
its  attacks  on  the  MRF  as  a  subversive  organization  working  for 
Turkey — a  desperate  effort  to  build  new  support  among  Bulgari- 
ans fearful  of  new  foreign  domination. 

In  early  1992,  the  political  situation  left  Turkish  citizens  with 
only  partially  restorated  civil  rights,  and  school  boycotts  were  called 
in  some  areas  where  the  use  of  Turkish  remained  restricted.  On 
this  issue,  the  Bulgarian  court  system,  which  had  been  a  purely 
political  institution  under  the  Zhivkov  regime,  was  unable  or  un- 
willing to  exercise  fully  the  independence  granted  the  judiciary  in 
the  new  constitution.  This  was  partly  because  the  new  antidiscrimi- 
nation language  of  that  document  had  never  before  been  tested  and 
partly  because  of  the  lingering  tradition  of  judicial  dependency  on 
political  officials.  Meanwhile,  politicians  generally  treated  the  Turk- 
ish issue  with  great  caution  in  1991  and  early  1992.  Nationalist 
factions  attacked  the  governing  UDF  for  its  legislative  "alliance" 
with  the  MRF,  suggesting  that  UDF  compromises  would  jeopardize 
national  security.  These  conditions  lessened  the  likelihood  that  the 
National  Assembly  would  finally  attack  and  resolve  the  "national 
question. " 

Bulgarian  foreign  policy  also  changed  markedly  in  the  years  fol- 
lowing 1989.  As  in  domestic  affairs,  a  strong  body  of  opinion  fa- 
vored maintaining  pre- 1989  policy,  in  this  case  continuing  to 
cultivate  the  Soviet  Union  as  protector  and  economic  benefactor. 
Actual  policy  sought  a  compromise  that  would  not  only  change  po- 
litical relations  but  also  ensure  continued  supply  of  raw  materials, 
especially  fuels.  Negotiations  with  the  Soviet  government  yielded 
promises  of  continued  supply,  but  by  1991  the  Soviet  republics 
responsible  for  delivery  were  able  to  ignore  the  commitment.  This 
situation  deteriorated  further  when  the  Soviet  Union  dissolved  into 
constituent  republics  in  the  fall  of  1991.  By  January  1992,  Bul- 
garia had  established  relations  with  Belarus,  Russia,  Ukraine,  and 


xxxvm 


the  Baltic  states  in  an  effort  to  reestablish  supply  lines.  In  Novem- 
ber 1991,  Bulgaria  joined  a  new  economic  association  for  East  Euro- 
pean cooperation  and  trade,  formed  by  economic  organizations  in 
most  of  the  former  East  European  Comecon  member  countries, 
as  well  as  in  Russia,  Kazakhstan,  and  Ukraine.  The  aim  was  to 
restore  economic  relations  among  those  countries  on  a  new  basis. 

A  top  foreign  policy  priority  of  the  Dimitrov  government  was 
dismantling  the  bureaucracy  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs, 
which  was  still  dominated  by  BSP  functionaries  under  Prime 
Minister  Popov.  Shortly  after  his  appointment,  Minister  of  For- 
eign Affairs  Ganev  secured  the  recall  of  several  ineffectual  senior 
diplomats.  In  early  1992,  he  reviewed  the  performance  of  all  minis- 
try personnel  in  order  to  streamline  the  organization  and  purge 
remaining  members  of  Zhivkov's  state  security  establishment,  which 
had  been  notorious  for  conducting  espionage  from  diplomatic 
outposts. 

Beginning  in  1990,  President  Zheliu  Zhelev  and  other  Bulgar- 
ian officials  met  with  Western  officials  to  stress  Bulgaria's  com- 
mitment to  economic  and  political  reform  and  cement  relations  with 
the  United  States  and  the  European  Community  (EC — see  Glos- 
sary). The  EC  was  the  primary  focus  because  Bulgarian  policy  mak- 
ers saw  acceptance  into  the  European  federation  as  the  best  way 
to  avoid  isolation  and  hasten  internal  reform.  With  this  goal  in 
mind,  top-level  diplomatic  attention  was  divided  among  many  West 
European  countries,  while  overtures  to  Eastern  Europe  declined 
noticeably.  In  late  1991,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  and  Italy  prom- 
ised to  support  Bulgarian  membership  in  the  EC,  although  at  that 
point  at  least  seven  countries  were  ahead  of  Bulgaria  on  the  list 
of  prospective  EC  members.  In  1991  Bulgaria  did  achieve  associ- 
ate status  in  the  EC,  together  with  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,  and 
Poland.  From  the  Western  viewpoint,  a  stable  Bulgaria  offered  a 
calming  influence  on  the  turbulent  Balkans,  where  the  disintegra- 
tion of  Yugoslavia  in  1991  threatened  to  trigger  wider  conflict  over 
ethnic  and  economic  issues. 

Bulgaria  viewed  the  Yugoslav  crisis  of  the  second  half  of  1991 
as  a  serious  threat  to  regional  stability.  President  Zhelev  reiter- 
ated Bulgaria's  policy  of  nonintervention  and  the  right  of  self- 
determination  for  all  people  in  Yugoslavia.  This  declaration  was 
mainly  to  reduce  accusations  and  fears  in  Serbia  that  Bulgaria  would 
assume  a  direct  role  in  weakening  the  Yugoslav  Federation  (now 
reduced  to  Serbia  and  Montenegro)  and  renew  century-old  claims 
on  Macedonian  territory.  Zhelev' s  reassurances  were  also  aimed 
at  Greece,  which  feared  annexation  of  its  part  of  Macedonia  into 


xxxix 


a  state  of  Greater  Macedonia.  Following  its  advocacy  of  self- 
determination  for  Balkan  states,  Bulgaria  recognized  the  four  former 
Yugoslav  secessionist  republics,  Bosnia  and  Hercegovina,  Croatia, 
Macedonia,  and  Slovenia,  in  the  winter  of  1991 .  In  late  1991 ,  Bul- 
garia strongly  backed  mediation  of  the  conflict  between  Serbia  and 
Croatia  by  the  EC  and  the  United  Nations,  and  Bulgaria  embar- 
goed military  supplies  and  arms  bound  for  Yugoslavia. 

Meanwhile,  relations  with  Turkey  improved  after  the  triumph 
of  the  UDF  in  the  fall  1991  election.  The  UDF-MRF  coalition  pur- 
sued a  treaty  of  friendship,  cooperation,  and  security  to  match  the 
treaty  signed  with  Greece  in  October  1991.  By  early  1992,  high- 
level  military  talks  had  substantially  eased  tension  with  Turkey, 
which  maintained  troops  in  eastern  Thrace  close  to  the  Bulgarian 
border.  Meanwhile,  Foreign  Minister  Ganev  was  seeking  a  trilateral 
summit  meeting  with  Turkey  and  Greece  to  enhance  regional  secu- 
rity as  well  as  a  "mini-Helsinki"  conference  of  Balkan  states,  to 
enhance  regional  security.  Cultivation  of  Turkey  had  the  strategic 
role  of  counterbalancing  Greece  and  Serbia,  two  regional  powers 
potentially  allied  against  Bulgaria  over  the  Macedonia  issue  in  1992. 

The  overthrow  of  Zhivkov  revealed  a  deep  fascination  in  Bul- 
garian society  with  the  culture  and  ideals  of  the  United  States,  and 
a  desire  for  closer  relations.  Although  United  States  aid  to  Bul- 
garia remained  quite  small  compared  with  aid  given  to  Poland, 
Hungary,  and  Czechoslovakia  in  the  early  1990s,  high-level  offi- 
cial contacts  in  that  period  were  more  friendly  and  frequent  than 
ever  before.  President  Zhelev  stated  Bulgaria's  position  very  force- 
fully on  two  visits  to  Washington  (1990  and  1991),  and  Prime 
Minister  Dimitrov  had  a  productive  stay  in  March  1992  that  gained 
a  promise  that  the  United  States  would  accord  Bulgaria  the  same 
status  as  the  three  major  East  European  aid  recipients.  In  November 
1991,  the  United  States  officially  granted  Bulgaria  most-favored- 
nation  status. 

The  demise  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  in  1991  left  Bulgaria  without 
the  military  protection  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  allies.  To  bol- 
ster its  security  position,  Bulgaria  obtained  NATO  assurances  about 
Turkey's  military  ambitions  and  established  a  special  relationship 
with  NATO  headquarters  in  1991 .  Meanwhile,  the  Bulgarian  mili- 
tary establishment  underwent  reforms  comparable  to  those  else- 
where in  society.  A  central  aim  of  the  Dimitrov  government  was 
to  bring  the  military  under  civilian  control,  to  end  the  separate, 
elite  status  that  followed  the  Soviet  model,  and  to  make  the  mili- 
tary an  open  institution  integrated  into  society.  An  immediate 
stimulus  for  this  reform  was  the  role  of  national  military  establish- 
ments in  Yugoslavia's  bloody  internal  conflict  and  in  the  failed  coup 


xl 


in  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991.  (The  Bulgarian  military  had  taken 
no  part  in  any  of  the  political  turmoil  of  1989-91 .)  The  depolitiza- 
tion  of  the  military  decreed  by  the  Bulgarian  government  in  1990 
reduced  BSP  influence  in  the  ranks.  As  in  other  phases  of  Bulgar- 
ian life,  positions  of  power  remained  for  some  time  thereafter  in 
the  hands  of  reactionaries  from  the  Zhivkov  era.  By  the  end  of  1991 , 
however,  about  85  percent  of  generals  active  in  1989  had  retired 
voluntarily  or  under  pressure.  The  resignations  resulted  in  a  net 
reduction  of  ninety-three  generals  from  a  top-heavy  officer  corps. 
The  military  reform  campaign  also  sought  to  lift  the  status  of  the 
military  as  a  profession  and  to  foster  positive  relations  between  the 
civilian  and  military  communities.  In  1992,  however,  a  shortage 
of  army  officers  was  partly  attributed  to  the  military's  negative 
image  in  society. 

Arms  and  spare-part  supply  to  the  Bulgarian  military  suffered 
greatly  when  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov  caused  the  Soviet  Union 
to  abandon  long-term  contracts.  At  the  same  time,  the  dispropor- 
tionately large  Bulgarian  arms  industry,  a  pillar  of  the  centrally 
planned  economy,  was  hit  hard  by  the  loss  of  its  Soviet  market. 
The  new  government  limited  the  activities  of  Kintex,  Bulgaria's 
notorious  arms  export  agency,  by  prohibiting  sales  to  terrorists  and 
totalitarian  regimes.  A  long-term  conversion  program  begun  in  Oc- 
tober 1991  gave  new  civilian  production  assignments  to  many  arms 
plants. 

The  Bulgarian  military  had  a  long  history  of  cooperation  with 
its  Soviet  counterpart.  Weapons  systems,  doctrine,  and  training 
were  interchangeable  throughout  the  postwar  era,  and  the  Bulgarian 
military  relied  on  Soviet  fuel  supplies  even  more  heavily  than  the 
civilian  economy.  The  sudden  end  of  the  Soviet  partnership  in  1990, 
followed  shortly  by  removal  of  the  communist  symbols  and  dogma 
that  had  supported  military  morale,  caused  considerable  turbulence 
and  confusion. 

New  international  responsibilities  also  affected  the  Bulgarian  mili- 
tary establishment.  To  abide  by  the  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed 
Forces  in  Europe  signed  by  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  NATO  in  1990, 
Bulgaria  also  faced  reductions  in  military  manpower  and  arma- 
ments beginning  in  1991 .  Bulgaria  sought  to  retain  the  Soviet  SS-23 
missiles  installed  in  the  1980s,  however,  on  the  grounds  that  they 
predated  the  relevant  nuclear  disarmament  treaty  and  were  vital 
to  national  defense. 

As  the  1990s  began,  Bulgaria  was  in  a  completely  new  phase 
of  national  existence.  For  this  phase  to  succeed,  Bulgaria  needed 
both  a  substantive  new  self-image  and  a  believable  new  interna- 
tional posture.  The  postwar  communist  period  had  changed  society 


xli 


by  forcible  industrialization  and  urbanization;  those  processes  were 
accompanied  by  regimentation  that  suppressed  cultural  and  economic 
individuality,  and  by  isolation  from  influences  and  challenges  out- 
side the  Soviet  sphere.  Then,  in  keeping  with  the  wave  of  democrati- 
zation that  had  swept  most  of  Eastern  Europe  in  1989,  Bulgaria  made 
an  abrupt  about-face  and  began  experimenting  with  democratic  in- 
stitutions in  a  manner  unprecedented  in  the  country's  political  his- 
tory. After  nearly  fifty  years  of  totalitarianism,  and  having  had 
marginal  success  with  democratic  institutions  prior  to  World  War 
II,  Bulgaria's  experimentation  was  quite  cautious  at  first.  By  1992, 
however,  a  new  generation  of  capable  leaders  had  instilled  impres- 
sive momentum  in  the  transformation  process.  Although  the  slow 
pace  of  economic  restructuring  promised  continued  hardship,  a  large 
part  of  Bulgarian  society  was  committed  to  reform,  and  hard-line 
revisionism  and  social  unrest  had  declined  in  early  1992. 

Besides  adapting  Western-type  political  and  economic  institu- 
tions to  unique  domestic  requirements,  Bulgaria's  most  difficult 
task  was  to  overcome  its  Cold- War  image  as  an  obscure  and  some- 
what sinister  nation  whose  total  loyalty  to  the  Soviet  Union  had 
led  it  to  support  terrorists  and  assassins.  By  1992  progress  in  that 
direction  was  significant;  Western  approval  raised  Bulgaria's  sta- 
tus closer  to  that  of  Poland,  Hungary,  and  Czechoslovakia,  the 
three  former  Soviet  client  states  whose  democratization  had  given 
them  a  head  start  toward  integration  into  the  fabric  of  Europe.  As 
it  strengthened  its  connections  to  the  West  in  1992,  Bulgaria  fi- 
nally had  an  opportunity  to  develop  social  and  political  institutions 
appropriate  to  its  needs  under  reduced  pressure  from  large-power 
European  politics. 

December  31,  1992 

*     *  * 

In  the  months  following  completion  of  this  manuscript,  Bulgaria 
underwent  serious  political  upheaval,  and  its  economy  failed  to 
move  toward  reform  nearly  as  fast  as  planners  had  hoped.  The 
Dimitrov  government  elected  in  late  1991  showed  early  promise 
in  promoting  economic  reform  and  democratization.  By  mid- 1992, 
however,  Dimitrov' s  leverage  was  reduced  by  shifting  factions  in 
his  political  coalition  and  by  rising  public  skepticism  that  Bulgaria's 
painful  reform  program  would  yield  a  better  standard  of  living. 

In  1992  Dimitrov 's  UDF  coalition  dominated  political  dialogue 
and  enjoyed  a  narrow  majority  in  the  National  Assembly.  This  po- 
sition required  that  the  coalition  remain  unified  within  itself  and 
allied  with  the  much  smaller  MRF.  But  in  the  second  half  of  1992, 


xlii 


UDF  policies  increasingly  alienated  influential  parts  of  Bulgarian 
society  such  as  the  Orthodox  Church,  parts  of  the  media,  trade 
unions,  and  private  businessmen.  An  atmosphere  of  escalating  con- 
frontation was  the  result. 

Meanwhile,  the  MRF  was  taking  increasingly  independent  stands 
on  many  issues,  using  the  influence  provided  by  the  party's  swing- 
vote  position  in  parliament.  In  October  1992,  judging  the  UDF 
response  to  its  demands  inadequate,  the  MRF  finally  joined  the 
Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  and  dissident  UDF  members  in  a  parlia- 
mentary vote  of  no  confidence  in  the  Dimitrov  government.  By 
destroying  the  Dimitrov  coalition,  the  vote  created  another  crisis 
period  in  which  Bulgaria  was  unable  to  choose  a  government. 
Nearly  two  months  later,  Liuben  Berov,  an  unaffiliated  econom- 
ics professor,  was  approved  as  prime  minister  after  both  the  UDF 
and  the  BSP  had  failed  to  form  governments. 

The  fate  of  the  leading  parties  thus  changed  drastically  at  the 
end  of  1992.  The  BSP,  which  had  remained  aloof  from  political 
struggle  during  the  UDF's  dominant  period,  found  itself  with  the 
political  influence  of  a  parliamentary  plurality  as  the  new  govern- 
ment took  office.  This  happened  in  spite  of  the  continued  split  be- 
tween BSP  conservatives  allied  with  former  communist  party  chief 
Aleksandur  Lilov  and  the  reformist  branch  of  the  party.  Observ- 
ers questioned  whether  the  BSP  would  use  its  new  influence  to  pro- 
mote reform  or  to  preserve  the  remaining  Zhivkov-era  party 
bastions  in  state  industry  and  provincial  government.  In  early  1993, 
BSP  support  of  the  Berov  government  was  decidedly  pragmatic, 
and  experts  saw  a  strong  likelihood  that  support  would  be  with- 
drawn (and  the  government  automatically  toppled)  if  policies  dis- 
pleased the  BSP  or  if  a  new  election  would  be  advantageous  to  the 
BSP. 

Meanwhile,  the  disparate  membership  of  the  UDF  wrote  another 
chapter  in  the  acrimonious  history  of  the  coalition.  The  group  again 
split  formally  when  one  faction  of  constituent  parties  formed  a  new 
coalition,  the  New  Union  for  Democracy.  Although  Berov  had 
pledged  to  continue  the  UDF  reform  program,  UDF  members  of 
parliament  refused  all  support  for  the  Berov  government.  Rela- 
tions between  the  UDF  and  its  former  allies  in  the  MRF  remained 
hostile.  Several  attempts  at  forming  new  coalitions  and  alliances 
failed  for  various  reasons  in  early  1993.  The  most  notable  coali- 
tion was  the  Bulgarian  Democratic  Center,  whose  loss  of  two  key 
member  parties  left  a  void  in  the  center  of  the  political  spectrum. 

Besides  the  confusion  of  a  fragmented  political  base,  the  Dimitrov 
government  left  unforeseen  financial  woes.  According  to  one 


xliii 


estimate,  Bulgaria's  internal  debt  doubled  in  1992.  The  reasons 
were  inflation  (which  reached  6.6  percent  per  month  in  early  1993), 
the  Dimitrov  government's  concealing  of  budget  deficits  by  with- 
holding funds  from  certain  industries,  and  government  assump- 
tion of  the  debts  of  state  companies.  After  the  government  had 
borrowed  heavily  from  the  Bulgarian  National  Bank  to  pay  its  debts, 
only  an  estimated  5  percent  of  domestic  credit  remained  for  pri- 
vate investment.  Experts  forecast  the  same  figure  for  1993,  leav- 
ing no  prospect  of  meaningful  support  for  a  larger  private  sector. 

In  April  1993,  Berov's  coalition  government  was  able  to  draft 
a  budget  bill  containing  the  same  deficit  as  in  1992,  despite  the 
debt  left  by  Dimitrov.  To  do  this,  spending  on  education,  health 
care,  culture,  and  national  defense  were  reduced  significantly;  the 
Ministry  of  National  Defense  would  receive  only  half  the  money 
it  requested.  Nevertheless,  the  proposed  deficit,  7.9  percent  of  the 
gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary),  caused  concern 
among  international  lenders. 

Economic  reform  in  1992  had  limited  success.  The  amended  land 
redistribution  law  passed  in  March  1992  effectively  abolished  col- 
lective farms;  nominally,  nearly  80  percent  of  Bulgaria's  total  arable 
land  had  been  reclaimed  by  individual  owners  by  midyear. 
Although  the  legislative  machinery  was  in  place,  however,  by 
mid- 1993  less  than  20  percent  of  designated  land  had  actually  been 
restored,  and  Zhelev  criticized  the  Berov  government  for  neglect- 
ing this  aspect  of  economic  policy.  In  April  1993,  farmers  demon- 
strated in  Sofia  against  inequities  they  perceived  in  the  land  law. 

The  political  crisis  stopped  vital  privatization  legislation  in  late 
1992,  delaying  the  pilot  privatization  of  100  companies.  Berov  had 
called  privatization  the  top  priority  of  his  government  when  he  took 
office,  and  adjustments  were  made  in  existing  laws  to  make  con- 
version easier.  Nevertheless,  almost  no  privatization  activity  took 
place  in  the  first  four  months  of  1993.  In  early  1993,  President 
Zhelev  recommended  that  privatization  be  delayed  until  a  large- 
scale  national  program,  similar  to  those  used  in  the  Czech  Repub- 
lic, Hungary,  and  Poland,  could  be  prepared.  Meanwhile,  ineffi- 
cient state  industries  went  deep  into  recession,  cancelling  the  effects 
of  what  had  been  a  rather  successful  economic  stabilization  plan 
in  1991. 

International  lenders,  whose  assistance  was  considered  a  vital 
ingredient  in  restructuring  Bulgaria's  economy,  responded  unevenly 
to  the  events  of  1992.  Lenders  demanded  faster  progress  toward 
a  market  system,  but  Bulgarian  policy  makers  were  wary  of  losing 
public  support  by  further  cutting  state  subsidies  for  social  programs. 
In  late  1992,  Bulgaria  agreed  to  repay  part  of  the  interest  overdue

to  its  international  commercial  creditors,  as  a  good- faith  step  toward 
a  1993  debt  settlement  agreement.  The  additional  expense,  how- 
ever, promised  to  exacerbate  the  budget  deficit. 

Prospects  for  Bulgaria's  commercial  relations  with  Western  Eu- 
rope improved  in  late  1992  and  early  1993.  In  March  1993,  Bul- 
garia signed  an  agreement  with  the  EC  to  establish  a  free-trade 
zone  with  that  group  over  a  ten-year  transition  period.  A  strong 
incentive  for  the  Europeans  was  bolstering  Bulgaria  as  a  stabiliz- 
ing influence  in  the  chaotic  Balkans.  In  an  April  resolution  on  its 
relations  with  Bulgaria,  the  European  Parliament  (the  legislative 
assembly  of  the  EC)  declared  that  no  further  guarantees  of  reform 
were  needed  because  Bulgaria  was  on  an  irreversible  line  toward 
a  market  economy — a  judgment  likely  encouraged  by  Balkan  geo- 
politics. The  new  EC-Bulgarian  accords  were  to  go  into  effect  in 
June  1993. 

In  March  1993,  Bulgaria  also  signed  a  free-trade  agreement  with 
the  European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA).  Although  at  that 
point  only  3.5  percent  of  Bulgaria's  exports  went  to  EFTA  mem- 
ber nations  (Austria,  Finland,  Iceland,  Liechtenstein,  Norway, 
Sweden,  and  Switzerland),  the  terms  of  the  agreement  made  sub- 
stantial expansion  possible.  Were  the  agreement  ratified,  95  per- 
cent of  Bulgarian  industrial  exports  would  have  tariff-free  access, 
while  agricultural  exports  would  be  governed  by  bilateral  arrange- 
ments. 

Besides  the  drive  for  inclusion  in  West  European  economic  group- 
ings, the  primary  issue  of  Bulgarian  foreign  policy  in  early  1993 
was  preventing  expansion  of  the  Yugoslav  crisis.  In  keeping  with 
its  own  consistent  policy  of  nonintervention,  Bulgaria  warned  the 
other  Balkan  states  to  refrain  from  military  involvement  that  might 
return  the  entire  region  to  the  chaos  that  preceded  World  War  I. 
Bulgaria  opposed  lifting  the  arms  embargo  on  Bosnian  Muslims, 
predicting  that  such  a  move  would  expand  the  conflict  between 
Muslims  and  Serbs.  Meanwhile,  Bulgarian  diplomats  remained 
in  constant  contact  with  Greece  and  Turkey  while  reiterating  Bul- 
garian support  for  the  independence  of  all  four  former  Yugoslav 
republics:  Bosnia  and  Hercegovina,  Croatia,  Macedonia,  and 
Slovenia.  Berov  traveled  to  Moscow  in  March  to  discuss  the  Balkan 
situation,  trade,  repayment  of  Russian  debts  to  Bulgaria,  and  eco- 
nomic cooperation.  No  concrete  decisions  were  made,  although  the 
Bulgarian  and  Russian  representatives  noted  their  nations'  har- 
mony on  the  Balkan  question.  In  early  1993,  Bulgaria  confirmed 
its  intention  to  rely  on  Russia  and  Ukraine  as  primary  military 
suppliers,  choosing  to  maintain  longstanding  relations  rather  than 
incur  the  greater  expense  of  refitting  Bulgarian  forces  with  Western 


xlv 


equipment.  According  to  official  Bulgarian  statements,  no  secu- 
rity threat  was  perceived  from  instability  in  any  former  Soviet 
republic. 

Ethnic  minority  issues  remained  without  solution  in  1992, 
although  no  major  open  conflict  resulted  from  continued  tension 
between  minorities  and  Bulgarian  nationalists.  Although  1992 
human  rights  legislation  improved  the  legal  status  of  minorities, 
unemployment  hit  them  especially  hard,  and  as  many  as  40,000 
Turks  left  Bulgaria  in  1992.  In  the  fall  of  1992,  the  Roma  (Gyp- 
sies) formed  their  first-ever  national  political  organization  in 
response  to  their  dire  economic  conditions.  Prime  Minister  Berov, 
whose  government  was  nominally  based  on  the  ethnic-Turkish 
MRF,  openly  discussed  pressure  tactics  used  by  both  Turks  and 
Bulgarian  nationalists  to  influence  ethnic  self-identification  in  eth- 
nically mixed  regions.  In  1993  those  tactics  still  included  campaigns 
against  restoration  of  Turkish  names  (following  Zhivkov's  mass 
renaming  campaign)  and  campaigns  against  use  of  Turkish  in 
schools  with  Turkish  populations,  as  well  as  forcible  Turkicization 
of  Bulgarian  Muslims  preferring  to  live  as  Bulgarians.  Berov 
pledged  to  prevent  human  rights  abuses  on  both  sides,  but  little 
concrete  change  occurred  in  the  first  half  of  1993. 

Bulgaria  began  the  fourth  year  of  the  post-Zhivkov  era  with 
prospects  less  optimistic  than  in  the  previous  years.  The  momen- 
tum of  economic  reform  was  slowed  significantly  by  continued  high 
unemployment,  rising  inflation,  low  productivity,  the  resistance 
of  Zhivkov-era  holdovers  in  large  state  industries,  and,  increas- 
ingly, the  cynicism  of  the  Bulgarian  public  toward  the  usefulness 
of  short-term  sacrifice  on  the  road  to  a  market  economy.  The 
ominously  growing  shadow  of  the  former  Bulgarian  Communist 
Party  hung  over  the  country,  whose  political  system  again  collapsed 
into  chaos  in  late  1992.  International  prospects  seemed  somewhat 
better,  mainly  because  Bulgaria's  designated  role  as  a  Balkan  is- 
land of  stability  prompted  increased  Western  support  even  when 
internal  political  and  economic  conditions  failed  to  match  Western 
expectations.  But  in  1993,  the  road  from  communism  was  prov- 
ing much  more  rocky  than  most  Bulgarians  had  anticipated;  for 
many  Bulgarians,  living  standards  were  lower  than  under  the  Zhiv- 
kov  regime,  and  patience  was  wearing  thin.

THE  HISTORY  OF  THE  LAND  now  known  as  Bulgaria  has 
been  determined  by  its  location  between  Asia  and  Europe,  by  its 
proximity  to  powerful  states  competing  for  land  and  influence  at 
the  junction  of  trade  routes  and  strategic  military  positions,  and 
by  the  strong  national  territorial  drive  of  various  Bulgarian  states. 
Before  the  Christian  era,  Greece  and  Rome  conquered  the  region 
and  left  substantial  imprints  on  the  culture  of  the  people  they  found 
there.  The  Bulgar  tribes,  who  arrived  in  the  seventh  century  from 
west  of  the  Urals,  have  occupied  the  region  continuously  for  thir- 
teen centuries.  Over  time  Bulgarian  culture  merged  with  that  of 
the  more  numerous  Slavs,  who  had  preceded  the  Bulgars  by  one 
century.  After  converting  to  Christianity  and  adopting  a  Slavic  lan- 
guage in  the  ninth  century,  the  Bulgarians  consolidated  a  distinct 
Slavic  culture  that  subsequently  passed  through  periods  of  both  ex- 
pansionist independence  and  subordination  to  outside  political 
systems. 

From  the  ninth  until  the  fourteenth  century,  Bulgaria  was  a 
dominant  force  in  the  Balkans  because  of  its  aggressive  military 
tradition  and  strong  sense  of  national  identity.  The  chief  rival  and 
neighbor,  the  Byzantine  Empire,  left  a  lasting  political  imprint  on 
two  Bulgarian  empires  as  it  competed  with  them  for  regional  domi- 
nation. Marking  the  deterioration  of  both  the  Byzantine  and  the 
Bulgarian  political  structures,  the  fall  of  Constantinople  to  the 
Ottoman  Turks  in  1453  began  four  centuries  of  Turkish  suppres- 
sion of  Bulgarian  cultural  and  political  institutions. 

By  the  eighteenth  century,  however,  weakening  Ottoman  con- 
trol allowed  a  Bulgarian  cultural  revival.  In  the  next  century, 
Western  political  ideas  gradually  combined  with  the  reborn  Bul- 
garian national  consciousness  to  form  an  independence  movement. 
The  movement  was  complicated  by  internal  disagreement  on  aims 
and  methods,  the  increasing  weakness  of  the  Ottoman  foothold  in 
Europe,  and  the  conflicting  attitudes  of  the  major  European  pow- 
ers toward  Bulgaria.  Russia  gained  distinction  as  Bulgaria's  pro- 
tector by  driving  out  the  Turks  in  1877,  but  France  and  Britain 
curbed  Russian  power  in  the  Balkans  by  forcing  establishment  of 
a  limited  autonomous  Bulgarian  state  under  Turkish  rule.  The  in- 
strument of  that  limitation,  the  Treaty  of  Berlin,  revived  longstand- 
ing Bulgarian  territorial  frustrations  by  placing  the  critical  regions 
of  Macedonia  and  Thrace  beyond  Bulgarian  control.  Both  of  those 
disputed  regions  had  substantial  Bulgarian  populations.  During 


3 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

the  next  sixty  years,  Bulgaria  would  fight  unsuccessfully  in  four 
wars,  in  a  variety  of  alliances,  to  redress  the  grievance.  None  of 
the  four  wars  brought  substantial  new  territory  to  Bulgaria. 

Beginning  in  1878,  Bulgaria  was  nominally  ruled  by  members 
of  West  European  royal  houses  under  a  parliamentary  form  of 
government.  Prime  Minister  Stefan  Stambolov  unified  the  coun- 
try during  its  first  decade,  but  extremist  political  parties  exerted 
substantial  influence  from  the  beginning.  Between  1878  and  the 
declaration  of  full  independence  in  1908,  Bulgaria  passed  through 
a  period  of  peaceful  modernization  with  expansion  in  industry, 
science,  education,  and  the  arts.  Modernization  and  industriali- 
zation sowed  the  seeds  of  class  conflict,  however,  nurturing  strong 
socialist  and  agrarian  opposition  parties  in  the  decades  that  followed 
independence. 

The  period  between  1912  and  1944  was  full  of  irredentist  wars 
and  internal  political  turmoil.  By  1900  Serbia  and  Greece  were  the 
major  territorial  rivals,  but  a  World  War  I  alliance  with  Germany 
gained  Bulgaria  litde  advantage  over  them.  After  the  war,  the  agrar- 
ian reform  government  of  Aleksandur  Stamboliiski  had  failed  to 
unite  the  country  by  1923.  The  series  of  unstable  factions  and  forms 
of  government  that  followed  Stamboliiski  was  broken  only  by  Bul- 
garia's  participation  as  an  Axis  ally  in  World  War  II.  Again  no 
territory  was  gained,  but  World  War  II  brought  Soviet  occupa- 
tion, the  end  of  the  monarchy,  and  forty-one  years  of  unbroken 
communist  rule  beginning  in  1948.  During  that  entire  period,  Bul- 
garia was  the  closest  East  European  imitator  of  Soviet  internal  and 
foreign  policy.  The  years  1948  through  1989  were  a  time  of  collec- 
tivization, heavy  industrialization,  drastic  restriction  of  human 
rights,  and  close  adherence  to  Soviet  Cold- War  policy. 

Early  Settlement  and  Empire 

The  land  now  known  as  Bulgaria  attracted  human  settlement 
as  early  as  the  Bronze  Age.  Almost  from  the  first,  however,  exist- 
ing civilizations  were  challenged  by  powerful  neighbors. 

Pre-Bulgarian  Civilizations 

The  first  known  civilization  to  dominate  the  territory  of  present- 
day  Bulgaria  was  that  of  the  Thracians,  an  Indo-European  group. 
Although  politically  fragmented,  Thracian  society  is  considered  to 
have  been  comparable  to  that  of  Greece  in  the  arts  and  econom- 
ics; these  achievements  reached  a  peak  in  the  sixth  century  B.C. 
Because  of  political  disunity,  however,  Thrace  then  was  suc- 
cessively occupied  and  divided  by  the  Greeks,  the  Persians,  the 
Macedonians,  and  the  Romans.  After  the  decline  of  the  Macedo- 
nian Empire  of  Alexander  the  Great,  a  new  Thracian  kingdom

emerged  in  the  third  century  B.C.  Occupied  by  the  Romans,  it 
remained  a  kingdom  within  the  Roman  Empire  until  the  emperor 
Vespasian  incorporated  it  as  a  district  in  the  first  century  A.D. 
Roman  domination  brought  orderly  administration  and  the  estab- 
lishment of  Serditsa  (on  the  site  of  modern  Sofia)  as  a  major  trad- 
ing center  in  the  Balkans.  In  the  fourth  century  A.D.,  when  the 
Roman  Empire  split  between  Rome  and  Constantinople,  Thrace 
became  part  of  the  Eastern,  or  Byzantine,  Empire.  Christianity 
was  introduced  to  the  region  at  this  time.  Both  the  Latin  culture 
of  Rome  and  the  Greek  culture  of  Constantinople  remained  strong 
influences  on  ensuing  civilizations. 

The  Slavs  and  the  Bulgars 

Waves  of  Huns,  Goths,  Visigoths,  and  Ostrogoths  invaded  and 
plundered  the  Balkans  beginning  in  the  third  century  A.D.  None 
of  these  invaders  permanently  occupied  territory.  Small  Slavic 
groups  began  settling  outlying  regions  in  the  fifth  century,  and  by 
the  seventh  century  the  Slavs  had  overcome  Byzantine  resistance 
and  settled  most  of  the  Balkans.  The  Slavs  brought  a  more  stable 
culture,  retained  their  own  language,  and  substantially  slavicized 
the  existing  Roman  and  Byzantine  social  system. 

The  immigration  of  the  first  Bulgars  overlapped  that  of  the  Slavs

in  the  seventh  century.  Of  mixed  Turkic  stock  (the  word  Bulgar 
derives  from  an  Old  Turkic  word  meaning  "one  of  mixed  nation- 
ality"), the  Bulgars  were  warriors  who  had  migrated  from  a  region 
between  the  Urals  and  the  Volga  to  the  steppes  north  of  the  Caspian 
Sea,  then  across  the  Danube  into  the  Balkans.  Besides  a  formid- 
able reputation  as  military  horsemen,  the  Bulgars  had  a  strong  po- 
litical organization  based  on  their  khan  (prince).  In  A.D.  630  a 
federation  of  Bulgar  tribes  already  existed;  in  the  next  years  the 
Bulgars  united  with  the  Slavs  to  oppose  Byzantine  control.  By  681 
the  khan  Asparukh  had  forced  Emperor  Constantine  V  to  recog- 
nize the  first  Bulgarian  state.  The  state,  whose  capital  was  at  Pliska, 
near  modern  Shumen,  combined  a  Bulgarian  political  structure 
with  Slavic  linguistic  and  cultural  institutions. 

The  First  Golden  Age 

The  First  Bulgarian  Empire  was  able  to  defeat  the  Byzantine 
Empire  in  81 1  and  expand  its  territory  eastward  to  the  Black  Sea, 
south  to  include  Macedonia,  and  northwest  to  present-day  Belgrade 
(see  fig.  2).  The  kingdom  reached  its  greatest  size  under  Tsar 
Simeon  (893-927),  who  presided  over  a  golden  age  of  artistic  and 
commercial  expansion.  After  moving  deep  into  Byzantine  terri- 
tory, Simeon  was  defeated  in  924. 

Meanwhile,  Rome  and  Byzantium  competed  for  political  and 
cultural  influence  in  Bulgaria.  The  Eastern  Empire  won  in  870, 
when  Bulgaria  accepted  Eastern  Rite  (Orthodox)  Christianity  and 
an  autocephalous  Bulgarian  Church  was  established.  This  decision 
opened  Bulgaria  to  Byzantine  culture  (and  territorial  ambitions) 
through  the  literary  language  devised  for  the  Slavs  by  the  Ortho- 
dox monks  Cyril  and  Methodius.  Establishment  of  a  common,  offi- 
cial religion  also  permanently  joined  the  Bulgarian  and  Slavic 
cultures. 

After  reaching  its  peak  under  Simeon,  the  First  Bulgarian  Em- 
pire declined  in  the  middle  of  the  tenth  century.  Byzantine  oppo- 
sition and  internal  weakness  led  to  a  loss  of  territory  to  the  Magyars 
and  the  Russians.  Bulgaria  remained  economically  dependent  on 
the  Byzantine  Empire,  and  the  widespread  Bogomil  heresy  (see 
Glossary)  opposed  the  secular  Bulgarian  state  and  its  political  am- 
bitions as  work  of  the  devil.  Seeking  to  restore  a  balance  of  power 
in  the  Balkans,  the  Byzantines  allied  with  the  Kievan  Russians 
under  Yaroslav  and  invaded  Bulgaria  several  times  in  the  late  tenth 
century.  Although  the  Bulgarians  expanded  their  territory  again 
briefly  under  Tsar  Samuil  at  the  end  of  the  tenth  century,  in  1014 
the  Byzantines  under  Basil  II  inflicted  a  major  military  loss.  By 
1018  all  of  Bulgaria  was  under  Byzantine  control.  For  nearly  two 


6 


Historical  Setting 


centuries,  the  Byzantines  ruled  harshly,  using  taxes  and  the  polit- 
ical power  of  the  church  to  crush  opposition.  The  first  and  second 
Crusades  passed  through  Bulgaria  in  this  period,  devastating  the 
land. 

The  Second  Golden  Age 

By  1185  the  power  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  had  again  waned 
because  of  external  conflicts.  The  noble  brothers  Asen  and  Peter 
led  a  revolt  that  forced  Byzantine  recognition  of  an  autonomous  Bul- 
garian state.  Centered  at  Turnovo  (present-day  Veliko  Turnovo), 
this  state  became  the  Second  Bulgarian  Empire.  Like  the  First  Bul- 
garian Empire,  the  second  expanded  at  the  expense  of  a  preoccupied 
Byzantine  Empire.  In  1202  Tsar  Kaloian  (1197-1207)  concluded 
a  final  peace  with  Byzantium  that  gave  Bulgaria  full  independence. 
Kaloian  also  drove  the  Magyars  from  Bulgarian  territory  and  in 
1204  concluded  a  treaty  with  Rome  that  consolidated  Bulgaria's 
western  border  by  recognizing  the  authority  of  the  pope.  By  the 
middle  of  the  thirteenth  century,  Bulgaria  again  ruled  from  the 
Black  Sea  to  the  Adriatic.  Access  to  the  sea  greatly  increased  com- 
merce, especially  with  the  Italian  Peninsula.  Turnovo  became  the 
center  of  Bulgarian  culture,  which  enjoyed  a  second  golden  age. 

The  final  phase  of  Bulgaria's  second  Balkan  dominance  was  the 
reign  of  Kaloian 's  successor,  Ivan  Asen  II  (1218-41;  see  fig.  3). 
In  this  period,  culture  continued  to  flourish,  but  political  instabil- 
ity again  threatened.  After  the  death  of  Ivan  Asen  II,  internal  and 
external  political  strife  intensified.  Sensing  weakness,  the  Tatars 
began  sixty  years  of  raids  in  1241,  the  Byzantines  retook  parts  of 
the  Second  Bulgarian  Empire,  and  the  Magyars  again  advanced. 
From  1257  until  1277,  aristocratic  factions  fought  for  control  of 
the  Bulgarian  throne.  Heavy  taxation  by  feudal  landlords  caused 
their  peasants  to  revolt  in  1277  and  enthrone  the  "swineherd  tsar" 
Ivailo.  After  1300  Tatar  control  ended,  and  a  new  period  of  ex- 
pansion followed  under  Mikhail  Shishman  (1323-1330)  and  Ivan 
Aleksandur  (1331-1370).  As  before,  however,  military  and  com- 
mercial success  paralleled  internal  disorder;  the  social  chaos  of  the 
previous  century  continued  to  erode  the  power  of  Bulgarian  lead- 
ers. Meanwhile,  Serbia  had  risen  as  a  formidable  rival  in  the 
Balkans,  and  the  Ottoman  Turks  had  advanced  to  the  Aegean  coast. 
In  the  late  fourteenth  century,  Bulgaria  was  weakened  by  the  di- 
vision of  its  military  defenses  between  the  two  perceived  threats. 

Ottoman  Rule 

The  Ottoman  Empire  was  founded  in  the  early  fourteenth  cen- 
tury by  Osman  I,  a  prince  of  Asia  Minor  (see  Glossary)  who  began 


7

pushing  the  eastern  border  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  westward  toward 
Constantinople.  Present-day  European  Turkey  and  the  Balkans, 
among  the  first  territories  conquered,  were  used  as  bases  for  ex- 
pansion far  to  the  West  during  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  centu- 
ries. The  capture  of  Constantinople  in  1453  completed  Ottoman 
subjugation  of  major  Bulgarian  political  and  cultural  institutions. 
Nevertheless,  certain  Bulgarian  groups  prospered  in  the  highly  or- 
dered Ottoman  system,  and  Bulgarian  national  traditions  continued 
in  rural  areas.  When  the  decline  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  began  about 
1600,  the  order  of  local  institutions  gave  way  to  arbitrary  repres- 
sion, which  eventually  generated  armed  opposition.  Western  ideas 
that  penetrated  Bulgaria  during  the  1 700s  stimulated  a  renewed  con- 
cept of  Bulgarian  nationalism  that  eventually  combined  with  decay 
in  the  empire  to  loosen  Ottoman  control  in  the  nineteenth  century.

Historical  Setting 


Introduction  of  the  Ottoman  System 

Ottoman  forces  captured  the  commercial  center  of  Sofia  in  1385. 
Serbia,  then  the  strongest  Christian  power  in  the  Balkans,  was  deci- 
sively defeated  by  the  Ottomans  at  the  Battle  of  Kosovo  Polje  in 
1389,  leaving  Bulgaria  divided  and  exposed.  Within  ten  years,  the 
last  independent  Bulgarian  outpost  was  captured.  Bulgarian  re- 
sistance continued  until  1453,  when  the  capture  of  Constantino- 
ple gave  the  Ottomans  a  base  from  which  to  crush  local  uprisings. 
In  consolidating  its  Balkan  territories,  the  new  Ottoman  political 
order  eliminated  the  entire  Bulgarian  state  apparatus.  The  Otto- 
mans also  crushed  the  nobility  as  a  landholding  class  and  poten- 
tial center  of  resistance.  The  new  rulers  reorganized  the  Bulgarian 
church,  which  had  existed  as  a  separate  patriarchate  since  1235, 
making  it  a  diocese  under  complete  control  of  the  Byzantine  Patri- 
archate at  Constantinople.  The  sultan,  in  turn,  totally  controlled 
the  patriarchate. 

The  Ottomans  ruled  with  a  centralized  system  much  different 
from  the  scattered  local  power  centers  of  the  Second  Bulgarian  Em- 
pire. The  single  goal  of  Ottoman  policy  in  Bulgarian  territory  was 
to  make  all  local  resources  available  to  extend  the  empire  westward 
toward  Vienna  and  across  northern  Africa.  Landed  estates  were 
given  in  fiefdom  to  knights  bound  to  serve  the  sultan.  Peasants  paid 
multiple  taxes  to  both  their  masters  and  the  government.  Territorial 
control  also  meant  cultural  and  religious  assimilation  of  the  populace 
into  the  empire.  Ottoman  authorities  forcibly  converted  the  most 
promising  Christian  youths  to  Islam  and  trained  them  for  govern- 
ment service.  Called  pomaks,  such  converts  often  received  special 
privileges  and  rose  to  high  administrative  and  military  positions. 
The  Ottoman  system  also  recognized  the  value  of  Bulgarian  arti- 
sans, who  were  organized  and  given  limited  autonomy  as  a  separate 
class.  Some  prosperous  Bulgarian  peasants  and  merchants  became 
intermediaries  between  local  Turkish  authorities  and  the  peasants. 
In  this  capacity,  these  chorbadzhi  (squires)  were  able  to  moderate 
Ottoman  policy.  On  the  negative  side,  the  Ottoman  assimilation 
policy  also  included  resettlement  of  Balkan  Slavs  in  Asia  Minor 
and  immigration  of  Turkish  peasants  to  farm  Bulgarian  land.  Slavs 
also  were  the  victims  of  mass  enslavement  and  forcible  mass  con- 
version to  Islam  in  certain  areas. 

Bulgarian  Society  under  the  Turks 

Traditional  Bulgarian  culture  survived  only  in  the  smaller  vil- 
lages during  the  centuries  of  Ottoman  rule.  Because  the  adminis- 
trative apparatus  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  included  officials  of  many 
nationalities,  commerce  in  the  polyglot  empire  introduced  Jews,

centers.  Bulgarians  in  such  centers  were  forcibly  resettled  as  part 
of  a  policy  to  scatter  the  potentially  troublesome  educated  classes. 
The  villages,  however,  were  often  ignored  by  the  centralized  Otto- 
man authorities,  whose  control  over  the  Turkish  landholders  often 
exerted  a  modifying  influence  that  worked  to  the  advantage  of  the 
indigenous  population.  Village  church  life  also  felt  relatively  little 
impact  from  the  centralized  authority  of  the  Greek  Orthodox  Church. 
Therefore,  between  the  fourteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries,  the 
villages  became  isolated  repositories  of  Bulgarian  folk  culture, 
religion,  social  institutions,  and  language. 

Early  Decay  and  Upheaval  in  the  Empire 

Notable  Bulgarian  uprisings  against  the  Ottomans  occurred  in

the  1590s,  the  1680s  and  the  1730s;  all  sought  to  take  advantage 
of  external  crises  of  the  empire,  and  all  were  harshly  suppressed. 
Beginning  in  the  1600s,  local  bandits,  called  hajduti  (sing. ,  hajdutin), 
led  small  uprisings  (see  fig.  4).  Some  writers  now  describe  these 
uprisings  as  precursors  of  a  Bulgarian  nationalist  movement.  Most 
scholars  agree,  however,  that  hajdutin  activities  responded  only  to 
local  misrule  and  their  raids  victimized  both  Christians  and  Mus- 
lims. Whatever  their  motivation,  hajdutin  exploits  became  a  cen- 
tral theme  of  national  folk  culture. 

By  1600  the  Ottoman  Empire  had  reached  the  peak  of  its  power 
and  territorial  control.  In  the  seventeenth  century,  the  empire  began 
to  collapse;  the  wealth  of  conquest  had  spread  corruption  through 
the  political  system,  vitiating  the  ability  of  the  central  government 
to  impose  order  throughout  the  farflung  empire.  For  the  majority 
of  people  in  agricultural  Bulgaria,  centralized  Ottoman  control  had 
been  far  from  intolerable  while  the  empire  was  orderly  and  strong. 
But  the  growing  despotism  of  local  authorities  as  the  central  govern- 
ment declined  created  a  new  class  of  victims.  Increasingly,  Bul- 
garians welcomed  the  progressive  Western  political  ideas  that 
reached  them  through  the  Danube  trade  and  travel  routes.  Already 
in  the  1600s,  Catholic  missionaries  in  western  Bulgaria  had  stimu- 
lated creation  of  literature  about  Bulgaria's  national  past.  Although 
the  Turks  suppressed  this  Western  influence  after  the  Chiprovets 
uprising  of  1688,  the  next  century  brought  an  outpouring  of  histor- 
ical writings  reminding  Bulgarian  readers  of  a  glorious  national 
heritage. 

National  Revival,  Early  Stages 

For  Bulgaria  the  eighteenth  century  brought  transition  from  static 
subservience  within  a  great  Asian  empire  toward  intellectual  and 
political  modernization  and  reestablishment  of  cultural  ties  with 
Western  Europe.  The  monasteries  of  an  increasingly  independent 
Bulgarian  church  fostered  national  thought  and  writing;  Western 
influences  altered  the  nature  of  commerce  and  landholding  in  the 
Balkans;  and  the  forcible  assimilation  of  Bulgarian  culture  into  a 
cosmopolitan  Asian  society  ended,  allowing  Bulgarian  national  con- 
sciousness to  reawaken.  At  the  same  time,  social  anarchy  inhib- 
ited the  liberation  process.  These  developments  set  the  stage  for 
a  full  national  revival. 

The  Written  Word 

In  the  eighteenth  century,  all  Slavic  cultures  moved  away  from 
the  formal  Old  Church  Slavonic  language  that  had  dominated  their 
literatures  for  centuries.  The  literary  language  that  emerged  was

much  closer  to  the  common  vernacular,  eventually  making  books 
accessible  to  a  much  wider  readership.  In  1741  Hristofor  Zhefarovich 
published  his  Stematografia,  a  discussion  of  the  cultural  history  of 
the  Serbs  and  the  Bulgarians.  The  book  displayed  the  Bulgarian 
coat  of  arms  and  praised  the  glorious  past  of  the  Bulgarian  people. 
In  1762  Father  Paisi  of  Hilendar  wrote  a  history  of  the  Bulgarian 
peoples  in  a  mixture  of  Old  Church  Slavonic  and  vernacular  lan- 
guage. Circulated  in  manuscript  form  for  nearly  one  hundred  years, 
the  book  was  a  lively,  readable  celebration  of  the  Bulgarian  past 
and  a  call  for  all  Bulgarians  to  remember  their  heritage  and  culti- 
vate their  native  language.  Paisi' s  history  inspired  generations  of 
writings  on  Bulgarian  patriotic  themes.  In  part,  its  influence  was 
strong  because  Paisi  wrote  at  a  monastery  on  Mt.  Athos,  the  larg- 
est spiritual  center  in  the  Balkans  and  an  early  receptacle  of  ideas

of  the  European  Enlightenment  (see  Glossary).  Paisi's  follower 
Sofronii  Vrachanski  further  developed  the  literature  by  using  a 
much  more  vernacular  language  to  advance  secular  ideas  of  the 
Enlightenment  in  translations  of  Greek  myths  and  his  original  Life 
and  Tribulations  of  the  Sinner  Sofronii.  Sofronii  also  published  the  first 
printed  book  in  Bulgaria  in  1806. 

Commerce  and  Western  Influences 

Under  the  Ottoman  Empire,  the  Mediterranean  and  Asian  trade 
routes  met  in  Bulgaria.  Fairs  and  regional  markets  eventually 
brought  tradesmen  into  contact  with  their  foreign  counterparts. 
After  centuries  of  exclusion  from  population  centers  by  Turkish 
policy,  Bulgarians  began  migrating  back  to  the  towns,  establish- 
ing an  urban  ethnic  presence.  By  the  eighteenth  century,  trade 
guilds  included  many  workers  in  cloth,  metal,  wood,  and  decora- 
tive braid.  The  estate  holders  of  Macedonia  also  profited  from  grow- 
ing European  cotton  markets.  Some  Bulgarian  merchants  assumed 
positions  as  intermediaries  between  Turkish  and  European  mar- 
kets, grew  rich  from  such  connections,  and  established  offices  in 
the  major  European  capitals.  As  the  Bulgarian  cultural  revival 
spread  from  the  monasteries  into  secular  society,  these  newly 
wealthy  groups  promoted  secular  art,  architecture,  literature,  and 
Western  ideals  of  individual  freedom  and  national  consciousness. 
Of  particular  impact  were  the  ideals  of  the  French  Revolution,  in- 
troduced through  commercial  connections  at  the  start  of  the 
nineteenth  century. 

The  end  of  centralized  Ottoman  power  over  Bulgarian  territory 
brought  several  decades  of  anarchy,  called  the  kurdzhaliistvo,  at  the 
end  of  the  eighteenth  century.  As  at  the  end  of  the  Second  Bulgar- 
ian Empire  four  hundred  years  before,  local  freebooters  controlled 
small  areas,  tyrannized  the  population,  and  fought  among  them- 
selves. Political  order  was  not  reestablished  in  Bulgaria  until  1820. 
Meanwhile,  large  population  shifts  occurred  as  Bulgarians  fled  the 
taxation  and  violence  inflicted  by  this  anarchic  condition;  the  new 
communities  they  founded  in  Romania  and  southern  Russia  were 
important  sources  of  cultural  and  political  ideas  in  the  nineteenth 
century. 

The  Bulgarian  national  revival  took  place  in  the  larger  context 
of  Christian  resistance  to  Turkish  occupation  of  Eastern  and  Cen- 
tral Europe — a  cause  whose  momentum  increased  as  the  Ottoman 
Empire  crumbled  from  within.  Russia  fought  a  series  of  wars  with 
the  Turks  between  1676  and  1878,  and  was  given  the  right  to  pro- 
tect Christians  living  under  Ottoman  rule  in  treaties  signed  in  1774 
and  1791 .  Those  treaties  granted  semiautonomy  to  the  Romanian 


13

regions  of  Wallachia  and  Moldavia,  which  gave  hope  that  Russia 
might  provide  similar  help  to  Bulgaria  during  the  kurdzhaliistvo.  In- 
tellectual ties  between  Bulgaria  and  Russia  promoted  the  adoption 
of  Russian  revolutionary  thought  along  with  Western  influences. 
In  1804  Sofronii  offered  the  help  of  the  entire  Bulgarian  people 
to  Russian  armies  fighting  the  Turks  and  moving  toward  Bulgar- 
ian territory.  By  1811  a  special  volunteer  army  of  several  thou- 
sand Bulgarians  had  been  formed,  in  the  hope  that  Russian  success 
against  the  Turks  would  liberate  Bulgaria.  Although  the  Russians 
did  not  aid  the  Bulgarians  directly  at  that  time,  Russia  remained 
crucial  to  Bulgarian  foreign  relations  from  that  time  to  the  late  twen- 
tieth century. 

European  and  Russian  Policies,  1800 

By  1800  the  Ottoman  Empire  was  universally  labeled  ''The  Sick 
Man  of  Europe."  The  empire  was  precariously  near  total  collapse 
and  ready  to  be  dismantled  by  a  powerful  neighbor,  just  as  the 
Byzantine  Empire  had  been  dismantied  by  the  Ottomans.  In  this 
case  the  logical  successor  was  Russia,  an  expanding  empire  with 
strong  religious  and  cultural  ties  to  the  captive  Slavic  groups.  Russia 
also  had  a  continuing  desire  to  achieve  access  to  the  Mediterra- 
nean Sea.  Russian  military  power  reached  its  peak  with  the  defeat 
of  Napoleon's  invading  army  in  1812,  but  throughout  the  nine- 
teenth century  France  and  Britain  used  diplomatic  and  military 
means  to  counterbalance  Russian  influence  in  the  Balkans  and  the 
Bosporus.  This  implicit  defense  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  delayed 
Bulgarian  independence,  but  the  intellectual  basis  of  revolution  grew 
rapidly  in  the  nineteenth  century. 

The  Bulgarian  Independence  Movement 

Revolution  in  the  Balkans 

In  1804  Serbia  began  a  series  of  uprisings  that  won  it  autonomy 
within  the  Ottoman  Empire  by  1830.  Especially  in  the  campaigns 
of  1804  and  1815.  many  Bulgarians  in  areas  adjacent  to  Serbia 
fought  beside  the  Serbs.  When  the  Greeks  revolted  against  Tur- 
kish rule  in  1821,  Bulgarian  towns  provided  money  and  soldiers. 
Several  hundred  Bulgarians  fought  in  the  six-year  Greek  uprising, 
some  of  them  as  commanders,  and  some  became  part  of  the  govern- 
ment of  independent  Greece.  Bulgarians  also  fought  the  Turks  in 
Crete:  in  addition,  they  fought  with  the  Italian  revolutionary 
Giuseppe  Garibaldi  and  with  other  nationalist  uprisings  against 
the  Habsburgs  in  1848-49.  In  spite  of  Bulgarian  sympathy  for  na- 
tional liberation  movements  nearby,  and  although  the  ideals  of  those

movements  permeated  the  Balkans  from  1804  on,  the  anarchy  of 
the  early  1800s  confined  expression  of  Bulgarian  national  feeling 
primarily  to  the  cultural  realm  until  the  1860s. 

Cultural  Expressions  of  Nationalism 

In  1824  Dr.  Petur  Beron,  a  member  of  the  Bulgarian  emigrant 
community  in  Romania,  published  the  first  primer  in  colloquial  Bul- 
garian. His  book  also  explained  a  new  system  of  secular  education 
to  replace  the  outdated  precepts  of  monastery  pedagogy,  and  Beron' s 
suggestions  strongly  influenced  the  development  of  Bulgarian  edu- 
cation in  the  nineteenth  century.  In  1835  a  school  was  opened  in 
Gabrovo  according  to  Beron 's  design.  Under  direction  of  the  monk 
Neofit  Rilski,  it  was  the  first  school  to  teach  in  Bulgarian.  Similar 
schools  opened  in  the  ensuing  years,  and  in  1840  the  first  school 
for  girls  opened  in  Pleven.  Education  grew  especially  fast  in  trad- 
ing towns  such  as  Koprivshtitsa  and  Kalofer  in  the  foothills  of  the 
Balkans,  where  textiles  and  other  trades  created  a  wealthy  merchant 
class.  In  the  1840s,  the  first  generation  of  Western-educated  Bul- 
garians returned  home.  Forming  a  cosmopolitan  intelligentsia,  they 
diversified  and  expanded  Bulgarian  schools  in  the  following  decades. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1800s,  special  educational  and  cultural  ties 
developed  with  Russia  and  France.  In  1840  the  Russian  government 


15 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

began  awarding  grants  for  Bulgarian  students  to  study  in  Russia. 
The  total  number  of  students  in  the  Russian  program  was  never 
high,  but  several  graduates  were  leaders  in  the  independence  drive 
of  the  1870s.  Several  notable  Bulgarians  of  that  generation  also 
were  educated  in  France  and  at  Robert  College,  founded  as  a  mis- 
sionary institution  in  Constantinople. 

Parallel  with  educational  advancement,  Bulgarian  book  print- 
ing advanced  substantially  after  1830.  Before  that  date  only  seven- 
teen original  Bulgarian  titles  had  been  printed;  but  by  mid-century, 
printing  had  replaced  manuscript  copying  as  the  predominant 
means  of  distributing  the  written  word.  The  first  periodical  was 
printed  in  Bulgarian  in  1844,  beginning  an  outpouring  of  mostly 
ephemeral  journals  through  the  nineteenth  century.  Censorship  be- 
fore 1878  meant  that  the  majority  of  such  journals  were  printed 
in  the  Romanian  emigrant  centers,  outside  the  Ottoman  Empire. 
Most  Bulgarian-language  periodicals  printed  within  the  empire 
came  from  Constantinople,  showing  the  cultural  importance  of  that 
city  to  the  Bulgarian  National  Revival.  After  1850  Bulgarian  emigre 
periodicals,  supporting  a  wide  variety  of  political  views  toward  the 
national  independence  movement,  played  a  vital  role  in  stimulat- 
ing Bulgarian  political  consciousness. 

In  the  mid- 1800s,  a  number  of  cultural  and  charitable  organi- 
zations founded  in  Constantinople  supported  and  directed  Bulgarian 
national  institutions  that  resisted  Ottoman  and  Greek  influence. 
The  social  institution  of  the  chitalishte  (literally  "reading  room") 
played  an  important  cultural  role  beginning  in  1856.  Established 
in  population  centers  by  adult  education  societies,  the  chitalishte  was 
a  center  for  social  gatherings,  lectures,  performances,  and  debates. 
Because  it  was  available  to  the  entire  public,  this  institution  spread 
national  cultural  and  political  ideals  beyond  the  intelligentsia  to 
the  larger  society.  By  1878  there  were  131  such  centers. 

The  Bulgarian  National  Revival  also  stimulated  the  arts  in  the 
nineteenth  century.  Dobri  Chintulov  wrote  the  first  poetry  in 
modern  Bulgarian  in  the  1840s,  pioneering  a  national  literary 
revival  that  peaked  in  the  1870s.  Translation  of  Western  European 
and  Russian  literature  accelerated,  providing  new  influences  that 
broke  centuries  of  rigid  formalism.  Painting  and  architecture  now 
also  broke  from  the  prescribed  forms  of  Byzantine  church  art  to 
express  secular  and  folk  themes.  Bulgarian  wood-carving  and  church 
singing  assumed  the  forms  that  survive  today. 

Religious  Independence 

The  Bulgarian  church  achieved  new  independence  in  the  nine- 
teenth century.  The  Ottoman  Empire  had  left  the  Bulgarian  church 


16 


Historical  Setting 


hierarchy  under  the  Greek  Patriarchate  of  Constantinople  for  four 
centuries,  disregarding  the  differences  between  the  two  Orthodox 
churches.  (The  last  separate  Bulgarian  church  jurisdiction,  the  arch- 
bishopric of  Ohrid,  was  absorbed  in  1767.)  Early  in  the  1800s,  few 
of  the  Bulgarian  church  leaders  most  closely  connected  with  En- 
lightenment ideas  sought  separation  from  the  Greek  Orthodox 
Church.  But  in  1839,  a  movement  began  against  the  Greek 
Metropolitan  of  Turnovo,  head  of  the  largest  Bulgarian  diocese, 
in  favor  of  local  control.  In  1849  the  active  Bulgarian  community 
of  Constantinople  began  pressing  Turkish  officials  for  church 
sovereignty.  Other  large  Bulgarian  dioceses  both  inside  and  out- 
side Bulgaria  sought  a  return  to  liturgy  in  the  vernacular  and  ap- 
pointment of  Bulgarian  bishops.  The  first  concession  came  in  1848, 
when  the  Greek  patriarch  of  Constantinople  allowed  one  Bulgar- 
ian church  in  that  city. 

Because  a  decade  of  petitions,  demonstrations,  and  Ottoman  re- 
form suggestions  had  brought  no  major  change,  in  1860  Bishop 
Ilarion  Makariopolski  of  Constantinople  declared  his  diocese  in- 
dependent of  the  Greek  patriarchate.  This  action  began  a  move- 
ment for  ecclesiastical  independence  that  united  rural  and  urban 
Bulgarians  and  began  a  bitter  Greek-Bulgarian  dispute.  The  Turks 
and  the  Russians  began  to  mediate  in  1866,  seeking  a  compromise 
that  would  ensure  the  security  of  each  in  the  face  of  increasing 
regional  unrest.  In  1870  the  Ottoman  sultan  officially  declared  the 
Bulgarian  church  a  separate  exarchate.  The  Greek  patriarchate, 
which  never  recognized  the  separation,  excommunicated  the  en- 
tire Bulgarian  church;  but  the  symbolism  of  the  Ottoman  decree 
had  powerful  political  effect.  The  new  exarchate  became  the  lead- 
ing force  in  Bulgarian  cultural  life;  it  officially  represented  the  Bul- 
garians in  dealing  with  the  Turks,  and  it  sponsored  Bulgarian 
schools.  The  novel  administrative  system  of  the  exarchate  called 
for  lay  representation  in  governing  bodies,  thus  introducing  a  note 
of  self-government  into  this  most  visible  institution. 

Early  Insurrections 

The  social  and  cultural  events  of  the  National  Revival  moved 
parallel  to  important  political  changes.  Bulgarian  aid  to  the  Rus- 
sians in  the  Russo-Turkish  wars  of  1806-12  and  1828-29  did  noth- 
ing to  loosen  Ottoman  control.  Then  the  Ottoman  Empire  ruthlessly 
quelled  major  Bulgarian  uprisings  in  1835  (in  Turnovo),  1841  (in 
Nis),  and  in  1850-51  (in  Vidin).  Those  uprisings  still  bore  the 
disorganized  qualities  of  the  hajduti,  but,  together  with  smaller  move- 
ments in  intervening  years,  they  established  a  tradition  of  insur- 
rection for  the  next  generation.  Meanwhile,  beset  by  European 


17 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

enemies  and  internal  revolutions,  the  Turks  entered  a  reform  period 
in  1826.  They  replaced  the  elite  but  increasingly  untrustworthy 
Janissary  forces  with  a  regular  army  and  officially  abolished  the 
feudal  land  system.  These  changes  reduced  oppression  by  the  local 
Turkish  rulers  in  Bulgaria.  In  the  1830s,  Sultan  Mahmud  II  recen- 
tralized  and  reorganized  his  government  to  gain  control  over  his 
corrupt  officials  and  follow  European  administrative  models. 
Although  these  changes  had  little  direct  effect  on  Bulgaria,  they 
clearly  signaled  to  the  Slavic  subjects  of  the  empire  that  reform  was 
now  possible. 

Balkan  Politics  of  the  Mid-Nineteenth  Century 

By  1850  the  emerging  Bulgarian  nationalist  movement  had  split 
into  two  distinct  branches.  The  moderates,  concentrated  in  Con- 
stantinople, favored  gradual  improvement  of  conditions  in  Bulgaria 
through  negotiations  with  the  Turkish  government.  This  was  the 
approach  that  created  a  separate  Bulgarian  exarchate  in  1870.  The 
moderates  believed  that  the  protection  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  was 
necessary  because  a  free  Bulgaria  would  be  subject  to  Balkan  poli- 
tics and  great-power  manipulation.  The  radical  faction,  however, 
saw  no  hope  of  gradual  reform.  Following  their  understanding  of 
European  liberal  tradition  and  Russian  revolutionary  thought,  the 
leaders  of  this  faction  aimed  first  for  liberation  from  all  outside  con- 
trols. Liberation,  they  believed,  would  automatically  lead  to  com- 
plete modernization  of  Bulgarian  society. 

The  crushing  of  the  large-scale  Vidin  peasant  revolt  in  1851 
brought  intervention  by  Britain  and  France,  who  bolstered  and  pro- 
tected the  Ottoman  Empire  throughout  the  nineteenth  century  as 
a  counterweight  to  Russian  expansion.  To  prevent  destabilizing 
unrest,  Britain  and  France  forced  the  Turks  to  introduce  land  re- 
form in  western  Bulgaria  in  the  early  1850s  and  a  series  of  major 
social  reforms  in  1856  and  1876.  Nominally,  those  measures  in- 
cluded equal  treatment  for  non-Muslims  in  the  empire  and 
parliamentary  representation  for  Bulgarians  and  Serbs.  These 
changes,  however,  were  the  cosmetic  product  of  Turkey's  need  for 
Western  support  in  major  wars  with  Russia.  They  did  nothing  to 
blunt  the  nationalist  drive  of  the  Bulgarian  radicals. 

The  First  Independence  Organizations 

In  1862  Georgi  Rakovski  assembled  the  first  armed  group  of  Bul- 
garians having  the  avowed  goal  of  achieving  independence  from 
the  Ottoman  Empire.  Rakovski,  well-educated  and  experienced 
in  the  1841  uprising  and  the  drive  for  ecclesiastical  independence, 
envisioned  a  federal  republic  including  all  Balkan  nations  except 


18 


Historical  Setting 


Greece.  His  fighters  were  to  stir  a  full-scale  national  uprising  after 
crossing  into  Bulgaria  from  assembly  points  in  Romania  and  Serbia. 
But  the  Serbs,  who  had  supported  the  Bulgarians  while  they  were 
useful  in  opposing  the  Turks,  disbanded  the  Bulgarian  legions  in 
Serbia  when  they  no  longer  served  that  purpose.  Although  Rakovski 
died  in  1867  without  achieving  Bulgarian  independence,  he  united 
the  emigre  intelligentsia,  and  the  presence  of  his  army  influenced 
Turkish  recognition  of  the  Bulgarian  church  in  1870. 

The  Bulgarian  Secret  Central  Committee,  founded  by  emigre 
Bulgarians  in  Bucharest  in  1866,  continued  Rakovski 's  mission 
under  the  leadership  of  Vasil  Levski  and  Liuben  Karavelov.  These 
ideologues  refined  Rakovski' s  idea  of  armed  revolutionary  groups, 
creating  a  cadre  of  intellectuals  who  would  prepare  the  people  to 
rise  for  independence.  Beginning  in  1868,  Levski  founded  the  first 
revolutionary  committees  in  Bulgaria.  Captured  by  the  Turks,  he 
became  a  national  hero  when  he  was  hanged  in  1873.  In  1870 
Karavelov  founded  the  Bulgarian  Revolutionary  Central  Commit- 
tee (BRCC)  in  Bucharest.  The  death  of  Levski  temporarily  shat- 
tered the  group,  but  the  committee  resumed  its  activities  when 
Georgi  Benkovski  joined  its  leadership  in  1875.  By  this  time,  the 
political  atmosphere  of  the  Balkans  was  charged  with  revolution, 
and  the  Ottoman  Empire  looked  increasingly  vulnerable.  Britain, 
Russia,  and  Austria-Hungary  were  growing  concerned  about  the 
implications  of  those  trends  for  the  European  balance  of  power. 
In  1875  Bosnia  and  Hercegovina  revolted  successfully  against  the 
Turks,  and  the  next  year  Serbia  and  Montenegro  attacked  the  Otto- 
man Empire. 

The  Final  Move  to  Independence 

In  the  early  1870s,  the  BRCC  had  built  an  intricate  revolution- 
ary organization,  recruiting  thousands  of  ardent  patriots  for  the 
liberation  struggle.  Finally,  in  1875  the  committee  believed  that 
external  distractions  had  weakened  the  Ottoman  Empire  enough 
to  activate  that  struggle.  Local  revolutionary  committees  in  Bul- 
garia attempted  to  coordinate  the  timing  and  strategy  of  a  general 
revolt.  Armed  groups  were  to  enter  Bulgaria  from  abroad  to  sup- 
port local  uprisings,  and  diversionary  attacks  on  Ottoman  mili- 
tary installations  were  planned.  Despite  these  efforts  at  coordination, 
the  BRCC  strategy  failed.  Although  planned  as  a  general  revolt, 
the  September  Uprising  of  1875  occurred  piecemeal  in  isolated  lo- 
cations, and  several  local  revolutionary  leaders  failed  to  mobilize 
any  forces.  The  Turks  easily  suppressed  the  uprising,  but  the  harsh- 
ness of  their  response  attracted  the  attention  of  Western  Europe; 
from  that  time,  the  fate  of  Bulgaria  became  an  international  issue.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Following  the  failure  of  the  September  Uprising,  Benkovski  re- 
organized the  BRCC  and  made  plans  for  a  new  revolt.  The  April 
Uprising  of  1876  was  more  widespread,  but  it  also  suffered  from 
poor  coordination.  Poor  security  allowed  the  Turks  to  locate  and 
destroy  many  local  groups  before  unified  action  was  possible.  Mas- 
sacres at  Batak  and  other  towns  further  outraged  international  opin- 
ion by  showing  the  insincerity  of  recent  Turkish  reform  proposals. 
The  deaths  of  an  estimated  30,000  Bulgarians  in  these  massacres 
spurred  the  Bulgarian  national  movement.  An  international  con- 
ference in  Constantinople  produced  proposals  to  curb  the  Muslim 
fanaticism  responsible  for  the  Bulgarian  massacres  and  give  local 
self-government  to  the  Christians  on  European  territory  in  the  em- 
pire. Two  autonomous  Bulgarian  regions  were  proposed,  one  cen- 
tered at  Sofia  and  the  other  at  Turnovo.  When  the  sultan  rejected 
the  reforms,  Russia  declared  war  unilaterally  in  early  1877.  This 
was  Russia's  golden  opportunity  to  gain  control  of  Western  trade 
routes  to  its  southwest  and  finally  destroy  the  empire  that  had 
blocked  this  ambition  for  centuries.  Shocked  by  the  Turkish  mas- 
sacres, Britain  did  not  oppose  Russian  advances. 

San  Stefano,  Berlin,  and  Independence 

In  eight  months,  Russian  troops  occupied  all  of  Bulgaria  and 
reached  Constantinople.  At  this  high  point  of  its  influence  on  Balkan 
affairs,  Russia  dictated  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  in  March  1878. 
This  treaty  provided  for  an  autonomous  Bulgarian  state  (under  Rus- 
sian protection)  almost  as  extensive  as  the  First  Bulgarian  Empire, 
bordering  the  Black  and  Aegean  seas.  But  Britain  and  Austria- 
Hungary,  believing  that  the  new  state  would  extend  Russian  in- 
fluence too  far  into  the  Balkans,  exerted  strong  diplomatic  pres- 
sure that  reshaped  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  four  months  later  into 
the  Treaty  of  Berlin.  The  new  Bulgaria  would  be  about  one-third 
the  size  of  that  prescribed  by  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano;  Mace- 
donia and  Thrace,  south  of  the  Balkans,  would  revert  to  complete 
Ottoman  control.  The  province  of  Eastern  Rumelia  would  remain 
under  Turkish  rule,  but  with  a  Christian  governor  (see  fig.  5). 

Whereas  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  called  for  two  years  of  Rus- 
sian occupation  of  Bulgaria,  the  Treaty  of  Berlin  reduced  the  time 
to  nine  months.  Both  treaties  provided  for  an  assembly  of  Bulgar- 
ian notables  to  write  a  constitution  for  their  new  country.  The  as- 
sembly would  also  elect  a  prince  who  was  not  a  member  of  a  major 
European  ruling  house  and  who  would  recognize  the  authority  of 
the  Ottoman  sultan.  In  cases  of  civil  disruption,  the  sultan  retained 
the  right  to  intervene  with  armed  force. 

The  final  provisions  for  Bulgarian  liberation  fell  far  short  of  the

goals  of  the  national  liberation  movement.  Large  populations  of 
Bulgarians  remained  outside  the  new  nation  in  Macedonia,  Eastern 
Rumelia,  and  Thrace,  causing  resentment  that  endured  well  into 
the  next  century.  (Bulgarians  still  celebrate  the  signing  of  the  Treaty 
of  San  Stefano  rather  than  the  Treaty  of  Berlin  as  their  national 
independence  day.)  In  late  1878,  a  provisional  Bulgarian  govern- 
ment and  armed  uprisings  had  already  surfaced  in  the  Kresna  and 
Razlog  regions  of  Macedonia.  These  uprisings  were  quelled  swiftly 
by  the  Turks  with  British  support.  During  the  next  twenty-five 
years,  large  numbers  of  Bulgarians  fled  Macedonia  into  the  new 
Bulgaria,  and  secret  liberation  societies  appeared  in  Macedonia 
and  Thrace.  One  such  group,  the  Internal  Macedonian  Revolu- 
tionary Organization  (IMRO),  continued  terrorist  activities  in  the 
Balkans  into  the  1930s. 

The  Decades  of  National  Consolidation 

Despite  strong  dissatisfaction  with  the  frontiers  imposed  by  the 
European  powers,  a  new  Bulgarian  state  was  born  in  1878.  And 
despite  early  political  uncertainty,  the  first  thirty-four  years  of 
modern  Bulgaria  were  in  many  ways  its  most  prosperous  and 
productive. 

Forming  the  New  State 

In  1879  a  constituent  assembly  was  duly  convened  in  Turnovo. 
Partly  elected  and  partly  appointed,  the  assembly  of  230  split  into 
conservative  and  liberal  factions  similar  to  those  that  had  existed 
before  independence.  The  liberals  advocated  continuing  the  alli- 
ance of  peasants  and  intelligentsia  that  had  formed  the  indepen- 
dence movement,  to  be  symbolized  in  a  single  parliamentary 
chamber;  the  conservatives  argued  that  the  Bulgarian  peasant  class 
was  not  ready  for  political  responsibility,  and  therefore  it  should 
be  represented  in  a  second  chamber  with  limited  powers.  The  frame- 
work for  the  Turnovo  constitution  was  a  draft  submitted  by  the 
Russian  occupation  authorities,  based  on  the  constitutions  of  Ser- 
bia and  Romania.  As  the  assembly  revised  that  document,  the  lib- 
eral view  prevailed;  a  one-chamber  parliament  or  subranie  would 
be  elected  by  universal  male  suffrage.  Between  the  annual  fall  ses- 
sions of  the  subranie,  the  country  would  be  run  jointly  by  the 
monarch  and  a  council  of  ministers  responsible  to  parliament.  The 
liberals  who  dominated  the  assembly  incorporated  many  of  their 
revolutionary  ideals  into  what  became  one  of  the  most  liberal  con- 
stitutions of  its  time.  The  final  act  of  the  Turnovo  assembly  was 
the  election  of  Alexander  of  Battenburg,  a  young  German  nobleman

who  had  joined  the  Russians  in  the  war  of  1877,  to  be  the  first 
prince  of  modern  Bulgaria. 

From  the  beginning  of  his  reign,  Alexander  opposed  the  liberal 
wing  in  Bulgaria  and  the  Turnovo  constitution.  After  two  years 
of  conflict  with  the  liberal  council  of  ministers  headed  by  Dragan 
Tsankov,  Alexander  received  Russian  backing  to  replace  Tsankov. 
When  the  Russian  Tsar  Alexander  II  was  assassinated,  Russian 
policy  changed  to  allow  a  grand  national  assembly  to  consider  the 
constitutional  changes  desired  by  Prince  Alexander.  The  assassi- 
nation had  spurred  conservatism  in  Russia,  and  the  Bulgarian  liber- 
als had  alarmed  the  Russians  by  refusing  foreign  economic  aid  in 
the  early  1880s.  To  the  dismay  of  the  liberals,  Russia  intervened 
in  the  election  of  the  constitutional  subranie,  frightening  voters  into 
electing  a  group  that  passed  the  entire  package  of  amendments. 
Liberal  influence  was  sharply  reduced  by  amendments  limiting  the 
power  of  the  subranie.  But,  because  the  conservative  approach  to 
governing  Bulgaria  had  little  popular  support,  Alexander  made  a 
series  of  compromises  with  liberal  positions  between  1881  and  1885. 
The  Turnovo  constitution  was  essentially  restored  by  agreement 
between  Tsankov  and  the  conservatives  in  1883,  and  the  constitu- 
tional issue  was  resolved.  In  only  the  first  two  years  of  Bulgaria's 
existence,  two  parliaments  and  seven  cabinets  had  been  dissolved, 
but  more  stable  times  lay  ahead. 

By  1884  the  conservative  faction  had  left  the  government,  but 
the  liberals  split  over  the  high  price  of  purchasing  the  Ruse-Varna 
Railway  from  the  British,  as  required  by  the  Treaty  of  Berlin.  As 
on  earlier  issues,  the  more  radical  faction  sought  to  reduce  the  in- 
fluence of  the  European  powers  who  had  imposed  the  Treaty  of 
Berlin.  This  group  was  led  by  Petko  Karavelov,  brother  of  revolu- 
tionary leader  Liuben  Karavelov  and  prime  minister  in  the  mid- 
18808. 

The  most  important  issue  of  that  period  was  Bulgaria's  chang- 
ing relationship  with  Russia.  Bulgarian  hostility  towards  the  Rus- 
sian army,  refusal  to  build  a  strategic  railway  for  the  Russians 
through  Bulgaria,  and  poor  relations  between  Prince  Alexander 
and  Tsar  Alexander  III  of  Russia  all  contributed  to  increasing  alie- 
nation. Because  conservative  Russia  now  feared  unrest  in  the 
Balkans,  Karavelov  tried  to  appease  the  tsar  by  quelling  the  upris- 
ings that  continued  in  Macedonia.  Radical  factions  in  Bulgaria  were 
persuaded  to  lower  their  goals  from  annexation  of  Macedonia  and 
Thrace  to  a  union  between  Bulgaria  and  Eastern  Rumelia.  When 
a  bloodless  coup  achieved  this  union  in  1885,  however,  Russia 
demanded  the  ouster  of  Prince  Alexander  and  withdrew  all  Russian

officers  from  the  Bulgarian  army.  Greece  and  Serbia  saw  their 
interests  threatened,  and  the  latter  declared  war  on  Bulgaria. 

The  Bulgarian  army  won  a  brilliant  victory  over  Serbia,  with 
no  Russian  aid,  at  the  Battle  of  Slivnitsa.  Although  the  victory  was 
a  source  of  great  national  pride  for  Bulgaria,  Russia  continued  to 
withhold  recognition  of  the  union  with  Eastern  Rumelia  until  Prince 
Alexander  abdicated.  Finally,  Russian-trained  Bulgarian  army 
officers  deposed  the  prince  in  August  1886. 

The  Stambolov  Years 

When  Alexander  left  behind  a  three-man  regency  headed  by 
Stefan  Stambolov,  the  Bulgarian  government  was  as  unstable  as 
it  had  been  in  its  first  year.  A  Russian-educated  liberal,  Stambolov 
became  prime  minister  in  1887  and  ceased  tailoring  Bulgarian  policy 
to  Russian  requirements.  The  tsar's  special  representative  in 


24 


Historical  Setting 


Bulgaria  returned  to  Russia  after  failing  to  block  a  subranie  called 
to  nominate  a  new  prince.  Russo-Bulgarian  relations  remained 
chilly  for  the  next  ten  years,  and  this  break  further  destabilized 
Bulgarian  politics  and  society.  Stambolov  brutally  suppressed  an 
army  uprising  in  1887  and  began  seven  years  of  iron  control  that 
often  bypassed  the  country's  democratic  institutions  but  brought 
unprecedented  stability  to  Bulgaria.  Meanwhile,  Ferdinand  of  Saxe- 
Coburg-Gotha,  a  Catholic  German  prince,  accepted  the  Bulgar- 
ian throne  in  August  1887. 

Independence  from  the  Ottoman  Empire  brought  drastic  eco- 
nomic and  social  changes  to  Bulgaria  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth 
century.  Industrialization  proceeded  rapidly  (thirty-six  major  fac- 
tories opened  between  1878  and  1887),  and  a  new  class  of  indus- 
trial labor  formed  from  displaced  artisans  and  agricultural  workers. 
Harsh  working  conditions  led  the  urban  poor  to  the  cause  of  so- 
cialism, and  in  1891  the  Social  Democratic  Party  was  formed.  (Later 
transformation  of  one  of  its  factions  into  the  Bulgarian  Communist 
Party  made  that  organization  the  oldest  communist  party  in  the 
world.)  Town-centered  trade  and  the  guild  structure  were  swept 
away  by  an  influx  of  West  European  commerce  to  which  Bulgaria 
had  been  opened  by  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Berlin. 

Despite  industrialization,  Bulgaria  remained  primarily  an  agricul- 
tural country.  Liberation  eliminated  the  Ottoman  feudal  landhold- 
ing  system.  Bulgarian  peasants  were  able  to  buy  land  cheaply  or 
simply  occupy  it  after  Turkish  landlords  left,  and  a  system  of  village- 
based  small  landholding  began.  Agricultural  production  rose  in  spite 
of  heavy  government  land  taxes.  Many  peasants  were  forced  into 
the  urban  work  force  by  taxes  or  high  interest  on  borrowings  for 
land  purchase.  Until  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  vast 
majority  of  the  Bulgarian  population  were  small  landholders  or  in- 
dependent small  tradesmen. 

Russia  and  the  other  great  powers  did  not  recognize  Ferdinand 
as  rightful  prince  of  Bulgaria  until  1896.  Supporters  of  Prince  Alex- 
ander who  remained  in  power  used  this  failure  as  a  weapon  against 
the  policies  of  Ferdinand  and  Stambolov.  In  1890  a  widespread 
plot  against  the  government  was  discovered.  As  before,  the  basis 
of  the  plot  was  dissatisfaction  with  Stambolov 's  refusal  to  inter- 
cede with  the  Turks  on  behalf  of  Macedonian  independence.  In 
a  masterful  diplomatic  stroke,  Stambolov  represented  the  insur- 
rection to  the  Turks  as  an  example  of  potential  chaos  that  could 
be  avoided  by  minor  concessions.  Fearing  the  Balkan  instability 
that  would  follow  an  overthrow  of  Ferdinand,  the  Turks  then  ceded 
three  major  Macedonian  dioceses  to  the  Bulgarian  exarchate.  Stam- 
bolov thus  gained  solid  church  support  and  an  overwhelming  victory

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  1890  election,  which  legitimized  his  government  among  all 
Bulgarian  factions  and  reduced  the  threat  of  radical  plots. 

In  the  next  years,  Stambolov  and  the  People's  Liberal  Party  he 
had  founded  in  1886  exerted  virtually  dictatorial  power  to  suppress 
extreme  nationalism  and  opposing  parties  and  create  conditions 
for  economic  growth.  After  the  1886  coup,  the  army  was  strictly 
controlled.  Voters  were  intimidated  to  ensure  the  reelection  of  in- 
cumbent officials,  and  political  patronage  grew  rampant.  Using 
his  own  and  Ferdinand's  ties  with  Germany  and  Austria-Hungary, 
Stambolov  built  a  capitalist  Bulgarian  economic  system  on  foreign 
loans,  protectionism,  an  expanded  industrial  and  transport  infras- 
tructure, and  a  strict  tax  system  for  capital  accumulation.  Espe- 
cially important  to  the  Bulgarian  economy  was  completion  of  the 
Vienna-to-Constantinople  Railway  through  Bulgaria  in  1888  and 
the  Burgas- Yambol  Railway  in  the  early  1890s.  Stambolov  derived 
strong  political  support  from  the  entrepreneurs  who  benefited  from 
his  industrial  policy.  The  Stambolov  era  marked  the  victory  of 
executive  over  legislative  power  in  the  Bulgarian  political  system. 

Legitimacy  of  the  Bulgarian  throne  remained  an  important  sym- 
bolic issue  in  the  early  1890s,  and  the  threat  of  assassination  or 
overthrow  of  the  prince  remained  after  Stambolov  consolidated  his 
power.  Therefore,  Stambolov  found  a  Catholic  wife  for  Ferdinand 
and  maneuvered  past  Orthodox  Church  objections  in  1893  to  en- 
sure Ferdinand  an  heir  that  would  stabilize  the  throne.  That  heir, 
Boris,  was  born  the  next  year.  Meanwhile,  Stambolov' s  autocratic 
maneuvering  and  tough  policies  won  him  many  enemies,  especially 
after  the  stabilization  of  the  early  1890s  appeared  to  make  such 
tactics  unnecessary.  In  1894  Ferdinand  dismissed  his  prime  minister 
because  the  prince  sought  more  power  for  himself  and  believed  that 
Stambolov  had  become  a  political  liability.  The  next  year,  Macedo- 
nian radicals  assassinated  Stambolov. 

The  Rule  of  Ferdinand 

The  new  administration  was  mainly  conservative,  and  Ferdinand 
became  the  dominant  force  in  Bulgarian  policy  making.  His  posi- 
tion grew  stronger  when  Russia  finally  recognized  him  in  1896.  The 
price  for  recognition  was  the  conversion  of  Prince  Boris  to  Ortho- 
doxy from  Catholicism.  The  Russian  attitude  had  changed  for  two 
reasons:  Alexander  III  had  died  in  1894,  and  new  Turkish  mas- 
sacres had  signaled  a  collapse  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  that  would 
threaten  Russian  and  Bulgarian  interests  alike.  In  the  next  twenty 
years,  no  strong  politician  like  Stambolov  emerged,  and  Ferdinand 
was  able  to  accumulate  power  by  manipulating  factions.  Several  lib- 
eral and  conservative  parties,  the  descendants  of  the  two  preliberation

groups,  held  power  through  1912  in  a  parliamentary  system  that 
seldom  functioned  according  to  the  constitution.  The  Bulgarian 
Social  Democratic  Party  took  its  place  in  the  new  political  order, 
advocating  class  struggle,  recruiting  members  from  the  working 
class,  and  organizing  strikes. 

After  relations  with  Russia  had  been  repaired,  Bulgaria's  in- 
ternational position  stabilized,  allowing  the  economy  to  continue 
growing  undisturbed  until  1912.  In  this  period,  the  government 
continued  active  intervention  in  agriculture  and  industry;  it  pro- 
moted new  agricultural  methods  that  improved  the  yield  from  fer- 
tile lands  still  being  reclaimed  from  the  Turks  in  1900.  Bulgarian 
economic  growth  continued  because  of  a  combination  of  factors: 
borrowing  from  West  European  industrial  countries,  a  strong  bank- 
ing system,  and  a  generally  sound  investment  policy.  Between  1887 
and  1911,  the  number  of  industrial  plants  grew  from  36  to  345. 
But  the  government's  financial  policy  greatly  increased  the  national 
debt,  which  by  1911  was  three  times  the  national  budget  and  re- 
quired 20  percent  of  the  budget  for  interest  payment.  New  land 
taxes  and  grain  tithes  were  levied  in  the  1890s,  leading  to  peasant 
revolts.  In  1899  the  Bulgarian  Agrarian  Union  was  founded,  the 
result  of  a  decade  of  growing  rural  discontent  and  resentment 
against  the  intellectual  and  governing  class.  Within  two  years,  the 
union  had  evolved  into  an  official  party,  the  Bulgarian  Agrarian 
National  Union  (BANU),  which  was  accepted  by  most  Bulgarian 
peasants  as  truly  representing  their  interests.  Soon,  Bulgarian  poli- 
ticians viewed  BANU  as  the  most  potent  political  group  in  the 
country. 

The  Macedonian  Issue 

Macedonian  unrest  continued  into  the  twentieth  century.  Be- 
tween 1894  and  1896,  the  government  of  Konstantin  Stoilov 
reversed  Stambolov's  policy  of  controlling  Macedonian  extremists. 
When  he  sought  to  negotiate  with  the  Turks  for  territorial  conces- 
sions in  Macedonia  at  the  end  of  the  century,  Stoilov  found  that 
he  could  not  control  IMRO.  By  1900  that  group,  which  advocated 
Macedonian  autonomy  over  the  standard  Bulgarian  policy  goal  of 
annexation,  had  gained  control  of  the  Macedonian  liberation  move- 
ment inside  Bulgaria.  Russia  and  the  Western  powers  now  held 
Ferdinand  responsible  for  all  disruptions  in  Macedonia,  causing 
suspicion  of  all  Bulgarian  activity  in  the  Balkans.  Greece  and  Ser- 
bia also  laid  claim  to  parts  of  Macedonia,  giving  them  vital  interests 
in  the  activities  of  IMRO  as  well.  In  1902  Russia  and  Austria- 
Hungary  forced  Serbia  and  Bulgaria  to  cut  all  ties  with  IMRO. 


27 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

In  1903  Macedonian  liberation  forces  staged  a  widespread  revolt, 
the  Ilinden-Preobrazhensko  Uprising.  Despite  strong  public  sup- 
port for  the  Macedonian  cause,  Bulgaria  sent  no  help,  and  the  Turks 
again  suppressed  opposition  with  great  violence.  Large  numbers 
of  refugees  now  entered  Bulgaria  from  Macedonia. 

In  the  next  four  years,  Austria-Hungary  and  Russia  sought  a 
formula  by  which  to  administer  Macedonia  in  a  way  satisfactory 
to  Bulgarian,  Serbian,  and  Greek  interests  and  approved  by  Con- 
stantinople. Although  nominal  agreement  was  reached  in  1905,  Ser- 
bian, Greek,  and  Bulgarian  sympathizers  clashed  in  Macedonia 
in  1906  and  1907.  After  the  death  of  its  leader  Gotse  Delchev  in 
the  1903  uprising,  IMRO's  influence  decreased.  Bulgarian  public 
sympathy  for  the  Macedonian  cause  also  diminished,  and  by  1905 
the  government's  attention  turned  to  internal  matters. 

Inspired  by  the  1905  uprisings  in  Russia,  a  series  of  riots  and 
demonstrations  between  1905  and  1908  were  a  reaction  by  work- 
ers, the  poor,  and  some  of  the  intelligentsia  to  several  issues:  domes- 
tic repression,  government  corruption,  and  the  handling  of  the 
Macedonian  issue.  In  1906  anti-Greek  riots  and  destruction  of 
Greek  property  were  ignited  in  some  parts  of  Bulgaria  by  Greek 
claims  to  Macedonia.  In  spite  of  heavy  fines  and  prohibitions  against 
striking,  a  rail  strike  occurred  in  1906,  and  in  1907  Prime  Minister 
Nikola  Petkov  was  assassinated. 

Full  Independence 

The  strikes  and  demonstrations  remained  isolated  and  had  little 
practical  effect,  so  Ferdinand  remained  in  firm  control.  In  1908 
the  Young  Turks,  an  energetic  new  generation  of  reformers,  gained 
power  in  the  Ottoman  Empire.  Their  ascendancy  temporarily  re- 
stored the  international  self-confidence  of  the  empire  and  threat- 
ened a  renewed  Turkish  influence  in  the  Balkans.  To  protect  the 
territory  it  occupied  in  Bosnia  and  Hercegovina,  Austria-Hungary 
annexed  those  regions.  While  the  Turks  were  preoccupied  with  that 
situation,  Ferdinand  nationalized  the  Bulgarian  section  of  his  main 
international  rail  line  and  declared  himself  tsar  of  a  fully  inde- 
pendent Bulgaria.  The  Western  powers,  again  seeing  the  threat 
of  Ottoman  collapse,  were  appeased  by  Russian-arranged  finan- 
cial compromises  that  saved  face  for  the  Turks.  But  tension  be- 
tween Bulgaria  and  Turkey  increased  dramatically  after  Ferdinand's 
declaration. 

The  arbitrary  nature  of  Ferdinand's  declaration  also  brought  loud 
criticism  from  democratic-minded  Bulgarian  factions.  Nonetheless, 
the  grand  national  assembly  held  at  Turnovo  in  1911  to  incorporate 


28

the  terms  of  independence  into  the  constitution,  ratified  Ferdinand's 
title  and  expanded  his  power  in  conducting  foreign  affairs. 

By  1911  the  BANU,  led  by  Aleksandur  Stamboliiski,  had  be- 
come the  largest  and  most  vocal  opposition  faction.  Although  the 
BANU  never  gained  more  than  15  percent  of  a  national  vote  be- 
fore World  War  I,  the  party  had  a  large,  unified  following  in  the 
peasant  class  victimized  by  poor  harvests,  usurious  interest  rates, 
and  high  taxes.  Stamboliiski 's  political  philosophy  put  the  peasant 
and  rural  life  ahead  of  all  other  classes  and  lifestyles.  Hating 
bureaucrats  and  urban  institutions,  he  proposed  a  government  that 
would  provide  representation  by  profession  rather  than  party,  to 
ensure  a  permanent  peasant  majority.  His  goal  was  to  establish 
a  peasant  republic  that  would  replace  the  conventional  parliamen- 
tary apparatus  established  at  Turnovo.  The  BANU  was  a  controver- 
sial and  powerful  force  in  Bulgarian  politics  for  the  next  two  decades. 

The  Balkan  Wars  and  World  War  I 

Full  independence  made  Bulgaria  a  more  aggressive  party  in  the 
complex  of  Balkan  politics.  The  end  of  Ottoman  occupation  height- 
ened territorial  ambitions  that  involved  Bulgaria  and  its  neighbors 
in  three  wars  within  four  years. 

The  First  Balkan  War 

The  period  from  1908  to  1912  was  one  of  colliding  interests  in 
the  Balkans  and  collapse  of  the  system  created  by  the  Treaty  of 
Berlin.  Beginning  in  1908,  the  Young  Turks  attempted  to  consoli- 
date Turkish  influence  in  the  Balkans  while  ensuring  equality  for 
all  nationalities  in  their  empire.  Rivals  Italy  and  Austria  threatened 
to  intervene  on  behalf  of  an  Albanian  revolt  against  the  Turks  in 
1909.  Russia  then  urged  a  Bulgarian-Serbian  alliance  to  keep  such 
foreign  powers  at  bay  and  ensure  continued  Slavic  control  in  the 
region.  In  1912,  after  long  negotiations,  Serbia  and  Bulgaria 
reached  temporary  agreement  on  the  disposition  of  Macedonia, 
the  chief  issue  dividing  them.  Subsequent  agreements  by  Greece 
with  Serbia,  Bulgaria,  and  Montenegro  completed  the  Balkan 
League — an  uneasy  alliance  designed  by  Russia  to  finally  push  the 
Turks  out  of  Europe  and  curtail  great-power  meddling  in  the 
Balkans.  The  First  Balkan  War,  which  began  in  October  1912, 
coincided  with  Italy's  campaign  to  liberate  Tripoli  from  the  Turks. 
Bulgarian  forces  moved  quickly  across  Ottoman  Europe,  driving 
the  Turks  out  of  Thrace.  However,  the  Bulgarians  then  over- 
extended their  position  by  a  fruitless  attack  toward  Constantinople. 
In  the  peace  negotiations  that  followed,  Bulgaria  regained  Thrace,

but  the  fragile  alliance  against  the  Turks  collapsed  over  the  un- 
resolved issue  of  Macedonia. 

The  Second  Balkan  War 

The  final  removal  of  the  Turks  from  Europe  posed  the  problem 
of  dividing  Ottoman  territory  and  heightened  the  worries  of  the 
European  great  powers  about  balancing  influence  in  that  strategic 
region.  Disagreement  about  the  disposition  of  Macedonia  quickly 
rearranged  the  alliances  of  the  First  Balkan  War  and  ignited  a  Sec- 
ond Balkan  War  in  1913.  The  Treaty  of  London  that  had  ended 
the  first  war  stipulated  only  that  the  Balkan  powers  resolve  exist- 
ing claims  among  themselves.  The  Bulgarians,  having  had  the 
greatest  military  success,  demanded  compensation  on  that  basis; 
the  Serbs  and  Greeks  demanded  adjustment  of  the  1912  treaty  of 
alliance  to  ensure  a  balance  of  Balkan  powers;  and  the  Romani- 
ans demanded  territorial  reward  for  their  neutral  position  in  the 
first  war.  Even  before  the  First  Balkan  War  ended,  a  strong  fac- 
tion in  Bulgaria  had  demanded  war  against  Serbia  to  preserve  Bul- 
garia's  claim  to  Macedonia.  Ferdinand  sided  with  that  faction  in 
1913,  and  Bulgaria  attacked  Serbia.  Turkey,  Greece,  and  Roma- 
nia then  declared  war  on  Bulgaria  because  they  all  feared  Bulgar- 
ian domination  of  the  Balkans  if  Macedonia  were  not  partitioned. 
Because  most  Bulgarian  forces  were  on  the  Serbian  frontier,  Tur- 
kish and  Romanian  troops  easily  occupied  Bulgarian  territory  by 
mid- 1913,  and  Bulgaria  was  defeated.  The  Treaty  of  Bucharest 
(1913)  allowed  Bulgaria  to  retain  only  very  small  parts  of  Macedonia 
and  Thrace;  Greece  and  Serbia  divided  the  rest,  humiliating  Bul- 
garian territorial  claims  and  canceling  the  gains  of  the  First  Balkan 
War  (see  fig.  6).  This  loss  further  inflamed  Bulgarian  nationalism, 
especially  when  Bulgarians  in  Serbian  and  Greek  Macedonia  were 
subjected  to  extreme  hardship  after  the  new  partition.  At  this  point, 
Russia,  whose  warnings  Bulgaria  had  defied  by  attacking  Serbia, 
shifted  its  support  to  the  Serbs  as  its  Balkan  counterbalance  against 
Austro-Hungarian  claims. 

World  War  I 

The  settlement  of  the  Second  Balkan  War  had  also  inflamed  Bos- 
nian nationalism.  In  1914  that  movement  ignited  an  Austrian- 
Serbian  conflict  that  escalated  into  world  war  when  the  European 
alliances  of  those  countries  went  into  effect. 

Prewar  Bulgarian  Politics 

Supported  by  Ferdinand,  the  government  of  Prime  Minister  Vasil 
Radoslavov  declared  neutrality  to  assess  the  possible  outcome  of 


30 


Historical  Setting 


the  alliances  and  Bulgaria's  position  relative  to  the  Entente  (Rus- 
sia, France,  and  Britain)  and  the  Central  Powers  (Austria-Hungary 
and  Germany).  From  the  beginning,  both  sides  exerted  strong  pres- 
sure and  made  territorial  offers  to  lure  Bulgaria  into  an  alliance. 
Ferdinand  and  his  diplomats  hedged,  waiting  for  a  decisive  mili- 
tary shift  in  one  direction  or  the  other.  The  Radoslavov  govern- 
ment favored  the  German  side,  the  major  opposition  parties  favored 
the  Entente,  and  the  agrarians  and  socialists  opposed  all  involve- 
ment. By  mid- 191 5  the  Central  Powers  gained  control  on  the  Rus- 
sian and  Turkish  fronts  and  were  thus  able  to  improve  their 
territorial  offer  to  Bulgaria.  Now  victory  would  yield  part  of  Tur- 
kish Thrace,  substantial  territory  in  Macedonia,  and  monetary  com- 
pensation for  war  expenses.  In  October  1915,  Bulgaria  made  a 
secret  treaty  with  the  Central  Powers  and  invaded  Serbia  and 
Macedonia. 

Early  Successes 

Catching  the  Entente  by  surprise,  Bulgarian  forces  pushed  the 
Serbs  out  of  Macedonia  and  into  Albania  and  occupied  part  of 
Greek  Macedonia  by  mid-1916.  British,  French,  and  Serbian  troops 
landed  at  Salonika  and  stopped  the  Bulgarian  advance,  but  the 
Entente's  holding  operation  in  Greece  turned  into  a  war  of  attri- 
tion lasting  from  late  1916  well  into  1917.  This  stalemate  diverted 
500,000  Entente  troops  from  other  fronts.  Meanwhile,  Romania 
had  entered  the  war  on  the  Entente  side  in  1916.  Bulgarian  and 
German  forces  pushed  the  poorly  prepared  Romanians  northward 
and  took  Bucharest  in  December  1916.  The  Bulgarians  then  faced 
Russia  on  a  new  front  in  Moldavia  (the  part  of  Romania  border- 
ing Russia),  but  little  action  took  place  there. 

Stalemate  and  Demoralization 

Once  the  Bulgarian  advance  into  Romania  and  Greece  halted, 
conditions  at  the  front  deteriorated  rapidly  and  political  support 
for  the  war  eroded.  By  1916  poor  allocation  of  supplies  created  short- 
ages for  both  civilians  and  soldiers,  and  a  series  of  government  re- 
organizations provided  no  relief.  By  1917  the  military  stalemate 
and  poor  living  conditions  combined  with  news  of  revolution  in 
Russia  to  stir  large-scale  unrest  in  Bulgarian  society.  The  agrari- 
ans and  socialist  workers  intensified  their  antiwar  campaigns,  and 
soldiers'  committees  formed  in  army  units.  Bolshevik  antiwar 
propaganda  was  widely  distributed  in  Bulgaria,  and  Russian  and 
Bulgarian  soldiers  began  fraternizing  along  the  Moldavian  front. 
In  December  1917,  Dimitur  Blagoev,  founder  and  head  of  the  So- 
cial Democratic  Party,  led  a  meeting  of  10,000  in  Sofia,  demanding

an  end  to  the  war  and  overthrow  of  the  Bulgarian  government. 
A  wave  of  unrest  and  riots,  including  a  "women's  revolt"  against 
food  and  clothing  shortages,  swept  through  the  country  in  1918. 

The  government  position  weakened  further  when  the  Treaty  of 
Bucharest,  which  divided  the  territory  of  defeated  Romania  among 
the  central  powers,  left  part  of  the  disputed  Romanian  territory 
of  Dobruja  outside  Bulgarian  control.  Having  failed  to  secure  even 
the  least  important  territory  promised  by  its  war  policy,  the  Rado- 
slavov  government  resigned  in  June  1918.  The  newr  prime  minister, 
Aleksandur  Malinov,  tried  to  unite  the  country  by  appointing  the 
agrarian  Aleksandur  Stambolhski  to  his  cabinet.  But  Malinov  had 
vowed  to  fight,  and  the  BANU  leader  refused  the  post  as  long  as 
Bulgaria  remained  in  the  war.  By  September  the  Bulgarian  army 
was  thoroughly  demoralized  by  antiwar  propaganda  and  harsh  con- 
ditions. A  batde  with  the  British  and  French  at  Dobro  Pole  brought 


32 


Historical  Setting 


total  retreat,  and  in  ten  days  Entente  forces  entered  Bulgaria.  On 
September  29,  the  Bulgarians  signed  an  armistice  and  left  the  war. 

Capitulation  and  Settlement 

The  retreat  from  Dobro  Pole  brought  a  soldier  revolt  that  was 
crushed  by  German  troops  near  Sofia.  But  the  parties  in  power 
forced  Ferdinand  to  abdicate  at  the  end  of  September  because  they 
feared  full-scale  revolution  and  blamed  the  tsar  for  the  country's 
chaotic  state.  Ferdinand's  son  Boris  was  named  tsar,  becoming  Boris 
III.  The  immediate  cause  of  social  upheaval  ended  with  the  arm- 
istice, but  shortages  and  discontent  with  the  Bulgarian  government 
continued.  An  ineffective  coalition  government  ruled  for  the  next 
year,  then  a  general  election  was  called.  Meanwhile,  Bulgaria  was 
again  left  far  short  of  the  territorial  goals  for  which  it  had  declared 
war.  In  the  Treaty  of  Neuilly-sur-Seine  (November  1919),  Thrace 
was  awarded  to  Greece,  depriving  Bulgaria  of  access  to  the  Aegean 
Sea.  The  newly  formed  Kingdom  of  the  Serbs,  Croats,  and  Slo- 
venes took  Macedonian  territory  adjoining  its  eastern  border,  and 
Southern  Dobruja  went  to  Romania  (see  fig.  7). 

The  treaty  limited  the  postwar  Bulgarian  Army  to  a  small  volun- 
teer force;  Yugoslavia,  Romania,  and  Greece  were  to  receive  repa- 
rations in  industrial  and  agricultural  goods;  and  the  victorious  Allies 
were  to  receive  monetary  reparations  for  the  next  thirty-seven  years. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  payment  schedule  was  significantly  im- 
proved in  1923,  and  Bulgaria's  loss  of  14,100  square  kilometers 
was  much  less  than  the  territorial  losses  of  its  wartime  allies.  Na- 
tionalist resentment  and  frustration  grew  even  stronger  because 
of  this  outcome,  however,  and  Bulgaria  remained  close  to  Germany 
throughout  the  interwar  period. 

The  Interwar  Period 

The  period  after  World  War  I  was  one  of  uneasy  political  coali- 
tions, slow  economic  growth,  and  continued  appearance  of  the 
Macedonia  problem.  Although  social  unrest  remained  at  a  high 
level,  Boris  kept  firm  control  of  his  government  as  World  War  II 
approached. 

Stambolirski  and  Agrarian  Reform 

The  1919  election  reflected  massive  public  dissatisfaction  with 
the  war  reparations,  inflation,  and  rising  taxes  that  prolonged  the 
chaotic  living  conditions  of  the  war.  The  socialist  and  agrarian  par- 
ties tightened  their  organizations  and  increased  membership.  The 
left  wing  of  the  Bulgarian  Workers'  Socialist-Democratic  Party 
(BWSDP)  numbered  only  25,000  in  1919,  and  the  BANU  emerged

as  the  largest  party  in  the  country.  The  BANU  received  28  percent 
of  the  1919  vote,  giving  it  a  plurality  but  not  a  majority  in  the  new 
subranie.  Stamboliiski  sought  to  include  the  Bulgarian  Communist 
Party  (BCP) — which  had  finished  second  in  the  election — and  the 
BWSDP  in  a  coalition  government.  (The  BCP  and  the  BWSDP 
were  the  two  factions  of  the  Bulgarian  communist  movement  that 
had  sprung  from  the  Social  Democratic  Party  founded  in  1891 ;  they 
would  remain  separate  until  the  former  was  disbanded  after  World 
War  II.)  Stamboliiski  could  not  permit  the  two  factions  the  control 
they  desired,  however,  so  they  refused  participation. 

The  postwar  governing  coalition  thus  included  only  factions  to 
Stamboliiski 's  right.  The  first  major  test  for  the  Stamboliiski  govern- 
ment was  a  transport  strike  that  lasted  from  December  1919  until 
February  1920.  Fomented  by  the  communists  and  the  social 
democrats  and  joined  by  urban  workers  and  middle-class  Bulgari- 
ans, the  striker  protests  were  quelled  harshly  by  the  army  and  the 


34 


Historical  Setting 


Orange  Guard,  a  quasi-military  force  that  Stamboliiski  formed  to 
counter  mass  demonstrations  by  the  parties  of  the  left. 

Suppression  of  the  strike,  mobilization  of  the  peasant  vote,  and 
intimidation  at  the  polls  gave  the  BANU  enough  support  to  win 
the  parliamentary  election  of  1920  over  the  communists  and  form 
a  non-coalition  government.  Tsar  Boris  and  much  of  the  Bulgar- 
ian middle  class  preferred  the  agrarians  to  the  communists  and  social 
democrats,  whom  they  feared  much  more.  Stamboliiski  immedi- 
ately began  drastic  economic  reforms.  He  abolished  the  merchants' 
trade  monopoly  on  grain,  replacing  it  with  a  government  consor- 
tium; broke  up  large  urban  and  rural  landholdings  and  sold  the 
surplus  to  the  poor;  enacted  an  obligatory  labor  law  to  ease  the 
postwar  labor  shortage;  introduced  a  progressive  income  tax;  and 
made  secondary  schooling  compulsory.  All  aspects  of  the  radical 
reform  policy  aimed  at  ridding  society  of  "harmful"  classes  of  so- 
ciety such  as  lawyers,  usurers,  and  merchants,  distributing  capital 
and  obligations  more  evenly  through  society,  and  raising  the  liv- 
ing standards  of  the  landless  and  poor  peasants. 

In  foreign  policy,  Stamboliiski  officially  abandoned  Bulgaria's 
territorial  claims,  which  he  associated  with  a  standing  army,  monar- 
chy, large  government  expenditures,  and  other  prewar  phenome- 
na that  the  agrarians  deemed  anachronistic.  After  the  war,  no  major 
power  was  available  to  protect  Bulgarian  interests  in  the  Balkans. 
For  this  reason,  the  traditional  approach  to  foreign  policy  was  dis- 
carded in  favor  of  rapprochement  with  all  European  powers  and 
the  new  government  of  Kemal  Atatiirk  in  Turkey,  membership 
in  the  League  of  Nations  (see  Glossary),  and  friendship  with  the 
new  Kingdom  of  the  Serbs,  Croats,  and  Slovenes  (later  the  King- 
dom of  Yugoslavia).  Relations  with  Turkey  were  greatly  improved 
by  Bulgarian  support  of  Atatiirk' s  revolutionary  Turkish  Repub- 
lic in  1920. 

Reconciliation  with  Yugoslavia  was  a  necessary  step  toward 
Stamboliiski 's  ultimate  goal  of  a  multiethnic  Balkan  peasant  fed- 
eration. Improved  Yugoslav  relations  required  a  crackdown  on  the 
powerful  Macedonian  extremist  movement.  Accordingly,  Stam- 
boliiski began  a  two-year  program  of  harsh  suppression  of  IMRO 
in  1921;  in  1923  Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  agreed  at  the  Nis  Con- 
vention to  cooperate  in  controlling  extremists. 

The  Fall  of  Stamboliiski 

Led  by  a  large  Macedonian  group  in  Sofia,  the  strong  nation- 
alist elements  remaining  in  Bulgaria  found  the  new  pacifist  policy 
alarming.  The  urban  working  class,  unaided  by  agrarian  reforms, 
gravitated  to  the  communists  or  the  socialist  workers.  Inflation  and 


35 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

industrial  exploitation  continued.  Many  of  Stamboliiski's  subor- 
dinates inflamed  social  tensions  by  taking  very  dogmatic  positions 
in  favor  of  peasant  rights.  The  Bulgarian  right,  silent  since  the  war, 
reorganized  into  a  confederation  called  the  National  Alliance.  Stam- 
boliiski's Orange  Guard  jailed  the  leaders  of  that  group  in  1922, 
temporarily  stopping  its  momentum.  Meanwhile,  in  late  1922  and 
early  1923,  Macedonian  nationalists  occupied  Kiustendil  along  the 
Yugoslav  border  and  attacked  government  figures  to  protest  rap- 
prochement with  Yugoslavia  and  Greece.  Stamboliiski  responded 
with  mass  arrests,  an  accelerated  campaign  against  IMRO  ter- 
rorism, a  purge  of  his  own  fragmented  and  notoriously  corrupt 
party,  and  a  new  parliamentary  election.  These  dictatorial  meas- 
ures united  the  agrarians'  various  opponents  (IMRO,  the  National 
Alliance,  army  factions,  and  the  social  democrats)  into  a  coalition 
led  by  Aleksandur  Tsankov.  The  communists  remained  outside 
the  group.  Bulgaria's  Western  creditors  would  not  protect  a  govern- 
ment that  had  rejected  their  reparations  policy.  In  June  1923,  Stam- 
boliiski was  brutally  assassinated  by  IMRO  agents,  and  the 
conspirators  shortly  took  control  of  the  entire  country  with  only 
scattered  and  ineffectual  agrarian  resistance. 

The  Tsankov  and  Liapchev  Governments 

Tsankov  formed  a  new  government,  which  Boris  III  quickly 
approved.  An  uprising  by  the  communists,  who  had  hoped  the  two 
major  coalition  factions  would  destroy  each  other,  was  easily 
suppressed  in  September  1923.  Nonetheless,  dominated  by  the 
Macedonian  freedom  factions  and  the  National  Alliance,  Tsankov' s 
government  failed  to  restore  order.  When  Tsankov  outlawed  the 
Bulgarian  Communist  Party  in  1924,  the  militant  communists  led 
by  exiles  Georgi  Dimitrov  and  Vasil  Kolarov  became  dominant 
in  that  organization.  The  first  response  to  this  change  was  the  bomb- 
ing of  Sveta  Nedelia  Cathedral  in  Sofia  while  the  tsar  was  present 
in  1925,  killing  over  100.  This  attack  brought  a  new  government 
reign  of  terror  against  the  communists  and  the  agrarians.  Disunited 
Macedonian  factions  also  continued  terrorist  attacks  from  their  vir- 
tually separate  state  at  Petrich,  causing  alarm  in  Western  Europe. 
In  1926  Tsankov  was  replaced  by  Andrei  Liapchev,  a  Macedonian 
who  remained  prime  minister  for  five  years. 

Liapchev  generally  was  more  lenient  toward  political  opposition 
than  Tsankov;  the  communists  resurfaced  in  1927  under  cover  of 
the  labor-based  Bulgarian  Workers'  Party,  and  an  Independent 
Workers'  Trade  Union  became  the  center  of  political  activity  by 
labor.  IMRO  also  had  much  more  latitude  under  the  Macedonian 
prime  minister;  this  meant  that  political  assassinations  and  terrorism 


36 


Historical  Setting 


continued  unabated.  IMRO  raids  into  Yugoslavia  ended  Bulgar- 
ian rapprochement  with  that  country,  and  the  Macedonians 
demanded  preferential  economic  treatment  under  Liapchev.  But 
compared  with  the  years  preceding,  the  late  1920s  brought  rela- 
tive political  stability  to  Bulgaria.  Liapchev  led  a  conservative 
majority  in  the  subranie  and  had  the  confidence  of  Boris.  The  press 
was  relatively  free,  and  educational  and  judicial  institutions  func- 
tioned independently.  Industrial  and  agricultural  output  finally  ex- 
ceeded prewar  levels,  and  foreign  investment  increased.  But  even 
after  substantial  reduction,  Bulgaria's  reparations  payments  were 
20  percent  of  her  budget  in  1928,  and  the  return  to  the  gold  stan- 
dard that  year  weakened  the  economy  one  year  before  the  onset 
of  world  depression. 

In  foreign  policy,  Liapchev  tried  unsuccessfully  to  improve  British 
and  French  World  War  I  reparation  terms  and  bring  Bulgaria  out 
of  its  postwar  diplomatic  isolation.  The  country  had  already  im- 
proved its  international  image  by  participating  enthusiastically  in 
the  League  of  Nations,  which  reciprocated  by  forcing  Greek  inva- 
sion troops  to  leave  southern  Bulgaria  in  1926.  Boris  made  two 
European  tours  in  the  late  1920s  to  strengthen  diplomatic  ties. 

In  the  late  1920s,  the  Macedonian  independence  movement  split 
over  the  ultimate  goal  of  its  activity.  The  supremacist  faction  sought 
incorporation  of  all  Macedonian  territory  into  Bulgaria,  while  the 
federalist  faction  (including  the  IMRO  terrorists)  sought  an  au- 
tonomous Macedonia  that  could  join  Bulgaria  or  Yugoslavia  in  a 
protective  alliance  if  necessary.  Violence  between  the  two  groups 
reinforced  a  growing  public  impression  that  the  Liapchev  govern- 
ment was  unstable. 

The  Crises  of  the  1930s 

Political  Disorder  and  Diplomatic  Isolation 

The  world  economic  crisis  that  began  in  1929  devastated  the  Bul- 
garian economy.  The  social  tensions  of  the  1920s  were  exacerbated 
when  200,000  workers  lost  their  jobs,  prices  fell  by  50  percent, 
dozens  of  companies  went  bankrupt,  and  per  capita  income  among 
peasants  was  halved  between  1929  and  1933.  A  wave  of  strikes  hit 
Bulgaria  in  1930-31,  and  in  1931  the  Liapchev  government  was 
defeated  in  what  would  be  the  last  open  election  with  proportional 
representation  of  parliamentary  seats. 

Liapchev' s  coalition  fell  apart,  his  defeat  hastened  by  the  rise 
of  a  supra-party  organization,  Zveno — a  small  coalition  with  con- 
nections to  most  of  the  major  Bulgarian  parties  and  to  fascist  Italy. 
The  main  goal  of  Zveno  was  to  consolidate  and  reform  existing 


37 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

political  institutions  so  that  state  power  could  be  exerted  directly 
to  promote  economic  growth.  After  1931  Zveno  used  the  economic 
crisis  to  instill  this  idea  in  the  Bulgarian  political  system.  In  1931 
the  new  government  coalition,  the  People's  Bloc,  readmitted  the 
BANU  in  an  attempt  to  reunite  Bulgarian  factions.  But  the  BANU 
had  become  factionalized  and  isolated;  its  representatives  in  the 
coalition  largely  pursued  political  spoils  rather  than  the  interests 
of  their  peasant  constituency. 

Meanwhile,  the  Macedonian  situation  in  the  early  1930s  blocked 
further  attempts  to  heal  Balkan  disputes.  Four  Balkan  conferences 
were  held  to  address  the  Macedonian  problem;  but  Bulgaria,  fearing 
IMRO  reprisals,  steadfastly  refused  to  drop  territorial  demands 
in  Macedonia  or  quell  Macedonian  terrorist  activities  in  the  region. 
Such  activities  had  continued  under  all  Bulgaria's  postwar  govern- 
ments, but  the  People's  Bloc  was  especially  inept  in  controlling 
them.  The  situation  eventually  led  to  the  Balkan  Entente  of  1934, 
by  which  Yugoslavia,  Greece,  Turkey,  and  Romania  pledged  to 
honor  existing  borders  in  the  Balkans.  For  Bulgaria  the  isolation 
inflicted  by  this  pact  was  a  serious  diplomatic  setback  in  southeastern 
Europe. 

In  1932  Aleksandur  Tsankov  founded  Bulgaria's  first  serious  fas- 
cist party,  the  National  Socialist  Movement,  which  imitated  the 
methods  of  Hitler's  Nazi  party.  Although  Tsankov' s  party  never 
attracted  a  large  following,  its  activities  added  to  the  chaotic  frag- 
mentation that  forced  the  People's  Bloc  from  power  in  May  1934. 

Fragmentation  of  the  People's  Bloc  coalition  and  the  threat  posed 
by  the  Balkan  Entente  led  Zveno  and  various  military  factions  to 
stage  a  right-wing  coup.  Under  the  leadership  of  Colonel  Damian 
Velchev  and  Kimon  Georgiev,  the  new  prime  minister,  the  new 
government  began  taking  dictatorial  measures.  The  government 
also  took  immediate  steps  to  improve  relations  with  Yugoslavia  and 
made  overtures  to  Britain  and  France.  Diplomatic  relations  resumed 
with  the  Soviet  Union  in  1934,  despite  a  marked  increase  in  inter- 
nal repression  of  communists  and  suspected  communists.  A  con- 
certed drive  by  the  Bulgarian  military  against  IMRO  permanently 
reduced  the  power  of  that  organization,  which  by  1934  had  ex- 
hausted most  of  its  support  in  Bulgarian  society.  The  fact  that  spon- 
sorship of  Balkan  terrorism  finally  ceased  to  hinder  Bulgarian 
foreign  policy  was  the  single  lasting  contribution  of  the  Velchev- 
Georgiev  government. 

The  Zveno  group  abolished  all  political  parties,  citing  the  failure 
of  such  institutions  to  provide  national  leadership.  The  press  was 
muzzled.  Henceforward  the  state  would  be  authoritarian  and  cen- 
tralized; the  subranie  would  represent  not  political  parties  but  the 


38

classes  of  society:  peasants,  workers,  artisans,  merchants,  the  in- 
telligentsia, bureaucrats,  and  professionals.  Velchev  also  proposed 
a  wide-ranging  program  of  social  and  technical  modernization.  In 
1935,  however,  Tsar  Boris  III  became  an  active  political  force  in 
Bulgaria  for  the  first  time.  Disillusioned  by  the  results  of  the  1934 
coup,  Boris  took  action  to  regain  his  power,  which  the  new  regime 
had  also  curtailed.  Boris  used  military  and  civilian  factions  alarmed 
by  the  new  authoritarianism  to  maneuver  the  Zveno  group  out  of 
power  and  declare  a  royal  dictatorship. 

The  Royal  Dictatorship 

In  the  years  following  1935,  Boris  relied  on  a  series  of  uncharis- 
matic  politicians  to  run  Bulgaria,  weaken  the  political  power  of 
Zveno  and  the  military,  and  keep  other  factions  such  as  the  BANU, 
the  communists,  and  the  national  socialists  from  forming  alliances 
against  him.  Boris  chose  not  to  restore  the  traditional  political 
supremacy  of  the  subranie  and  ignored  demands  by  many  public 
figures  to  write  a  new  Bulgarian  constitution.  In  1936  a  broad  coa- 
lition, the  People's  Constitutional  Bloc,  brought  together  nearly 
all  leftist  and  centrist  factions  in  a  nominal  opposition  that  had  the 
blessing  of  the  tsar.  Boris  delayed  holding  a  national  election  until 
1938.  At  that  time,  only  individual  candidates  were  allowed  in  a 
carefully  controlled  election  procedure  that  excluded  party  candi- 
date lists.  Boris  claimed  that  domination  of  the  new  subranie  by  pro- 
government  representatives  justified  his  nonparty  system,  although 
the  People's  Constitutional  Bloc  seated  over  sixty  delegates.  Elec- 
tions in  the  next  two  years  were  strictly  limited  in  order  to  main- 
tain Boris's  control  over  his  parliament. 

The  Interwar  Economy 

In  the  years  between  the  world  wars,  Bulgarian  efforts  to  raise 
agricultural  and  industrial  standards  closer  to  those  of  Western  Eu- 
rope yielded  uneven  results.  Until  the  mid-1 930s,  political  unrest, 
steep  reparations  payments,  and  the  world  financial  crisis  stymied 
growth.  Reparations  payments  were  finally  canceled  in  1932, 
however,  and  the  stability  of  the  royal  dictatorship  brought  eco- 
nomic improvement  in  the  late  1930s.  Half  the  European  average 
in  1930,  per-capita  agricultural  production  improved  markedly 
when  government  control  forced  diversification,  new  methods,  and 
new  markets  into  the  system.  In  the  1930s,  a  75  percent  increase 
in  membership  of  agricultural  cooperatives  bolstered  the  financial 
stability  of  the  agricultural  sector,  particularly  benefiting  small  land- 
holders. The  most  notable  agricultural  trend  between  the  wars  was 


39 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


the  switch  to  industrial  crops,  especially  tobacco,  which  replaced 
wheat  as  Bulgaria's  top  agricultural  export.  The  predominance  of 
small  agricultural  plots  increased,  however;  in  1944  only  1  per- 
cent of  holdings  were  over  twenty  hectares  and  the  number  of  land- 
less families  had  decreased  (see  Agriculture,  ch.  3). 

In  the  1930s,  Germany  bought  a  huge  percentage  of  Bulgaria's 
agricultural  exports  (67.8  percent  in  1939),  reinforcing  economic 
dependency  by  selling  finished  industrial  products  for  nonconvert- 
ible  currency — a  distinct  advantage  for  the  Bulgarian  economy  and 
a  boon  to  the  Bulgarian  standard  of  living.  Boris  tried  to  balance 
German  trade  by  expanding  British  and  French  markets,  but  he 
found  little  interest  in  either  country.  Although  industry  remained 
distinctly  secondary  to  agriculture,  contributing  only  5.6  percent 
of  the  Bulgarian  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  in 
1938,  between  1929  and  1939  Bulgarian  industry  grew  at  an  aver- 
age rate  of  4.8  percent,  well  ahead  of  the  European  average  for 
the  period.  The  role  of  state-owned  enterprises  dwindled  steadily 
in  the  1930s;  by  1944,  only  coal  mines,  electrical  power,  railroads, 
and  banks  remained  predominantly  in  that  category.  While  large 
state-sponsored  enterprise  diminished,  small  private  industries 
flourished  in  the  1930s.  At  the  same  time,  Bulgarian  commerce 
became  largely  state-controlled  and  centralized  in  Sofia,  and  the 
social  and  political  dichotomy  between  rural  and  urban  Bulgaria 
was  even  sharper  as  World  War  II  began. 

Foreign  Policy  in  the  Late  1930s 

By  1939  Bulgaria  had  moved  inexorably  into  the  fascist  sphere 
of  Germany  and  Italy.  The  country  was  tied  to  the  former  for  eco- 
nomic reasons  and  because  Germany  promised  territorial  revision 
for  Bulgaria,  and  to  the  latter  because  Boris  was  married  to  the 
daughter  of  King  Victor  Emmanuel  III  of  Italy.  In  the  late  1930s, 
Bulgaria  continued  to  seek  rapprochement  with  Yugoslavia;  a 
friendship  treaty  was  signed  in  1937  and  a  renunciation  of  armed 
intervention  in  1938.  Germany's  takeover  of  the  Sudetenland  from 
Czechoslovakia  in  1938  ended  the  anti-German  Little  Entente  al- 
liance of  Yugoslavia,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Romania  and  pushed 
Yugoslavia  closer  to  Bulgaria.  When  World  War  II  began  in  Sep- 
tember 1939  with  the  German  invasion  of  Poland,  Bulgaria  declared 
neutrality,  but  this  position  was  inevitably  altered  by  big-power 
relationships. 

The  Nazi-Soviet  alliance  of  1939  improved  Bulgaria's  relations 
with  the  Soviet  Union,  which  had  remained  cool,  and  yielded  a 
Bulgarian-Soviet  commercial  treaty  in  1940.  The  pro- Western 


40 


Historical  Setting 


Bulgarian  Prime  Minister  Georgi  Kioseivanov  was  deposed  that 
year  in  favor  of  pro-German  Bogdan  Filov,  who  reduced  cultural 
ties  with  the  West  and  instituted  a  Nazi-type  youth  league.  Mean- 
while, Boris  strove  to  maintain  neutrality,  rejecting  Soviet  treaty 
offers  in  1939  and  1940.  Boris  also  rejected  membership  in  the 
Balkan  Entente  and  in  a  proposed  Turkish- Yugoslav-Bulgarian 
defense  pact  because  such  moves  would  anger  Italy,  Germany,  the 
Soviet  Union,  or  all  three.  Under  pressure  from  Hitler,  Romania 
ceded  southern  Dobruja  to  Bulgaria  by  the  Treaty  of  Craiova  in 
1940.  Needing  Bulgaria  to  anchor  its  Balkan  flank,  Germany  in- 
creased diplomatic  and  military  pressure  that  year.  The  massing 
of  German  troops  in  Romania  prior  to  Germany's  invading  Greece 
removed  all  remaining  flexibility;  aware  that  German  troops  would 
have  to  pass  through  Bulgaria  to  reach  Greece,  Bulgaria  signed 
the  Tripartite  Pact  with  Germany  and  Italy  in  March  1941. 

World  War  II 

As  in  the  case  of  World  War  I,  Bulgaria  fought  on  the  losing 
German  side  of  World  War  II  but  avoided  open  conflict  with  the 
Russian/Soviet  state.  Again  the  strains  of  war  eroded  public  sup- 
port and  forced  the  wartime  Bulgarian  government  out  of  office. 
But  World  War  II  heralded  a  drastic  political  change  and  a  long 
era  of  totalitarian  governance. 

The  Passive  Alliance 

Having  failed  to  remain  neutral,  Boris  entered  a  passive  alliance 
with  the  Axis  powers.  The  immediate  result  was  Bulgarian  occu- 
pation (but  not  accession)  of  Thrace  and  Macedonia,  which  Bul- 
garian troops  took  from  Greece  and  Yugoslavia,  respectively,  in 
April  1941.  Although  the  territorial  gains  were  initially  very  popular 
in  Bulgaria,  complications  soon  arose  in  the  occupied  territories. 
Autocratic  Bulgarian  administration  of  Thrace  and  Macedonia  was 
no  improvement  over  the  Greeks  and  the  Serbs;  expressions  of 
Macedonian  national  feeling  grew,  and  uprisings  occurred  in 
Thrace.  Meanwhile,  the  Germans  pressured  Bulgaria  to  support 
the  eastern  front  they  had  opened  by  invading  the  Soviet  Union 
in  June  1941.  Boris  resisted  the  pressure  because  he  believed  that 
Bulgarian  society  was  still  sufficiently  Russophile  to  overthrow  him 
if  he  declared  war.  After  the  Japanese  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor  ended 
United  States  neutrality,  Bulgaria  declared  war  on  Britain  and  the 
United  States,  but  continued  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Soviet 
Union  throughout  World  War  II.  Acceleration  of  domestic  war 
protests  by  the  BCP  in  1941  led  to  an  internal  crackdown  on 


41 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

dissident  activities  of  both  the  right  and  left.  In  the  next  three  years, 
thousands  of  Bulgarians  went  to  concentration  and  labor  camps. 

The  German  eastern  front  received  virtually  no  aid  from  Bul- 
garia, a  policy  justified  by  the  argument  that  Bulgarian  troops  had 
to  remain  at  home  to  defend  the  Balkans  against  Turkish  or  Allied 
attack.  Hitler  reluctantly  accepted  this  logic.  Boris's  stubborn 
resistance  to  committing  troops  was  very  popular  at  home,  where 
little  war  enthusiasm  developed.  Nazi  pressure  to  enforce  anti- 
Jewish  policies  also  had  little  support  in  Bulgarian  society.  Early 
in  the  war,  laws  were  passed  for  restriction  and  deportation  of  the 
50,000  Bulgarian  Jews,  but  enforcement  was  postponed  using  var- 
ious rationales.  No  program  of  mass  deportation  or  extermination 
was  conducted  in  Bulgaria. 

Wartime  Crisis 

In  the  summer  of  1943,  Boris  died  suddenly  at  age  49,  leaving 
a  three-man  regency  ruling  for  his  six-year-old  son,  Simeon.  Be- 
cause two  of  the  three  regents  were  figureheads,  Prime  Minister 
Bogdan  Filov,  the  third  regent,  became  de  facto  head  of  state  in 
this  makeshift  structure. 

The  events  of  1943  also  reversed  the  military  fortunes  of  the  Axis, 
causing  the  Bulgarian  government  to  reassess  its  international  po- 
sition. Late  in  1943,  the  Allies  delivered  the  first  of  many  disas- 
trous air  raids  on  Sofia.  The  heavy  damage  sent  a  clear  message 
that  Germany  could  not  protect  Bulgaria  from  Allied  punishment. 
Once  the  war  had  finally  intruded  into  Bulgarian  territory,  the 
winter  of  1943-44  brought  severe  social  and  economic  dislocation, 
hunger,  and  political  instability.  The  antiwar  factions,  especially 
the  communists,  used  urban  guerrilla  tactics  and  mass  demonstra- 
tions to  rebuild  the  organizational  support  lost  during  the  govern- 
ment crackdown  of  1941.  Partisan  activity,  never  as  widespread 
as  elsewhere  in  the  Balkans  during  the  war,  increased  in  1944  as 
the  Red  Army  moved  westward  against  the  retreating  Germans. 
To  support  antigovernment  partisan  groups,  in  1942  the  com- 
munists had  established  an  umbrella  Fatherland  Front  coalition 
backing  complete  neutrality,  withdrawal  from  occupied  territory, 
and  full  civil  liberties. 

Early  in  1944,  Bulgarian  officials  tried  to  achieve  peace  with  the 
Allies  and  the  Greek  and  Yugoslav  governments-in-exile.  Fearing 
the  German  forces  that  remained  in  Bulgaria,  Filov  could  not  simply 
surrender  unconditionally;  meanwhile,  the  Soviets  threatened  war 
if  Bulgaria  did  not  declare  itself  neutral  and  remove  all  German 
armaments  from  Bulgaria's  Black  Sea  coast.  Unable  to  gain  the 
protection  of  the  Allies,  who  had  now  bypassed  Bulgaria  in  their 


42 


Historical  Setting 


strategic  planning,  Bulgaria  was  caught  between  onrushing  Soviet 
forces  and  the  last  gambits  of  the  retreating  Nazis.  At  this  point, 
the  top  priority  of  Bulgarian  leaders  was  clearing  the  country  of 
German  occupiers  while  arranging  a  peace  with  the  Allies  that  would 
deprive  Soviet  forces  of  an  excuse  to  occupy  Bulgaria.  But  in  Sep- 
tember 1944,  the  Soviet  Union  unexpectedly  declared  war  on  Bul- 
garia, just  as  the  latter  was  about  to  withdraw  from  the  Axis  and 
declare  war  on  Germany. 

The  Soviet  Occupation 

When  Soviet  troops  arrived  in  Bulgaria,  they  were  welcomed 
by  the  populace  as  liberators  from  German  occupation.  On  Sep- 
tember 9,  1944,  five  days  after  the  Soviet  declaration  of  war,  a 
Fatherland  Front  coalition  deposed  the  temporary  government  in 
a  bloodless  coup.  Headed  by  Kimon  Georgiev  of  Zveno,  the  new 
administration  included  four  communists,  five  members  of  Zveno, 
two  social  democrats,  and  four  agrarians.  Although  in  the  minor- 
ity, the  communists  had  been  the  driving  force  in  forming  the  coa- 
lition as  an  underground  resistance  organization  in  1942.  The 
presence  of  the  Red  Army,  which  remained  in  Bulgaria  until  1947, 
strengthened  immeasurably  the  communist  position  in  dealing  with 
the  Allies  and  rival  factions  in  the  coalition.  At  this  point,  many 
noncommunist  Bulgarians  placed  their  hopes  on  renewed  relations 
with  the  Soviet  Union;  in  their  view,  both  Germany  and  the  Al- 
lies had  been  discredited  by  the  events  of  the  previous  fifteen  years. 
In  1945  the  Allies  themselves  expected  that  a  benign  Soviet  Union 
would  continue  the  wartime  alliance  through  the  period  of  post- 
war East  European  realignment. 

The  armistice  signed  by  Bulgaria  with  the  Soviet  Union  in  Oc- 
tober 1944  surrendered  all  wartime  territorial  gains  except  Southern 
Dobruja;  this  meant  that  Macedonia  returned  to  Yugoslavia  and 
Thrace  to  Greece.  The  peace  agreement  also  established  a  Soviet- 
dominated  Allied  Control  Commission  to  run  Bulgaria  until  con- 
clusion of  a  peace  treaty.  Overall  war  damage  to  Bulgaria  was 
moderate  compared  to  that  in  other  European  countries,  and  the 
Soviet  Union  demanded  no  reparations.  On  the  other  hand,  Bul- 
garia held  the  earliest  and  most  widespread  war  crimes  trial  in  post- 
war Europe;  almost  3,000  were  executed  as  war  criminals.  Bulgaria 
emerged  from  the  war  with  no  identifiable  political  structure;  the 
party  system  had  dissolved  in  1934,  replaced  by  the  pragmatic 
balancing  of  political  factions  in  Boris's  royal  dictatorship.  This 
condition  and  the  duration  of  the  war  in  Europe  eight  months  after 
Bulgaria's  surrender  gave  the  communists  ample  opportunity  to 
exploit  their  favorable  strategic  position  in  Bulgarian  politics.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Communist  Consolidation 

Initial  Maneuvering 

In  the  months  after  the  surrender,  the  communist  element  of 
the  Fatherland  Front  gradually  purged  opposition  figures,  exiled 
Tsar  Simeon  II,  and  rigged  elections  to  confirm  its  power.  In  De- 
cember 1945,  a  conference  of  foreign  ministers  of  the  United  States, 
Britain,  and  the  Soviet  Union  theoretically  allocated  two  seats  to 
the  newly  consolidated  opposition  BANU  in  the  Bulgarian  Coun- 
cil of  Ministers,  but  BANU  leaders  demanded  an  immediate  na- 
tional election  and  removal  of  communist  ministers.  Because  the 
BANU  was  now  a  unified  party  with  substantial  political  backing, 
these  demands  created  a  governmental  stalemate  with  the  Father- 
land Front  for  one  year.  In  a  national  referendum  in  September 

1946,  however,  an  overwhelming  majority  voted  to  abolish  the 
monarchy  and  proclaim  Bulgaria  a  people's  republic. 

The  next  month,  a  national  election  chose  a  subranie  to  draft  a 
new  constitution.  In  a  widely  questioned  process,  Fatherland  Front 
candidates  won  70  percent  of  the  votes.  At  this  point,  however, 
opposition  to  the  front  remained  strong,  as  communist  power  grew 
steadily.  In  early  1947,  opposition  to  aggressive  communist  tac- 
tics of  confiscation  and  collectivization  generated  a  loose  anticom- 
munist  coalition  within  and  outside  the  Fatherland  Front,  under 
BANU  leader  Nikola  Petkov.  The  power  struggle,  which  centered 
on  the  nature  of  the  new  constitution,  reached  its  peak  when  the 
Paris  peace  treaty  of  February  1947  required  that  Soviet  forces  and 
the  Allied  Control  Commission  leave  Bulgaria  immediately.  Once 
the  United  States  ratified  its  peace  treaty  with  Bulgaria  in  June 

1947,  the  communist-dominated  Fatherland  Front  arrested  and  exe- 
cuted Petkov  and  declared  Bulgaria  a  communist  state.  Petkov' s 
coalition  was  the  last  organized  domestic  opposition  to  communist 
rule  in  Bulgaria  until  1989. 

After  1946  Fatherland  Front  governments  maintained  nominal 
representation  of  noncommunist  parties.  But  those  parties  increas- 
ingly bowed  to  the  leadership  of  communist  Prime  Minister  Georgi 
Dimitrov,  who  had  been  appointed  in  1946.  After  two  years  of  post- 
war turmoil,  Bulgarian  political  and  economic  life  settled  into  the 
patterns  set  out  by  the  new  communist  constitution  (referred  to 
as  the  Dimitrov  Constitution)  ratified  in  December  1947.  Dimitrov 
argued  that  previous  Bulgarian  attempts  at  parliamentary  democ- 
racy were  disastrous  and  that  only  massive  social  and  economic 
restructuring  could  ensure  stability.  By  the  end  of  1947,  Bulgaria 
had  followed  the  other  East  European  states  in  refusing  reconstruc- 
tion aid  from  the  Marshall  Plan  (see  Glossary)  and  joining  the 


44

Communist  Information  Bureau  (Cominform — see  Glossary).  In 
1948  the  Fatherland  Front  was  reorganized  into  an  official  worker- 
peasant  alliance  in  accordance  with  Cominform  policy.  In  Decem- 
ber 1947,  BANU  leader  Georgi  Traikov  had  repudiated  traditional 
agrarian  programs;  after  a  thorough  purge  that  year,  his  party  re- 
tained only  nominal  independence  to  preserve  the  illusion  of  a  two- 
party  system.  All  other  opposition  parties  disbanded. 

The  Dimitrov  Constitution 

Dimitrov  guided  the  framing  of  the  1947  constitution  on  the 
model  of  the  1936  constitution  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The  Bulgar- 
ian document  guaranteed  citizens  equality  before  the  law;  freedom 
from  discrimination;  a  universal  welfare  system;  freedom  of  speech, 
the  press,  and  assembly;  and  inviolability  of  person,  domicile,  and 
correspondence.  But  those  rights  were  qualified  by  a  clause  pro- 
hibiting activity  that  would  jeopardize  the  attainments  of  the  na- 
tional revolution  of  September  9,  1944.  Citizens  were  guaranteed 
employment  but  required  to  work  in  a  socially  useful  capacity.  The 
constitution  also  prescribed  a  planned  national  economy.  Private 
property  was  allowed,  if  its  possession  was  not  "to  the  detriment 
of  the  public  good."  By  the  end  of  1947,  all  private  industry  had 


45 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

been  confiscated  and  financial  enterprises  nationalized  in  the  cul- 
mination of  a  gradual  government  takeover  that  began  in  1944. 
The  first  two-year  plan  for  economic  rehabilitation  began  in  1947 
(see  Postwar  Economic  Policy,  ch.  3). 

Chervenkov  and  Stalinism  in  Bulgaria 

In  1948  the  newly  formed  Soviet  empire  in  Eastern  Europe  was 
threatened  by  a  split  between  Yugoslav  President  Josip  Broz  Tito 
and  Soviet  leader  Joseph  V.  Stalin.  After  expelling  Yugoslavia  from 
the  Cominform,  Stalin  began  exerting  greater  pressure  on  the  other 
East  European  states,  including  Bulgaria,  to  adhere  rigidly  to  Soviet 
foreign  and  domestic  policy.  He  demanded  that  the  communist  par- 
ties of  those  countries  become  virtual  extensions  of  the  Communist 
Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU)  by  purging  all  opposition  figures. 
The  Bulgarian  government  curtailed  religious  freedom  by  forcing 
Orthodox  clergy  into  a  Union  of  Bulgarian  Priests  in  1948,  taking 
control  of  Muslim  religious  institutions,  and  dissolving  Bulgarian 
branches  of  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant  churches  in  1949.  The 
most  visible  political  victim  of  the  new  policy  was  Traicho  Rostov, 
who  with  Georgi  Dimitrov  and  Vasil  Kolarov  had  led  the  BCP  to 
power  in  1944.  Accused  by  Dimitrov  of  treason,  Rostov  was  shot 
in  December  1949.  Dimitrov  died  before  Rostov's  execution, 
Rolarov  soon  afterward.  To  fill  the  power  vacuum  left  by  those 
events,  Stalin  chose  Vulko  Chervenkov,  a  trusted  protege.  Cher- 
venkov would  complete  the  conversion  of  the  BCP  into  the  type 
of  one-man  dictatorship  that  Stalin  had  created  in  the  Soviet  Un- 
ion. Chervenkov  assumed  all  top  government  and  party  positions 
and  quickly  developed  a  cult  of  personality  like  that  of  his  Soviet 
mentor.  At  Stalin's  command,  Chervenkov  continued  purging  party 
members  from  1950  until  1953,  to  forestall  in  Bulgaria  the  sort  of 
Titoist  separatism  that  Stalin  greatly  feared.  Rigid  party  hierar- 
chy replaced  the  traditional  informal  structures  of  Bulgarian  gover- 
nance, and  the  purges  eliminated  the  faction  of  the  BCP  that 
advocated  putting  Bulgarian  national  concerns  ahead  of  blind  sub- 
servience to  the  CPSU. 

The  Chervenkov  period  (1950-56)  featured  harsh  repression  of 
all  deviation  from  the  party  line,  arbitrary  suppression  of  culture 
and  the  arts  along  the  lines  of  Soviet-prescribed  socialist  realism, 
and  an  isolationist  foreign  policy.  By  early  1951,  Chervenkov  had 
expelled  one  in  five  party  members,  including  many  high  officials, 
in  his  campaign  for  complete  party  discipline.  In  1950  a  new  agricul- 
tural collectivization  drive  began.  In  spite  of  intense  peasant 
resistance,  the  collectivization  drive  continued  intermittently  until 
the  process  was  virtually  complete  in  1958.

Foreign  and  Economic  Policies 

The  independent  course  taken  by  Tito's  Yugoslavia  in  1948 
caused  Bulgaria  to  seal  the  Yugoslav  border;  a  1953  Balkan  Pact 
among  Greece,  Yugoslavia,  and  Turkey  further  isolated  Bulgaria, 
which  by  that  time  had  cut  all  relations  with  Western  countries. 
The  Soviet  Union  now  was  Bulgaria's  only  ally.  It  supplied  mili- 
tary and  economic  advisers  and  provided  the  model  for  Bulgarian 
social  services,  economic  planning,  and  education  in  the  early  1950s. 
Over  90  percent  of  Bulgarian  exports  and  imports  involved  Soviet 
partnership,  although  the  Soviets  often  paid  less  than  world  prices 
for  Bulgarian  goods.  Because  the  primitive,  mainly  agricultural  Bul- 
garian economy  closely  resembled  that  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Soviet- 
style  centralized  planning  in  five-year  blocks  had  more  immediate 
benefits  there  than  in  the  other  European  states,  where  it  was  first 
applied  in  the  early  1950s. 

After  Stalin 

The  death  of  Joseph  Stalin  in  March  1953  had  strong  repercus- 
sions in  Bulgaria.  By  that  time,  Chervenkov  had  already  moved 
slightly  away  from  hard-line  Stalinist  domestic  repression  and  in- 
ternational isolation,  but  the  lack  of  clear  ideological  guidance  from 
post-Stalin  Moscow  left  him  in  an  insecure  position.  Official  ap- 
proval in  1951  of  Dimitur  Dimov's  mildly  heretical  novel  Tiutiun 
(Tobacco)  had  loosened  somewhat  the  official  constraints  on  liter- 
ature and  other  cultural  activities.  In  1953  Bulgaria  resumed  rela- 
tions with  Greece  and  Yugoslavia,  some  political  amnesties  were 
granted,  and  planners  discussed  increasing  production  of  consumer 
goods  and  reducing  the  prices  of  necessities.  At  the  Sixth  Party 
Congress  in  1954,  Chervenkov  gave  up  his  party  leadership  but  re- 
tained his  position  as  prime  minister.  Todor  Zhivkov,  most  promi- 
nent in  the  postwar  generation  of  Bulgarian  communist  leaders, 
assumed  the  newly  created  position  of  first  secretary  of  the  party 
Central  Committee.  Several  purged  party  leaders  were  released  from 
labor  camps,  and  some  resumed  visible  roles  in  the  party  hierarchy. 

In  spite  of  the  1954  party  shifts,  Chervenkov  remained  the  un- 
challenged leader  of  Bulgaria  for  two  more  years.  The  economic 
shift  away  from  heavy  industry  toward  consumer  goods  continued 
in  the  mid-1950s,  and  direct  Soviet  intervention  in  Bulgarian  eco- 
nomic and  political  life  diminished.  By  1955,  some  10,000  politi- 
cal prisoners  had  been  released.  In  an  attempt  to  win  political 
support  from  the  peasants,  Chervenkov  eased  the  pace  of  collec- 
tivization and  increased  national  investment  in  agriculture. 
However,  events  in  the  Soviet  Union  ended  this  brief  period  of  calm.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  Fall  of  Chervenkov 

In  1955  the  Belgrade  Declaration  restored  Soviet-Yugoslav  friend- 
ship and  reinstated  Tito  to  the  fraternity  of  world  communist  lead- 
ers. Because  Chervenkov  had  branded  Tito  and  the  Yugoslavs  as 
arch-villains  during  his  rise  to  power,  this  agreement  eroded  his 
position.  Then,  in  February  1956,  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  denounced 
Chervenkov' s  patron  Stalin  and  Stalin's  cult  of  personality  at  the 
twentieth  congress  of  the  CPSU.  Unwilling  to  stray  from  the  Soviet 
party  line,  the  BCP  also  condemned  the  cult  of  personality  (and, 
implicitly,  Chervenkov's  authoritarianism),  advocating  instead  col- 
lective leadership  and  inner-party  democracy.  In  his  1956  report 
to  party  leaders,  Zhivkov  expressed  this  condemnation  and 
promised  that  the  party  would  make  amends  for  past  injustices — 
a  clear  reference  to  the  fate  of  Kostov  and  Chervenkov's  other  purge 
victims  in  the  party.  Having  had  his  entire  regime  repudiated  by 
the  party  leader,  Chervenkov  resigned.  Zhivkov,  who  had  thus  far 
remained  below  Chervenkov  in  actual  party  power,  now  assumed 
the  full  powers  of  his  party  first  secretary  position.  The  1956  April 
Plenum  became  the  official  date  of  Bulgarian  de-Stalinization  in 
party  mythology;  after  that  event,  the  atmosphere  of  BCP  politics 
changed  significantly. 

Intellectual  Life 

The  thaw  in  Bulgarian  intellectual  life  had  continued  from  1951 
until  the  middle  of  the  decade.  Chervenkov's  resignation  and  the 
literary  and  cultural  flowering  in  the  Soviet  Union  encouraged  the 
view  that  the  process  would  continue,  but  the  Hungarian  revolu- 
tion of  fall  1956  frightened  the  Bulgarian  leadership  away  from  en- 
couragement of  dissident  intellectual  activity.  In  response  to  events 
in  Hungary,  Chervenkov  was  appointed  minister  of  education  and 
culture;  in  1957  and  1958,  he  purged  the  leadership  of  the  Bulgar- 
ian Writers'  Union  and  dismissed  liberal  journalists  and  editors 
from  their  positions.  His  crackdowns  effectively  ended  the  "Bul- 
garian thaw"  of  independent  writers  and  artists  inspired  by  Khrush- 
chev's 1956  speech  against  Stalinism.  Again  mimicking  the  Soviet 
party,  which  purged  a  group  of  high  officials  in  1957,  the  BCP 
dismissed  three  party  leaders  on  vague  charges  the  same  year. 
Among  those  removed  was  deputy  prime  minister  Georgi  Chankov, 
an  important  rival  of  Zhivkov.  The  main  motivation  for  this  purge 
was  to  assure  the  Soviet  Union  that  Bulgarian  communists  would 
not  fall  into  the  same  heretical  behavior  as  had  the  Hungarian  party 
in  1956.  Through  the  political  maneuvers  of  the  mid-1950s,  Todor 
Zhivkov  enhanced  his  position  by  identifying  with  the  "Bulgarian" 


48

rather  than  "Soviet"  branch  of  the  BCP  at  the  same  time  as  he 
aligned  himself  with  the  new  anti-Stalinist  faction  in  the  Soviet  Un- 
ion. He  established  especially  close  ties  with  Khrushchev  at  this 
time. 

Domestic  Policy  and  Its  Results 

Most  aspects  of  life  in  Bulgaria  continued  to  conform  strongly 
to  the  Soviet  model  in  the  mid-1950s.  In  1949  the  Bulgarian  educa- 
tional system  had  begun  a  restructuring  process  to  resemble  the 
Soviet  system,  and  the  social  welfare  system  followed  suit.  In  the 
mid-1950s,  Soviet-style  centralized  planning  produced  economic 
indicators  showing  that  Bulgarians  were  returning  to  their  prewar 
lifestyle  in  some  respects:  real  wages  increased  75  percent,  con- 
sumption of  meat,  fruit,  and  vegetables  increased  markedly,  medical 
facilities  and  doctors  became  available  to  more  of  the  population, 
and  in  1957  collective  farm  workers  benefited  from  the  first  agricul- 
tural pension  and  welfare  system  in  Eastern  Europe. 

In  1959  the  BCP  borrowed  from  the  Chinese  the  phrase  "Great 
Leap  Forward"  to  symbolize  a  sudden  burst  of  economic  activity 
to  be  injected  into  the  Third  Five-Year  Plan  (1958-1962).  whose 
original  scope  was  quite  conservative.  According  to  the  revised  plan, 
industrial  production  would  double  and  agricultural  production 
would  triple  by  1962;  a  new  agricultural  collectivization  and  con- 
solidation drive  would  achieve  great  economies  of  scale  in  that 
branch;  investment  in  light  industry  would  double,  and  foreign 
trade  would  expand  (see  The  First  Five-Year  Plans,  ch.  3).  Fol- 
lowing the  Chinese  model,  all  of  Bulgarian  society  was  to  be 
propagandized  and  mobilized  to  meet  the  planning  goals.  Two 
purposes  of  the  grandiose  revised  plan  were  to  keep  Bulgaria  in 
step  with  the  Soviet  bloc,  all  of  whose  members  were  embarking 
on  plans  for  accelerated  growth,  and  to  quell  internal  party  con- 
flicts. Zhivkov,  whose  "theses"  had  defined  the  goals  of  the  plan, 
purged  Politburo  members  and  party  rivals  Boris  Taskov  (in  1959) 
and  Anton  Yugov  (in  1962).  citing  their  criticism  of  his  policy  as 
economically  obstructionist.  Already  by  i960,  however,  Zhivkov 
had  been  forced  to  redefine  the  impossible  goals  of  his  theses.  Lack 
of  skilled  labor  and  materials  made  completion  of  projects  at  the 
prescribed  pace  impossible.  Harvests  were  disastrously  poor  in  the 
early  1960s;  peasant  unrest  forced  the  government  to  raise  food 
prices;  and  the  urban  dissatisfaction  that  resulted  from  higher  prices 
compounded  a  crisis  that  broke  in  the  summer  of  1962.  Blame  fell 
on  Zhivkov 's  experiments  with  decentralized  planning,  which  was 
totally  abandoned  by  1963.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  Zhivkov  Era 

Beginning  in  1961,  Todor  Zhivkov  skillfully  retained  control  of 
the  Bulgarian  government  and  the  BCP.  His  regime  was  a  period 
of  unprecedented  stability,  slavish  imitation  of  Soviet  policies,  and 
modest  economic  experimentation. 

Zhivkov  Takes  Control 

Zhivkov  was  able  to  weather  the  social  unrest  of  1962  by  find- 
ing scapegoats,  juggling  indicators  of  economic  progress,  and  re- 
ceiving help  from  abroad.  In  1961  Khrushchev  had  once  again 
denounced  Stalin,  requiring  similar  action  in  the  loyal  Soviet  satel- 
lites. In  October  Chervenkov,  who  had  retained  considerable  party 
power,  was  ousted  from  the  Politburo  as  an  unrepentant  Stalinist 
and  obstructor  of  Bulgarian  economic  progress  (see  The  Cher- 
venkov Era,  ch.  4).  When  Khrushchev  visited  Bulgaria  in  1962, 
the  Soviet  leader  made  clear  his  preference  for  Zhivkov  over  other 
Bulgarian  party  leaders.  Within  months  Yugov  had  lost  his  party 
position,  and  Chervenkov  was  expelled  from  the  party.  Thus,  in 
spite  of  disastrously  unrealistic  economic  experimentation  of  the 
sort  that  contributed  to  Khrushchev's  ouster  in  1964,  Zhivkov  had 
greatly  strengthened  his  position  as  party  first  secretary  by  the  time 
his  Soviet  patron  had  fallen. 

In  the  early  1960s,  Zhivkov  improved  ties  with  the  Bulgarian 
intelligentsia  by  liberalizing  censorship  and  curbing  the  state  security 
forces  (see  Zhivkov  and  the  Intelligentsia,  ch.  4).  He  also  mended 
relations  with  the  agrarians  by  granting  amnesties  to  BANU  mem- 
bers and  appointing  the  leader  of  the  party  as  head  of  state.  These 
measures  gave  Zhivkov  a  political  base  broad  enough  to  survive 
the  fall  of  Khrushchev,  but  they  did  not  prevent  an  army  plot  against 
him  in  1965.  Zhivkov  used  the  plot  as  a  reason  to  tighten  control 
over  the  army  and  move  security  functions  from  the  Ministry  of 
the  Interior  to  a  new  Committee  of  State  Security,  under  his  per- 
sonal control.  Several  other  plots  were  reported  unofficially  in  the 
late  1960s,  but  after  1962  Zhivkov's  position  as  sole  leader  of  Bul- 
garia went  without  serious  challenge. 

Zhivkov's  Political  Methodology 

In  the  1960s,  Zhivkov  moved  slowly  and  carefully  to  replace  the 
deeply  entrenched  Old  Guard  in  party  positions.  He  believed  that 
only  an  energetic,  professional  party  cadre  could  lead  Bulgaria 
effectively.  Therefore,  he  gradually  moved  a  younger  group,  in- 
cluding his  daughter  Liudmila  Zhivkova  and  future  party  leader 
Aleksandur  Lilov,  into  positions  of  power.  At  the  same  time,  he 


50 


Historical  Setting 


juggled  party  positions  enough  to  prevent  any  individual  from  be- 
coming a  serious  rival.  Unlike  Chervenkov,  with  his  Stalinist  per- 
sonality cult,  Zhivkov  cultivated  an  egalitarian  persona  that  kept 
him  in  contact  with  the  Bulgarian  people.  Unlike  contemporane- 
ous communist  leaders  in  other  countries,  Zhivkov  displayed  a  sense 
of  humor  even  in  formal  state  speeches.  Because  of  the  strong  tra- 
dition of  egalitarianism  in  Bulgarian  political  culture,  the  contrast 
of  his  approach  with  that  of  Chervenkov  served  Zhivkov  very  well. 

The  Constitution  of  1971 

In  1968  the  Prague  Spring  outbreak  of  heretical  socialism  in 
Czechoslovakia  caused  the  BCP  to  tighten  control  over  all  social 
organizations,  calling  for  democratic  centrism  and  elimination  of 
unreliable  elements  from  the  party.  This  policy  kept  the  BCP  on 
a  unified  path  in  complete  support  of  Soviet  interests;  it  also  led 
to  a  new  Bulgarian  constitution  and  BCP  program  in  1971.  Ap- 
proved by  the  Tenth  Party  Congress  and  a  national  referendum, 
the  1971  constitution  detailed  for  the  first  time  the  structure  of  the 
BCP  (highly  centralized,  in  keeping  with  policy  after  1968)  and 
its  role  in  leading  society  and  the  state.  BANU  was  specified  as 
the  partner  of  the  BCP  in  the  cooperative  governing  of  the  coun- 
try. A  new  State  Council  was  created  to  oversee  the  Council  of 
Ministers  and  exercise  supreme  executive  authority  (see  The  Con- 
stitution of  1971,  ch.  4).  In  1971  Zhivkov  resigned  as  prime  minister 
to  become  chairman  of  the  State  Council,  a  position  equivalent 
to  Bulgarian  head  of  state.  The  new  constitution  also  defined  four 
forms  of  property:  state,  cooperative,  public  organization,  and  pri- 
vate. Private  property  was  limited  to  that  needed  for  individual 
and  family  upkeep. 

Foreign  Affairs  in  the  1960s  and  1970s 

In  the  first  decade  of  the  Zhivkov  regime,  Balkan  affairs  remained 
central  to  Bulgarian  foreign  policy,  and  relations  with  the  Soviet 
Union  remained  without  significant  conflict.  Because  the  Soviet 
Union  showed  relatively  little  interest  in  the  Balkans  in  the  1950s 
and  1960s,  Bulgaria  was  able  to  improve  significantly  its  relations 
with  its  neighbors.  In  1964  an  agreement  with  Greece  ended  the 
long  postwar  freeze  caused  by  Greek  membership  in  the  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary).  Bulgaria 
paid  partial  wartime  reparations  to  Greece,  and  relations  were  nor- 
malized in  culture,  trade,  and  communications  after  the  initial 
agreement.  Turkish-Bulgarian  relations  were  hindered  by  irrita- 
tion over  the  Turkish  minority  issue:  throughout  the  postwar  period, 
wavering  Bulgarian  policy  on  internal  treatment  and  emigration 


51 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


of  Bulgarian  Turks  was  the  chief  obstacle  to  rapprochement, 
although  bilateral  agreements  on  emigration  and  other  issues  were 
reached  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  i  see  The  Turkish  Problem,  ch.  4: 
Foreign  Policv.  ch.  4). 

Relations  with  Yugoslavia  also  were  strained  in  the  postwar  years. 
The  age-old  Macedonian  dispute  was  the  principal  reason  that 
Yugoslavia  remained  untouched  by  Zhivkov' s  Balkan  detente  pol- 
icy. In  the  mid-1960s.  Tito  and  Zhivkov  exchanged  visits,  but  by 
1967  official  Bulgarian  spokesmen  were  again  stressing  the  Bul- 
garian majority  in  Yugoslav-ruled  Macedonia,  and  a  new  decade 
of  mutually  harsh  propaganda  began.  Although  the  polemic  over 
Macedonia  continued  through  the  1980s,  it  served  both  countries 
mainly  as  a  rallying  point  for  domestic  political  support,  and  Bul- 
garia avoided  taking  advantage  of  Yugoslav  vulnerabilities  such 
as  the  unrest  in  the  province  of  Kosovo.  In  the  early  1980s,  much 
oi  Bulgaria's  anti-Yugoslav  propaganda  aimed  at  discrediting 
heretical  economic  policv  applications  (feared  by  every  orthodox 
communist  neighbor  of  Yugoslavia  i  in  Yugoslav  Macedonia.  In 
1981  Zhivkov  called  for  establishment  of  a  Balkan  nuclear-free  zone 
that  would  include  Romania.  Greece.  Turkey,  and  Yugoslavia. 
The  concept  was  notable  not  because  of  its  practical  implications 
(Bulgaria  was  generally  unsupportive  of  regional  cooperation,  and 
the  potential  participants  had  strongly  differing  international  po- 
sitions i.  but  as  a  Soviet  device  to  remove  NATO  nuclear  weapons 
from  Greece  and  Turkev  at  a  time  of  superpower  tension  over  Euro- 
pean weapons  installations. 

In  the  1970s.  Zhivkov  actively  pursued  better  relations  with  the 
West,  overcoming  conservative  opposition  and  the  tentative, 
tourism-based  approach  to  the  West  taken  in  the  1960s.  Emulat- 
ing Soviet  detente  policv  of  the  1970s.  Bulgaria  gained  Western 
technology,  expanded  cultural  contacts,  and  attracted  Western  in- 
vestments with  the  most  liberal  foreign  investment  policy  in  Eastern 
Europe.  Between  1966  and  1975,  Zhivkov  visited  Charles  de  Gaulle 
and  the  pope  and  established  full  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany).  As  in  1956  and  1968, 
however.  Soviet  actions  altered  Bulgaria's  position.  The  Soviet  in- 
vasion of  Afghanistan  in  late  1979.  which  Bulgaria  supported 
vigorously,  renewed  tension  between  Bulgaria  and  the  West.  Bul- 
garian implication  in  the  attempted  assassination  of  Pope  John  Paul 
II  in  1981  exacerbated  the  problem  and  kept  relations  cool  through 
the  earlv  1980s. 

Bulgaria  also  followed  the  Soviet  example  in  relations  with  Third- 
World  countries,  maintaining  the  image  of  brotherly  willingness 
to  aid  struggling  \dctims  of  Western  imperialism.  Student  exchanges 


52 


Historical  Setting 


already  were  common  in  the  1960s,  and  many  Bulgarian  techni- 
cians and  medical  personnel  went  to  African,  Asian,  and  Latin 
American  countries  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Cultural  exchange  pro- 
grams targeted  mainly  the  young  in  those  countries.  Between  1978 
and  1983,  Zhivkov  visited  seventeen  Third-World  countries  and 
hosted  leaders  from  at  least  that  many. 

Throughout  the  1960s  and  1970s,  Bulgaria  gave  official  mili- 
tary support  to  many  national  liberation  causes,  most  notably  in 
the  Democratic  Republic  of  Vietnam  (North  Vietnam),  Indone- 
sia, Libya,  Angola,  Afghanistan,  the  Horn  of  Africa,  and  the  Mid- 
dle East.  In  1984  the  9,000  Bulgarian  advisers  stationed  in  Libya 
for  military  and  nonmilitary  aid  put  that  country  in  first  place 
among  Bulgaria's  Third-World  clients.  Through  its  Kintex  arms 
export  enterprise,  Bulgaria  also  engaged  in  covert  military  sup- 
port activities,  many  of  which  were  subsequently  disclosed  (see  Arms 
Sales,  ch.  5).  In  the  1970s,  diplomatic  crises  with  Sudan  and  Egypt 
were  triggered  by  Bulgarian  involvement  in  coup  plots.  Repeated 
discoveries  of  smuggled  arms  shipments  from  Bulgaria  to  Third- 
World  countries  gave  Bulgaria  a  reputation  as  a  major  player  in 
international  arms  supply  to  terrorists  and  revolutionaries.  Arms 
smuggling  into  Turkey  periodically  caused  diplomatic  problems 
with  that  country  in  the  1970s. 

Domestic  Policy  in  the  1960s  and  1970s 

Zhivkov's  domestic  policy  in  the  late  1960s  and  1970s  empha- 
sized increased  production  by  Bulgaria's  newly  completed  base  of 
heavy  industry,  plus  increased  consumer  production.  The  indus- 
trial base  and  collectivization  of  Bulgarian  agriculture  had  been 
achieved  largely  by  emulating  Khrushchev's  approaches  in  the  early 
1960s;  but  after  Khrushchev  fell,  Zhivkov  experimented  rather 
freely  in  industrial  and  agricultural  policy.  A  1965  economic  re- 
form decentralized  decision  making  and  introduced  the  profit  mo- 
tive in  some  economic  areas.  The  approach,  a  minor  commitment 
to  "planning  from  below"  in  imitation  of  Yugoslavia's  self- 
management  program,  was  abandoned  in  1969.  Taking  its  place, 
a  recentralization  program  gave  government  ministries  full  plan- 
ning responsibility  at  the  expense  of  individual  enterprises  (see  The 
Era  of  Experimentation  and  Reform,  ch.  3). 

Meanwhile,  a  new  program  for  integration  and  centralization 
of  agriculture  was  born  in  1969.  The  agricultural-industrial  com- 
plex (agropromishlen  kompleks — APK)  merged  cooperative  and 
state  farms  and  introduced  industrial  technology  to  Bulgarian 
agriculture.  In  the  1970s,  the  APK  became  the  main  supporting 
structure  of  Bulgarian  agriculture  (see  Agriculture,  ch.  3).  The  social 


53 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


and  political  goal  of  this  program  was  to  homogenize  Bulgarian 
society,  ending  the  sharp  dichotomy  that  had  always  existed  be- 
tween rural  and  town  populations  and  weakening  the  ideological 
force  of  the  BAXU.  If  the  traditional  gulf  between  Bulgarian 
agricultural  and  industrial  workers  were  eliminated,  the  BCP  could 
represent  both  groups.  Despite  this  large-scale  reorganization  ef- 
fort, the  Bulgarian  tradition  of  small  peasant  farming  remained 
strong  into  the  1980s. 

In  keeping  with  the  detente  of  the  1970s.  Bulgaria  sought  in- 
dependent trade  agreements  with  the  West  throughout  that  decade, 
to  furnish  technology  and  credit  not  available  within  the  Council 
for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary).  Eco- 
nomic cooperation  and  license  agreements  were  signed  with  several 
West  European  countries,  most  notably  West  Germany.  .Although 
the  Western  demand  for  Bulgarian  goods  remained  generally  low 
and  Western  commodities  proved  unexpectedly  expensive  in  the 
late  1970s.  Bulgaria's  expansion  of  Western  trade  in  that  decade 
was  unusually  high  for  a  Comecon  member  nation  ^see  Foreign 
Trade,  ch.  3). 

The  Political  Atmosphere  in  the  1970s 

Through  the  mid-1970s.  Zhivkov  continued  balancing  the  older 
and  younger  generations  and  the  reformist  and  conservative  fac- 
tions in  his  party,  with  only  occasional  purges  of  key  officials.  But 
in  1977.  the  purge  of  liberal  Politburo  member  Boris  Yelchev  in- 
troduced a  massive  reorganization  of  provincial  party  organiza- 
tions that  ousted  38.500  party  members.  This  move  was  designed 
to  limit  the  atmosphere  of  liberalization  that  had  followed  the  1975 
Helsinki  Accords  (see  Glossary).  That  mood  and  an  economic  cri- 
sis caused  by  oil  shortages  in  the  1970s  aroused  discontent  and 
demonstrations  in  Bulgaria  in  the  late  1970s. 

At  the  end  of  the  decade,  two  more  crises  confronted  Zhivkov: 
in  1978  the  murder  of  exiled  writer  Georgi  Markov  was  widely  at- 
tributed to  Bulgarian  State  Security,  damaging  the  country's  in- 
ternational image:  and  in  1980  the  Polish  Solidarity  (see  Glossary) 
movement  alarmed  the  entire  Soviet  Bloc  by  attracting  an  active 
anticommunist  following  in  a  key  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary)  coun- 
try. .Although  the  magnitude  of  Bulgarian  social  discontent  was 
much  less  than  that  in  Poland,  the  BCP  ordered  production  of  more 
consumer  goods,  a  reduction  of  party  privileges,  and  limited  media 
coverage  of  Poland  in  the  early  1980s  as  an  antidote  to  the  "Pol- 
ish infection." 

Meanwhile,  in  1980  Zhivkov  had  improved  his  domestic  posi- 
tion by  appointing  his  daughter  Liudmila  Zhivkova  as  chair  of  the 


54 


Historical  Setting 


commission  on  science,  culture,  and  art.  In  this  powerful  position, 
Zhivkova  became  extremely  popular  by  promoting  Bulgaria's 
separate  national  cultural  heritage.  She  spent  large  sums  of  money 
in  a  highly  visible  campaign  to  support  scholars,  collect  Bulgarian 
art,  and  sponsor  cultural  institutions.  Among  her  policies  was  closer 
cultural  contact  with  the  West;  her  most  visible  project  was  the 
spectacular  national  celebration  of  Bulgaria's  1 ,300th  anniversary 
in  1981 .  When  Zhivkova  died  in  1981 ,  relations  with  the  West  had 
already  been  chilled  by  the  Afghanistan  issue,  but  her  brief  ad- 
ministration of  Bulgaria's  official  cultural  life  was  a  successful  phase 
of  her  father's  appeal  to  Bulgarian  national  tradition  to  bind  the 
country  together. 

Bulgaria  in  the  1980s 

Despite  the  resumption  of  the  Cold  War,  by  1981  several  long- 
standing problems  had  eased  in  Bulgaria.  Zhivkova  had  bolstered 
national  pride  and  improved  Bulgaria's  international  cultural  im- 
age; Zhivkov  had  eased  oppression  of  Roman  Catholics  and 
propaganda  against  the  Bulgarian  Orthodox  Church  in  the  1970s, 
and  used  the  1 ,300th  anniversary  of  the  Bulgarian  state  for  formal 
reconciliation  with  Orthodox  church  officials;  the  Bulgarian  media 
covered  an  expanded  range  of  permissible  subject  matter;  Bulgaria 
contributed  equipment  to  a  Soviet  space  probe  launched  in  1981, 
heralding  a  new  era  of  technological  advancement;  and  the  New 
Economic  Model  (NEM),  instituted  in  1981  as  the  latest  economic 
reform  program,  seemingly  improved  the  supply  of  consumer  goods 
and  generally  upgraded  the  economy. 

However,  Zhivkova' s  death  and  East- West  tensions  dealt  seri- 
ous blows  to  cultural  liberalization;  by  1984  the  Bulgarian  Writers' 
Conference  was  calling  for  greater  ideological  content  and  opti- 
mism in  literature.  Once  fully  implemented  in  1982,  NEM  was 
unable  to  improve  the  quality  or  quantity  of  Bulgarian  goods  and 
produce.  In  1983  Zhivkov  harshly  criticized  all  of  Bulgarian  in- 
dustry and  agriculture  in  a  major  speech,  but  the  reforms  gener- 
ated by  his  speech  did  nothing  to  improve  the  situation.  A  large 
percentage  of  high-quality  domestic  goods  were  shipped  abroad  in 
the  early  1980s  to  shrink  Bulgaria's  hard-currency  debt,  and  the 
purchase  of  Western  technology  was  sacrificed  for  the  same  rea- 
son, crippling  technical  advancement  and  disillusioning  consumers. 
By  1984  Bulgaria  was  suffering  a  serious  energy  shortage  because 
its  Soviet-made  nuclear  power  plant  was  undependable  and 
droughts  reduced  the  productivity  of  hydroelectric  plants  (see 
Energy  Generation,  ch.  3).  Like  the  cutback  in  technology  imports, 
this  shortage  affected  all  of  Bulgarian  industry.  Finally,  Bulgarian 


55

implication  in  the  plot  to  assassinate  Pope  John  Paul  II  in  1981 
and  in  international  drugs  and  weapons  trading  impaired  the  coun- 
try's international  image  and  complicated  economic  relations  with 
the  West  (see  Security  and  Intelligence  Services,  ch.  5). 

The  problem  of  the  Turkish  minority  in  Bulgaria  continued  into 
the  1980s.  Because  birth  rates  among  the  Turks  remained  rela- 
tively high  while  Bulgarians  approached  a  zero-growth  birth  rate 
m  1980.  Bulgarian  authorities  sought  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  grow- 
ing Turkish  enclaves  in  certain  regions.  Hence.  Bulgaria  dis- 
continued its  liberal  1969  emigration  agreement  with  Turkey 
(ostensibly  to  prevent  a  shortage  of  unskilled  labor  resulting  from 
free  movement  of  Turkish  workers  back  to  their  homeland),  and 
in  1984  began  a  massive  campaign  to  erase  the  national  identity 
of  Turkish  citizens  by  forcing  them  to  take  Bulgarian  names.  Official 
propaganda  justified  forced  assimilation  with  the  assertion  that  the 
only  *  'Turks"  in  Bulgaria  were  descended  from  the  Bulgarians  who 
had  adopted  Islam  after  the  Ottoman  occupation  in  the  fourteenth 
centurv.  This  campaign  brought  several  negative  results.  Bulgaria's 
international  ima?e.  already  damaged  by  events  in  the  early  1980s, 
now  included  official  discrimination  against  the  country's  largest 
ethnic  mmontv.  The  resumption  of  terrorist  attacks  on  civilians, 
absent  for  many  years,  coincided  with  the  new  policy.  And  Bul- 
garia's relations  with  Turkey,  which  had  improved  somewhat  after 
a  visit  by  Turkish  President  Kenan  Evren  to  Bulgaria  in  1982. 
suffered  another  setback. 

Bulgaria's  close  reliance  on  the  Soviet  Union  continued  into  the 
1980s,  but  differences  began  to  appear.  Much  of  Zhivkov' s  suc- 
cess had  come  from  the  secure  support  of  Xikita  Khrushchev's  suc- 
cessor. Leonid  Brezhnev,  with  whom  Zhivkov  had  a  close  personal 
relationship.  By  contrast,  relations  between  Zhivkov  and  Brezh- 
nev's successor.  Iuri!  V.  Andropov,  were  tense  because  Zhivkov 
had  supported  Andropov's  rival  Konstantm  Chernenko  as  successor 
to  Brezhnev.  The  advent  of  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  as  Soviet  party 
leader  in  1985  defined  a  new  generational  difference  between  Soviet 
and  Bulgarian  leadership.  Gorbachev  immediately  declared  that 
Bulgaria  must  follow  his  example  in  party  reform  if  traditional  re- 
lations were  to  continue. 

By  this  time,  the  image  of  the  BCP  had  suffered  for  several  years 
from  well-publicized  careerism  and  corruption,  and  from  the  re- 
moteness and  advancing  age  of  the  party  leadership  (Zhivkov  was 
seventy-four  in  1985).  The  state  bureaucracy,  inordinately  large 
in  Bulgaria  since  the  first  post-liberation  government  of  1878.  con- 
stituted 13.5  percent  of  the  total  national  work  force  in  1977.  Peri- 
odic anticorruption  campaigns  had  only  temporary  effects.  The 


56 


Historical  Setting 


ideological  credibility  of  the  party  also  suffered  from  the  apparent 
failure  of  the  NEM,  whose  goals  were  being  restated  by  1984. 
Although  the  BCP  faced  no  serious  political  opposition  or  internal 
division  in  the  early  1980s,  the  party  launched  campaigns  to  in- 
volve Bulgarian  youth  more  fully  in  party  activities.  But  these  ef- 
forts had  little  impact  on  what  party  leaders  perceived  as  serious 
and  widespread  political  apathy  (see  The  Bulgarian  Communist 
(Socialist)  Party,  ch.  4).  Thus,  by  1985  many  domestic  and  inter- 
national signs  indicated  that  the  underpinning  of  the  long,  stable 
Zhivkov  era  was  in  precarious  condition.

The  most  comprehensive  English-language  treatment  of  Bulgar- 
ian history  is  Richard  J.  Crampton's  A  Short  History  of  Modern  Bul- 
garia, which  covers  in  detail  the  period  from  liberation  (1878)  to 
1985.  The  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  from  Blagoev  to  Zhivkov,  by  John 
D.  Bell,  provides  a  political  history  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  BCP, 
beginning  with  the  pre- 1900  origins  of  that  party  and  concluding 
in  1984.  Modern  Bulgaria:  History,  Policy,  Economy,  Culture,  edited 
by  Georgi  Bokov,  contains  a  long  historical  section  whose  useful 
detail  can  be  separated  from  its  bias  as  a  state  publication  of  the 
Zhivkov  era.  Cyril  Black's  chapter  "Bulgaria  in  Historical  Per- 
spective" in  Bulgaria  (edited  by  L.A.D.  Dellin)  is  a  balanced  over- 
view and  perspective  of  all  periods  of  Bulgarian  history.  And  the 
"History  and  Political  Traditions"  chapter  of  Robert  J.  Mclntyre's

litical institutions  from  the  First  Bulgarian  Empire  to  the  late  1980s.

Chapter  2.  The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Man  in  traditional  costume,  playing  gaida,  a  folk  instrument 


IN  THE  PAST  150  YEARS,  vast  changes  have  completely  trans- 
formed the  political  and  economic  situation  in  Bulgaria,  as  well 
as  the  country's  way  of  life.  Poor  peasants  who  served  a  foreign 
ruler  first  became  land-owning  peasants,  then  industrial  workers 
who  were  mostly  urbanized  and  disconnected  from  the  land.  Bul- 
garians who  had  traveled  no  farther  than  the  next  village  began 
to  migrate,  often  to  gain  a  better  education  or  to  get  a  job  in  a 
growing  industry.  As  villages  and  towns  became  less  isolated,  both 
internal  migration  and  emigration  became  easier. 

The  decline  in  the  agricultural  way  of  life  also  made  people  sus- 
ceptible to  changes  on  a  national  level  rather  than  on  a  village  or 
regional  level.  People  were  less  self-sufficient  for  their  basic  needs 
and  therefore  more  vulnerable  to  fluctuations  in  the  national  econ- 
omy. The  traditional  support  systems  of  the  extended  family  and 
cooperative  work  in  the  village  were  replaced  by  a  vast  network 
of  national  social  welfare  programs.  Instead  of  receiving  help  from 
family  and  neighbors,  the  poor,  elderly,  and  disabled  grew  depen- 
dent on  governmental  programs.  The  sick  no  longer  relied  solely 
on  traditional  village  healers  once  villagers  and  city  people  alike 
fell  under  coverage  of  a  national  health  system. 

After  1944  much  was  written  about  the  contrast  between  Bul- 
garia's traditional  past  and  the  modern  way  of  life  to  which  com- 
munism had  accustomed  Bulgarians.  Indeed,  during  the  postwar 
era,  Bulgaria  made  great  progress  in  establishing  the  structure  of 
a  modern,  urbanized  way  of  life.  Mortality  decreased  markedly, 
life  expectancy  increased  greatly,  and  the  educational  level  of  the 
population  improved  significantly.  However,  the  modern  way  of 
life  also  generated  much  greater  expectations  for  housing,  educa- 
tion, health  standards,  work  standards,  and  other  aspects  of  life 
than  the  communist  system  could  deliver.  The  centralization  and 
bureaucracy  of  traditional  communist  social  policy  established  a 
single,  rather  low  standard  for  everyone,  regardless  of  individual 
needs.  Also,  massive  industrialization  brought  pollution  and  other 
environmental  problems  to  a  land  that  had  been  relatively  unspoiled 
before  World  War  II. 

After  democratization  began  in  1989,  Bulgarians  began  look- 
ing westward  and  found  that  many  aspects  of  their  way  of  life  were 
sadly  lacking  by  the  standards  of  Western  Europe  and  the  United 
States.  The  sense  that  Bulgaria  needed  to  do  fifty  years'  worth  of 
catching  up  made  the  transition  to  democracy  even  harder.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Natural  Features 

The  land  area  of  Bulgaria  is  110,550  square  kilometers,  slightly 
larger  than  that  of  the  state  of  Tennessee.  The  country  is  situated 
on  the  west  coast  of  the  Black  Sea,  with  Romania  to  the  north, 
Greece  and  Turkey  to  the  south,  and  Yugoslavia  to  the  west.  Con- 
sidering its  small  size,  Bulgaria  has  a  great  variety  of  topographi- 
cal features.  Even  within  small  parts  of  the  country,  the  land  may 
be  divided  into  plains,  plateaus,  hills,  mountains,  basins,  gorges, 
and  deep  river  valleys. 

Boundaries 

Although  external  historical  events  often  changed  Bulgaria's  na- 
tional boundaries  in  its  first  centuries  of  existence,  natural  terrain 
features  defined  most  boundaries  after  1944,  and  no  significant 
group  of  people  suffered  serious  economic  hardship  because  of  bor- 
der delineation.  Postwar  Bulgaria  contained  a  large  percentage  of 
the  ethnic  Bulgarian  people,  although  numerous  migrations  into 
and  out  of  Bulgaria  occurred  at  various  times.  None  of  the  coun- 
try's borders  was  officially  disputed  in  1991,  although  nationalist 
Bulgarians  continued  to  claim  that  Bulgaria's  share  of  Macedonia — 
which  it  shared  with  both  Yugoslavia  and  Greece — was  less  than 
just  because  of  the  ethnic  connection  between  Macedonians  and 
Bulgarians  (see  Macedonians,  this  ch.). 

In  1991  Bulgaria  had  a  total  border  of  about  2,264  kilometers. 
Rivers  accounted  for  about  680  kilometers  and  the  Black  Sea  coast 
for  400  kilometers;  the  southern  and  western  borders  were  mainly 
defined  by  ridges  in  high  terrain.  The  western  and  northern  bound- 
aries were  shared  with  Yugoslavia  and  Romania,  respectively,  and 
the  Black  Sea  coastline  constituted  the  entire  eastern  border.  The 
Romanian  border  followed  the  Danube  River  for  464  kilometers 
from  the  northwestern  corner  of  the  country  to  the  city  of  Silistra 
and  then  cut  to  the  east-southeast  for  136  kilometers  across  the 
northeastern  province  of  Varna.  The  Danube,  with  steep  bluffs 
on  the  Bulgarian  side  and  a  wide  area  of  swamps  and  marshes  on 
the  Romanian  side,  was  one  of  the  most  effective  river  boundaries 
in  Europe.  The  line  through  Dobruja  was  arbitrary  and  was 
redrawn  several  times  according  to  international  treaties  (see  The 
Balkan  Wars  and  World  War  I,  ch.  1).  In  that  process,  most  in- 
habitants with  strong  national  preferences  resettled  in  the  country 
of  their  choice.  Borders  to  the  south  were  with  Greece  and  Tur- 
key. The  border  with  Greece  was  491  kilometers  long,  and  the  Tur- 
kish border  was  240  kilometers  long. 

Topography 

The  main  characteristic  of  Bulgaria's  topography  is  alternating 


62 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


bands  of  high  and  low  terrain  that  extend  east  to  west  across  the 
country  (see  fig.  8).  From  north  to  south,  those  bands  are  the  Danu- 
bian  Plateau,  the  Balkan  Mountains  (called  Stara  Planina,  mean- 
ing old  mountains  in  Bulgarian),  the  central  Thracian  Plain,  and 
the  Rhodope  Mountains.  The  easternmost  sections  near  the  Black 
Sea  are  hilly,  but  they  gradually  gain  height  to  the  west  until  the 
westernmost  part  of  the  country  is  entirely  high  ground. 

More  than  two-thirds  of  the  country  is  made  up  of  plains, 
plateaus,  or  hilly  land  at  an  altitude  less  than  600  meters.  Plains 
(below  200  meters)  make  up  31  percent  of  the  land,  plateaus  and 
hills  (200  to  600  meters)  41  percent,  low  mountains  (600  to  1,000 
meters)  10  percent,  medium-sized  mountains  (1,000  to  1,500 
meters)  10  percent,  and  high  mountains  (over  1,500  meters)  3  per- 
cent. The  average  altitude  in  Bulgaria  is  470  meters. 

The  Danubian  Plateau  extends  from  the  Yugoslav  border  to  the 
Black  Sea.  It  encompasses  the  area  between  the  Danube  River, 
which  forms  most  of  the  country's  northern  border,  and  the  Balkan 
Mountains  to  the  south.  The  plateau  slopes  gently  from  cliffs  along 
the  river,  then  it  abuts  mountains  of  750  to  950  meters.  The  plateau, 
a  fertile  area  with  undulating  hills,  is  the  granary  of  the  country. 

The  southern  edge  of  the  Danubian  Plateau  blends  into  the 
foothills  of  the  Balkan  Mountains,  the  Bulgarian  part  of  the  Car- 
pathian Mountains.  The  Carpathians  resemble  a  reversed  S  as  they 
run  eastward  from  Czechoslovakia  across  the  northern  portion  of 
Romania,  swinging  southward  to  the  middle  of  Romania  and  then 
running  westward,  where  they  are  known  as  the  Transylvanian 
Alps.  The  mountains  turn  eastward  again  at  the  Iron  Gate,  a  gorge 
of  the  Danube  River  at  the  Romanian-Yugoslav  border.  At  that 
point,  they  become  the  Balkan  Mountains  of  Bulgaria. 

The  Balkan  Mountains  originate  at  the  Timok  Valley  in  Yugo- 
slavia and  run  southward  towards  the  Sofia  Basin  in  west  central 
Bulgaria.  From  there  they  run  east  to  the  Black  Sea.  The  Balkans 
are  about  600  kilometers  long  and  30  to  50  kilometers  wide.  They 
retain  their  height  well  into  central  Bulgaria,  where  Botev  Peak, 
the  highest  point  in  the  Balkan  Mountains,  rises  to  about  2,376 
meters.  The  range  then  continues  at  lower  altitude  to  the  cliffs  of 
the  Black  Sea.  Through  most  of  Bulgaria,  the  Balkan  Mountains 
form  the  watershed  from  which  rivers  drain  north  to  the  Danube 
River  or  south  to  the  Aegean  Sea.  Some  smaller  rivers  in  the  east 
drain  directly  to  the  Black  Sea.  The  Sredna  Gora  (central  hills) 
is  a  narrow  ridge  about  160  kilometers  long  and  1 ,600  meters  high, 
running  east  to  west  parallel  to  the  Balkans.  Just  to  the  south  is 
the  Valley  of  Roses,  famous  for  rose  oil  used  in  perfume  and  li- 
queurs. 


63 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  southern  slopes  of  the  Balkan  Mountains  and  the  Sredna 
Gora  give  way  to  the  Thracian  Plain.  Roughly  triangular  in  shape, 
the  plain  originates  at  a  point  east  of  the  mountains  near  Sofia  and 
broadens  eastward  to  the  Black  Sea.  It  includes  the  Maritsa  River 
valley  and  the  lowlands  that  extend  from  the  river  to  the  Black  Sea. 
Like  the  Danubian  Plateau,  much  of  the  Thracian  Plain  is  some- 
what hilly  and  not  a  true  plain.  Most  of  its  terrain  is  moderate 
enough  to  cultivate. 

The  Rhodope  Mountains  occupy  the  area  between  the  Thracian 
Plain  and  the  Greek  border  to  the  south.  The  western  Rhodopes 
consist  of  two  ranges:  the  Rila  Mountains  south  of  Sofia  and  the 
Pirin  Mountains  in  the  southwestern  corner  of  the  country.  They 
are  the  most  outstanding  topographic  feature  of  Bulgaria  and  of 
the  entire  Balkan  Peninsula.  The  Rila  range  includes  Mount 
Musala,  whose  2,975-meter  peak  is  the  highest  in  any  Balkan  coun- 
try. About  a  dozen  other  peaks  in  the  Rilas  are  over  2,600  meters. 
The  highest  peaks  are  characterized  by  sparse  bare  rocks  and  re- 
mote lakes  above  the  tree  line.  The  lower  peaks,  however,  are  cov- 
ered with  alpine  meadows  that  give  the  range  an  overall  impression 
of  green  beauty.  The  Pirin  range  is  characterized  by  rocky  peaks 
and  stony  slopes.  Its  highest  peak  is  Mount  Vikhren,  at  2,915  meters 
the  second-highest  peak  in  Bulgaria. 

The  largest  basin  in  Bulgaria  is  the  Sofia  Basin.  About  twenty- 
four  kilometers  wide  and  ninety-six  kilometers  long,  the  basin  con- 
tains the  capital  city  and  the  area  immediately  surrounding  it.  The 
route  through  basins  and  valleys  from  Belgrade  to  Istanbul  (for- 
merly Constantinople)  via  Sofia  has  been  historically  important 
since  Roman  times,  determining  the  strategic  significance  of  the 
Balkan  Peninsula.  Bulgaria's  largest  cities  were  founded  on  this 
route.  Paradoxically,  although  the  mountains  made  many  Bulgarian 
villages  and  towns  relatively  inaccessible,  Bulgaria  has  always  been 
susceptible  to  invasion  because  no  natural  obstacle  blocked  the  route 
through  Sofia. 

A  significant  part  of  Bulgaria's  land  is  prone  to  earthquakes.  Two 
especially  sensitive  areas  are  the  borders  of  the  North  Bulgarian 
Swell  (rounded  elevation),  the  center  of  which  is  in  the  Gorna 
Oryakhovitsa  area  in  north-central  Bulgaria,  and  the  West 
Rhodopes  Vault,  a  wide  area  extending  through  the  Rila  and  north- 
ern Pirin  regions  to  Plovdiv  in  south-central  Bulgaria.  Especially 
strong  tremors  also  occur  along  diagonal  lines  running  between 
Skopje  in  the  Republic  of  Macedonia  and  Razgrad  in  northeast 
Bulgaria,  and  from  Albania  eastward  across  the  southern  third  of 
Bulgaria  through  Plovdiv.  Sixteen  major  earthquakes  struck  Bul- 
garia between  1900  and  1986,  the  last  two  in  Strazhitsa  on  the

Skopje-Razgrad  fault  line.  Together  the  two  quakes  damaged  over 
16,000  buildings,  half  of  them  severely.  One  village  was  almost 
completely  leveled,  others  badly  damaged.  Many  inhabitants  were 
still  living  in  temporary  housing  four  years  later. 

Drainage 

The  Balkan  Mountains  divide  Bulgaria  into  two  nearly  equal 
drainage  systems.  The  larger  system  drains  northward  to  the  Black 
Sea,  mainly  by  way  of  the  Danube  River.  This  system  includes 
the  entire  Danubian  Plateau  and  a  stretch  of  land  running  forty- 
eight  to  eighty  kilometers  inland  from  the  coastline.  The  second 
system  drains  the  Thracian  Plain  and  most  of  the  higher  lands  of 
the  south  and  southwest  to  the  Aegean  Sea.  Although  only  the 
Danube  is  navigable,  many  of  the  other  rivers  and  streams  in  Bul- 
garia have  a  high  potential  for  the  production  of  hydroelectric  power 
and  are  sources  of  irrigation  water. 

Of  the  Danube's  Bulgarian  tributaries,  all  but  the  Iskur  rise  in 
the  Balkan  Mountains.  The  Iskur  flows  northward  to  the  Danube 
from  its  origin  in  the  Rila  Mountains,  passing  through  Sofia's 
eastern  suburbs  and  through  a  Balkan  Mountain  valley. 

The  Danube  gets  slightly  more  than  4  percent  of  its  total  volume 
from  its  Bulgarian  tributaries.  As  it  flows  along  the  northern  border, 
the  Danube  averages  1.6  to  2.4  kilometers  in  width.  The  river's 
highest  water  levels  usually  occur  during  June  floods;  it  is  frozen 
over  an  average  of  forty  days  per  year. 

Several  major  rivers  flow  directly  to  the  Aegean  Sea.  Most  of 
these  streams  fall  swiftly  from  the  mountains  and  have  cut  deep, 
scenic  gorges.  The  Maritsa  with  its  tributaries  is  by  far  the  larg- 
est, draining  all  of  the  western  Thracian  Plain,  all  of  the  Sredna 
Gora,  the  southern  slopes  of  the  Balkan  Mountains,  and  the  north- 
ern slopes  of  the  eastern  Rhodopes.  After  it  leaves  Bulgaria,  the 
Maritsa  forms  most  of  the  Greek-Turkish  border.  The  Struma  and 
the  Mesta  (which  separate  the  Pirin  Mountains  from  the  main 
Rhodopes  ranges)  are  the  next  largest  Bulgarian  rivers  flowing  to 
the  Aegean.  The  Struma  and  Mesta  reach  the  sea  through  Greece. 

Climate 

Considering  its  small  area,  Bulgaria  has  an  unusually  variable 
and  complex  climate.  The  country  lies  between  the  strongly  con- 
trasting continental  and  Mediterranean  climatic  zones.  Bulgarian 
mountains  and  valleys  act  as  barriers  or  channels  for  air  masses, 
causing  sharp  contrasts  in  weather  over  relatively  short  distances. 
The  continental  zone  is  slightly  larger  because  continental  air  masses 
flow  easily  into  the  unobstructed  Danubian  Plain.  The  continental 


67 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

influence,  stronger  during  the  winter,  produces  abundant  snow- 
fall; the  Mediterranean  influence  increases  during  the  summer  and 
produces  hot,  dry  weather.  The  barrier  effect  of  the  Balkan  Moun- 
tains is  felt  throughout  the  country:  on  the  average,  northern  Bul- 
garia is  about  one  degree  cooler  and  receives  about  192  more 
millimeters  of  rain  than  southern  Bulgaria.  Because  the  Black  Sea 
is  too  small  to  be  a  primary  influence  over  much  of  the  country's 
weather,  it  only  affects  the  immediate  area  along  its  coastline. 

The  Balkan  Mountains  are  the  southern  boundary  of  the  area 
in  which  continental  air  masses  circulate  freely.  The  Rhodope 
Mountains  mark  the  northern  limits  of  domination  by  Mediterra- 
nean weather  systems.  The  area  between,  which  includes  the  Thra- 
cian  Plain,  is  influenced  by  a  combination  of  the  two  systems,  with 
the  continental  predominating.  This  combination  produces  a  plains 
climate  resembling  that  of  the  Corn  Belt  in  the  United  States,  with 
long  summers  and  high  humidity.  The  climate  in  this  region  is 
generally  more  severe  than  that  of  other  parts  of  Europe  in  the  same 
latitude.  Because  it  is  a  transitional  area,  average  temperatures  and 
precipitation  are  erratic  and  may  vary  widely  from  year  to  year. 

Average  precipitation  in  Bulgaria  is  about  630  millimeters  per 
year.  Dobruja  in  the  northeast,  the  Black  Sea  coastal  area,  and 
parts  of  the  Thracian  Plain  usually  receive  less  than  500  millimeters. 
The  remainder  of  the  Thracian  Plain  and  the  Danubian  Plateau 
get  less  than  the  country  average;  the  Thracian  Plain  is  often  sub- 
ject to  summer  droughts.  Higher  elevations,  which  receive  the  most 
rainfall  in  the  country,  may  average  over  2,540  millimeters  per  year. 

The  many  valley  basins  scattered  through  the  uplands  have  tem- 
perature inversions  resulting  in  stagnant  air.  Sofia  is  located  in  such 
a  basin,  but  its  elevation  (about  530  meters)  tends  to  moderate  sum- 
mer temperature  and  relieve  oppressive  high  humidity.  Sofia  also 
is  sheltered  from  the  northern  European  winds  by  the  mountains 
that  surround  its  troughlike  basin.  Temperatures  in  Sofia  average 
-2°C  in  January  and  about  21°C  in  August.  The  city's  rainfall 
is  near  the  country  average,  and  the  overall  climate  is  pleasant. 

The  coastal  climate  is  moderated  by  the  Black  Sea,  but  strong 
winds  and  violent  local  storms  are  frequent  during  the  winter. 
Winters  along  the  Danube  River  are  bitterly  cold;  however, 
sheltered  valleys  that  open  to  the  south  along  the  Greek  and  Tur- 
kish borders  may  be  as  mild  as  areas  along  the  Mediterranean  or 
Aegean  coasts. 

Environment 

Like  the  other  European  members  of  the  Council  for  Mutual 
Economic  Assistance  (Comecon — see  Glossary),  Bulgaria  saw 


68 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


unimpeded  industrial  growth  as  a  vital  sign  of  social  welfare  and 
progress  toward  the  socialist  ideal.  Because  this  approach  made 
environmental  issues  a  taboo  subject  in  socialist  Bulgaria,  the  degree 
of  damage  by  postwar  industrial  policy  went  unassessed  until  the 
government  of  Todor  Zhivkov  (1962-89)  was  overthrown  in  late 
1989.  The  Zhivkov  government's  commitment  to  heavy  industry 
and  lack  of  money  to  spend  on  protective  measures  forced  it  to  con- 
ceal major  environmental  hazards,  especially  when  relations  with 
other  countries  were  at  stake.  Factories  that  did  not  meet  environ- 
mental standards  paid  symbolic  fines  and  had  no  incentive  to  in- 
stitute real  environmental  protection  measures.  Even  as  late  as  1990, 
socialist  officials  downplayed  the  effects  on  Bulgaria  of  radiation 
from  the  1986  nuclear  power  plant  accident  at  Chernobyl'.  Citizens 
were  informed  that  they  need  not  take  iodine  tablets  or  use  any 
other  protective  measures. 

In  1991  Bulgarian  environmentalists  estimated  that  60  percent 
of  the  country's  agricultural  land  had  been  damaged  by  excessive 
use  of  pesticides  and  fertilizers  and  by  industrial  fallout.  By  1991 
two-thirds  of  Bulgarian  rivers  were  polluted,  and  the  Yantra  River 
was  classified  as  the  dirtiest  river  in  Europe.  Bulgaria's  forests  had 
also  been  damaged.  By  1991,  about  two-thirds  of  the  primary  forests 
had  been  cut.  However,  despite  its  recognition  of  the  need  for 
greater  environmental  protection,  Bulgaria  budgeted  only  10.4  bil- 
lion leva  (for  value  of  the  lev — see  Glossary)  to  remedy  ecological 
problems  in  1991 . 

Perhaps  the  most  serious  environmental  problem  in  Bulgaria  was 
in  the  Danube  port  city  of  Ruse.  From  1981  to  1989,  the  chemical 
pollution  that  spread  from  a  chlorine  and  sodium  plant  across  the 
Danube  in  Giurgiu,  Romania,  was  a  forbidden  subject  in  Bulgaria 
because  it  posed  a  threat  to  good  relations  between  two  Warsaw 
Pact  (see  Glossary)  countries.  Chemical  plants  in  Ruse  also  con- 
tributed to  the  pollution.  Citizen  environmentalists  opposing  the 
situation  in  Ruse  organized  the  first  demonstrations  and  the  first 
independent  political  group  to  oppose  the  Zhivkov  regime  (see  Other 
Political  Organizations,  ch.  4).  During  the  Giurgiu  plant's  first  year 
of  operation,  chlorine  levels  in  Ruse  almost  doubled,  reaching  two 
times  the  permissible  maximum  in  the  summer  of  1990.  Over  3,000 
families  left  the  city  in  the  1980s  despite  government  restrictions 
aimed  at  covering  up  the  problem.  Besides  chlorine  and  its  by- 
products, the  plant  produced  chemical  agents  for  the  rubber  in- 
dustry, and  in  1991  some  sources  reported  that  the  plant  was 
processing  industrial  waste  from  Western  countries — both  activi- 
ties likely  to  further  damage  Ruse's  environment.  International 
experts  claimed  that  half  of  Ruse's  pollutants  came  from  Giurgiu, 


69 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

and  the  others  came  from  Bulgarian  industries.  In  response  to  the 
formidable  Bulgarian  environmental  movement,  some  Bulgarian 
plants  have  been  closed  or  have  added  protective  measures;  the 
Giurgiu  plant,  however,  was  planning  to  expand  in  1991. 

Pollution  of  agricultural  land  from  a  copper  plant  near  the  town 
of  Srednogorie  provoked  harsh  public  criticism.  The  plant  emit- 
ted toxic  clouds  containing  copper,  lead,  and  arsenic.  In  1988  it 
released  toxic  wastewater  into  nearby  rivers  used  to  irrigate  land 
in  the  Plovdiv-Pazardzhik  Plain,  which  includes  some  of  Bulgaria's 
best  agricultural  land.  The  groundwater  beneath  the  plain  also  was 
poisoned.  Work  has  begun  on  a  plan  to  drain  toxic  wastewater  from 
the  plant's  reservoir  into  the  Maritsa  River.  Environmental  im- 
provements for  the  copper  plant  and  three  other  factories  in  the 
Plovdiv  area  (a  lead  and  zinc  factory,  a  chemical  factory,  and  a 
uranium  factory)  also  were  planned,  but  they  would  take  years  to 
implement. 

None  of  Bulgaria's  large  cities  escaped  serious  environmental 
pollution.  Statistics  showed  that  70  to  80  percent  of  Sofia's  air  pol- 
lution was  caused  by  emissions  from  cars,  trucks,  and  buses.  Tem- 
perature inversions  over  the  city  aggravated  the  problem.  Two  other 
major  polluters,  the  Kremikovtsi  Metallurgy  Works  and  the  Bu- 
khovo  uranium  mine  (both  in  southwestern  Bulgaria),  contami- 
nated the  region  with  lead,  sulfur  dioxide,  hydrogen  sulfide,  ethanol, 
and  mercury.  The  city  of  Kurdzhali  became  heavily  polluted  with 
lead  from  its  lead  and  zinc  complex.  In  1973  the  petroleum  and 
chemical  plant  near  the  Black  Sea  port  of  Burgas  released  large 
amounts  of  chlorine  in  an  incident  similar  to  the  one  in  Srednogorie. 
Environmentalists  estimated  that  the  area  within  a  thirty-kilometer 
radius  of  the  plant  was  rendered  uninhabitable  by  that  release.  The 
air  in  Burgas  was  also  heavily  polluted  with  carbon  and  sulfur  di- 
oxide in  1990. 

In  1990  environmental  scientists  claimed  that  two-thirds  of  Bul- 
garia's population  suffered  from  the  polluted  environment  to  some 
degree  (see  Health,  this  ch.).  In  1991  Bulgaria  began  seeking  in- 
ternational assistance  in  solving  environmental  problems.  Besides 
joining  Romania,  Turkey,  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  joint  scientific 
studies  of  the  critically  polluted  Black  Sea,  Bulgaria  actively  sought 
environmental  technology  and  expertise  from  Western  Europe  and 
the  United  States. 

Population 

Since  ancient  times,  Bulgaria  has  been  a  crossroads  for  popula- 
tion movement.  Early  settlement  occurred  mainly  in  the  most  fer- 
tile agricultural  lands.  After  World  War  II,  however,  Bulgarian 


70 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


cities  grew  rapidly  at  the  expense  of  rural  population  in  concert 
with  state  industrialization  policy. 

Administrative  Subdivisions 

In  1991  Bulgaria  was  divided  into  nine  provinces  (oblasti;  sing. 
oblast).  These  administrative  units  included  the  city  of  Sofia  (Grad 
Sofiya)  and  eight  provincial  districts:  Burgas,  Khaskovo,  Lovech, 
Mikhaylovgrad,  Plovdiv,  Razgrad,  Sofiya  (the  region  outside  the 
city),  and  Varna  (see  fig.  1).  Each  province  was  named  for  the  city 
that  was  its  administrative  center.  Excluding  the  city  of  Sofia,  the 
provinces  encompassed  territories  ranging  from  9.5  percent  of  the 
country  to  17.2  percent,  and  their  population  ranged  from  7.5  per- 
cent to  14  percent  of  the  national  total  (see  table  2,  Appendix). 
The  eight  provinces  were  divided  into  a  total  of  273  communities 
(obshtini;  sing.,  obshtina)\  the  city  of  Sofia  was  divided  into  districts 
(rawni;  sing.,  raion).  Because  this  system  was  established  in  1987, 
references  to  another  type  of  district,  the  okrug  (pi.  okruzi),  remained 
common  in  the  early  1990s.  The  new  government  that  took  office 
in  1991  announced  that  yet  another  change  was  needed  in  Bul- 
garia's political  subdivisions  because  the  1987  system  reflected  the 
discredited  policies  of  the  Zhivkov  regime. 

Settlement  Patterns 

The  first  settlements  sprang  up  in  Bulgaria  very  early  in  the  area's 
history  (see  Early  Settlement  and  Empire,  ch.  1).  The  biggest  and 
most  numerous  villages  appeared  on  fertile  lands  such  as  the  Danu- 
bian  Plateau,  the  Dobruja  region,  and  the  Maritsa  and  Tundzha 
river  valleys.  Settlements  also  took  hold  at  very  high  altitudes  (up 
to  1,500  meters  in  the  Rhodope  Mountains  and  up  to  1,200  meters 
in  the  Balkans),  but  only  in  areas  where  it  was  warm  enough  to 
grow  grain  or  other  crops.  During  the  rule  of  the  Ottoman  Em- 
pire, many  Bulgarians  were  forced  to  move  into  villages  at  higher 
altitudes.  After  Bulgaria  became  independent  in  1878,  many  peo- 
ple returned  to  the  lower  altitudes,  but  most  of  the  upland  villages 
remained.  The  process  of  urbanization  began  at  that  point,  but 
it  progressed  slowly  because  of  wars,  lack  of  employment  in  popu- 
lation centers,  and  the  emigration  of  the  ethnic  Turks  who  had  sup- 
ported the  economies  of  some  cities  during  the  Ottoman  era.  The 
massive  industrialization  of  the  communist  era  again  stimulated 
temporary  settlement  at  high  altitudes  for  mining  or  forestry.  Gener- 
ally, only  the  highest  areas  in  the  Rila,  Pirin,  and  Rhodope  moun- 
tains remained  comparatively  unsettled.  These  regions  became 
known  for  their  national  parks  and  seasonal  resort  areas.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 
Cities 

Bulgaria's  cities  grew  much  more  rapidly  after  1944.  In  1946 
only  Sofia  and  Plovdiv  had  populations  numbering  over  100,000. 
By  1990,  there  were  ten  cities  having  populations  exceeding 
250,000:  Burgas,  Dobrich  (formerly  Tolbukhin),  Pleven,  Plodiv, 
Ruse,  Shumen,  Sliven,  Sofia,  Stara  Zagora,  and  Varna  (see  fig.  9; 
table  3,  Appendix).  In  1990  nearly  one-third  of  Bulgaria's  popu- 
lation lived  in  the  ten  largest  cities;  two-thirds  of  the  population 
was  urban.  Although  the  urban  birth  rate  declined  after  the  mid- 
1970s,  large-scale  migration  from  rural  areas  to  cities  continued 
through  1990  (see  table  4,  Appendix).  At  the  same  time,  migra- 
tion from  cities  to  rural  areas  more  than  doubled  from  the  1960s 
to  the  1980s,  mainly  because  more  mechanical  and  service  jobs  be- 
came available  in  agriculture  during  that  period.  In  cities  such  as 
Sofia  and  Plovdiv,  where  industrialization  started  earliest,  the  popu- 
lation stabilized,  and  the  repercussions  of  rapid  population  growth 
were  less  obvious  in  the  1980s. 

The  population  of  the  average  Bulgarian  city  grew  by  three  to 
four  times  between  1950  and  1990.  The  rapidity  of  this  growth 
caused  some  negative  trends.  The  cities  often  lacked  the  resources 
to  serve  the  needs  of  their  growing  populations:  in  particular,  hous- 
ing and  social  services  could  not  grow  fast  enough.  The  cities'  great 
need  for  social  resources  in  turn  diverted  resources  from  smaller, 
more  scattered  population  centers.  The  overall  rural-to-urban 
migration  pattern  caused  shortages  of  agricultural  labor,  especi- 
ally in  the  villages  surrounding  large  cities.  The  government  dis- 
couraged new  industries  from  locating  in  outlying  areas  because 
of  the  lack  of  workers. 

Sofia  was  founded  by  the  Thracians  and  has  remained  an  im- 
portant population  center  for  2,000  years.  Its  location  in  a  basin 
sheltered  by  the  Vitosha  Mountains  was  strategically  and  estheti- 
cally  desirable.  Long-established  communication  routes  pass  though 
Sofia,  most  notably  the  route  from  Belgrade  to  Istanbul.  Sofia's 
climate  and  location  caused  the  Roman  Emperor  Constantine  to 
consider  the  city  when  he  selected  an  eastern  capital  for  his  em- 
pire in  the  early  fourth  century.  Hot  springs,  which  still  exist  today, 
were  an  added  attraction.  After  it  became  the  Bulgarian  capital 
in  1879,  Sofia  became  the  administrative,  educational,  and  cul- 
tural center  of  the  country.  Because  of  Sofia's  rapid  postwar  growth 
(it  grew  by  36  percent  between  1965  and  1986),  in  1986  its  city 
government  closed  the  city  to  all  internal  immigrants  except  scho- 
lars and  technical  experts. 

Plovdiv,  the  country's  second  most  important  city,  was  found- 
ed in  the  fourth  century  B.C.  by  Philip  of  Macedonia.  Its  exposed

location  on  the  route  from  Belgrade  to  Istanbul  gave  the  city  a  vio- 
lent history  that  included  several  instances  of  capture  and 
devastation — both  by  non-Christian  invaders  and  by  Christian 
armies  during  the  Crusades.  At  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century, 
Plovdiv  remained  an  important  commercial  city.  More  rail  lines 
radiated  from  Plovdiv  than  from  Sofia,  and  the  city  had  a  univer- 
sity, important  museums  and  art  treasures,  and  an  old  town  center 
with  a  unique  mid-nineteenth  century  architectural  style.  Part  of 
old  Plovdiv  was  declared  a  national  monument. 

The  three  main  port  cities  were  Varna  and  Burgas  on  the  Black 
Sea  and  Ruse  on  the  Danube  River.  A  relatively  young  city,  Bur- 
gas gained  most  of  its  size  in  the  late  1800s.  Until  the  1950s,  it 
was  the  most  active  Bulgarian  port.  Varna,  which  was  founded 
by  Greeks  in  the  sixth  century  B.C. ,  eclipsed  Burgas  by  attracting 
the  naval  academy  and  the  chief  naval  base  and  acquiring  most 
of  Bulgaria's  shipbuilding  industry.  Ruse,  founded  by  the  Romans 
in  the  first  century  B.C.,  grew  into  a  major  industrial  center  and 
transportation  hub  after  World  War  II.  The  first  bridge  across  the 
Danube  between  Bulgaria  and  Romania  was  built  just  north  of 
Ruse. 

Internal  Migration 

The  urbanization  of  Bulgaria  began  with  independence  from  the 
Ottoman  Turks,  but  the  process  did  not  become  widespread  until 
the  massive  industrialization  of  the  communist  era.  In  1900  city 
dwellers  composed  barely  20  percent  of  Bulgaria's  population,  and 
in  1945  they  made  up  only  24  percent.  By  the  end  of  1990,  however, 
more  than  6  million  people  lived  in  the  cities  while  fewer  than  3 
million  lived  in  the  villages.  Bulgarian  demographers  predicted  that 
75  percent  of  the  population  would  live  in  cities  by  the  year  2000. 

During  the  1950s  and  1960s,  when  the  industrialization  process 
was  most  intense,  most  Bulgarians  who  moved  were  of  working 
age,  had  a  basic  education  or  less,  and  wished  to  obtain  new  jobs 
in  industry  (see  The  Era  of  Experimentation  and  Reform,  ch.  3). 
Fully  85  percent  of  internal  migrants  in  the  early  1960s  went  to 
work  in  an  industry.  The  trend  of  moving  to  locations  with  indus- 
trial jobs  continued  at  a  reduced  rate  in  the  next  decades,  and 
migrants  in  the  1980s  tended  to  be  younger  and  better  educated 
than  those  of  earlier  years.  The  migrant  population  generally  in- 
cluded more  women  than  men.  The  number  reflected  women  who 
moved  to  join  the  work  force  as  well  as  women  who  married  and 
moved  to  join  their  husbands. 

About  two-thirds  of  migrant  Bulgarians  relocated  within  the  same 
province;  hence  no  region  showed  a  marked  population  decline.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  decline  in  village  population,  however,  concerned  demo- 
graphers, who  feared  that  villages  would  be  completely  vacated  and 
the  country's  population  distribution  severely  skewed.  By  1990  this 
population  shift  had  occurred  most  noticeably  in  the  southeastern 
and  southern  regions,  but  a  similar  trend  was  evident  in  the  north- 
west. 

As  workers  continued  to  leave,  village  populations  aged  demo- 
graphically.  The  share  of  villages  with  an  average  population  age 
above  fifty  increased  from  23  percent  in  1956  to  41  percent  in  1985. 
Natural  growth  in  villages,  negative  after  1975,  fell  to  negative  6 
percent  in  1985.  Some  villages  recorded  no  births  for  an  entire  year. 
As  the  younger  population  decreased,  schools  and  health  facilities 
closed.  The  closures,  in  turn,  drove  more  people  to  leave  their 
villages. 

Meanwhile,  demographers  and  sociologists  encouraged  youn- 
ger Bulgarians  to  return  to  the  villages.  Generally,  those  who  fol- 
lowed this  advice  because  of  housing  shortages,  transportation 
problems,  or  pollution  in  the  cities  found  hard,  uncongenial  work, 
a  lower  standard  of  living,  and  scant  public  services  and  recrea- 
tion. Many  village  workers  were  forced  to  raise  animals  to  supple- 
ment their  regular  income.  The  beginning  of  democratization  in 

1990  sparked  much  debate  about  whether  the  rural  standard  of  liv- 
ing would  rise  if  the  government's  agricultural  privatization  pro- 
gram could  stimulate  agricultural  activity  (see  Agricultural 
Products,  ch.  3). 

Foreign  Citizens  in  Bulgaria 

During  the  Zhivkov  era,  Bulgaria  signed  several  friendship  treaties 
with  other  Comecon  nations  to  ease  the  exchange  of  workers.  In 
the  1980s,  for  example,  a  large  number  of  Bulgarians  worked  in 
the  construction  and  timber  industries  of  the  Komi  Autonomous 
Soviet  Socialist  Republic  (Komi  ASSR)  under  an  exchange  agree- 
ment with  the  Soviet  Union.  Workers  were  expected  to  return  to  their 
own  countries  when  their  contracts  ended,  but  they  did  not  always  do 
so.  For  example,  some  Vietnamese  construction  workers  sent  to  Bul- 
garia under  a  Comecon  agreement  in  the  1980s  remained,  and  in 

1991  the  Vietnamese  population  of  Bulgaria  was  11,000.  Because 
they  arrived  completely  unprepared  for  life  in  Bulgaria  and  began 
working  after  only  one  month  of  training  and  language  courses,  the 
Vietnamese  who  remained  in  Bulgaria  generally  received  the  hardest 
and  lowest-paying  jobs  and  often  became  involved  in  criminal  ac- 
tivity. In  1991  several  violent  incidents  involving  Vietnamese  pro- 
voked calls  for  their  repatriation.  In  response,  the  government  made 
plans  to  expel  all  resident  Vietnamese  from  Bulgaria  in  1992.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

Population  Trends 

The  1985  census  recorded  Bulgaria's  population  at  8,948,649, 
an  increase  of  220,878  over  the  1975  census  figure.  At  the  end  of 
1990,  the  Central  Statistical  Bureau  had  estimated  an  updated  figure 
of  8,989,172,  including  about  100,000  more  women  than  men. 
However,  the  estimates  for  1989  and  1990  did  not  account  for  major 
emigrations  in  those  years:  first  the  massive  emigration  of  Turks 
in  1989,  then  the  emigration  of  ethnic  Bulgarians  in  1990.  Adjust- 
ing for  emigration  figures,  the  population  figure  actually  decreased 
between  1985  and  1990.  Bulgaria's  1989  population  density  figure 
of  eighty-one  people  per  square  kilometer  made  it  one  of  the  least 
densely  populated  countries  in  Europe. 

Bulgaria's  rate  of  population  growth  began  a  steady  decrease 
in  the  mid- 1920s,  and  the  trend  accelerated  thereafter  (see  table  5, 
Appendix).  Before  World  War  II,  a  man's  status  in  his  commu- 
nity was  determined  by  how  many  children  (especially  sons)  he 
had.  Women  who  did  not  marry,  or  who  married  but  had  no  chil- 
dren, were  seen  as  failures.  As  the  country  became  more  urbanized, 
however,  such  traditional  views  gradually  disappeared.  Large  fam- 
ilies were  no  longer  the  economic  necessity  they  had  been  in  agricul- 
tural society,  and  extra  children  became  a  burden  rather  than  a 
boon.  As  women  became  more  educated  and  less  accepting  of  the 
traditional  patriarchal  family  norms,  their  attitude  toward  child- 
bearing  changed.  In  1990  the  majority  of  Bulgarian  women  be- 
lieved two  children  ideal  for  a  family,  but  because  of  economic  and 
social  conditions,  their  personal  preference  was  to  raise  only  one. 
By  the  1980s,  this  change  in  attitude  had  begun  to  prevail  even 
in  villages  and  with  less-educated  women.  In  1985,  75  percent  of 
Bulgarian  women  indicated  that  they  would  not  like  to  have  any 
more  children.  Families  with  three  or  more  children  became  a  rarity, 
and  women  who  opted  for  more  than  two  children  had  a  lower  stan- 
dard of  living  and  were  generally  less  respected  in  society. 

Although  few  social  planners  advocated  a  return  to  the  large  fam- 
ilies of  the  past,  Bulgarian  policy  makers  were  dismayed  that  the 
population  did  not  increase.  During  the  Zhivkov  era,  the  mass 
media  and  scholarly  journals  expressed  concern  that  the  nine  mil- 
lionth Bulgarian  had  not  yet  been  born,  and  that  families  were  un- 
willing to  have  two  children  instead  of  one.  By  1985  population 
experts  were  urging  that  30  to  40  percent  of  families  have  three 
children  to  make  up  for  those  which  had  none  or  only  one.  Mean- 
while, although  the  1973  Politburo  had  affirmed  a  family's  right 
to  decide  how  many  children  to  have  and  when  they  should  be  born, 
in  the  1970s  and  1980s  contraceptives  were  not  available  in  sufficient 


77

quantity  for  family  planning.  The  Zhivkov  regime  had  placed  strict 
restrictions  on  abortions;  these  restrictions  were  not  repealed  until 
1990.  Partly  because  contraceptives  were  in  short  supply,  abor- 
tions had  surpassed  births  by  1985  despite  the  restrictions.  Until 
1990  bachelors  and  unmarried  women  had  to  pay  a  5  to  15  per- 
cent "bachelors'  tax"  depending  on  their  age.  In  a  more  positive 
step,  laws  provided  family  allowances  for  children  under  sixteen. 
The  age  limit  for  the  family  allowance  was  raised  to  eighteen  in 
1990  for  children  still  in  school. 

In  1990  Bulgarian  demographers  recorded  a  negative  growth  rate 
(negative  35  births  per  1 ,000  population)  for  the  first  time.  At  that 
point,  the  number  of  live  births  per  woman  was  1.8.  Demographers 
reported  that  the  figure  must  increase  to  2.1  to  maintain  the  coun- 
try's natural  rate  of  population  replacement.  Mortality  figures  in 
Bulgaria  were  also  much  higher  than  those  of  the  developed  Euro- 
pean countries  (see  Health,  this  ch.). 

The  most  alarming  demographic  trend  of  the  late  1980s,  however, 
was  substantially  greater  emigration  totals.  The  1989  Turkish  exo- 
dus caused  by  the  Zhivkov  assimilation  campaigns  had  a  severe  im- 
pact on  the  Bulgarian  labor  force  (see  Turks,  this  ch.).  Then,  in 
1990,  economic  reform  brought  harsh  living  conditions  that  stimu- 
lated a  wave  of  emigration  by  ethnic  Bulgarians  (see  Standard  of 
Living,  ch.  3.).  As  of  March  1991,  some  460,000  Bulgarians  had 
emigrated,  bringing  the  total  number  of  Bulgarians  living  abroad 
to  about  3  million.  The  majority  of  the  emigre  population  remained 
in  nearby  countries  (1.2  million  in  Yugoslavia,  800,000  in  other 
Balkan  countries,  and  500,000  in  the  Soviet  Union).  Smaller  num- 
bers went  as  far  as  the  United  States  (100,000  to  120,000),  Canada 
(100,000),  Argentina  (18,000),  and  Australia  (15,000). 

Ethnographic  Characteristics 

Throughout  its  past,  Bulgaria,  like  the  rest  of  the  Balkan  Penin- 
sula, had  been  home  to  many  diverse  ethnic  groups  that  were  able 
to  preserve  their  national  identities  despite  being  shifted  among 
the  jurisdictions  of  powerful  empires.  In  modern  Bulgaria,  the  op- 
posite has  been  true:  the  largest  minority  ethnic  group,  the  Turks, 
remained  in  territory  that  their  Ottoman  ancestors  had  occupied. 
After  the  fall  of  the  Zhivkov  government,  Bulgaria  was  forced  to 
moderate  its  minority  policy  in  order  to  improve  its  delicate  rela- 
tions with  neighboring  countries  such  as  Turkey  and  Yugoslavia. 

Government  Minority  Policy 

The  1893  census  listed  the  following  nationalities  and  religious 
groups  in  order  of  prevalence:  Eastern  Rite  Orthodox  Bulgarians, 


78

Turks,  Romanians,  Greeks,  Gypsies,  Jews,  Muslim  Bulgarians, 
Catholic  Bulgarians,  Tatars,  Gagauz  (a  Turkish-speaking  people 
of  the  Eastern  Orthodox  faith),  Armenians,  Protestant  Bulgarians, 
Vlachs  (a  Romanian-speaking  people  in  southwest  Bulgaria),  and 
foreigners  of  various  nationalities,  mainly  Russians  and  Germans. 

Migrations  and  boundary  changes  after  the  two  world  wars 
reduced  the  list  somewhat;  few  Greeks  and  Romanians  remained 
in  Bulgaria  by  1990  (see  table  6,  Appendix).  However,  Bulgaria's 
communist  leaders  often  tried  to  deny  the  existence  of  minority 
groups  by  manipulating  or  suppressing  census  data  or  by  forcibly 
assimilating  "undesirable"  groups.  In  1985,  at  the  height  of  the 
last  anti-Turkish  assimilation  campaign,  a  leading  Bulgarian  Com- 
munist Party  official  declared  Bulgaria  "a  one-nation  state"  and 
affirmed  that  "the  Bulgarian  nation  has  no  parts  of  other  peoples 
and  nations." 

After  the  fall  of  Todor  Zhivkov  in  1989,  all  the  minorities  in  Bul- 
garia progressed  somewhat  toward  self-determination  and  freedom 
of  expression.  New  minority  organizations  and  political  parties 
sprang  up,  and  minority  groups  began  publishing  their  own 
newspapers  and  magazines.  Non-Bulgarian  nationalities  regained 
the  right — curtailed  in  the  Zhivkov  era — to  use  their  original  names, 
speak  their  language  in  public,  and  wear  their  national  dress.  In 


79 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

1991  significant  controversy  remained,  however,  as  to  how  far  the 
rights  of  minorities  should  extend.  Legislators  making  policy  on 
such  issues  as  approval  of  non-Bulgarian  names  and  Turkish- 
language  schools  faced  mass  protests  by  nationalist  Bulgarians,  who 
successfully  delayed  liberalization  of  government  policy  on  those 
issues  (see  The  Turkish  Problem,  ch.  4). 

Bulgarians 

Bulgarians  have  been  recognized  as  a  separate  ethnic  group  on 
the  Balkan  Peninsula  since  the  time  of  Tsar  Boris  I  (852-89),  under 
whom  the  Bui  gars  were  converted  to  Christianity.  Early  historians 
began  mentioning  them  as  a  group  then;  however,  it  is  not  clear 
whether  such  references  were  to  the  earliest  Bulgarians,  who  were 
Asiatic  and  migrated  to  the  Balkan  Peninsula  from  the  Ural  Moun- 
tains of  present-day  Russia,  or  to  the  Slavs  that  preceded  them  in 
what  is  now  Bulgaria.  By  the  end  of  the  ninth  century,  the  Slavs 
and  the  Bulgarians  shared  a  common  language  and  a  common 
religion,  and  the  two  cultures  essentially  merged  under  the  name 
"Bulgarian"  (see  The  Slavs  and  the  Bulgars,  ch.  1). 

Acceptance  of  the  Eastern  Orthodox  church  as  the  state  religion 
of  the  First  Bulgarian  Empire  in  A.D.  864  shaped  the  Bulgarian 
national  identity  for  many  centuries  thereafter.  The  Bulgarian  lan- 
guage, which  was  the  first  written  Slavic  language,  replaced  Greek 
as  the  official  language  of  both  church  and  state  once  the  Cyrillic 
alphabet  (see  Glossary)  came  into  existence  in  the  ninth  century. 
National  literature  flourished  under  the  First  Bulgarian  Empire, 
and  the  church  remained  the  repository  of  language  and  national 
feeling  during  subsequent  centuries  of  occupation  by  the  Byzan- 
tine and  Ottoman  empires. 

Ottoman  rule  was  the  most  formidable  test  of  Bulgarian  ethnic 
identity.  The  Ottoman  Turks  forced  many  of  their  Christian  sub- 
jects to  convert  to  Islam,  and  the  Turks  differentiated  their  sub- 
jects only  by  religion,  not  by  nationality.  The  latter  policy  meant 
that  the  empire  usually  considered  the  Bulgarians  as  Greeks  be- 
cause of  their  common  Orthodox  religion.  Turkish  recognition  of 
the  Greek  Orthodox  Church  gave  the  Greeks  the  power  to  replace 
Bulgarian  clergy  and  liturgy  with  Greek,  further  threatening  Bul- 
garian national  identity.  Under  the  Ottomans,  some  Bulgarians 
who  had  converted  to  Islam  lost  their  national  consciousness  and 
language  entirely.  Others  (the  Pomaks)  converted  but  managed 
to  retain  their  old  language  and  customs. 

During  the  Ottoman  occupation,  the  monasteries  played  an  im- 
portant role  in  preserving  national  consciousness  among  educated 
Bulgarians.  Later,  during  the  National  Revival  period  of  the 


80 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

nineteenth  century,  primary  schools  and  reading  rooms  (chitalishta) 
were  established  to  foster  Bulgarian  culture  and  literacy  in  cities 
throughout  Bulgaria.  The  vast  majority  of  uneducated  peasants, 
however,  preserved  their  customs  in  the  less  accessible  regions  in 
the  mountains.  Traditional  folk  songs  and  legends  flourished  there 
and  became  richer  and  more  widely  known  than  the  literature 
created  by  educated  Bulgarians  (see  The  Written  Word,  ch.  1). 

Bulgarian  is  classified  as  a  South  Slavic  language,  together  with 
Serbo-Croatian,  Slovenian,  and  Macedonian.  One  of  the  oldest 
written  languages  in  Europe,  Bulgarian  influenced  all  the  other 
Slavic  languages,  especially  Russian,  in  early  medieval  times.  In 
turn,  the  Bulgarian  language  was  enriched  by  borrowings  from 
other  civilizations  with  which  it  came  into  contact.  Besides  2,000 
words  from  the  pre-Cyrillic  Old  Slavonic  language,  Bulgarians  bor- 
rowed religious  terms  and  words  used  in  daily  life  from  the  Greeks; 
vocabulary  relating  to  political,  economic,  and  day-to-day  life  from 
Turkish;  and  many  Russian  words  to  replace  their  Turkish  equiva- 
lents as  Ottoman  influence  waned  during  the  National  Revival  pe- 
riod. In  the  postwar  era,  many  West  European  words  began  to 
appear  in  Bulgarian,  especially  in  technological  fields. 

Turks 

Because  of  their  status  as  former  occupiers,  the  Turks  have  had 
a  stormy  relationship  with  Bulgaria  since  the  beginning  of  its  in- 
dependence. In  1878  Turks  outnumbered  Bulgarians  in  Bulgaria, 
but  they  began  emigrating  to  Turkey  immediately  after  inde- 
pendence was  established.  The  movement  continued,  with  some 
interruptions,  through  the  late  1980s.  Between  1923  and  1949, 
219,700  Turks  left  Bulgaria.  Then  a  wave  of  155,000  emigrants 
either  were  "expelled"  (according  to  Turkish  sources)  or  were  "al- 
lowed to  leave"  (according  to  Bulgarian  sources)  between  1949  and 
1951.  The  number  would  have  been  far  greater  had  Turkey  not 
closed  its  borders  twice  during  those  years.  In  1968  an  agreement 
reopened  the  Bulgarian-Turkish  border  to  close  relatives  of  per- 
sons who  had  left  from  1944  to  1951.  The  agreement  remained 
in  effect  from  1968  to  1978. 

The  biggest  wave  of  Turkish  emigration  occurred  in  1989, 
however,  when  310,000  Turks  left  Bulgaria  as  a  result  of  the 
Zhivkov  regime's  assimilation  campaign.  That  program,  which 
began  in  1984,  forced  all  Turks  and  other  Muslims  in  Bulgaria 
to  adopt  Bulgarian  (Christian  or  traditional  Slavic)  names  and 
renounce  all  Muslim  customs.  Bulgaria  no  longer  recognized  the 
Turks  as  a  national  minority,  explaining  that  all  the  Muslims  in 
Bulgaria  were  descended  from  Bulgarians  who  had  been  forced  into 


81 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

the  Islamic  faith  by  the  Ottoman  Turks.  The  Muslims  would  there- 
fore "voluntarily"  take  new  names  as  part  of  the  "rebirth  process" 
by  which  they  would  reclaim  their  Bulgarian  identities.  During  the 
height  of  the  assimilation  campaign,  the  Turkish  government 
claimed  that  1.5  million  Turks  resided  in  Bulgaria,  while  the  Bul- 
garians claimed  there  were  none.  (In  1986  Amnesty  International 
estimated  that  900,000  ethnic  Turks  were  living  in  Bulgaria.) 

The  motivation  of  the  1984  assimilation  campaign  was  unclear; 
however,  many  experts  believed  that  the  disproportion  between 
the  birth  rates  of  the  Turks  and  the  Bulgarians  was  a  major  factor. 
The  birth  rate  for  Turks  was  about  2  percent  at  the  time  of  the 
campaign,  while  the  Bulgarian  rate  was  barely  above  zero.  The 
upcoming  1985  census  would  have  revealed  this  disparity,  which 
could  have  been  construed  as  a  failure  of  Zhivkov  government  pol- 
icy. On  the  other  hand,  although  most  Turks  worked  in  low-prestige 
jobs  such  as  agriculture  and  construction,  they  provided  critical 
labor  to  many  segments  of  the  Bulgarian  economy.  The  emigra- 
tion affected  the  harvest  season  of  1989,  when  Bulgarians  from  all 
walks  of  life  were  recruited  as  agricultural  laborers  to  replace  the 
missing  Turks.  The  shortage  was  especially  acute  in  tobacco,  one 
of  Bulgaria's  most  profitable  exports,  and  wheat. 

During  the  name-changing  phase  of  the  campaign,  which  saw 
Turkish  towns  and  villages  surrounded  by  army  units,  citizens  were 
issued  new  identity  cards  with  Bulgarian  names.  Failure  to  present 
a  new  card  meant  forfeiture  of  salary,  pension  payments,  and  bank 
withdrawals.  Birth  or  marriage  certificates  were  issued  only  in  Bul- 
garian names.  Traditional  Turkish  costumes  were  banned;  homes 
were  searched  and  all  signs  of  Turkish  identity  removed.  Mosques 
were  closed.  According  to  estimates,  500  to  1,500  people  were  killed 
when  they  resisted  assimilation  measures,  and  thousands  of  others 
went  to  labor  camps  or  were  forcibly  resettled. 

Before  Zhivkov 's  assimilation  campaign,  official  policy  toward 
use  of  the  Turkish  language  had  varied.  Before  1958,  instruction 
in  Turkish  was  available  at  all  educational  levels,  and  university 
students  were  trained  to  teach  courses  in  Turkish  in  the  Turkish 
schools.  After  1958,  Turkish-language  majors  were  taught  in  Bul- 
garian only,  and  the  Turkish  schools  were  merged  with  Bulgarian 
ones.  By  1972,  all  Turkish-language  courses  were  prohibited,  even 
at  the  elementary  level.  Assimilation  meant  that  Turks  could  no 
longer  teach  at  all,  and  the  Turkish  language  was  forbidden,  even 
at  home.  Fines  were  levied  for  speaking  Turkish  in  public. 

After  the  fall  of  Zhivkov  in  1989,  the  National  Assembly  at- 
tempted to  restore  cultural  rights  to  the  Turkish  population.  In  1991 
a  new  law  gave  anyone  affected  by  the  name-changing  campaign 


82

three  years  to  officially  restore  original  names  and  the  names  of 
children  born  after  the  name  change.  The  Slavic  endings  -ov, 
-ova,  -ev,  or  -eva  could  now  be  removed  if  they  did  not  go  with 
one's  original  name,  reversing  the  effect  of  a  1950s  campaign  to 
add  Slavic  endings  to  all  non-Slavic  names.  The  law  was  impor- 
tant not  only  for  Turks,  but  also  for  the  minority  Gypsies  and  Po- 
maks  who  had  been  forced  to  change  their  names  in  1965  and  1972 


83 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


respectively.  In  January  1991,  Turkish-language  lessons  were  rein- 
troduced for  four  hours  per  week  in  parts  of  the  country  with  a 
substantial  Turkish  population,  such  as  the  former  Kurdzhali  and 
Razgrad  districts. 

Pomaks 

Pomaks — a  term  that  loosely  translates  as  collaborators — were  the 
descendants  of  ethnic  Bulgarians  who  accepted  the  Islamic  faith 
during  Ottoman  rule,  mostly  between  the  sixteenth  and  eighteenth 
centuries.  In  1990  about  150.000  Pomaks  lived  in  mountain  vil- 
lages in  southern  and  southwestern  Bulgaria.  They  were  chiefly 
employed  in  agriculture,  forestry,  and  mining.  Because  of  their 
relative  isolation  in  the  mountains,  the  Pomaks  did  not  become 
ethnically  mixed  with  their  coreligionist  Turks  during  the  occupa- 
tion, and  they  largely  retained  their  Slavic  physical  features.  Be- 
cause the  Ottoman  Turks  showed  little  interest  in  Pomak  lands, 
and  because  the  Pomaks  were  converted  rather  late,  most  of  their 
traditional  Bulgarian  customs  remained  intact.  Thus,  for  exam- 
ple, the  Pomaks  never  learned  to  speak  Turkish.  The  Bulgarian 
government  always  considered  the  Pomaks  as  Bulgarians  rather 
than  as  a  separate  minority. 

As  a  result  of  the  1972-73  assimilation  campaign,  about  550  Po- 
maks were  arrested  and  imprisoned  at  Belene  in  north  central  Bul- 
garia and  in  Stara  Zagora.  Unrest  flared  in  1989  when  Pomaks 
from  the  Gotse  Delchev  area  in  southwest  Bulgaria  were  refused 
passports  that  would  have  enabled  them  to  emigrate  with  the  Turks. 
Some  Pomaks  in  southwest  Bulgaria  were  subjected  to  a  second 
name  change  because  the  names  they  received  the  first  time  were 
not  definitely  Bulgarian.  Riots,  work  stoppages,  and  hunger  strikes 
ensued.  According  to  reports  from  the  Plovdiv  region,  local  offi- 
cials banned  public  gatherings  of  more  than  three  Pomaks  and  for- 
bade residents  to  leave  their  villages. 

Macedonians 

Beginning  with  the  withdrawal  of  the  Ottoman  occupation,  the 
region  known  as  Macedonia  was  divided  among  two  or  more  Euro- 
pean states.  The  entire  region  was  never  included  in  a  single  po- 
litical unit.  In  1990  Macedonia  included  all  of  the  Yugoslav  republic 
of  Macedonia,  the  Pirin  region  of  southwest  Bulgaria,  the  part  of 
northern  Greece  bordering  the  Aegean  Sea  and  including  Thes- 
saloniki.  and  a  very  small  part  of  eastern  .Albania.  The  Macedoni- 
an language,  in  which  no  written  documents  are  known  to  have 
existed  before  1790.  had  three  main  dialects.  One  dialect  was  closest 


84 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


to  Serbian,  one  most  resembled  Bulgarian,  and  a  third,  more 
distinctive  group  became  the  basis  for  the  official  language. 

The  region's  location  in  the  middle  of  the  Balkans  and  its  lack 
of  defined  ethnic  character  made  the  dispute  over  the  existence  and 
location  of  a  separate  Macedonian  nationality  and  control  over  its 
territory  one  of  the  most  intractable  Balkan  issues  of  the  late 
nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries.  In  general,  Bulgaria  and  Greece 
asserted  that  the  Macedonians  within  their  jurisdiction  were  eth- 
nically indistinguishable  from  the  majority  population.  Yugoslavia 
saw  the  Macedonians  of  all  jurisdictions  as  a  distinct  ethnic  group. 
But,  beginning  with  independence  in  1878,  Bulgarians  also  claimed 
various  segments  of  non-Bulgarian  territory  based  on  the  ethnic 
Slavic  commonality  of  the  Bulgarians  and  the  Macedonians. 
Residual  claims  on  Macedonian  territory  were  a  primary  reason 
for  Bulgaria's  decision  to  side  with  Germany  during  both  world 
wars.  In  the  division  of  territory  after  World  War  I,  most  of 
Macedonia  became  part  of  the  Kingdom  of  the  Serbs,  Croats,  and 
Slovenes  (later  the  Kingdom  of  Yugoslavia),  and  was  renamed 
"South  Serbia."  After  World  War  II,  Yugoslavia  strengthened  its 
hold  by  making  Macedonia  a  separate  republic  and  recognizing 
the  Macedonians  as  a  distinct  nationality  (see  World  War  I  and 
Foreign  Policy  in  the  Late  1930s,  ch.  1). 

The  Bulgarian  position  maintained  that  leading  patriots  such  as 
Gotse  Delchev  and  lane  Sandanski  (who  had  fought  for  Macedo- 
nian independence  from  the  Turks)  and  cultural  figures  such  as 
the  Miladinov  brothers  (who  promoted  education  and  the  Slavic 
vernacular  during  the  National  Revival  period)  were  products  of 
Bulgarian  culture  and  considered  themselves  Bulgarians,  not 
Macedonians.  In  1990  many  people  in  the  Pirin  region  identi- 
fied themselves  as  Bulgarian,  but  some  opposition  Macedonian 
organizations  such  as  Ilinden  (named  after  the  1903  Ilinden- 
Preobrazhensko  uprising  for  Macedonian  independence  on  St. 
Elijah's  Day)  sought  recognition  by  the  Bulgarian  government  as 
a  minority  separate  from  the  Bulgarians.  This  position  was  based 
on  the  assertion  that  Macedonians  were  a  separate  nationality  with 
a  distinct  language  and  history. 

No  reliable  data  showed  how  many  people  in  Bulgaria,  or  in  all 
of  Macedonia,  considered  themselves  Macedonian  or  spoke  a 
Macedonian  dialect  in  1990.  Those  who  considered  the  Slavs  in 
Macedonia  as  Bulgarians  cited  statistics  for  the  whole  region  at  the 
time  it  was  first  divided  after  World  War  I.  At  that  time,  1 ,239,903 
Bulgarians,  or  59  percent  of  the  population,  were  listed.  The  Bul- 
garians were  a  majority  in  both  Yugoslav  (Vardar)  Macedonia 
(759,468  people)  and  in  Bulgarian  (Pirin)  Macedonia  (226,700

people).  Later  Bulgarian  censuses,  however,  showed  sharply  varying 
numbers  of  Macedonians  according  to  what  political  agenda  was 
to  be  supported  by  a  given  census.  The  1946  census,  for  example, 
identified  over  250,000  Macedonians,  reportedly  to  back  President 
Georgi  Dimitrov's  short-lived  plan  for  federation  with  Yugoslavia. 
Then,  between  the  censuses  of  1956  and  1965,  the  number  of 
Macedonians  dropped  from  187,789  to  9,632.  After  that  time,  the 
Bulgarian  census  ceased  identifying  citizens  by  nationality. 

Gypsies 

Although  Gypsies  are  known  to  have  lived  in  Bulgaria  since  the 
fourteenth  century,  most  of  the  Gypsy  population  arrived  in  the 
past  few  centuries.  The  last  known  group  was  forced  to  settle  in 
1958,  having  remained  nomadic  until  that  time.  The  Gypsy  popu- 
lation was  divided  into  three  groups.  According  to  the  1965  cen- 
sus, the  last  that  enumerated  Bulgarians  by  nationality,  42.5  percent 
were  Orthodox  and  spoke  Bulgarian;  34.2  percent  were  Orthodox 
and  spoke  Romanian  or  Romany,  the  Gypsy  language;  and  22.8 
percent  were  Muslim,  spoke  Turkish,  and  considered  themselves 
ethnic  Turks.  Estimates  in  1990  put  the  Gypsy  population  at  about 
450,000,  some  10  percent  of  whom  lived  in  the  southeastern  city 
of  Sliven. 

The  Gypsies  had  a  long  history  as  one  of  Bulgaria's  most  dis- 
advantaged and  maligned  nationalities.  They  were  the  focus  of  offi- 
cial name-changing  campaigns  in  every  postwar  decade  between 
1950  and  1990.  Despite  their  numbers,  Gypsies  did  not  contrib- 
ute much  to  Bulgarian  society  because  only  about  40  percent  of 
them  attained  the  educational  and  cultural  level  of  the  average  Bul- 
garian. The  other  60  percent  lived  in  extremely  disadvantaged  con- 
ditions, isolated  from  the  mainstream  of  society  by  the  Gypsy 
tradition  of  preserving  ethnic  customs  and  by  Bulgarian  government 
policy.  Government  programs  to  improve  the  lot  of  the  Gypsies 
usually  meant  construction  of  new,  separate  Gypsy  neighborhoods 
rather  than  integration  into  Bulgarian  society.  Housing  in  Gypsy 
neighborhoods  was  always  poor  and  overcrowded.  In  1959  when 
a  new  neighborhood  was  built  in  Sofia,  800  people  moved  into  252 
apartments.  Each  apartment  had  one  and  one-half  rooms  and  no 
kitchen  or  inside  plumbing.  By  1990  about  3,000  people  lived  in 
these  same  apartments. 

The  education  of  Gypsies  who  spoke  Romany  was  inhibited  be- 
cause the  language  has  no  alphabet  or  written  literature.  Gypsy 
children  were  exposed  to  Bulgarian  only  in  school,  hampering  com- 
pletion of  studies  for  many.  The  illiteracy  rate  among  Gypsies  was 
believed  to  be  still  quite  high  in  1990,  although  no  statistics  were 


86 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


available.  According  to  the  only  known  literacy  figures  for  nation- 
alities, given  in  the  1926  census,  8.2  percent  of  Gypsies  were  liter- 
ate compared  with  54.4  percent  of  Bulgarians  overall  (see 
Education,  this  ch.).  The  Gypsy  community  exerted  littie  pressure 
on  students  to  finish  school;  many  dropped  out  before  reaching 
legal  working  age,  increasing  the  tendency  to  marry  and  begin  hav- 
ing children  early. 

In  1990  about  70  percent  of  Gypsy  workers  were  unskilled  and 
worked  as  general  laborers,  custodians,  street  cleaners,  dishwash- 
ers, or  in  other  minimum- wage  occupations.  About  20  percent  of 
Gypsies  worked  at  skilled  jobs.  The  small  Gypsy  intelligentsia, 
which  included  musicians,  scholars,  professionals  in  various  fields, 
and  political  figures,  tried  to  influence  their  countrymen  to  gain 
more  education  and  job  skills.  Pressure  also  was  exerted  for  elimi- 
nation of  separate  Gypsy  neighborhoods  and  official  replacement 
of  the  derogatory  Bulgarian  word  tsiganin  with  rom,  the  Romany 
word  for  Gypsy. 

Other  Minorities 

Because  of  official  suppression  of  nationality  statistics,  little  in- 
formation was  available  on  less  numerous  minorities  in  Bulgaria 
between  1965  and  1990.  Most  of  the  Tatar  population  (6,430  in 
1965)  had  migrated  from  the  Crimea  to  the  cities  of  the  Dobruja 
area  in  the  nineteenth  century.  The  Greek  minority  (8,241  in  1965) 
comprised  political  emigres  from  Greece  and  the  remainder  of  a 
population  in  southern  Bulgaria  that  had  been  largely  forced  out 
of  Bulgaria  by  government  oppression  and  violence  between  the 
world  wars.  The  Armenian  population  (20,282  in  1965)  was  mostly 
added  between  1896  and  1924  during  the  massive  emigration  of 
Armenians  from  the  Ottoman  Empire.  The  Armenians  were  con- 
centrated in  the  cities,  especially  Sofia  and  Plovdiv.  In  1946  some 
44,209  Jews  remained  in  Bulgaria,  which  had  conducted  no  large- 
scale  persecution  despite  its  wartime  alliance  with  Nazi  Germany. 
But  massive  emigration  of  Jews  to  Israel  in  the  1950's  substan- 
tially reduced  that  number. 

Religion 

The  Bulgarian  Orthodox  Church,  which  played  a  crucial  role 
in  preserving  Bulgarian  culture  during  the  Ottoman  occupation, 
remained  central  to  the  sense  of  Bulgarian  nationhood  even  under 
the  postwar  communist  regimes.  In  spite  of  the  official  status  of 
Orthodoxy,  Bulgaria  also  had  a  tradition  of  tolerance  toward  other 
Christian  religions.  Tolerance  of  Islam,  however,  remained  prob- 
lematic under  all  forms  of  government  because  of  that  religion's 


87

historical  identification  with  the  occupation  and  subjugation  of 
Bulgaria. 

Eastern  Orthodoxy 

In  1991  most  Bulgarians  were  at  least  nominally  members  of 
the  Bulgarian  Orthodox  Church,  an  independent  national  church 
like  the  Russian  Orthodox  Church  and  the  other  national  branches 
of  Eastern  Orthodoxy.  Because  of  its  national  character  and  its  status 
as  the  national  church  in  every  independent  Bulgarian  state  until 
the  advent  of  communism,  the  church  was  considered  an  insepara- 
ble element  of  Bulgarian  national  consciousness  (see  Bulgarians, 
this  ch.).  Baptism,  before  1944  an  indispensable  rite  establishing 
individual  identity,  retained  this  vital  role  for  many  even  after  the 
communists  took  power.  The  power  of  this  tradition  caused  the 
communist  state  to  introduce  a  naming  ritual  called  "civil  baptism." 

Although  communist  regimes  could  not  eliminate  all  influence, 
they  did  undermine  church  authority  significantly.  First,  the  com- 
munists ruled  that  the  church  only  had  authority  on  church  mat- 
ters and  could  not  take  part  in  political  life.  Second,  although  the 
constitution  made  the  church  separate  from  the  state,  the  clergy's 
salaries  and  the  fees  needed  to  maintain  the  churches  were  paid 
by  the  state.  This  meant  that  the  clergy  had  to  prove  its  loyalty 
to  the  state.  From  1949  until  1989,  religion  in  Bulgaria  was  mainly 
controlled  by  the  Law  on  Religious  Organizations,  which  enumer- 
ated the  limitations  on  the  constitution's  basic  separation  of  church 
and  state. 

The  number  of  Orthodox  priests  declined  from  3,312  in  1947 
to  1,700  in  1985.  Priests  associated  with  the  prewar  regime  were 
accused  of  engaging  in  illegal  or  antisocialist  activities,  supporting 
the  opposition,  and  propagandizing  against  the  state.  Upon  tak- 
ing control  of  all  church  property,  the  state  had  the  choice  of  main- 
taining churches  or  closing  them  down.  Thus,  for  example,  Rila 
Monastery,  the  largest  monastery  in  Bulgaria,  became  a  national 
museum  in  1961. 

In  1987  the  Orthodox  Church  in  Bulgaria  had  3,720  churches 
and  chapels,  120  monasteries,  981  regular  and  738  retired  priests, 
135  monks,  and  170  nuns.  The  church  was  administered  by  a  Holy 
Synod.  Under  communist  rule,  the  synod  had  the  authority  to  pub- 
lish limited  quantities  of  religious  material  such  as  magazines, 
newspapers,  and  church  calendars.  A  new  translation  of  the  Bible 
was  published  in  1982,  but  in  such  small  quantities  that  the  size 
of  the  printing  could  not  be  determined.  By  1988  the  1982  edition 
was  being  resold  at  ten  times  the  original  price.

After  the  fall  of  Zhivkov,  the  Orthodox  Church  and  other 
churches  in  Bulgaria  experienced  a  revival.  Church  rituals  such 
as  baptisms  and  church  weddings  attracted  renewed  interest,  and 
traditional  church  holidays  were  observed  more  widely.  Christmas 
1990,  the  first  Christmas  under  the  new  regime,  was  widely  cele- 
brated and  greatly  promoted  in  the  mass  media.  During  the  post- 
war years,  Christmas  had  received  little  public  attention.  The 
government  returned  some  church  property,  including  the  Rila 
Monastery,  and  religious  education  and  Bible  study  increased  in 
the  early  post-Zhivkov  years.  The  Orthodox  seminary  in  Sofia 
returned  to  its  original  home  in  1990  and  attracted  over  100  male 
and  female  students  in  its  first  year  of  operation.  The  Konstantin 
Preslavski  Higher  Pedagogical  Institute  added  a  new  theology 
department  to  train  theology,  art,  and  music  teachers  as  well  as 
priests.  The  Holy  Synod  planned  to  publish  300,000  Orthodox 
Bibles  in  1992. 

Islam 

The  Muslim  population  of  Bulgaria,  including  Turks,  Pomaks, 
Gypsies,  and  Tatars,  lived  mainly  in  northeastern  Bulgaria  and 
in  the  Rhodope  Mountains.  Most  were  Sunni  Muslims  (see  Glos- 
sary) because  Sunni  Islam  had  been  promoted  by  the  Ottoman 


89 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Turks  when  they  ruled  Bulgaria.  Shia  sects  (see  Glossary)  such  as 
the  Kuzulbashi  and  the  Bektashi  also  were  present,  however.  About 
80,000  Shia  Muslims  lived  in  Bulgaria,  mainly  in  the  Razgrad, 
Sliven,  and  Tutrakan  (northeast  of  Ruse)  regions.  They  were  main- 
ly descendants  of  Bulgarians  who  had  converted  to  Islam  to  avoid 
Ottoman  persecution  but  chose  a  Shia  sect  because  of  its  greater 
tolerance  toward  different  national  and  religious  customs.  For 
example,  Kuzulbashi  Bulgarians  could  maintain  the  Orthodox  cus- 
toms of  communion,  confession,  and  honoring  saints.  This  integra- 
tion of  Orthodox  customs  into  Islam  gave  rise  to  a  type  of  syncretism 
found  only  in  Bulgaria. 

As  of  1987,  Muslims  in  Bulgaria  had  1,267  mosques  served  by 
533  khodzhai,  or  religious  community  leaders.  The  Muslim  hierar- 
chy was  headed  by  one  chief  mufti  and  eight  regional  muftis,  in- 
terpreters of  Muslim  law,  all  of  whom  served  five-year  terms.  The 
largest  mosque  in  Bulgaria  was  the  Tumbul  Mosque  in  Shumen, 
built  in  1744. 

Bulgarian  Muslims  were  subject  to  particular  persecution  in  the 
later  years  of  the  Zhivkov  regime,  partly  because  the  Orthodox 
Church  traditionally  considered  them  foreigners,  even  if  they  were 
ethnically  Bulgarian.  In  addition,  the  Bulgarian  communist  regimes 
declared  traditional  Muslim  beliefs  to  be  diametrically  opposed  to 
communist  and  Bulgarian  beliefs.  This  view  justified  repression 
of  Muslim  beliefs  and  integration  of  Muslims  into  the  larger  soci- 
ety as  part  of  the  class  and  ideological  struggle. 

Like  the  practitioners  of  the  other  faiths,  Muslims  in  Bulgaria 
enjoyed  greater  religious  freedom  after  the  fall  of  the  Zhivkov  re- 
gime. New  mosques  were  built  in  many  cities  and  villages;  one 
village  built  a  new  church  and  a  new  mosque  side  by  side.  Some 
villages  organized  Quran  (also  seen  as  Koran)  study  courses  for 
young  people  (study  of  the  Quran  had  been  completely  forbidden 
under  Zhivkov).  Muslims  also  began  publishing  their  own 
newspaper,  Miusiulmani,  in  both  Bulgarian  and  Turkish. 

Roman  Catholicism 

Roman  Catholic  missionaries  first  tried  to  convert  the  Bulgari- 
ans during  the  reign  of  Boris  I.  They  were  unsuccessful,  and  Boris 
I  led  the  Bulgarians  in  their  conversion  to  Orthodoxy.  In  1204  the 
Bulgarian  Tsar  Kaloian  (1197-1207)  formed  a  short-lived  union 
between  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  the  Bulgarian  Ortho- 
dox Church  as  a  political  tactic  to  balance  the  religious  power  of 
the  Byzantine  Empire.  The  union  ended  when  Rome  declared  war 
on  Bulgaria,  and  the  Bulgarian  patriarchate  was  reestablished  in 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


1235.  The  Catholic  Church  had  no  influence  in  the  Bulgarian 
Empire  after  that  date. 

Catholic  missionaries  renewed  their  interest  in  Bulgaria  during 
the  sixteenth  century,  when  they  were  aided  by  merchants  from 
Dubrovnik  on  the  Adriatic.  In  the  next  century,  Vatican  mission- 
aries converted  most  of  the  Paulicians,  the  remainder  of  a  once- 
numerous  heretical  Christian  sect,  to  Catholicism.  Many  believed 
that  conversion  would  bring  aid  from  Western  Europe  in  liberat- 
ing Bulgaria  from  the  Ottoman  Empire.  By  1700,  however,  the 
Ottomans  began  persecuting  Catholics  and  preventing  their  Or- 
thodox subjects  from  converting. 

After  Bulgaria  became  independent,  the  Catholic  Church  again 
tried  to  increase  its  influence  by  opening  schools,  colleges,  and  hos- 
pitals throughout  the  country,  and  by  offering  scholarships  to  stu- 
dents who  wished  to  study  abroad.  Prince  Ferdinand  of  Saxe- 
Coburg-Gotha,  first  ruler  of  independent  Bulgaria,  was  himself 
Catholic  and  supported  the  Vatican  in  these  efforts.  The  papal 
nuncio  Angelo  Roncalli,  who  later  became  Pope  John  XXIII, 
played  a  leading  role  in  establishing  Catholic  institutions  in  Bul- 
garia and  in  establishing  diplomatic  relations  between  Bulgaria  and 
the  Vatican  in  1925. 

The  communist  era  was  a  time  of  great  persecution  for  Catho- 
lics, nominally  because  Catholicism  was  considered  the  religion  of 
fascism.  Bulgarian  communists  also  deemed  Catholicism  a  foreign 
influence  because,  unlike  Orthodoxy,  it  had  no  ties  to  Russia.  The 
logic  was  that  anything  anti-Russian  must  also  be  anti-Bulgarian. 
Under  the  communist  regimes,  Catholic  priests  were  charged  with 
following  Vatican  orders  to  conduct  antisocialist  activities  and  help 
opposition  parties.  In  1949  foreign  priests  were  forbidden  to  preach 
in  Bulgaria,  and  the  papal  nuncio  was  forbidden  to  return  to  Bul- 
garia. Relations  between  the  Vatican  and  Bulgaria  were  severed 
at  that  time.  During  the  "Catholic  trials"  of  1951-52,  sixty  priests 
were  convicted  of  working  for  Western  intelligence  agencies  and 
collecting  political,  economic,  and  military  intelligence  for  the  West. 
Four  priests  were  executed  on  the  basis  of  these  charges.  In  the 
early  1950s,  the  property  of  Catholic  parishes  was  confiscated,  all 
Catholic  schools,  colleges,  and  clubs  were  closed,  and  the  Catho- 
lic Church  was  deprived  of  its  legal  status.  Only  nominal  official 
toleration  of  Catholic  worship  remained. 

In  1991  about  44,000  Roman  Catholics  remained  in  Bulgaria, 
mostly  in  Ruse,  Sofia,  and  Plovdiv.  Another  18,000  Uniate  Catho- 
lics were  concentrated  in  Sofia.  (Uniate  Catholics  recognize  the 
pope  as  their  spiritual  leader,  but  practice  the  Eastern  Orthodox 
rite.)  Bulgaria  reestablished  relations  with  the  Vatican  in  1990,  and 


91 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


the  Bulgarian  government  invited  the  pope  to  visit  Bulgaria.  Uniate 
Catholics  began  assisting  Western-rite  Catholics  in  conducting 
masses  in  Bulgarian,  making  the  Liturgy  more  accessible,  and 
prompting  predictions  that  the  two  branches  would  unite.  Rela- 
tions had  not  been  established  between  the  Bulgarian  Orthodox 
Church  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  1991.  however,  and 
Catholics  blamed  official  Orthodox  intolerance  for  the  continued 
rift. 

Protestantism 

Protestantism  was  introduced  in  Bulgaria  by  missionaries  from 
the  United  States  in  1857-58.  amid  the  National  Revival  period. 
The  two  main  denominations,  the  Methodists  and  Congregation- 
alists,  divided  their  areas  of  influence.  The  former  predominated 
in  northern  Bulgaria  and  the  latter  in  the  south.  In  1875  the  Pro- 
testant denominations  united  in  the  Bulgarian  Evangelical  Philan- 
thropic Society,  which  later  became  the  Union  of  Evangelical 
Churches  in  Bulgaria.  Besides  setting  up  churches,  the  Protestants 
established  schools,  clinics,  and  youth  clubs  in  Bulgaria,  and  dis- 
tributed copies  of  the  Bible  and  their  own  religious  publications. 
The  Union  of  Evangelical  Churches  produced  the  first  translation 
of  the  entire  Bible  into  Bulgarian  in  1871  and  founded  the  non- 
denominational  Robert  College  in  Constantinople,  where  many 
Bulgarian  leaders  of  the  post-independence  era  were  educated.  After 
independence  in  1878.  the  Protestants  gained  influence  because 
they  used  the  vernacular  in  services  and  in  religious  literature. 

The  communist  regimes  subjected  Protestants  to  even  greater 
persecution  than  they  did  the  Catholics.  In  1946  church  funding 
was  cut  off  by  a  law  curbing  foreign  currency  transactions.  Because 
many  ministers  had  been  educated  in  the  West  before  World  War 
II.  they  were  automatically  suspected  of  supporting  the  opposition 
parties.  In  1949  thirty-one  Protestant  clergymen  were  charged  with 
working  for  American  intelligence  and  running  a  spy  ring  in  Bul- 
garia. All  church  property  was  confiscated,  and  the  churches'  legal 
status  was  revoked.  Most  of  the  mainstream  Protestant  denomi- 
nations maintained  the  nominal  right  to  worship,  as  guaranteed 
by  the  constitution  of  1947. 

According  to  estimates  in  1991.  the  5.000  to  6.000  Pentecostals 
in  Bulgaria  made  that  sect  the  largest  Protestant  group  (see  table 
7.  Appendix).  The  Pentecostal  movement  was  brought  to  Bulgaria 
in  1921  by  Russian  emigres.  The  movement  later  spread  to  Varna, 
Sliven.  Sofia,  and  Pleven.  It  gained  popularity  in  Bulgaria  after 
freedom  of  religion  was  declared  in  1944.  and  the  fall  of  Zhivkov 
brought  another  surge  of  interest.  In  1991  the  Pentecostal  Church 


92 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


had  thirty-six  clergy  in  forty-three  parishes,  with  sufficient  con- 
centration in  Ruse  to  petition  the  government  to  establish  a  Bible 
institute  there. 

In  1991  the  Adventist  Church  had  3,500  Bulgarian  members, 
two-thirds  of  them  young  people.  The  Adventist  movement  began 
in  the  Dobruja  region  of  Bulgaria  at  the  turn  of  the  century  and 
then  spread  to  Tutrakan,  Ruse,  Sofia,  and  Plovdiv.  It  gained  mo- 
mentum in  Bulgaria  after  1944.  Under  the  communist  regimes, 
mainstream  Adventists  maintained  the  right  to  worship.  Some 
twenty  parishes  with  forty  pastors  remained  active  through  that 
era,  although  a  breakaway  reformed  group  was  banned  because 
of  its  pacifist  beliefs.  Some  Adventists  were  imprisoned  for  refusal 
of  military  service. 

Judaism 

The  Bulgarian  communist  regimes  officially  considered  Jews  a 
nationality  rather  than  a  religious  group.  For  that  reason,  and  be- 
cause nearly  90  percent  of  the  country's  Jewish  population  emi- 
grated to  Israel  after  World  War  II,  the  Jewish  society  that  remained 
in  Bulgaria  was  mainly  secular.  Under  the  Zhivkov  regime,  syna- 
gogues rarely  were  open  in  Sofia,  Samokov,  and  Vidin.  In  1990 
the  Jewish  population  was  estimated  at  about  71,000.  At  that  time, 
only  two  rabbis  were  active,  although  several  synagogues  report- 
edly were  reopened  under  the  new  regime.  Most  of  the  Jews  in 
Bulgaria  were  Sephardic,  descended  from  Spanish  Jews  who  spoke 
Hebrew  or  Ladino  (a  Judeo-Spanish  dialect).  A  much  smaller  num- 
ber were  Ashkenazi,  with  Yiddish-speaking  ancestors.  However, 
very  few  Jews  in  postcommunist  Bulgaria  remembered  their  an- 
cestral languages,  and  frequent  mixed  marriages  further  diluted 
feelings  of  Jewish  identity.  The  Jews  of  Bulgaria  assimilated  eas- 
ily into  Bulgarian  society,  partly  because  they  traditionally  lived 
in  cities  and  worked  as  tradesmen  or  financiers. 

The  fate  of  Bulgarian  Jews  during  World  War  II  was  a  source 
of  Bulgarian  pride.  The  approximately  50,000  Jews  then  living  in 
Bulgaria  had  long  been  well  integrated  into  the  fabric  of  Bulgar- 
ian city  life.  Because  of  this  integration,  neither  society  in  general 
nor  Tsar  Boris  III  was  inclined  to  follow  the  anti-Jewish  policies 
of  Bulgaria's  Nazi  ally.  Boris  tried  to  appease  the  Nazis  by  pass- 
ing comparatively  benign  anti-Jewish  laws,  which  nevertheless 
were  protested  widely,  especially  by  the  Bulgarian  Orthodox 
Church.  Twice  in  1943,  Boris  personally  blocked  orders  to  deport 
Bulgarian  Jews,  sending  them  instead  to  so-called  labor  camps  in- 
side Bulgaria.  Many  Jews  also  received  transit  visas  to  Palestine 
at  this  time.

Social  System 

Most  manifestations  of  traditional  Bulgarian  familial  and  socie- 
tal relations  disappeared  in  the  initial  postwar  wave  of  moderniza- 
tion. Some  traditions,  however,  proved  surprisingly  persistent  and 
survived  into  the  1990s,  especially  in  parts  of  western  and  south- 
western Bulgaria.  Although  postwar  communist  regimes  nominally 
emphasized  emancipation  of  women,  strong  elements  of  paternal- 
ism and  emphasis  on  traditional  female  roles  remained  in  Bulgar- 
ian society.  By  1990  economic  forces  had  eliminated  traditional 
extended  families  and  limited  the  number  of  children,  especially 
in  urban  areas.  Some  evidence  of  resuming  traditional  relation- 
ships was  seen  in  the  immediate  post-Zhivkov  years. 

Traditional  Society 

Traditional  Bulgarian  society  had  three  classes:  the  peasants 
(almost  everyone  in  the  villages),  the  chorbadzhii  (a  small  wealthy 
class  that  owned  large  tracts  of  land  and  hired  peasants  to  work 
them),  and  the  esnafi  (skilled  tradespeople  in  towns,  who  later  be- 
came the  bourgeoisie).  Most  references  to  traditional  Bulgarian 
society  described  village  or  peasant  society  because  until  the  com- 
munist era  the  great  majority  of  Bulgarians  were  peasants. 

The  most  important  institution  of  traditional  Bulgarian  society 
was  the  zadruga,  an  extended  family  composed  of  ten  to  twenty  small 
families,  related  by  blood,  who  lived  and  worked  together,  owned 
property  jointly,  and  recognized  the  authority  of  a  single  patriarch. 
The  extended  family  most  often  included  four  generations  of  men, 
the  wives  whom  these  men  brought  into  the  household  through  mar- 
riage, and  the  children  produced  through  these  marriages.  Once 
a  girl  married,  she  would  leave  the  zadruga  of  her  parents  for  that 
of  her  husband.  No  member  of  the  zadruga  had  any  personal 
property  other  than  clothes  or  the  women's  dowries. 

Traditional  Bulgarian  society  was  strongly  patriarchal.  The  zadruga 
leader,  called  the  "old  man"  or  the  "lord  of  the  house,"  had  ab- 
solute power  over  his  family  and  was  treated  with  the  utmost  respect. 
He  was  considered  the  wisest  because  he  had  lived  the  longest.  His 
duties  included  managing  the  purchase  and  sale  of  all  household 
property,  division  of  labor  among  zadruga  members,  and  settling 
personal  disputes.  Older  men  within  the  household  could  offer  ad- 
vice, but  the  "old  man"  had  the  final  word.  Obligatory  signs  of 
familial  respect  included  rising  whenever  he  appeared  and  eating 
only  after  he  had  begun  and  before  he  had  finished  his  meal.  The 
"old  man's"  wife  (or  the  senior  woman  if  he  were  widowed)  had 
similar  authority  over  traditional  women's  activities  such  as  tending 


94 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  garden,  observing  holiday  rituals,  and  sewing.  The  senior 
woman  commanded  similar  respect  from  zadruga  members,  but  she 
was  never  allowed  to  interfere  in  functions  designated  for  men. 

When  a  zadruga  broke  up  (normally  because  it  became  too  large 
for  easy  management),  property  was  divided  equally  among  its 
members.  Before  the  twentieth  century,  many  villages  were  formed 
as  outgrowths  of  an  enlarged  zadruga.  The  largest  of  the  extended 
family  organizations  in  Bulgaria  began  breaking  up  in  the  1840s. 
At  that  time,  the  Ottoman  Empire  instituted  new  inheritance  laws 
that  did  not  take  zadruga  property  patterns  into  account.  A  second 
stage  of  fragmentation  occurred  as  the  expectation  of  automatic 
integration  into  the  extended  family  gradually  weakened  in  youn- 
ger generations:  sons  began  leaving  the  zadruga  at  the  death  of  the 
"old  man,"  and  newly  arrived  wives  failed  to  adjust  to  the  tradi- 
tional system.  As  a  result  of  such  pressures,  smaller  households 
began  to  proliferate  in  the  nineteenth  century. 

The  zadruga  breakup  accelerated  after  Bulgaria  gained  its  indepen- 
dence and  began  instituting  Western-style  laws  that  gave  women 
equal  inheritance  rights,  although  in  many  parts  of  Bulgaria  women 
did  not  begin  demanding  their  legal  inheritance  until  well  into  the 
twentieth  century.  The  disintegration  of  large  family  holdings 
gradually  led  to  the  impoverishment  of  the  peasants  as  land  owner- 
ship became  more  fragmented  and  scattered  with  each  generation. 
The  durability  of  the  extended  family  was  reflected  in  the  1934  cen- 
sus, however,  which  still  listed  a  category  of  household  size  as 
"thirty-one  and  over."  Furthermore,  even  after  extended  fami- 
lies broke  up,  many  peasants  continued  to  work  cooperatively. 

The  familial  system  sometimes  extended  to  include  godparents 
and  adopted  brothers  and  sisters — unrelated  individuals  enjoying 
the  same  status  as  close  relatives.  Godparenthood  included  another 
set  of  traditional  relationships  that  knit  village  society  together.  God- 
parents kept  close  ties  with  their  godchildren  throughout  their  lives, 
and  the  godparent/godchild  relationship  could  be  transferred  from 
generation  to  generation.  Godparents  were  treated  with  the  utmost 
respect  and  had  an  important  role  in  all  important  events  in  a  god- 
child's life,  beginning  with  baptism.  The  familial  relationship  was 
so  strong  that  a  taboo  developed  against  the  marriage  of  children 
related  to  the  same  family  only  through  godparenthood. 

After  the  decline  of  the  zadruga,  the  patriarchal  system  continued 
to  flourish  in  the  smaller  families,  where  husbands  gained  owner- 
ship of  family  property  and  all  the  patriarchal  status  the  old  men 
once  had.  The  status  of  wives  remained  distinctly  secondary.  Upon 
marriage  a  woman  still  severed  all  ties  with  her  family  if  her  hus- 
band's family  lived  in  another  village.  Thus,  couples  always  looked

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

forward  to  the  birth  of  sons  rather  than  daughters  because  sons 
would  always  remain  family  members.  Men  traditionally  married 
between  the  ages  of  twenty  and  twenty-two;  women,  between  eigh- 
teen and  twenty.  In  areas  where  daughters  were  needed  as  laborers 
at  home,  marriage  might  be  postponed  until  age  twenty-five.  Ar- 
ranged marriages,  common  until  the  communist  era,  persisted  in 
the  most  traditional  villages  until  the  1960s. 

Only  in  the  twentieth  century  did  men  begin  to  consult  their  wives 
in  family  decisions.  Until  that  time,  wives  were  expected  to  give 
blind  obedience  to  their  husbands.  A  woman  who  dared  question 
or  interfere  in  a  man's  work  was  universally  condemned.  Women 
waited  for  a  man  to  pass  rather  than  crossing  his  path,  and  wives 
often  walked  with  heavy  loads  while  their  husbands  rode  on  horse- 
back. The  wife  was  responsible  for  all  work  inside  the  house  and 
for  helping  her  husband  in  the  field  as  well. 

Children  typically  began  to  share  in  household  work  at  the  age 
of  five  or  six.  At  that  age,  girls  began  to  do  household  work,  and 
by  age  twelve  they  had  usually  mastered  most  of  the  traditional 
household  skills.  By  age  twelve  or  thirteen,  boys  were  expected  to 
do  the  same  field  work  as  adults.  Alternatively,  boys  might  begin 
learning  a  trade  such  as  tailoring  or  blacksmithing  at  six  or  seven. 
As  the  size  of  farmland  parcels  diminished  and  field  labor  became 
less  critical,  more  families  sent  children  away  from  home  to  learn 
trades.  Village  boys  apprenticed  in  cities  sometimes  became  ac- 
customed to  city  life  and  did  not  return  to  the  village. 

Family  Life  and  Modern  Society 

Throughout  the  era  of  postwar  communist  modernization,  fam- 
ily life  remained  one  of  the  most  important  values  in  Bulgarian 
society.  In  a  1977  sociological  survey,  95  percent  of  women  re- 
sponded that  "one  can  live  a  full  life  only  if  one  has  a  family." 
From  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  until  the  1970s,  the 
marriage  rate  in  Bulgaria  was  stable  at  close  to  10  percent  per  year. 
The  rate  was  slightly  higher  just  after  the  two  world  wars.  The  rate 
fell  beginning  in  1980,  however,  reaching  7  percent  in  1989.  Slightly 
more  couples  married  in  the  cities  than  in  the  villages,  a  natural 
development  considering  the  aging  of  the  village  population.  Most 
women  married  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and  twenty-five,  most 
men  between  twenty  and  twenty-five.  Village  men  and  less  edu- 
cated city  men  typically  married  before  they  were  twenty.  The  first 
men  to  marry  often  were  those  who  had  completed  their  military 
service,  did  not  plan  further  education,  and  could  support  them- 
selves financially  (see  Recruitment  and  Service  Obligations,  ch.  5; 
Education,  this  ch.).  Those  who  continued  their  education  often 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


delayed  marriage  until  their  late  twenties.  In  choosing  their  spouses, 
the  less  educated  and  those  from  more  traditional  regions  of  Bul- 
garia sought  qualities  most  highly  valued  in  traditional  society:  love 
of  hard  work,  modesty,  and  good  character.  Among  the  educated 
classes,  values  such  as  personal  respect,  commonality  of  interests, 
and  education  were  more  often  predominant  in  the  choice  of  a 
spouse. 

Until  1944  divorce  was  quite  rare  in  Bulgaria,  and  great  stigma 
was  attached  to  all  individuals  who  had  divorced.  After  1944  the 
divorce  rate  rose  steadily  until  1983,  when  it  reached  16.3  percent. 
Between  1983  and  1986,  however,  the  rate  fell  to  11.2  percent.  In 
the  1980s,  the  divorce  rate  in  the  cities  was  more  than  twice  that 
in  the  villages,  in  part  because  the  village  population  was  older. 
The  divorce  rate  was  especially  high  for  couples  married  five  years 
or  less;  that  group  accounted  for  44  percent  of  all  divorces.  In  1991 
the  rate  was  increasing,  however,  for  those  married  longer  than 
five  years. 

Concerned  about  Bulgaria's  low  birth  rate,  the  government  is- 
sued new  restrictions  on  divorce  in  its  1985  Family  Code.  The  fee 
to  apply  for  a  divorce  was  more  than  three  months'  average  sal- 
ary, and  every  application  for  a  divorce  required  an  investigation. 
The  grounds  most  often  listed  in  a  divorce  application  were  infi- 
delity, habitual  drunkenness,  and  incompatibility. 

In  1991  the  average  Bulgarian  family  included  four  people.  Fam- 
ilies of  two  to  five  people  were  common,  whereas  families  of  six 
or  more  were  rare.  In  the  larger  families,  moreover,  the  additional 
members  usually  included  one  or  two  of  the  couple's  parents.  In 
1980  extended  families  spanning  three  or  even  four  generations 
made  up  17  percent  of  all  households,  indicating  the  persistence 
of  the  extended  family  tradition.  Although  the  tradition  was  more 
prevalent  in  the  villages  of  western  and  southern  Bulgaria  than  in 
the  cities,  many  urban  newly  weds  lived  with  their  parents  because 
they  could  not  afford  or  obtain  separate  apartments. 

Socialist  Bulgaria  greatly  emphasized  the  emancipation  of 
women.  The  1971  constitution  expressly  stated  that  "all  citizens 
of  the  People's  Republic  of  Bulgaria  are  equal  before  the  law,  and 
no  privileges  or  limitations  of  rights  based  on  national,  religious, 
sex,  race,  or  educational  differences  are  permitted"  and  that 
"women  and  men  in  the  People's  Republic  of  Bulgaria  have  the 
same  rights."  Bulgaria's  Family  Code  also  affirmed  equal  rights 
for  men  and  women. 

In  1988  Bulgaria's  work  force  included  an  almost  equal  num- 
ber of  men  (50. 1  percent)  and  women  (49.9  percent).  By  1984  nearly 
70  percent  of  working  women  surveyed  said  that  they  could  not 


99 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

imagine  life  without  their  professional  work,  even  if  they  did  not 
need  the  pay.  Only  9  percent  of  the  women  preferred  being  house- 
wives. However,  most  men  surveyed  in  1988  cited  economics  as 
the  reason  for  their  wives  to  work,  asserting  that  the  wives  should 
give  up  their  work  if  they  were  needed  at  home. 

Household  chores  remained  primarily  the  responsibility  of 
women,  including  most  working  wives.  In  1990  the  average  work- 
ing woman  spent  eight  and  one-half  hours  at  her  job  and  over  four 
and  one-half  hours  doing  housework:  cooking,  washing  dishes, 
washing  clothes,  ironing,  mending,  and  tending  the  children.  In 
many  households,  such  tasks  were  still  considered  "women's  work," 
to  which  husbands  contributed  little. 

In  their  social  planning,  Bulgarian  legislators  usually  viewed  their 
country's  women  mainly  as  mothers,  not  as  workers.  Besides  the 
laws  passed  in  an  effort  to  increase  the  country's  birth  rate,  legis- 
lators passed  laws  giving  certain  privileges  to  women  in  the  work- 
place, often  keeping  their  reproductive  capability  in  mind.  Women 
were  prohibited  by  law  from  doing  heavy  work  or  work  that  would 
adversely  affect  their  health  or  their  capacities  as  mothers.  Women 
sought  such  jobs  because  they  generally  offered  better  pay  and 
benefits.  The  list  of  prohibited  jobs  changed  constantly.  Depend- 
ing on  the  type  of  work,  women  could  retire  after  fifteen  or  twenty 
years,  or  after  reaching  age  forty-five,  fifty,  or  fifty-five.  Women 
who  had  raised  five  or  more  children  could  retire  after  fifteen  years 
of  work,  regardless  of  their  age  or  type  of  work.  Men  were  gener- 
ally offered  retirement  after  working  twenty-five  years  or  reach- 
ing age  fifty,  fifty-five,  or  sixty.  Some  jobs  were  restricted  to  women 
unless  no  women  were  available.  Without  exception  these  were  low- 
skill,  low-paying  jobs  such  as  archivist,  elevator  operator,  ticket 
seller,  coat  checker,  and  bookkeeper.  Other  jobs,  such  as  secre- 
tary, stenographer,  librarian,  cashier,  and  cleaning  person  were 
considered  "appropriate  for  women. "  Men  in  the  workplace  often 
expressed  resentment  of  women  in  positions  of  authority. 

Social  Groups  and  Their  Work 

Postwar  Bulgarian  society  was  divided  into  three  social  groups, 
according  to  type  of  work:  Workers,  who  held  jobs  in  the  "produc- 
tive" manufacturing  sector  of  the  economy;  Employees,  who  worked 
in  "non-productive"  service  and  education  jobs;  and  Agricultural 
workers.  The  intelligentsia,  usually  considered  a  subsector  of  the 
employee  category,  held  professional  or  creative  positions  requir- 
ing specific  qualifications.  In  1987  nonagricultural  workers  made 
up  63  percent  of  the  population,  employees  made  up  18  percent, 
and  agricultural  workers  made  up  19  percent.  The  intelligentsia 


100

made  up  13.5  percent  of  the  total  population  in  1985.  Both  the 
nonagricultural  worker  and  the  employee  category  grew  about  1 5 
percent  between  the  censuses  of  1975  and  1985,  but  the  number 
of  agricultural  workers  dropped  steadily  through  the  1970s  and 
1980s  (see  table  8,  Appendix).  Of  all  people  in  the  work  force  in 
1990,  only  21.7  percent  were  rated  as  highly  qualified.  According 
to  sociologists,  that  figure  would  have  to  more  than  double  if  Bul- 
garia were  to  become  economically  competitive  with  the  West. 

Most  of  those  registered  as  workers  had  jobs  in  industry.  Be- 
tween 1975  and  1985,  the  number  of  workers  in  the  machine- 
building,  spare-parts  and  metal-processing  industries  increased. 
Other  industries,  such  as  the  food  industry,  the  lumber  industry, 
and  the  fuel  industry,  lost  workers.  Most  workers  were  compara- 
tively young,  with  little  education  and  few  work  qualifications  (see 
table  9,  Appendix).  In  1990  some  66.8  percent  of  industrial  work- 
ers had  a  basic  education  or  less.  However,  young  workers  were 
valued  because  they  were  considered  most  capable  of  adapting  to 
new  technology — a  critical  requirement  for  upgrading  Bulgaria's 
outdated  industrial  infrastructure  (see  Labor  Force,  ch.  3). 

In  the  1980s,  employment  grew  in  the  trade,  supply,  construc- 
tion, and  transportation  sectors.  Growing  the  fastest,  however,  were 
the  sectors  requiring  primarily  intellectual  work:  research  and 


101 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

research  services,  education,  and  administration.  After  growing 
by  90  percent  between  1965  and  1985,  administration  included  26 
percent  of  all  employees  and  was  the  largest  division  of  this  category. 
The  housing  sector  was  the  only  component  of  the  employee 
category  that  lost  jobs  between  1975  and  1990. 

The  number  of  agricultural  workers  decreased  markedly  from 
50  percent  of  all  workers  in  1965  to  20  percent  in  1985.  As  agricul- 
tural production  intensified,  many  agricultural  workers  were  trans- 
ferred to  nonagricultural  jobs.  In  the  late  1980s,  however,  a  shortage 
of  agricultural  workers  occurred  because  so  many  people  had  left 
the  villages.  For  this  reason,  labor-intensive  farm  activities  such 
as  harvesting  required  recruitment  of  brigades  from  schools  and 
nonagricultural  enterprises.  Many  of  the  remaining  farm  workers 
could  not  adapt  to  new  technology.  This  lack  of  adaptation  inhibited 
the  modernization  and  mechanization  of  agricultural  processes. 

The  democratization  that  followed  the  Zhivkov  regime  raised  the 
problem  of  unemployment,  unknown  in  Bulgaria  after  1944  (see 
Labor  and  Economic  Reform,  ch.  3).  As  of  April  1991,  some  124,000 
Bulgarians  were  unemployed.  With  the  country  in  the  midst  of  eco- 
nomic restructuring,  enterprise  shutdowns,  and  scarcity  of  raw 
materials,  employment  figures  showed  no  sign  of  improvement.  The 
highest  unemployment  rates  occurred  in  Plovdiv  and  Sofia.  Most 
unemployed  persons  were  under  age  thirty,  and  over  60  percent 
were  women.  Job  vacancies  continued  to  decline  in  1991;  most  re- 
maining opportunities  were  in  low-skilled  jobs  or  jobs  requiring  hard 
physical  labor.  Persons  with  the  highest  level  of  education,  such  as 
engineers,  economists,  and  teachers,  were  least  likely  to  find  suit- 
able positions.  In  1990  the  lack  of  skilled  professional  positions 
spurred  a  "brain  drain"  emigration  that  further  threatened  Bul- 
garia's ability  to  compete  on  technologically  oriented  world  mar- 
kets. In  the  meantime,  the  country's  economy  had  lost  its  protected 
position  as  a  member  of  the  defunct  Comecon,  putting  more  pres- 
sure on  the  domestic  labor  force  (see  Bulgaria  in  Comecon,  ch.  3). 

Because  the  national  welfare  system  could  only  accommodate 
those  who  lost  their  jobs  because  of  enterprise  shutdown,  in  1990 
the  Bulgarian  government  began  seeking  ways  to  create  more  jobs. 
It  considered  rewarding  businesses  that  added  shifts  or  offered  part- 
time  or  seasonal  work,  and  it  encouraged  development  of  small 
business.  One  proposed  solution,  replacing  working  pensioners  with 
young  unemployed  workers,  was  unworkable  because  enterprises 
found  it  less  expensive  to  continue  hiring  pensioners. 

Social  Services 

Between  independence  and  the  communist  era,  the  Bulgarian 
government  had  used  its  social  welfare  funds  mainly  for  government 


102

workers,  army  officers,  white-collar  workers,  craftsmen,  and  trades- 
men. The  1949  social  welfare  law  founded  a  new  social  welfare  sys- 
tem that  endured  into  the  1990s.  The  new  system  greatly  expanded 
the  categories  of  people  eligible  and  the  amounts  they  could  receive. 
The  social  welfare  system  in  1991  was  largely  based  on  the  1951 
section  of  the  Labor  Code  that  regulated  monetary  compensation 
and  supplements,  and  the  1957  Law  on  Pensions.  Both  laws  were 
revised  countless  times  and  no  longer  agree  with  each  other.  The 
National  Assembly  delayed  creation  of  a  new  law  until  the  new 
constitution  was  ratified  in  the  summer  of  1991. 

In  1991  two-thirds  of  Bulgaria's  social  welfare  budget  was  spent 
on  pensions;  the  rest  went  for  monthly  child-care  allowances  and 
other  programs.  As  of  late  1990,  the  Bulgarian  government  provided 
over  4  billion  leva  per  year  to  2,300,000  pensioners — about  one 
fourth  of  the  entire  population.  To  keep  pace  with  the  rising  cost 
of  living  in  the  transition  to  a  Western  economic  system,  the  govern- 
ment had  to  index  pensions  several  times  in  1990.  By  the  begin- 
ning of  1991,  some  165  leva  were  being  added  monthly  to  every 
pension,  casting  doubt  on  the  long-term  possibility  of  maintain- 
ing the  program.  The  ratio  of  Bulgaria's  pensioners  to  its  total  popu- 
lation was  the  largest  in  the  world,  almost  twice  that  of  most  Western 
countries.  Because  the  society  was  aging,  some  experts  declared 


103 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

that  workers  should  be  encouraged  to  remain  in  the  work  force  and 
participate  actively  in  society  much  longer  than  had  been  the  prac- 
tice under  the  communist  regimes. 

In  early  1991,  in  a  further  effort  to  keep  pace  with  the  rising 
cost  of  living,  the  Council  of  Ministers  established  a  new  minimum 
wage  and  new  subsidy  levels  for  all  social  welfare  programs.  Any- 
one who  had  received  the  old  monthly  minimum  wage  of  165  leva 
would  now  be  compensated  270  leva  to  provide  for  a  new  mini- 
mum wage  of  435  leva.  This  minimum  wage  was  subsequently 
changed  three  times  in  1991,  peaking  at  518  leva.  The  1991  pro- 
gram also  gave  242  leva  to  pregnant  or  nursing  women  and  to  those 
on  temporary  workers'  disability.  Child-care  compensation  for 
households  with  children  under  three  years  of  age  was  raised  to 
90  leva,  with  a  monthly  supplement  of  100  leva  per  child.  In  1991 
several  cost-of-living  increases  were  added  to  those  categories  as 
well.  In  1991  unemployment  compensation  was  set  at  270  leva  per 
month;  students  over  eighteen  received  130  leva  per  month;  gradu- 
ate students,  230  leva.  Those  payments  were  funded  from  the  state 
budget  and  from  enterprise  salary  budgets,  neither  of  which  seemed 
adequate  to  keep  pace  with  rapidly  changing  prices  in  1991. 

Under  socialism  all  citizens  who  had  been  awarded  the  title  "ac- 
tive fighter  against  fascism  and  capitalism"  for  military  or  civilian 
contributions  in  World  War  II  received  a  large  pension  and  spe- 
cial privileges  such  as  free  public  transportation,  free  medical 
prescriptions,  and  free  vacations  at  special  resorts.  After  much  con- 
troversy, those  privileges  were  abolished  in  1990. 

Health 

Until  the  1920s,  peasants  relied  on  traditional  medicine  and  went 
to  a  doctor  or  hospital  only  as  a  last  resort.  Traditional  healers  be- 
lieved that  many  illnesses  were  caused  by  evil  spirits  (baiane)  and 
could  therefore  be  treated  with  magic,  with  chants  against  the  spirits, 
with  prayers,  or  by  using  medicinal  herbs.  The  knowledge  of  healing 
herbs  was  highly  valued  in  village  society.  For  healing  one  could 
also  drink,  wash,  or  bathe  in  water  from  mineral  springs,  some 
of  which  were  considered  holy.  Even  in  postcommunist  Bulgaria, 
some  resorted  to  herbal  medicine  or  to  persons  with  reputed  extra- 
sensory healing  powers.  Herbalists  and  "extrasenses"  regained  pop- 
ularity in  Bulgaria  after  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov.  Because  of  the 
skepticism  of  conventional  doctors,  little  research  was  done  on  the 
validity  of  traditional  herbal  medicine,  but  in  1991  doctors  began 
to  consider  rating  skilled  herbalists  as  qualified  specialists. 

Beginning  in  1944,  Bulgaria  made  significant  progress  in  increas- 
ing life  expectancy  and  decreasing  infant  mortality  rates.  In  1986 


104 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Bulgaria's  life  expectancy  was  68.1  years  for  men  and  74.4  years 
for  women.  In  1939  the  mortality  rate  for  children  under  one  year 
had  been  138.9  per  1,000;  by  1986  it  was  18.2  per  1,000,  and  in 
1990  it  was  14  per  1,000,  the  lowest  rate  in  Eastern  Europe.  The 
proportion  of  long-lived  people  in  Bulgaria  was  quite  large;  a  1988 
study  cited  a  figure  of  52  centenarians  per  1  million  inhabitants, 
most  of  whom  lived  in  the  Smolyan,  Kurdzhali,  and  Blagoevgrad 
regions. 

The  steady  demographic  aging  of  the  Bulgarian  population  was 
a  concern,  however.  In  the  1980s,  the  number  of  children  in  the 
population  decreased  by  over  100,000.  The  prenatal  mortality  rate 
for  1989  was  1 1  per  1 ,000,  twice  that  in  West  European  countries. 
In  1989  the  mortality  rate  for  children  of  ages  one  to  fourteen  was 
twice  as  great  as  in  Western  Europe.  The  mortality  rate  for  vil- 
lage children  was  more  than  twice  the  rate  for  city  children. 
However,  in  1990  some  Bulgarian  cities  had  mortality  rates  as  low 
as  8.9  per  1,000,  which  compared  favorably  with  the  rates  in 
Western  Europe. 

Poor  conditions  in  maternity  wards  and  shortages  of  baby  needs 
worried  new  and  prospective  mothers.  Hospital  staff  shortages 
meant  that  doctors  and  nurses  were  overworked  and  babies  received 
scant  attention.  Expensive  neonatal  equipment  was  not  available 
in  every  hospital,  and  transferral  to  better-equipped  facilities  was 
rare.  In  1990  the  standard  minimum  weight  to  ensure  survival  at 
birth  was  1 ,000  grams,  compared  with  the  World  Health  Organi- 
zation standard  of  500  grams. 

The  number  of  medical  doctors,  nurses,  and  dentists  in  Bulgaria 
increased  during  the  1980s.  Bulgaria  had  27,750  doctors  in  1988, 
almost  6,000  more  than  in  1980.  This  meant  one  doctor  for  every 
323  Bulgarians.  Some  257  hospitals  were  operating  in  1990,  with 
105  beds  per  1,000  people. 

Like  other  aspects  of  society,  health  services  underwent  signifi- 
cant reform  after  1989.  In  1990  health  officials  declared  that  the 
socialist  system  of  polyclinics  in  sectors  serving  3,000  to  4,000  people 
did  not  satisfy  the  public's  need  for  more  complex  diagnostic  ser- 
vices. They  claimed  the  system  was  too  centralized  and  bureau- 
cratic, provided  too  few  incentives  for  health  personnel,  and  lacked 
sufficient  modern  equipment  and  supplies.  Thereafter,  new  em- 
phasis was  placed  on  allowing  free  choice  of  a  family  doctor  and 
providing  more  general  practitioners  to  treat  families  on  an  on- 
going basis.  Beginning  in  1990,  Bulgaria  began  accepting  dona- 
tions of  money  and  medicine  from  Western  countries.  During  the 
reform  period,  even  common  medicines  such  as  aspirin  were  some- 
times in  short  supply.  Prices  for  medicines  skyrocketed.  Shortages 


105 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


of  antibiotics,  analgesics,  dressings,  sutures,  and  disinfectants  were 
chronic. 

In  November  1989.  the  Council  of  Ministers  decreed  that  doc- 
tors could  be  self-employed  during  their  time  off  from  their  assigned 
clinics.  Doctors  could  work  for  pay  either  in  health  facilities  or  in 
patients'  homes,  but  with  significant  restrictions.  When  acting  pri- 
vately, they  could  not  certify  a  patient's  health  or  disability,  issue 
prescriptions  for  free  medicine,  perform  outpatient  surgery  or  abor- 
tions, conduct  intensive  diagnostic  tests,  use  anesthetics,  or  serve 
patients  with  infectious  or  venereal  diseases.  In  1990  the  National 
Assembly  extended  the  right  of  private  practice  to  all  qualified  med- 
ical specialists,  and  private  health  establishments  and  pharmacies 
were  legalized.  Church-sponsored  facilities  were  included  in  this 
provision.  The  1990  law  did  not  provide  for  a  health  insurance  sys- 
tem, however,  and  establishment  of  such  a  system  was  not  a  high 
legislative  priority  for  the  early  1990s. 

In  1991  the  government  created  a  National  Health  Council  to 
be  financed  by  2.5  billion  leva  from  the  state  budget  plus  funds 
from  donors  and  payments  for  medical  services.  The  goal  of  the 
new  council  was  to  create  a  more  autonomous  health  system.  Also 
in  1991.  the  Ministry  of  Health  set  up  a  Supreme  Medical  Coun- 
cil and  a  Pharmaceuticals  Council  to  advise  on  proposed  private 
health  centers,  pharmacies,  and  laboratories  and  to  regulate  the 
supply  and  distribution  of  medicine. 

In  1988  the  top  three  causes  of  death  in  Bulgaria  were  cardio- 
vascular illnesses,  cancer,  and  respiratory  illnesses.  An  expert  esti- 
mated that  88  percent  of  all  deaths  were  caused  by  "socially 
significant  diseases"  that  resulted  from  an  unhealthy  lifestyle  and 
were  thus  preventable.  Strokes,  the  most  prevalent  cause  of  death, 
killed  a  higher  percentage  of  the  population  in  Bulgaria  than  any- 
where else  in  the  world.  In  1985  nearly  58.000  Bulgarians  suffered 
strokes,  and  nearly  24.000  of  them  died.  The  mortality  rate  for 
strokes  was  especially  high  in  northern  Bulgaria,  where  it  some- 
times exceeded  300  fatalities  per  100.000  persons.  In  villages  the 
rate  was  three  times  as  high  as  in  the  cities.  Doctors  cited  unhealthy 
eating  habits,  smoking,  alcohol  abuse,  and  stress  as  lifestyle  causes 
of  the  high  stroke  rate. 

In  1990  about  35  percent  of  Bulgarian  women  and  25  percent 
of  men  were  overweight.  Sugar  provided  an  average  of  22  percent 
of  the  calories  in  Bulgarian  diets,  twice  as  much  as  the  standard 
for  balanced  nutrition.  Another  35  percent  of  average  calories  came 
from  animal  fat.  also  twice  as  much  as  the  recommended  amount. 
That  percentage  was  likely  much  higher  in  the  villages,  where  many 
animal  products  were  made  at  home.  Modernization  of  the  food 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


supply  generally  led  to  increased  consumption  of  carbohydrates  and 
fats.  In  contrast,  the  traditional  Bulgarian  diet  emphasized  dairy 
products,  beans,  vegetables,  and  fruits.  Large  quantities  of  bread 
were  always  a  key  element  of  the  Bulgarian  diet.  Average  salt 
consumption  was  also  very  high.  In  1990  the  average  Bulgarian 
consumed  14.5  kilograms  of  bread,  4.4  kilograms  of  meat,  12.6 
kilograms  of  milk  and  milk  products,  15  eggs,  and  15  kilograms 
of  fruits  and  vegetables  per  month. 

In  the  1980s,  Bulgaria  ranked  tenth  in  the  world  in  per  capita 
tobacco  consumption.  Tobacco  consumption  was  growing,  espe- 
cially among  young  people.  Each  Bulgarian  consumed  7.34  liters 
of  alcohol  per  month,  not  including  huge  amounts  of  homemade 
alcoholic  beverages.  Between  1962  and  1982,  recorded  alcohol  con- 
sumption increased  1.6  times. 

In  1990  an  estimated  35  percent  of  the  population  risked  seri- 
ous health  problems  because  of  environmental  pollution  (see  En- 
vironment, this  ch.).  In  the  most  polluted  areas,  the  sickness  rate 
increased  by  as  much  as  twenty  times  in  the  1980s.  By  1990,  pol- 
lution was  rated  the  fastest-growing  cause  of  "socially  significant 
diseases,"  particularly  for  respiratory  and  digestive  disorders.  Doc- 
tors in  the  smelting  center  of  Srednogorie  found  that  the  incidence 
of  cancer,  high  blood  pressure,  and  dental  disorders  had  increased 
significantly  in  the  1980s. 

Pollution  had  an  especially  adverse  effect  on  the  immune  sys- 
tems of  children.  In  the  first  few  years  of  the  Giurgiu  plant's  oper- 
ation, the  number  of  deformed  children  born  across  the  Danube 
in  Ruse  increased  144  percent.  From  1985  to  1990,  this  number 
increased  from  27.5  to  39.7  per  1,000.  Miscarriages,  stillbirths, 
and  premature,  low- weight  births  doubled  during  that  period.  The 
infant  mortality  rate  in  Srednogorie  was  three  times  the  national 
average  in  1990.  Excessive  lead  in  the  soil  and  water  at  Kurdzhali 
had  caused  a  great  increase  in  skin  and  infectious  diseases  in  chil- 
dren there.  In  1990  environmental  authorities  named  the  village 
of  Dolno  Ezerovo,  near  Burgas,  the  "sickest  village  in  Bulgaria" 
because  over  60  percent  of  its  children  suffered  from  severe  respira- 
tory illnesses  and  allergies. 

In  1987  Bulgarian  health  authorities  instituted  limited  manda- 
tory testing  for  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  which  causes 
acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS).  All  prospective 
marriage  partners,  all  pregnant  women,  and  all  transportation 
workers  arriving  from  outside  Bulgaria  were  required  to  be  tested. 
Hemophiliacs,  Bulgarian  navy  sailors  who  had  traveled  abroad  after 
1982,  and  students  and  workers  visiting  vacation  resorts  also  fell 
under  this  rule.  As  of  October  1989,  some  2.5  million  people  in 


107 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Bulgaria,  including  about  66,000  foreigners,  had  been  tested  for 
HIV,  and  81  Bulgarians  were  diagnosed  as  HIV-positive.  Accord- 
ing to  government  figures,  six  of  that  number  had  contracted  AIDS. 
Foreigners  diagnosed  as  HIV-positive  were  ordered  to  leave  the 
country.  Bulgaria  estimated  it  would  spend  over  US$4  million  to 
treat  AIDS  and  HIV-positive  patients  in  1991. 

Housing 

In  the  postwar  era,  housing  in  Bulgaria  improved  significantly 
as  more  and  better-quality  homes  were  built.  Expectations  for  hous- 
ing availability  also  increased  significantly  in  that  time,  however. 
According  to  a  1990  survey,  51  percent  of  all  Bulgarians  were  dis- 
satisfied with  their  current  housing,  and  73  percent  (especially  young 
families)  did  not  believe  that  their  current  housing  would  be  ade- 
quate for  their  future  needs. 

In  1990  the  average  home  in  Bulgaria  had  three  rooms  and  an 
area  of  65  square  meters.  This  small  average  size  reflected  the  policy 
of  the  command  economy,  which  was  to  build  many  small  one- 
or  two-room  apartments  in  large  prefabricated  housing  complexes 
in  order  to  maximize  the  number  of  available  housing  units  and 
meet  growing  demand.  In  1985  some  15.6  percent  of  all  homes 
had  one  room,  31.5  percent  had  two  rooms,  29.6  percent  had  three 
rooms,  14.4  percent  had  four  rooms,  and  only  8.9  percent  had  five 
or  more  rooms.  As  a  result,  65  percent  of  the  population  averaged 
only  half  a  room  per  family  member.  Only  36  percent  of  families 
with  children  under  eighteen  had  a  separate  children's  room;  65 
percent  used  the  living  room  as  a  bedroom;  and  57  percent  used 
the  kitchen  as  a  bedroom.  By  1990  communal  apartments  were 
becoming  rarer,  however;  at  that  time,  12  percent  of  families  shared 
a  kitchen  with  another  family. 

The  predominance  of  small  housing  units  put  larger  families  at 
a  disadvantage.  The  situation  was  also  difficult  for  young  couples, 
60  percent  of  whom  were  forced  to  stay  in  their  parents'  homes 
after  marriage.  In  1990  over  40  percent  of  homes  included  two  or 
more  families  or  other  relatives  of  one  family.  Members  of  three 
or  even  four  generations  often  lived  together.  Traditional  accep- 
tance of  the  extended  family  contributed  to  this  situation,  but  long 
waits  for  separate  housing  also  played  a  critical  role.  In  1979  the 
government  established  a  special  Young  Newlywed  Families  Fund 
that  ensured  that  new  families  would  receive  at  least  25  percent 
of  new  government  housing.  This  program  delivered  more  hous- 
ing to  young  families  in  the  1980s,  but  waiting  lists  also  grew  longer 
during  that  period. 


108 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Living  space  was  much  more  available  in  villages  than  in  cities. 
One-room  homes  were  unusual  in  villages,  and  villagers  were  much 
more  likely  to  live  in  separate  homes  than  in  apartment  complexes. 
Village  houses  usually  had  more  rooms,  but  they  lacked  many  of 
the  modern  conveniences  available  in  city  apartments. 

In  1985  hot  running  water,  a  shower  or  bathtub,  and  an  indoor 
toilet  were  available  in  only  42.4  percent  of  homes.  Between  the 
1975  and  1985  censuses,  the  number  of  households  with  bathtubs 
or  showers  almost  doubled,  from  34.0  percent  to  63.7  percent.  Still, 
only  39.3  percent  of  villagers  had  a  bathtub  or  shower,  and  only 
7.3  percent  of  them  had  an  indoor  toilet.  In  1990  many  villages 
lacked  a  sewage  system  and  relied  on  wells  for  water.  At  that  time, 
about  30  percent  of  Bulgarian  homes  had  electric  heating,  and  34 
percent  were  connected  to  a  steam  central  heating  system. 

Housing  planners  often  overlooked  the  need  for  convenient 
schools,  stores,  and  recreational  facilities.  (For  Bulgarians,  prox- 
imity generally  meant  fifteen  minutes'  walk.)  On  the  average,  70 
to  80  percent  of  construction  funds  went  to  constructing  the  hous- 
ing complexes  themselves,  and  only  20  to  30  percent  went  to  build- 
ing facilities  to  serve  the  residents  of  the  complexes.  This  was 
especially  true  in  Sofia,  where  some  of  the  newest  neighborhoods 
were  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  city. 

Housing  was  affected  by  the  drastic  reform-period  price  hikes 
in  Bulgaria.  At  the  end  of  1990,  apartment  owners  in  Sofia  were 
offering  to  sell  two-room  apartments  at  between  100,000  and 
200,000  leva,  or  to  rent  them  for  600  leva  per  month.  Moreover, 
the  new  economic  system  gave  landlords  the  right  to  evict  tenants 
for  nonpayment  of  rent.  In  1990  prospective  homebuyers  frustrated 
by  the  steeper  housing  prices  established  a  tent  city  in  Sofia  to 
dramatize  the  threat  of  homelessness  (see  The  Ferment  of  1988-90, 
ch.  4). 

Also  at  risk  for  homelessness  were  many  Bulgarian  Turks  who 
had  emigrated  in  1989  but  returned  after  the  overthrow  of  Zhiv- 
kov.  By  1991  the  state  had  bought  many  of  the  Turks'  homes  and 
resold  them;  other  homes  were  occupied  illegally.  In  1991  many 
who  lost  their  homes  in  this  way  went  through  the  bureaucratic 
process  of  reclaiming  their  property.  In  1990  Sofia  created  a  new 
foundation  to  help  the  homeless,  especially  elderly  and  single  peo- 
ple, and  to  aid  in  the  building  and  financing  of  homes. 

Education 

Before  the  National  Revival  of  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  educa- 
tion usually  took  the  form  of  memorization  of  the  liturgy  and  other 
religious  material.  Supporters  of  the  National  Revival  movement 


109 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

were  instrumental  in  establishing  and  supporting  Bulgarian  schools 
in  the  cities — first  for  boys,  and  later  for  girls  as  well.  These  ac- 
tivists also  introduced  the  chitalishta.  Often  located  next  to  a  school, 
the  chitalishta  served  as  community  cultural  centers  as  well  as  reading 
rooms.  The  first  schools,  which  began  opening  in  the  early  nine- 
teenth century,  often  did  not  go  beyond  a  basic  education;  students 
wishing  to  continue  their  education  had  to  go  abroad. 

The  educational  system  established  after  Bulgaria  gained  its  in- 
dependence retained  the  same  basic  structure  through  1989.  The 
1878  Temporary  Law  on  National  Schools  established  free  com- 
pulsory education  in  primary  school  for  both  sexes.  The  schools 
were  designed  to  teach  reading,  writing,  and  basic  arithmetic.  In 
practice,  not  everyone  received  that  education,  but  the  law  gave 
the  villages  an  incentive  to  open  new  schools.  By  the  turn  of  the 
century,  one-third  of  all  Bulgarian  villages  had  primary  schools. 
In  the  early  days,  the  immediate  demand  for  a  large  number  of 
teachers  meant  that  many  new  teachers  had  little  more  education 
than  their  students.  Later  reforms  specified  a  seven-year  standard 
education  with  a  curriculum  based  on  a  West  European  model. 
Some  peasants,  especially  uneducated  ones,  withdrew  their  chil- 
dren from  school  because  they  believed  the  classes  were  unrelated 
to  peasant  life.  This  situation  led  to  the  offering  of  textbooks  and 
prizes  as  an  incentive  for  students  from  poorer  families  to  remain 
in  school. 

Communist  rule  in  Bulgaria  brought  forth  a  new  approach  to 
education  as  a  means  of  indoctrinating  Marxist  theory  and  com- 
munist values.  Literacy  was  promoted  so  that  the  communist- 
controlled  press  could  be  disseminated  throughout  society.  New 
classes  for  both  adults  and  children  aimed  at  providing  as  many 
as  possible  with  a  high-school  education  and  abolishing  illiteracy. 
Schools  switched  their  focus  from  liberal  arts  to  technical  training 
and  introduced  a  curriculum  modeled  on  that  of  the  Soviet  Union. 
Russian  language  study  was  introduced  for  all,  from  kindergart- 
ners  to  adults  who  had  already  completed  their  education.  Copies 
of  Pravda,  the  primary  newspaper  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the 
Soviet  Union,  were  distributed  even  in  isolated  villages.  After  the 
overthrow  of  Zhivkov,  however,  English  became  the  most  studied 
foreign  language  in  Bulgaria,  and  the  study  of  Russian  declined 
dramatically. 

In  1979  Zhivkov  introduced  a  sweeping  educational  reform, 
claiming  that  Marxist  teachings  on  educating  youth  were  still  not 
being  applied  completely.  Zhivkov  therefore  created  Unified  Secon- 
dary Polytechnical  Schools  (Edinna  sredna  politekhnicheska  uchilishta, 
ESPU),  in  which  all  students  would  receive  the  same  general 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


education.  The  system  united  previously  separate  specialized  middle 
schools  in  a  single,  twelve- grade  program  heavily  emphasizing  tech- 
nical subjects.  In  1981  a  national  program  introduced  computers 
to  most  of  the  ESPUs.  The  change  produced  a  chaotic  situation 
in  which  teaching  plans  and  programs  had  to  be  completely  over- 
hauled and  new  textbooks  issued  to  reflect  the  new  educational 
emphasis.  This  project  proved  unworkable,  and  by  1985  new 
specialized  schools  again  were  being  established  (see  table  10,  Ap- 
pendix). 

The  fall  of  Zhivkov  resulted  in  a  complete  restructuring  of  the 
country's  educational  system.  In  retrospect  Bulgarian  educators 
recognized  that  the  socialist  way  of  educating  was  not  only 
bureaucratic,  boring,  and  impersonal,  but  also  led  to  disregard  for 
the  rights  of  the  individual,  intolerance  of  the  opinions  of  others, 
and  aggressive  behavior.  The  centralized  system  with  its  regional 
hierarchies  was  therefore  scrapped  in  favor  of  a  system  of  educa- 
tional councils  in  which  every  400  teachers  could  elect  a  delegate 
to  the  National  Council  of  Teachers.  The  first  goal  of  the  new  or- 
ganization was  to  depoliticize  the  schools  in  cooperation  with  the 
Ministry  of  Public  Education. 

In  1991  the  Bulgarian  educational  system  consisted  of  three  types 
of  schools:  state,  municipal,  and  private  (including  religious).  The 
grade  levels  were  primary  (first  to  fourth  grade),  basic  (fifth  to 
seventh  grade),  and  secondary  (eighth  to  twelfth  grade).  Children 
began  first  grade  at  age  six  or  seven  and  were  required  to  attended 
school  until  age  sixteen.  Parents  also  had  the  option  of  enrolling 
their  children  in  kindergarten  at  age  five.  Secondary  school  stu- 
dents had  the  choice  of  studying  for  three  years  at  professional- 
vocational  schools  or  for  four  years  at  technical  schools  or  general 
high  schools.  Religious  schools  operated  only  on  the  high-school 
level.  Specialized  high  schools  taught  foreign  languages,  mathema- 
tics, and  music;  admittance  to  them  was  by  special  entrance  exams. 
Special  programs  for  gifted  and  talented  children  began  as  early 
as  the  fifth  grade.  Special  schools  also  operated  for  handicapped 
children.  Children  suffering  from  chronic  illnesses  could  receive 
their  schooling  in  a  hospital  or  sanatorium. 

Prior  to  the  postcommunist  reform  era,  about  25,000  students 
dropped  out  every  year  before  reaching  their  sixteenth  birthday; 
another  25,000  failed  to  advance  to  the  next  grade.  Under  the  new 
system,  parents  could  be  fined  500  to  1,000  leva  if  their  children 
failed  to  attend  school;  fines  also  were  levied  for  pupils  retained 
in  grade  for  an  extra  year. 

Public  opinion  on  the  educational  reform  focused  mainly  on 
depolitization.  By  the  1990-91  school  year,  new  textbooks  had  been 


111 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


introduced  in  many  subjects,  but  many  of  them  were  not  completely 
free  of  socialist  rhetoric.  A  first-grade  mathematics  textbook  pub- 
lished in  1990  contained  the  following  exercise:  "Count  how  many 
words  there  are  in  this  sentence:  'I  am  grateful  to  the  Party,  for 
it  leads  my  country  to  beautiful,  radiant  life  and  vigilantly  pro- 
tects us  from  war.  '"A  newly  published  music  book  contained  songs 
about  the  party,  a  communist  youth  organization,  and  Lenin.  Many 
teachers  likewise  continued  to  espouse  the  communist  rhetoric  in 
which  their  profession  had  been  long  and  firmly  indoctrinated.  In 
late  1990,  about  50,000  Sofia  University  students  demonstrated 
against  poor  education  and  against  continued  requirements  to  at- 
tend courses  in  Marxism.  Their  protest  caused  the  university  to 
eliminate  compulsory  political  indoctrination  courses.  The  1991 
Law  on  Public  Education  declared  that  "no  political  activity  is  al- 
lowed in  the  system  of  public  education." 

Depolitization  was  expected  to  be  a  slow  process  because  of  the 
extent  to  which  the  schools  had  been  politicized  before  1990.  At 
the  end  of  1990,  over  90  percent  of  all  teachers  were  still  members 
of  the  Bulgarian  Socialist  (formerly  Communist)  Party.  For  this 
reason,  the  Law  on  Public  Education  prohibited  teachers  from  be- 
coming members  of  political  parties  for  a  period  of  three  years, 
beginning  in  1991 .  Because  the  Zhivkov  regime  had  tinkered  often 
with  Bulgaria's  educational  system,  longtime  teachers  had  devel- 
oped a  cynicism  toward  reform  of  any  type.  This  attitude  ham- 
pered the  removal  of  the  old  socialist  structures  from  the  educational 
system. 

Some  students  married  and  began  families  while  they  were  still 
in  school,  and  two- student  families  were  not  uncommon.  Such  fam- 
ilies often  depended  on  help  from  parents  because  of  their  low  in- 
come and  because  of  a  shortage  of  student  family  housing.  By  1990 
most  Bulgarian  students  worked  in  their  free  time,  unlike  their 
predecessors  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s. 

Reform  also  reached  higher  education.  In  1990  a  new  law  on 
academic  freedom  emphasized  the  concept  of  an  intellectual  mar- 
ket in  which  universities,  teachers,  and  students  must  maintain  high 
performance  levels  to  stay  competitive.  The  law  gave  every  insti- 
tution of  higher  learning  the  right  to  manage  its  teaching  and 
research  activities  without  government  interference.  This  right  in- 
cluded control  over  curriculum,  number  of  students,  standards  for 
student  admissions  and  teacher  hirings,  training  and  organization 
of  faculty,  and  the  level  of  contact  with  other  institutions  of  higher 
learning  in  Bulgaria  and  abroad.  Students  received  the  right  to 
choose  their  own  professors.  The  higher  education  law  was  criticized 


112 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


for  withholding  students'  rights  and  because  the  legislature  had 
failed  to  consult  students  in  the  law's  formulation. 

In  1991  experts  evaluated  the  state  university  system  as  weak 
in  critically  needed  technical  fields  of  study.  The  availability  of  in- 
terested students  was  also  questioned.  In  the  1990-91  school  year, 
no  graduate  students  with  enterprise  scholarships  majored  in  sub- 
jects such  as  computer  systems,  artificial  intelligence  systems,  or 
ecology  and  environmental  protection.  Graduate  programs  in  cri- 
tical nontechnical  fields  such  as  management  economics,  market- 
ing, production  management,  and  finance  also  had  no  students. 

After  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov,  France  and  Germany  made  early 
commitments  to  help  Bulgaria  carry  out  educational  reforms.  In 
1991  the  United  States  began  planning  a  new  American  college 
in  Blagoevgrad,  where  students  would  be  taught  in  English  using 
American  educational  methods.  The  first  200  students  were  to  in- 
clude 160  Bulgarians,  20  students  from  neighboring  European  coun- 
tries, and  20  Americans  majoring  in  Balkan  studies.  The  University 
of  Maine  was  to  supply  the  teachers.  Plans  called  for  business  and 
economics  to  be  the  major  areas  of  concentration.  Affordability  was 
a  potential  barrier  to  participation  in  this  plan  by  Bulgarian  stu- 
dents; the  cost  was  low  by  American  standards,  but  far  above  the 
average  Bulgarian's  price  range.  And  the  tuition-free  Bulgarian 
university  system  was  expected  to  lure  many  qualified  students  from 
the  new  university.  Nevertheless,  Western  education  assistance  was 
an  important  symbolic  step  in  moving  the  social  institutions  of  Bul- 
garia into  the  European  mainstream,  from  which  they  had  been 
isolated  for  forty-five  years.

Because  the  societal  change  stimulated  in  Bulgaria  by  the  process 
of  democratization  is  likely  to  continue  through  the  1990s,  trans- 
lations of  the  Bulgarian  press  are  an  invaluable  source  of  current 
information.  A  wide  variety  of  articles  and  broadcasts  on  social 
topics,  as  well  as  government  documents  and  laws,  is  translated 
in  the  Foreign  Broadcast  Information  Service's  Daily  Report:  East 
Europe  and  the  Joint  Publication  Research  Service's  JPRS  Report: 
East  Europe.  Amnesty  International's  Bulgaria:  Imprisonment  of  Eth- 
nic Turks  is  an  impartial  source  of  information  on  the  Turks  and 
other  minorities  during  the  assimilation  campaign  of  the  1980s.

material  on  ethnic  policy  and  regional  issues  after  the  overthrow 
of  Zhivkov.  Kak  Zhiveem  (How  We  Live)  is  a  new  Bulgarian-

ing education,  minorities,  population,  and  religion;  some  articles 
are  in  English,  most  are  in  German.  (For  further  information  and

Chapter  3.  The  Economy 


A  potter,  one  of  many  artisans  practicing  their  trade  in  modern  Bulgaria 


FROM  THE  END  OF  WORLD  WAR  II  until  widespread  revo- 
lution in  Eastern  Europe  swept  aside  most  communist  governments 
in  1989,  the  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  (BCP)  exerted  complete 
economic  control  in  Bulgaria.  The  party's  ascent  to  power  in  1944 
had  marked  the  beginning  of  radical  economic  change  for  Bulgaria. 
After  World  War  II,  Bulgaria  followed  the  Soviet  model  of  eco- 
nomic development  more  closely  than  any  other  East  Bloc  coun- 
try. The  new  regime  shifted  much  of  the  labor  force  from  the 
countryside  to  the  city  to  provide  workers  for  new  large-scale  in- 
dustrial complexes.  At  the  same  time,  the  focus  of  Bulgarian  in- 
ternational trade  shifted  from  Central  Europe  to  Eastern  Europe. 

These  new  policies  resulted  in  impressive  initial  rates  of  growth. 
But  this  was  partly  because  the  country  was  starting  from  a  low 
level  of  economic  development.  Throughout  the  postwar  period, 
economic  progress  also  was  assisted  substantially  by  a  level  of  in- 
ternal and  external  political  stability  unseen  in  other  East  Euro- 
pean countries  during  the  same  period  and  unprecedented  in 
modern  Bulgarian  history. 

Nonetheless,  beginning  in  the  early  1960s  low  capital  and  labor 
productivity  and  expensive  material  inputs  plagued  the  Bulgarian 
economy.  With  disappointing  rates  of  growth  came  a  high  degree 
of  economic  experimentation.  This  experimentation  took  place 
within  the  socialist  economic  framework,  however,  and  it  never 
approached  a  market-based  economy. 

In  the  late  1980s,  continuing  poor  economic  performance  brought 
new  economic  hardship.  By  that  time,  the  misdirection  and  irra- 
tionality of  BCP  economic  policies  had  become  quite  clear.  Fi- 
nally, on  November  10,  1989,  a  popular  movement  toppled  Todor 
Zhivkov,  long-time  party  leader  and  head  of  state,  and  orthodox 
communist  dictatorship  ended.  But  unlike  the  communist  parties 
in  most  other  East  European  states,  the  BCP  retained  majority 
power  after  the  transition  in  Bulgaria  by  winning  the  first  free  na- 
tional elections  in  June  1990.  By  that  time,  however,  changes  in 
party  leadership  and  reduction  of  the  BCP's  power  base  permit- 
ted economic  reorientation  toward  a  market  system.  This  difficult 
transition  combined  with  political  instability  to  seriously  worsen 
economic  conditions  during  1990. 

Bulgaria's  success  in  transforming  its  economy  from  central  plan- 
ning to  a  market-based  system  remained  unmeasured  in  1991.  Un- 
doubtedly, any  form  of  Bulgarian  government  faced  a  daunting 


117 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


task  at  that  point.  Because  its  financial  and  productive  resources 
had  been  allocated  ineffectively  for  many  years,  the  economy  ur- 
gently needed  major  reforms.  The  manufacturing  sector  was  un- 
competitive in  world  markets,  was  technologically  outmoded,  and 
consumed  energy  and  materials  at  enormously  wasteful  rates.  The 
agricultural  sector,  once  the  most  productive  sector  of  the  Bulgar- 
ian economy,  had  degenerated  to  the  point  that  the  country  could 
scarcely  feed  its  own  people.  A  new  trade  regime  with  traditional 
partners  would  strain  already  low  hard  currency  reserves,  restricting 
access  to  raw  materials  and  sophisticated  technology.  External  and 
internal  debt  was  enormous  when  Zhivkov  fell.  Inflation  was  high, 
environmental  problems  were  severe,  and  skilled  labor  was  in- 
sufficient. 

Several  factors  complicate  the  quantification  of  socialist  econo- 
mies from  a  capitalist  perspective.  Prices  in  socialist  economies  serve 
primarily  an  accounting  function;  they  do  not  reflect  relative  scar- 
cities and  demand  for  a  product  as  they  do  in  capitalist  economies. 
Hence,  comparisons  of  value  indicators  are  difficult.  In  addition, 
some  socialist  statistics  simply  are  calculated  differendy.  For  ex- 
ample, the  socialist  equivalent  of  national  income,  referred  to  as 
net  material  product  (NMP — see  Glossary),  excludes  the  value  of 
most  services,  including  government,  that  are  unrelated  to  physi- 
cal production. 

Accurate  assessment  of  Bulgarian  economic  policies  and  perfor- 
mance under  communist  regimes  also  is  complicated  by  incom- 
plete, inaccurate,  or  misleading  statistics.  Some  Western  economists 
have  attempted,  however,  to  extrapolate  data  based  on  a  combi- 
nation of  Bulgarian  statistics,  various  economic  assumptions,  and 
statistical  techniques. 

Resource  Base 

Bulgaria  is  relatively  poor  in  both  quantity  and  quality  of  natural 
resources.  This  situation  has  been  an  important  factor  in  planning 
the  national  economy  and  foreign  trade.  The  primary  indigenous 
mineral  resources  are  coal,  copper,  lead.  zinc,  and  iron  ore. 

Coal  and  Minerals 

Lignite,  by  far  the  most  prevalent  form  of  coal,  is  mined  chiefly 
in  the  Maritsa-zapad  (West  Maritsa)  and  Maritsa-iztok  (East 
Maritsa)  sections  of  the  Maritsa  Basin  (see  fig.  10).  The  main  source 
of  other  grades  of  brown  coal  is  the  Bobov  Dol  deposit  in  the  Rila 
Mountains  of  southwest  Bulgaria.  There  is  little  bituminous  coal 
in  the  country.  Copper  is  mined  chiefly  in  the  Sredna  Gora  (cen- 
tral hills)  in  the  western  Balkans,  and  at  Chelopets  in  south-central 
Bulgaria.  There  are  also  large  deposits  of  lead.  zinc,  and  iron  ore.

the  largest  of  which  are  at  Kremikovtsi.  Bulgaria  became  self- 
sufficient  in  the  production  of  pig  iron  in  1987.  Manganese,  ura- 
nium, gold,  salt,  and  chromium  also  are  mined.  Small  amounts 
of  oil  are  extracted  offshore  in  the  Black  Sea  and  inland  near  Pleven. 

Agricultural  Resources 

In  1987  approximately  56  percent  of  Bulgaria's  total  land  mass 
of  11,055,000  hectares  was  used  for  agriculture.  Of  that  total, 
3,825,000  hectares,  or  35  percent  of  the  total  land  mass,  was  arable. 
Although  natural  conditions  are  very  good  for  some  crops,  not  all 
of  the  land  is  ideal  for  agricultural  purposes.  Large  portions  of  the 
western  uplands  are  suitable  only  for  tobacco  and  vegetable  culti- 
vation. Grain  fields  on  the  rolling  plain  to  the  north  of  the  Balkan 
Mountains  receive  limited  rainfall  and  experience  periodic  droughts. 

Environmental  Problems 

Although  Bulgaria  has  had  serious  environmental  problems  for 
some  time,  they  were  not  openly  discussed  until  the  overthrow  of 
Zhivkov.  Ecological  groups  were  at  the  forefront  of  anti-Zhivkov 
demonstrations  in  1989,  when  an  all-European  ecology  conference 
focused  world  attention  on  Sofia.  After  acknowledging  the  problem, 
post-Zhivkov  policy  makers  rated  degradation  of  the  air,  water,  and 
soil  as  one  of  the  most  serious  problems  facing  Bulgaria.  In  April 
1990,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Health  declared  the  cities  of  Asenov- 
grad,  Dimitrovgrad,  Kurdzhali,  Panagyurishte,  Plovdiv,  Ruse,  and 
Vratsa  ecologically  endangered  regions  and  announced  that  resi- 
dents of  these  regions  would  be  given  medical  examinations.  But 
after  forty  years  of  touting  heavy  industry  as  the  pathway  to  na- 
tional advancement,  Bulgaria  could  not  easily  remedy  the  intense 
pollution  emitted  by  chemical  plants  in  Ruse  and  Dimitrovgrad  or 
the  copper  smelters  at  Srednogorie  without  further  damaging  its  al- 
ready shaky  economy.  Likewise,  the  Kozloduy  Nuclear  Power  Plant 
on  the  Maritsa  River,  provider  of  over  20  percent  of  the  country's 
electric  power  but  a  persistent  emitter  of  radiation,  could  not  be  closed 
without  severe  impact  on  the  economy.  Radiation  from  the  1986 
Chernobyl'  accident  in  the  Soviet  Union  also  remained  an  environ- 
mental hazard  in  1991  (See  Environment,  ch.  2). 

Labor  Force 

Because  of  a  low  birth  rate,  labor  shortages  began  to  appear  in 
Bulgaria  in  the  1980s.  Then  in  1989,  deportation  of  310,000  eth- 
nic Turks  created  critical  shortages  in  certain  economic  sectors. 
The  dislocation  caused  by  the  large-scale  economic  reform  that 
began  in  1990  introduced  high  rates  of  unemployment  and  social 
insecurity  to  a  system  that  nominally  had  no  unemployment  under 


121 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

the  central  planning  regime.  A  period  of  protracted  readjustment 
of  labor  to  enterprise  needs  was  expected  to  begin  in  1991. 

Factors  of  Availability 

The  total  labor  force  in  Bulgaria  was  4.078  million  in  1988.  Of 
that  total,  35.9  percent  were  classified  as  industrial  workers,  19 
percent  as  agricultural  workers,  and  18.9  percent  as  service  work- 
ers. In  1985  some  56  percent  of  the  population  was  of  working  age 
(16  to  59  years  old  for  men  and  16  to  54  for  women);  22.9  percent 
were  under  working  age,  and  21.1  percent  were  over  working  age. 
These  figures  indicate  that  the  population  had  aged  demographi- 
cally  since  1946,  when  30  percent  of  the  population  was  under  the 
working  age  and  only  12  percent  was  over.  Small  growth  rates  and 
occasional  declines  of  the  Bulgarian  labor  force  increasingly  inhib- 
ited economic  growth  in  the  1980s.  The  meager  growth  in  the  labor 
force  was  caused  primarily  by  a  birthrate  that  began  declining  be- 
fore World  War  II. 

Declining  population  growth  did  not  affect  Bulgarian  economic 
planning  and  performance  for  a  number  of  years.  In  the  1950s  and 
1960s,  the  expanding  labor  requirements  of  industrial  growth  were 
accommodated  by  a  steady  influx  of  peasant  labor  from  the  country- 
side and  by  the  nationalization  of  artisan  shops  in  1951 .  This  migra- 
tion slowed,  however,  and  complaints  of  an  industrial  labor  shortage 
were  common  by  the  late  1960s.  The  situation  was  exacerbated  in 
1974  when  the  government  reduced  the  work  week  from  48  to  42.5 
hours  (see  Agriculture,  this  ch.).  By  the  early  1980s,  Bulgaria's  urban 
working- age  population  had  begun  to  decline  in  absolute  terms.  Then 
in  May  1989,  ethnic  strife  caused  thousands  of  ethnic  Turks  to  leave 
Bulgaria  for  Turkey.  In  August  Turkish  authorities  finally  closed 
the  border,  but  only  after  310,000  ethnic  Turks  had  left  the  country, 
taking  with  them  a  substantial  chunk  of  the  Bulgarian  work  force. 
In  addition,  a  significant  "brain  drain"  threatened  in  1990  when 
large  numbers  of  young,  highly  educated  Bulgarians  applied  to  leave 
the  country.  In  the  first  four  months  of  1990,  at  a  time  when  the 
country  desperately  needed  its  professional  class  to  restructure  so- 
ciety and  the  economy,  550,000  such  applications  were  received. 

Labor  statistics  reflect  a  distinct  change  of  economic  priorities 
from  agriculture  to  industry  under  communist  regimes.  From  1948 
to  1988,  the  shares  of  labor  in  industry  and  agriculture  shifted  dra- 
matically. Industry's  share  rose  from  7.9  to  38  percent,  while 
agriculture's  share  fell  from  82.1  to  19.3  percent.  Among  other 
sectors,  in  1988  construction,  transportation  and  communications, 
and  trade  respectively  accounted  for  8.3,  6.7,  and  8.7  percent  of 
employment.

The  Economy 


Labor  and  Economic  Reform 

Under  communist  rule,  unemployment  officially  was  nonexis- 
tent. Like  many  other  Soviet-style  economies,  however,  the  Bul- 
garian system  included  much  underemployment  and  hoarding  of 
surplus  workers,  particularly  in  industry.  While  in  power,  the  BCP 
set  wage  and  work  norms.  Average  annual  earnings  rose  from  2, 185 
leva  (for  value  of  the  lev,  see  Glossary)  in  1980  to  2,953  leva  in 
1988.  Earnings  were  highest  in  the  research,  state  administration, 
construction,  transport,  and  finance  sectors,  in  that  order.  Agricul- 
ture and  forestry  were  among  the  lowest  paid  sectors. 

After  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov,  reasonable  use  of  industrial  capac- 
ity was  expected  to  maintain  a  tight  labor  market  for  the  foreseeable 
future  because  the  labor  force  had  ceased  to  grow.  Women  already 
accounted  for  approximately  50  percent  of  the  labor  force  in  1988; 
therefore,  little  additional  growth  was  expected  from  that  part  of  the 
population.  Similarly,  little  growth  was  expected  from  among  volun- 
tarily employed  pensioners  and  invalids.  However,  the  tight  labor 
supply  was  not  the  most  pressing  concern  of  the  first  post-Zhivkov 
economic  planners.  The  economic  transformation  from  centralized 
planning  to  a  market  economy  meant  increased  influence  by  mar- 
ket factors  on  wage  and  unemployment  rates  in  the  future.  This 
transformation  also  made  high  unemployment  likely  as  state  enter- 
prises closed  and  generation  of  goods  and  services  shifted  to  an  ex- 
panded private  sector.  But  this  intermediate  dislocation  was  thought 
necessary  to  achieve  correlation  between  wages  and  productivity. 

Unemployment,  which  stood  at  72,000  at  the  beginning  of  1991, 
was  expected  to  jump  to  at  least  250,000  by  the  end  of  that  year 
because  of  the  planned  transition  to  a  market  structure.  In  1990 
the  interim  government  of  Petur  Mladenov  created  a  national  labor 
exchange  to  assist  in  placing  unemployed  workers.  Unemployment 
assistance  remained  a  state  responsibility,  but  the  state  had  very 
little  money  for  this  purpose  in  1991 .  Plans  called  for  eventual  con- 
tribution by  private  employers  to  a  designated  unemployment  fund. 

Economic  Structure  and  Control  Mechanisms 

Until  late  1989,  Bulgaria  had  a  command  economy  based  on  cen- 
tralized planning  rather  than  on  market  forces.  In  such  a  system, 
crucial  economic  decisions  such  as  allocation  of  output,  rates  of  ex- 
pansion of  various  sectors,  values  of  goods  and  services,  and  the 
exchange  rate  of  the  national  currency  were  made  administratively, 
not  by  the  market.  Bulgaria's  faithful  adherence  to  the  Soviet  model 
of  economic  planning  included  rapid  industrialization,  large-scale 
investments,  and  other  resource  allocation  to  heavy  industry  at  the 
expense  of  light  industry  and  agriculture,  higher  rates  of  spending

for  capital  investment  than  for  consumption  purchases,  and  forced 
nationalization  of  industry  and  collectivization  of  agriculture. 

The  Centrally  Planned  Economy 

Proponents  of  centrally  planned  economies  (CPEs)  maintained 
that  the  advantages  of  such  systems  far  outweighed  the  disadvan- 
tages. They  believed  that  in  many  respects  economic  competition 
wasted  society's  resources.  In  other  words,  what  Marx  called  the 
"anarchy  of  the  market"  led  producers  and  consumers  to  expend 
resources  in  activities  that  became  unnecessary  when  they  worked 
in  harmony  rather  than  in  competition.  Planning  could  give  pri- 
ority to  social  goals  over  economic  ones.  Should  the  government 
decide  that  the  development  of  health  professionals  was  important 
to  society,  for  example,  it  could  earmark  funds  for  that  purpose. 
Proponents  of  CPEs  also  claimed  that  they  could  insulate  their  econ- 
omies from  the  ups  and  downs  of  the  business  cycle,  a  phenome- 
non that  Western  economies  never  have  been  able  to  avoid. 
Theoretically,  CPEs  were  designed  to  be  immune  to  economic  (and 
social)  losses  such  as  reduced  output  and  unemployment  associ- 
ated with  economic  downturns.  (As  their  national  economies  be- 
came more  interrelated  with  international  markets,  however,  CPE 
proponents  admitted  the  difficulty  of  isolating  themselves  from 
swings  in  world  economic  conditions.)  Another  theoretical  advan- 
tage was  that  economic  decisions  could  be  based  on  long-range  goals 
because  the  financial  losses  of  any  individual  enterprise  or  indus- 
try could  be  offset  by  profits  in  other  areas  of  the  economy.  And, 
since  the  organization  of  the  entire  industrial  and  agricultural  base 
was  determined  administratively,  economies  of  scale  could  easily 
be  incorporated  into  the  planning  process. 

Western  economists  were  generally  critical  of  the  CPE,  however. 
Their  criticisms  had  two  essential  components.  First,  central  eco- 
nomic planners  often  were  unable  to  plan  an  economy  efficiently; 
and  second,  even  when  they  could  plan  well,  they  were  unable  to 
achieve  the  goals  they  planned.  These  general  assertions  proved 
true  regarding  specific  aspects  of  Bulgaria's  command  economy, 
and  they  had  ramifications  for  efforts  to  reorganize  that  economy 
in  the  1990s. 

The  CPE  induced  enterprises  to  seek  low  production  targets,  con- 
cealing productive  capacity  and  never  overfulfilling  the  plan  by  too 
much,  lest  higher  targets  be  set  in  the  next  plan.  The  result  was 
underutilized  resources.  Plans  tended  to  stress  quantity  over  qual- 
ity. Simply  requiring  a  particular  level  of  output  was  insufficient 
if  that  output  were  of  such  poor  quality  that  no  one  bought  it,  or 
if  there  were  no  need  for  such  a  product  in  the  beginning.  The 


124 


The  Economy 


consumer  had  no  effective  control  over  the  producer  when  quality 
was  low,  and  the  artificial  price  structure  prevented  price  signals 
from  alerting  producers  to  consumer  preferences.  Also,  because 
enterprises  were  judged  on  their  fulfillment  of  the  plan,  producers 
geared  production  levels  for  satisfying  the  plan,  not  consumers. 

The  CPE  could  induce  technical  progress  from  above,  but  it  could 
not  stimulate  it  from  below.  The  plan  discouraged  enterprise  in- 
novation, because  innovation  meant  interrupting  current  pro- 
duction, hence  jeopardizing  plan  fulfillment.  The  system  also 
encouraged  waste  and  hoarding  of  fixed  and  working  capital,  and 
the  wage  system  failed  to  encourage  workers  to  work  harder  or  man- 
agers to  economize  on  labor.  Under  Zhivkov,  Bulgaria  attempted 
to  deal  with  these  problems  by  a  series  of  reforms  in  both  industry 
and  agriculture.  These  reforms  included  alternately  centralizing 
and  decentralizing  economic  management;  adding  and  deleting  eco- 
nomic ministries  and  committees;  revising  the  economic  indica- 
tors for  plan  fulfillment;  and  encouraging  or  discouraging  elements 
of  private  enterprise.  Despite  such  experimentation,  however,  Bul- 
garia remained  faithful  to  the  general  Soviet  model  for  over  four 
decades.  In  the  years  after  the  end  of  communist  rule,  the  CPE 
remained  the  predominant  structural  element  in  the  Bulgarian  econ- 
omy, especially  in  large  enterprise  management. 

The  Planning  System 

Prior  to  1990,  the  planning  hierarchy  in  Bulgaria  included  several 
levels.  The  ultimate  economic  authority  was  the  BCP.  The  party 
determined  general  economic  policies,  identified  economic  reforms 
and  their  structure,  and  monitored  economic  activity.  Planning 
and  control  were  the  responsibility  of  the  Council  of  Ministers, 
which  was  roughly  equivalent  to  a  Western  cabinet.  The  most  im- 
portant planning  committee  within  the  Council  of  Ministers  was 
the  State  Planning  Committee  (SPC).  Within  the  Council  of 
Ministers  were  specialized  economic  ministries,  such  as  the  Ministry 
of  Finance  and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade,  and  various  govern- 
mental committees  and  commissions.  The  composition  and  author- 
ity of  the  ministries  underwent  frequent  change.  In  1986,  for 
example,  six  ministries  with  economic  powers  were  eliminated  and 
five  cabinet-level  "voluntary  associations"  were  formed.  The  after- 
math of  these  changes,  however,  showed  few  new  power  relation- 
ships. In  the  later  Zhivkov  years,  the  prime  responsibilities  of 
ministry-level  agencies  included  forecasting  development  of  their  in- 
dustries, assessing  development  bottlenecks,  and  generally  overseeing 
state  development  policy.  However,  the  ministries  were  not  to  par- 
ticipate actively  in  planning.  That  was  a  function  of  the  associations. 


125 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  associations,  also  known  as  trusts,  were  an  intermediary 
organization  between  the  ministries  and  the  lowest  level  of  the  plan- 
ning hierarchy,  the  enterprise.  The  association  integrated  produc- 
tion, research  and  development,  design,  construction,  and  foreign 
trade  functions.  Unlike  associations  in  the  Soviet  Union,  which 
were  merely  an  intermediary  link  in  the  chain  of  economic  com- 
mand, Bulgarian  associations  retained  several  essential  decision- 
making prerogatives  and  were  in  direct  contact  with  centers  of  eco- 
nomic power  such  as  the  SPC,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the 
Bulgarian  National  Bank  (BNB).  At  the  bottom  of  the  economic 
hierarchy,  enterprises  were  distinct  economic  entities  that  operated 
under  an  independent  accounting  system.  They  were  expected  to 
earn  a  planned  amount  of  profit,  a  portion  of  which  went  to  the 
state  as  a  profits  tax. 

In  the  Bulgarian  command  economy,  almost  all  economic  ac- 
tivity was  directed  toward  plan  fulfillment.  Economic  directives  were 
outlined  extensively  in  the  plans,  which  were  not  merely  guide- 
lines but  binding,  legal  documents.  The  best  known  of  these  was 
the  Five-Year  Plan,  although  planning  was  done  for  longer  and 
shorter  periods  as  well.  Most  important  for  the  day-to-day  opera- 
tions of  enterprises  were  the  annual  and  monthly  plans. 

One  of  the  most  important  tasks  of  central  planning  was  what 
was  referred  to  as  material  balances — planning  for  correspondence  be- 
tween supply  and  demand  of  goods.  At  the  draft  plan  stage,  this 
required  that  supply  (planned  output,  available  stocks,  and  planned 
imports)  equal  demand  (domestic  demand  and  exports)  for  every 
industry.  When  demand  exceeded  supply,  planners  could  increase 
planned  output,  increase  imports,  or  reduce  domestic  demand.  The 
SPC  usually  favored  the  last  alternative.  This  manipulation  limited 
the  flow  of  inputs  to  low-priority  industrial  branches,  which  most 
often  made  consumer  items,  resulting  in  shortages  of  those  goods. 

The  party  began  the  planning  process  by  providing  priorities 
and  output  targets  for  critical  commodities  to  the  SPC,  which  recon- 
ciled them  with  required  inputs.  A  draft  plan  then  was  created  by 
a  process  of  negotiation  and  information  exchange  up  and  down 
the  planning  hierarchy.  After  negotiating  with  the  SPC  on  targets 
and  resources  and  formulating  specific  guidelines,  the  associations 
then  negotiated  with  their  individual  enterprises  to  establish  final 
figures.  The  output  targets  then  went  back  to  the  SPC  for  a  final 
negotiation  with  the  associations. 

The  final  version  of  the  plan  was  submitted  to  the  Council  of 
Ministers  for  approval  or  modification,  after  which  the  approved 
targets  were  sent  down  the  hierarchy  to  the  individual  firms.  Thus 
enterprises  were  informed  of  their  binding  norms  for  a  planning 
period,  including  volume  and  mix  of  output,  procurement  limits, 


126 


The  Economy 


level  of  state  investment,  foreign  currency  earnings,  foreign  cur- 
rency limits  for  imports,  and  wage  rates.  An  important  element 
of  the  plan  fulfillment  stage  was  manipulation  of  resources  by  minis- 
tries and  the  SPC  to  ensure  fulfillment  of  priority  targets  and 
minimize  bottlenecks.  Occasionally,  reforms  allowed  enterprises 
rather  than  higher  echelons  to  make  many  of  these  decisions.  For 
most  of  the  communist  era,  however,  this  was  not  the  case. 

Economic  Policy  and  Performance 

Bulgarian  postwar  economic  development  can  be  divided  into 
four  phases:  the  revolutionary  period  (1944  through  1948);  the  de- 
velopment of  socialism  (1949  through  1960);  the  age  of  intermit- 
tent reform  (1961  through  1989);  and  the  transformation  to  a  market 
economy  (beginning  in  1990). 

Postwar  Economic  Policy 

After  the  BCP  came  to  power  in  1944,  the  transition  to  social- 
ism began  slowly.  Before  World  War  II,  the  Bulgarian  economy 
had  been  agrarian  and  decentralized;  as  a  result,  the  industrial  base 
was  relatively  undeveloped  (see  The  Interwar  Economy,  ch.  1). 
Following  the  Soviet  model,  the  BCP  first  sought  control  over  as 
many  facets  of  the  economy  as  possible.  Thus,  restructuring  in- 
cluded collectivizing  agriculture,  confiscating  private  enterprises, 
nationalizing  industry,  and  enacting  various  fiscal  and  monetary 
measures. 

In  the  1940s,  the  BCP  viewed  the  agricultural  sector  as  a  major 
obstacle  to  the  transformation  of  the  economy.  Although  collec- 
tivization proceeded  slowly  at  first,  state  power  in  the  agricultural 
markets  was  quickly  established  by  nationalizing  internal  and  for- 
eign commodity  trade.  To  accomplish  this,  the  BCP  used  the  war- 
time organizations  that  had  overseen  distribution  of  major  crops. 

Industry  continued  to  decentralize  from  1944  until  1947.  In  those 
years,  the  majority  of  labor  leaving  the  military  and  the  farms  en- 
tered small  factories  and  unmechanized  artisan  shops.  These  small 
enterprises  were  quite  the  opposite  of  the  modern,  large-scale  in- 
dustry that  the  BCP  was  committed  to  creating.  Small  enterprises 
also  competed  with  state  enterprises  for  scarce  raw  materials  and 
skilled  labor.  Labor  discipline  also  was  a  major  problem  during 
this  phase;  unexcused  absences,  sporadic  strikes,  and  high  labor 
turnover  plagued  the  new  state  enterprises.  In  September  1947, 
a  decision  to  accelerate  the  nationalization  of  industry  was  taken 
at  a  meeting  of  the  Communist  Information  Bureau  (Cominform — 
see  Glossary).  As  a  result,  in  December  1947  trained  groups  of  party 
members  entered  all  the  approximately  6,100  remaining  private 


127 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

enterprises,  seized  their  capital,  and  announced  their  immediate 
nationalization.  This  act  effectively  erased  Bulgaria's  small  class 
of  private  industrial  entrepreneurs.  Also  in  1947,  government  mo- 
nopolies were  established  over  all  items  of  retail  trade.  By  the  end 
of  1948,  85  percent  of  the  means  of  production  were  run  by  the  state. 

Although  Bulgaria  had  few  private  banks  when  the  BCP  came 
to  power,  by  December  1947  those  few  were  merged  with  the  BNB. 
The  BCP  also  enacted  a  series  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures 
to  gain  control  over  Bulgaria's  financial  resources  by  the  end  of 
1947.  Monetary  reform  froze  all  bank  accounts  over  20,000  leva, 
and  a  tax  was  imposed  on  the  remaining  accounts.  These  actions 
reduced  the  money  supply  by  two-thirds.  The  new  policy  also  levied 
high  taxes  on  private  income  and  high  profits  to  absorb  any  potential 
new  deposits. 

This  first  phase  of  postwar  economic  development  included  a 
tentative  Two-Year  Plan  (1947-48)  that  foreshadowed  later  poli- 
cies. Aimed  principally  at  speedy  recovery  from  wartime  stress, 
the  program  began  large-scale  industrialization  and  electrification; 
it  sought  to  raise  industrial  production  by  67  percent  and  agricul- 
tural production  by  34  percent  over  prewar  levels.  The  first  plan 
disproportionately  allocated  funds  away  from  agriculture  and  en- 
countered severe  organizational  and  technical  problems,  mistakes 
by  inexperienced  management,  and  shortages  of  energy  and  produc- 
tion equipment — problems  that  would  continue  in  ensuing  develop- 
ment phases. 

The  First  Five-Year  Plans 

The  next  phase  of  Bulgarian  postwar  economic  development  in- 
cluded the  First  Five-Year  Plan.  This  plan  made  an  important  con- 
tribution to  the  pattern  of  Bulgaria's  socialist  economic  development 
by  creating  the  institutional  apparatus  for  long-term  industrial  plan- 
ning. Already  in  1945,  the  wartime  Directorate  for  Civilian  Mobili- 
zation had  been  replaced  by  a  Supreme  Economic  Council  that 
extended  the  previous  organization's  authority  over  resource 
allocation.  Now  the  state's  existing  economic  ministries  were  sub- 
divided into  one  ministry  for  each  branch  of  production.  By  Janu- 
ary 1948,  a  separate  and  politically  powerful  State  Production 
Committee  (SPC)  was  established.  By  October  1948,  representa- 
tives of  the  new  SPC  and  the  existing  Main  Directorate  for  Statis- 
tics had  set  out  the  criteria  for  calculating  plan  fulfillment. 

The  announced  targets  for  the  First  Five-Year  Plan  (1949-53) 
confirmed  the  economic  priorities  indicated  by  the  previous  Two- 
Year  Plan.  Agriculture  was  to  receive  17  percent  of  new  invest- 
ment and  industry  47  percent.  Gross  industrial  output  was  to  grow 
by  119  percent,  primarily  because  of  a  220  percent  increase  in  heavy 


128 


The  Economy 


industry.  Light  industry  and  agriculture  were  to  raise  output  by 
75  and  59  percent,  respectively.  The  rapid  collectivization  and 
mechanization  of  agriculture  were  expected  to  achieve  the  last  tar- 
get while  freeing  labor  for  industry,  construction,  and  transporta- 
tion. Because  about  25  percent  of  the  country's  national  income 
was  invested  in  the  economic  infrastructure,  the  standard  of  liv- 
ing remained  low. 

In  1952  the  plan  was  declared  fulfilled  a  year  ahead  of  schedule, 
but  statistics  on  the  period  were  too  incomplete  and  contradictory 
to  evaluate  its  actual  results.  Substantial  bottlenecks  existed  in 
material  inputs  and  outputs.  Agriculture  received  less  investment 
than  planned  (only  13  percent)  and  showed  no  growth  through  the 
period  (see  table  12,  Appendix).  The  effect  of  low  agricultural  output 
rippled  through  other  sectors  of  the  economy,  hindering  produc- 
tion in  related  industries.  Substantial  material  and  technical  aid 
came  from  the  Soviet  Union,  but  with  a  steep  price:  Bulgaria  was 
expected  to  sell  products  to  the  Soviet  market  at  below-market 
prices,  and  the  arrogance  of  Soviet  economic  advisers  caused  seri- 
ous resentment. 

Continuing  problems  with  excessive  labor  turnover  forced  the 
regime  to  cut  back  the  targets  for  heavy  industry  in  the  Second 
Five- Year  Plan  (1953-57),  and  average  annual  industrial  growth 
fell  from  20.7  to  12.7  percent  during  that  period.  This  was  the  first 
of  several  dramatic  swings  that  characterized  Bulgarian  economic 
development  throughout  the  postwar  period.  The  average  annual 
growth  rate  of  agriculture  increased  from  negative  0.9  percent  to 
4.9  percent  in  the  Second  Five-Year  Plan,  but  the  same  indicator 
for  the  overall  NMP  dropped  from  8.4  to  7.8  percent.  The  indus- 
trial share  of  the  NMP  exceeded  that  of  agriculture  for  the  first 
time  in  this  period. 

Two  important  economic  events  occurred  at  the  Seventh  Party 
Congress  of  the  BCP,  which  met  in  mid- 1958.  The  party  declared 
that  Bulgaria  was  the  first  country  besides  the  Soviet  Union  to 
achieve  full  collectivization  of  agriculture  (estimates  put  the  figure 
at  92  percent  at  this  time),  and  it  announced  the  goals  for  the  Third 
Five-Year  Plan.  That  plan,  which  began  in  1958,  set  relatively 
moderate  initial  quotas  that  included  substantially  more  produc- 
tion of  consumer  goods.  In  1959,  however,  a  BCP  decision  to  make 
a  "Great  Leap  Forward"  (borrowed  by  the  press  from  Mao 
Zedong's  concurrent  program  for  the  Chinese  economy)  drasti- 
cally raised  quotas:  by  1965  industrial  output  was  to  be  three  to 
four  times  the  1957  level,  and  by  1961  agriculture  was  to  produce 
three  times  as  much  as  it  had  in  1957.  To  achieve  the  latter  goal, 
agriculture  was  again  reorganized.  Amalgamation  of  collective 
farms  cut  their  number  by  70  percent,  after  which  average  farm 


129

acreage  was  second  only  to  the  Soviet  Union  among  countries  in 
Eastern  Europe.  The  grandiose  Zhivkov  Theses,  as  the  quota  pro- 
gram came  to  be  known,  were  tempered  noticeably  by  1961,  when 
the  economy's  inability  to  achieve  such  growth  was  obvious  to  all. 

Meanwhile,  throughout  the  late  1950s  urban  unemployment  had 
been  a  major  problem.  The  new  collectivization  drive  brought 
another  wave  of  peasant  migration  to  urban  centers.  Compound- 
ing this  problem  was  a  cutback  in  Soviet  imports  of  industrial  in- 
puts, which  created  some  excess  capacity  in  heavy  industry.  Thus, 
the  intensified  industrialization  of  the  Third  Five-Year  Plan  also 
aimed  at  absorbing  surplus  labor. 

Trade  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe  also 
played  a  large  role  in  the  investment  priorities  of  the  Third  Five- 
Year  Plan.  Food  processing  and  agriculture  were  earmarked  for 
greatest  growth  because  these  sectors,  together  with  chemical  fer- 
tilizers and  small  electric  equipment,  were  now  areas  of  Bulgarian 
responsibility  in  the  plans  of  the  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  As- 
sistance (Comecon — see  Glossary)  for  greater  East  European  trade. 
After  a  reduction  in  1955,  Bulgaria  faced  greatly  increased  export 
obligations  to  the  USSR,  Czechoslovakia,  and  the  German  Demo- 
cratic Republic  (East  Germany)  in  the  late  1950s.  The  latter  two 
could  provide  badly  needed  industrial  machinery  in  return,  and 
the  USSR  provided  vital  raw  materials  and  energy. 

The  party  leadership  initially  resolved  to  fulfill  the  third  plan, 
like  the  first,  within  three  or  four  years;  although  none  of  its  goals 
were  reached,  the  party  declared  fulfillment  in  1960,  and  Zhivkov 
survived  the  popular  disillusionment  and  economic  upheaval  caused 
by  his  totally  unrealistic  theses.  At  that  point,  the  twelve  years  of 
the  second  phase  of  Bulgarian  postwar  economic  development  had 
wrought  major  structural  changes  in  the  Bulgarian  economy.  In- 
dustry's share  of  the  NMP  increased  from  23  percent  to  48  per- 
cent as  agriculture's  share  fell  from  59  percent  to  27  percent.  By 
1960  the  value  produced  by  heavy  industry  matched  that  of  light 
industry,  although  food  processing  for  export  also  grew  rapidly. 
Throughout  the  second  phase,  budget  expenditures  consisted 
primarily  of  reinvestment  in  sectors  given  initial  priority.  Mean- 
while, the  completion  of  collectivization  had  shifted  678,000 
peasants,  about  20  percent  of  the  active  labor  force,  into  indus- 
trial jobs.  The  average  annual  increase  in  industrial  employment 
peaked  at  11.5  percent  between  1955  and  1960. 

The  Era  of  Experimentation  and  Reform 

The  first  full  five-year  plans  proved  the  Bulgarian  system's  ca- 
pacity for  extensive  growth  in  selected  branches  of  industry,  based 


130 


The  Economy 


on  massive  infusions  of  labor  and  capital.  In  the  first  postwar  de- 
cades, that  system  was  much  more  successful  in  reaching  goals  than 
were  the  command  economies  in  the  other  East  European  coun- 
tries, largely  because  Bulgaria  had  started  with  a  much  more  primi- 
tive industrial  infrastructure.  By  the  early  1960s,  however,  changes 
to  the  system  were  obviously  needed  to  achieve  sustained  growth 
in  all  branches  of  production,  including  agriculture.  Specific  incen- 
tives to  reform  were  shortages  of  labor  and  energy  and  the  growing 
importance  of  foreign  trade  in  the  "thaw"  years  of  the  mid-1960s. 
Consequently,  in  1962  the  Fourth  Five-Year  Plan  began  an  era 
of  economic  reform  that  brought  a  series  of  new  approaches  to  the 
old  goal  of  intensive  growth. 

Industrial  Decentralization 

In  industry  the  "New  System  of  Management"  was  introduced 
in  1964  and  lasted  until  1968.  This  approach  intended  to  stream- 
line economic  units  and  make  enterprise  managers  more  responsible 
for  performance.  In  June  1964,  about  fifty  industrial  enterprises, 
mostly  producers  of  textiles  and  other  consumer  goods,  were  placed 
under  the  new  system.  Wages,  bonuses,  and  investment  funds  were 
tied  to  enterprise  profits,  up  to  70  percent  of  which  could  be  re- 
tained. Outside  investment  funds  were  to  come  primarily  from  bank 
credit  rather  than  the  state  budget.  In  1965  state  subsidies  still  ac- 
counted for  63  percent  of  enterprise  investment  funds,  however, 
while  30  percent  came  from  retained  enterprise  earnings  and  only 
7  percent  from  bank  credits.  By  1970  budget  subsidies  accounted 
for  only  27  percent  of  investment  funds,  while  bank  credits  jumped 
to  39  percent,  and  retained  enterprise  earnings  reached  34  percent. 
The  number  of  compulsory  targets  for  the  Fourth  Five-Year  Plan 
was  cut  to  four:  physical  output,  investment  funds,  input  utiliza- 
tion, and  foreign  trade  targets.  The  pilot  enterprises  did  very  well, 
earning  profits  that  were  double  the  norm.  By  1967  two-thirds 
of  industrial  production  came  from  firms  under  the  new  system, 
which  by  that  time  had  embraced  areas  outside  consumer  produc- 
tion. 

Another  distinctive  feature  of  the  Bulgarian  economy  during  the 
1960s  was  the  high  level  of  net  capital  investment  (total  investment 
minus  depreciation).  The  average  of  12  percent  from  1960  to  1970 
was  the  highest  in  all  of  Eastern  Europe.  As  in  the  past,  invest- 
ment in  heavy  industry  received  the  lion's  share — over  80  percent 
of  total  industrial  investment.  Capital  accumulation  (net  invest- 
ment plus  net  inventories)  averaged  29  percent  from  1960  to  1970, 
also  a  very  high  level.

Industrial  Recentralization 

Before  the  end  of  the  1960s,  however,  Bulgarian  economic  plan- 
ning moved  back  toward  the  conventional  CPE  approach.  Many 
Western  analysts  attributed  the  Bulgarian  retreat  from  the  reforms 
of  the  1960s  to  tension  caused  by  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Czecho- 
slovakia in  1968.  International  events  may  well  have  played  a  role, 
but  the  timing  of  the  retreat  and  the  invasion  suggest  another  com- 
ponent: dissatisfaction  among  the  BCP  elite  with  the  results  and 
ideological  implications  of  the  reform.  For  example,  in  July  1968, 
one  month  before  the  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia,  Bulgaria's  un- 
orthodox, three-tiered  pricing  system  was  eliminated.  The  party 
leadership  had  never  accepted  the  concept  of  free  and  flexible  pricing 
for  some  products,  which  was  an  important  Bulgarian  departure 
from  centralized  planning  in  the  1960s.  Resistance  to  reform  was 
further  encouraged  by  a  series  of  cases  in  which  major  enterprise 
directors  used  newly  decentralized  financial  resources  to  line  their 
own  pockets. 

Despite  the  general  retreat  from  reform,  two  important  measures 
remained  intact,  one  each  in  agriculture  and  industry.  The  first 
involved  new  operating  procedures  introduced  on  the  larger  col- 
lective farms  in  the  early  1960s.  To  better  exploit  the  new  equip- 
ment introduced  during  the  consolidation  of  the  late  1950s,  farms 
were  assigned  more  agronomists  and  labor  was  specialized  by  es- 
tablishing fixed  brigades.  Production  target  negotiations  between 
the  Ministry  of  State  Planning  and  the  agricultural  collectives  also 
were  simplified. 

The  industrial  reform  that  survived  retrenchment  in  1968  gave 
associations,  not  ministries,  responsibility  to  supervise  the  new  sys- 
tem of  supply  contracts  between  enterprises.  This  system  continued 
to  grow,  with  prices  determined  on  the  basis  of  enterprise  bargaining 
rather  than  ministerial  fiat.  Interenterprise  allocations  clearly  func- 
tioned more  efficiently  with  this  arrangement. 

Larger  Economic  Units 

Just  as  most  reforms  were  being  rescinded,  the  BCP  began  the 
last  phase  of  postwar  agricultural  restructuring.  Prompted  by  the 
labor  shortage,  the  new  streamlining  of  collective  farms  that  be- 
gan in  1969  introduced  the  so-called  agricultural-industrial  com- 
plex (agrompromishlen  kompleks — APK).  The  new  structure  was  to 
industrialize  agricultural  production,  boost  the  value-added  com- 
ponent in  Bulgarian  exports  by  processing  more  agricultural  goods, 
and  raise  the  food  supply  to  cities  without  diverting  labor  back  from 
industry.  In  the  late  1960s,  relatively  poor  agricultural  performance 


132 


133 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

under  the  existing  structure  had  prevented  those  goals  from  being 
reached. 

The  idea  of  combining  existing  enterprises  into  a  smaller, 
presumably  more  manageable  number  of  units  spread  quickly  from 
agriculture  to  industry.  By  the  end  of  the  1970s,  the  number  of 
associations  into  which  industrial  enterprises  were  grouped  was 
reduced  by  half.  The  sixty-four  new,  larger  associations  were 
granted  the  authority  to  make  decisions  for  their  enterprises  about 
new  investments,  bank  credits,  and  budget  subsidies.  Within  an 
association,  the  larger  enterprises  (called  subsidiaries)  still  could 
sign  their  own  supply  contracts  and  maintain  their  own  bank  ac- 
counts, but  they  ceased  to  be  legal  entities.  Smaller  enterprises 
(called  subdivisions)  became  fully  dependent  on  their  association. 

The  main  advantage  of  this  streamlined  organization  was  seen 
as  economy  of  scale  through  increased  specialization  and  a  simpli- 
fied flow  of  information.  Associations  also  were  assumed  to  be  better 
able  to  make  investment  decisions  and  oversee  material  and  labor 
distribution  than  either  a  small  number  of  ministries  or  a  large  num- 
ber of  enterprises.  The  new  structure  would  link  specific  indus- 
trial enterprises  with  scientific  institutes  in  the  same  way  as  the 
agricultural  complexes  had  linked  them. 

These  reforms  proved  disappointing.  Reformed  planning  tech- 
niques continued  to  leave  unused  industrial  capacity,  and  quality 
control  failed  to  improve.  Both  Western  and  domestic  customers 
remained  dissatisfied  with  the  quality  of  many  Bulgarian  manufac- 
tures. New  planning  indicators  that  set  norms  for  cost  reduction 
actually  reduced  quality  in  a  number  of  cases.  Individual  mem- 
bers of  institutes  could  not  convey  their  ideas  to  associations  or 
ministries,  where  decisions  to  import  or  to  invest  in  new  technol- 
ogy were  made.  Thus  the  new  framework  only  accentuated  the 
dangers  of  socialist  monopoly.  Party  meetings  and  the  press  criti- 
cized monopolistic  abuses  resulting  from  irrational  decisions  at  the 
top  and  poor  implementation  of  rational  policies  at  the  enterprise 
level.  By  the  end  of  the  1970s,  a  new  set  of  reforms  was  prescribed. 

The  New  Economic  Model 

Initiated  in  1981,  the  next  program  of  reforms  was  designated 
the  New  Economic  Model  (NEM).  This  program  involved  both 
agricultural  complexes  and  industrial  enterprises.  Goals  of  the  NEM 
included  updating  the  technical  infrastructure  of  Bulgarian  indus- 
try and  improving  the  quality  of  Bulgarian  exports  to  raise  hard- 
currency  income.  Centralized  planning  now  was  relegated  to  setting 
gross  profits  and  overseeing  the  national  scientific  program.  In 


134 


The  Economy 


1982-83  the  NEM's  principal  instruments  were  financial  incen- 
tives and  accounting  regulations  aimed  at  all  levels  of  management, 
but  especially  at  the  smallest  unit  of  labor,  the  brigade.  Brigades, 
each  containing  thirty  to  fifty  workers,  now  would  set  labor  and 
material  input  levels  and  dispose  of  finished  products.  In  an  effort 
to  remedy  the  chronic  distribution  problems  of  the  central  econo- 
my, higher  economic  institutions  became  financially  accountable 
for  damage  inflicted  by  their  decisions  on  subordinate  levels. 

Several  important  initiatives  were  launched  in  1978.  The  long- 
standing limits  on  enterprise  investment  were  lifted.  In  their  place, 
a  new  investment  plan  was  based  on  the  enterprises'  contractual 
obligations  and  credits  with  the  BNB.  The  bank  monitored  the  cash 
balance  of  enterprise  contracts  with  customers  and  suppliers,  grant- 
ing credits  only  when  required.  Three  separate  reinvestment  funds 
received  first  claim  on  the  net  income  of  the  enterprise.  Although 
budgetary  subsidies  were  not  eliminated,  the  NEM  directives  as- 
signed responsibility  for  financial  losses  to  all  levels  of  enterprises. 
Self-financing  became  the  watchword  for  all  economic 
organizations. 

Another  major  change  eliminated  the  automatic  first  claim  of 
salaries  and  wages  on  gross  enterprise  income.  This  meant  that 
wages  could  rise  only  after  an  increase  in  labor  productivity,  and 
then  only  by  50  percent  of  that  increase.  Moreover,  management 
salaries  could  be  cut  by  as  much  as  20  percent  if  the  complex  or 
enterprise  failed  to  meet  its  norms  for  production  and  productivity. 
The  formula  for  sanctions  against  management  salaries  changed 
several  times.  Finally,  binding  performance  criteria  were  limited 
to  five  financial  indicators  for  agricultural  complexes  and  indus- 
trial associations,  and  to  four  for  individual  enterprises.  Profit  cri- 
teria were  set  only  for  the  complexes  or  associations.  Complexes 
and  associations  were  given  explicit  freedom  to  sign  their  own  con- 
tracts with  suppliers  and  customers  at  home  and  abroad. 

The  BNB  was  granted  some  flexibility  in  restricting  its  terms 
of  lending  and  in  charging  interest  rates  above  the  nominal  2  per- 
cent. These  measures  were  designed  to  bestow  greater  rewards  for 
efficiency  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  unfinished  or  unprofitable 
new  projects.  The  latter  accounted  for  57  percent  of  all  Bulgarian 
investment  as  late  as  1976.  A  provision  for  joint  ventures  with  for- 
eign firms  met  little  enthusiasm  from  abroad. 

The  Last  Round  of  Zhivkov  Reforms 

By  1982  economists  and  the  party  leadership  admitted  that  the 
NEM  had  not  led  to  the  anticipated  upturn  in  overall  productivity 
and  efficiency.  Even  upwardly  skewed  official  statistics  indicated 


135 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

that  aggregate  economic  growth  had  dropped  to  its  lowest  postwar 
level.  Under  the  NEM,  enterprises  could  still  get  approval  from 
state  pricing  authorities  for  price  increases  with  marginal  or  non- 
existent quality  improvement — an  important  factor  in  evaluating 
official  figures. 

The  differences  between  the  Western  concept  of  gross  national 
product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  and  NMP  make  performance  com- 
parisons problematic.  However,  a  Western  economist  who  cal- 
culated growth  rates  for  the  Bulgarian  economy  according  to  the 
conventional  GNP  standard  used  in  market  economies  determined 
the  official  Bulgarian  growth  rates  between  1961  and  1980.  The 
calculated  rate  for  1981-2  was  2.9  percent. 

The  Bulgarian  response  to  declining  growth  rates  under  NEM 
was  to  initiate  a  second  set  of  NEM  reforms.  Measures  in  1982 
and  1983  concentrated  almost  exclusively  on  financial  incentives 
and  prices.  Net  income  was  identified  as  the  major  basis  forjudg- 
ing plan  fulfillment.  The  only  other  targets  were  tax  payments, 
domestic  and  imported  input  limits,  and  minimum  export  levels. 
The  emphasis  on  self-supporting  net  income  was  extended  down- 
ward to  the  brigade  and  upward  to  the  associations.  Guarantees 
of  a  minimum  wage  were  removed  for  workers  and  all  levels  of 
management.  Ministers  themselves  now  were  subject  to  salary 
reductions  if  their  industrial  association  failed  to  meet  the  stream- 
lined list  of  targets.  Ministry  access  to  budgetary  subsidies  for  new 
investment  was  drastically  cut  and  limited  to  a  fixed  term.  Most 
investment  capital  outside  net  income  had  to  be  procured  from  the 
BNB.  The  bank's  increasingly  independent  guidelines  included  the 
authorization  to  hold  regional  competitions  for  investment  funds. 
Interest  rates  remained  low  however,  ranging  between  2.5  and  8 
percent. 

All  these  reforms  did  little  to  invigorate  economic  growth.  In 
the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1981-5),  the  NMP  growth  rate  dropped 
to  3.7  percent,  its  lowest  postwar  level.  Officially,  industry  grew 
at  a  rate  of  7  percent  and  construction  at  5.4  percent,  but  agricul- 
ture declined  by  3.9  percent  per  year. 

In  1985  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  visited  Bulgaria  and  reportedly 
pressured  Zhivkov  to  make  the  country  more  competitive  econom- 
ically. This  pressure  led  to  a  Bulgarian  version  of  the  Soviet  peres- 
troika  program  (see  Glossary).  New  Regulations  on  Economic 
Activity  took  effect  in  January  1987.  These  directives,  intended 
to  stimulate  "socialist  competition,"  allowed  enterprises  to  retain 
a  much  greater  share  of  their  profits  and  also  required  them  to  com- 
pete for  investment  capital  from  newly  formed  commercial  banks. 
In  June  1987,  in  response  to  widespread  dissatisfaction  and 


136 


The  Economy 


confusion  over  the  measures,  a  decree  on  collective  and  individual 
labor  activities  made  it  possible  for  state  economic  organizations 
to  lease  small  trading  and  catering  facilities  to  private  individuals 
by  offering  contracts  at  public  auctions.  The  auctions  were  an  ab- 
ject failure,  however,  because  of  high  taxes,  high  rents,  restricted 
access  to  capital,  uncertain  supplies,  the  short  duration  of  the  con- 
tracts, and  legal  insecurity.  The  idea  was  quietly  abandoned. 

Finally,  in  January  1989,  the  party  issued  Decree  Number  56. 
This  decree  established  "firms"  as  the  primary  unit  of  economic 
management.  Theoretically,  four  types  of  firm  could  be  created: 
joint-stock  firms,  firms  with  limited  responsibility,  firms  with  un- 
limited responsibility,  and  citizens'  firms.  The  differences  among 
the  first  three  types  of  firms  were  small.  But  citizens'  firms  offered 
the  potential  of  individual,  collective,  and  associative  ownership 
arrangements.  In  a  fundamental  departure  from  the  socialist  pro- 
hibition of  private  citizens  hiring  labor,  as  many  as  ten  people  could 
now  be  hired  permanently,  and  an  unlimited  number  could  be  hired 
on  temporary  contracts.  A  wave  of  reorganizations  produced  new, 
larger  firms,  depriving  numerous  enterprises  of  their  self-manage- 
ment status.  Nonetheless,  hundreds  of  private  and  cooperative  firms 
were  authorized  by  Decree  Number  56. 

Other  elements  of  the  decree  allowed  firms  to  issue  shares  and 
bonds  and  pay  dividends,  with  a  number  of  restrictions.  Some 
clauses  sought  to  encourage  foreign  investment  in  the  country.  State- 
owned  enterprises  that  were  transformed  into  joint-stock  firms  now 
could  have  foreign  shareholders.  Although  tax  incentives  and  legal 
guarantees  were  provided  for  joint  ventures,  little  foreign  invest- 
ment was  stimulated.  In  1989  and  1990,  only  117  joint  ventures 
were  consummated,  totaling  US$10  million  in  Western  capital.  In 
all  probability,  low  labor  costs  were  not  enough  to  attract  foreign 
investment  given  remaining  organizational  disadvantages,  poor  in- 
frastructure, low  political  credibility,  the  nonconvertability  of  the 
lev,  and  close  economic  ties  to  the  Soviet  Union. 

This  last  round  of  reforms  by  the  Zhivkov  regime  confused  rather 
than  improved  economic  performance.  Statistics  on  growth  for 
1986-88  indicated  a  5.5  percent  annual  rate,  up  from  the  3.7  per- 
cent rate  achieved  during  the  previous  five-year  plan.  However, 
these  statistics  were  internally  inconsistent  and  widely  disputed  in 
the  press.  Expert  observers  speculated  that  they  were  the  minimum 
growth  the  regime  could  tolerate  given  the  6  percent  target  rate 
in  the  five-year  plan. 

Ultimately,  the  reforms  failed  to  radically  change  the  economic 
conditions  in  the  country.  Public  discontent  increased,  and,  finally, 
emboldened  by  revolutions  throughout  Eastern  Europe,  the  public 


137 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

erupted  in  a  popular  revolt  that  ousted  Todor  Zhivkov  in  Novem- 
ber 1989.  By  early  1990,  the  first  attempts  were  being  made  to  es- 
tablish a  market-based  economy. 

Economic  Sectors 

Bulgaria's  consistent  emphasis  on  developing  heavy  industry  at 
any  cost  created  raw  material  demands  well  beyond  the  country's 
domestic  resources.  This  problem  was  compounded  by  the  ineffi- 
cient industrial  use  of  energy  and  raw  materials:  Bulgaria  used  more 
energy  per  unit  of  NMP  than  any  Western  economy.  For  this  rea- 
son, one  of  the  most  salient  aspects  of  the  Bulgarian  postwar  econ- 
omy was  reliance  on  imported  Soviet  natural  resources. 

Fuels 

In  1989  Soviet  imports  supplied  Bulgaria  with  95  percent  of  its 
coal,  90  percent  of  its  crude  oil,  and  100  percent  of  its  natural  gas 
(see  fig.  10).  Although  Bulgaria  imported  the  majority  of  its  raw 
materials  for  energy  and  industrial  requirements,  some  domestic 
fuels  and  minerals  were  available.  A  small  supply  of  hard  coal  was 
depleted  rapidly  in  the  1980s;  in  1987  only  198,000  tons  were  mined. 
More  ample  deposits  of  low-quality  lignite  yielded  31,400,000  tons 
in  1987,  but  those  fuels  were  relatively  inefficient  energy  producers 
and  high  polluters.  In  1990  the  Maritsa  Basin  in  south-central  Bul- 
garia was  expected  to  remain  the  prime  source  of  lignite  for  the  fore- 
seeable future;  yearly  production  at  its  Maritsa-iztok  open-pit  mines 
was  projected  to  reach  forty  million  tons  after  the  year  2000. 

Energy  Generation 

In  1988  Bulgaria  produced  approximately  43  billion  kilowatt 
hours  of  electricity  (in  contrast  to  384  billion  for  France  and  83.5 
billion  for  Yugoslavia).  At  that  point,  planners  expected  power  con- 
sumption to  increase  by  about  3.5  percent  per  year  through  the 
year  2000.  The  1988  Program  for  Energy  Development  through 
1995  and  in  Perspective  until  2005  set  general  long-term  goals  for 
the  Bulgarian  power  industry,  including  more  effective  integration 
of  machine  building  and  construction  industries  into  power  projects, 
improved  balance  between  supply  and  demand  of  energy,  and  more 
effective  use  of  low-quality  coal  and  local  hydroelectric  plants.  In 
1988  Bulgaria  and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  a  bilateral  agreement 
for  scientific  and  technical  cooperation  in  thermoelectric,  hydro- 
electric, and  nuclear  power  generation.  That  year  59  percent  of 
Bulgaria's  electricity  came  from  thermoelectric  plants  (primarily 
coal-powered);  35  percent  came  from  nuclear  reactors,  the  re- 
mainder from  hydroelectric  stations.  Total  generating  capacity  in 


138 


The  Economy 


1988  was  11,300  megawatts  (in  contrast  to  103,400  for  France, 
20,000  for  Yugoslavia). 

Conventional  Power  Generation 

About  1 ,500  megawatts  of  Bulgaria's  thermoelectric  generation 
capacity  were  idle  in  the  late  1980s  because  of  inefficient  fuel  delivery 
or  equipment  breakdown.  About  half  the  capacity  of  local  heat  and 
power  plants,  relied  upon  to  supplement  major  electrical  plants  and 
provide  heat  for  industries  and  homes,  was  unavailable  for  the  same 
reasons. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Bulgarian  energy  planners  faced  serious  dilem- 
mas. At  the  Maritsa-iztok- 1 ,  Maritsa-iztok-2  and  Dimo  Dichev  ther- 
moelectric plants,  located  in  the  Maritsa-iztok  coal  fields,  long-term 
plans  called  for  gradual  replacement  of  old  generating  equipment 
in  existing  stations.  But  most  such  projects  were  far  behind  sched- 
ule in  1990.  The  1990  decision  not  to  complete  the  Belene  Nuclear 
Power  Plant  meant  increased  reliance  on  Maritsa-iztok  coal  for  heat 
and  power  generation.  In  1990  that  source  provided  70  percent 
of  the  country's  coal,  and  its  three  power  stations  contributed  about 
25  percent  of  total  power  generation. 

The  Maritsa-iztok  Industrial-Power  Complex  (with  its  machine 
building  and  repair  enterprises  one  of  the  largest  industrial  centers 
in  Bulgaria,  employing  22,000  people  in  1991)  had  been  in  opera- 
tion since  1951;  by  1991  the  quality  of  its  coal  and  the  reliability 
of  its  infrastructure  were  steadily  declining.  But  at  that  crisis  point 
in  the  national  economy,  funds  were  unavailable  for  capital  invest- 
ment, especially  to  buy  expensive  foreign  technology  (see  Market 
Reform,  this  ch.).  At  the  same  time,  industry  authorities  acknowl- 
edged burning  high-sulfur  coal  and  strip  mining  at  Maritsa-iztok 
as  a  severe  environmental  problem  whose  amelioration  would  cost 
at  least  a  billion  leva,  mostly  hard  currency. 

Hydroelectric  power  generation  was  concentrated  in  southwestern 
Bulgaria,  but  few  Bulgarian  rivers  offered  large-scale  hydroelectric 
potential.  The  major  hydroelectric  project  in  the  Ninth  Five- Year 
Plan  (1986-90)  was  completion  of  the  Chaira  station,  which  would 
add  864  megawatts  of  generating  capacity.  Development  of  local 
hydroelectric  stations  on  small  streams  was  a  planning  priority  for 
the  1990s. 

Nuclear  Power 

Nuclear  power  provided  Bulgaria  a  way  of  easing  its  dependence 
on  imported  fuels,  although  the  Soviet  Union  and  Czechoslovakia 
provided  the  expertise  and  equipment  on  which  Bulgaria  built  its 
nuclear  power  industry.  Lacking  hard  currency  to  buy  enough  oil, 


139 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

and  reaching  the  toleration  limit  for  pollution  by  coal-burning 
plants,  Bulgaria  increasingly  made  nuclear  power  the  center  of  its 
energy  policy  in  the  1980s.  In  1974  the  first  nuclear  power  plant 
was  opened  at  Kozloduy  north  of  Sofia  on  the  Danube  River.  After 
completing  the  original  four- reactor  complex  in  1982,  Kozloduy 
added  a  fifth  unit  in  late  1987.  This  was  the  first  1 ,000-megawatt 
reactor  in  Eastern  Europe  outside  the  Soviet  Union.  A  sixth  unit 
was  installed  in  1989.  At  that  point,  Bulgaria  ranked  third  in  the 
world  in  per  capita  nuclear  power  generation,  and  the  extent  of 
its  reliance  on  a  sole  nuclear  power  plant  was  unsurpassed  in  the 
world. 

The  Bulgarian  nuclear  power  industry  was  beset  with  major 
problems  from  the  beginning.  The  Kozloduy  station  had  a  history 
of  technical  difficulties  and  accidents,  many  of  which  were  related 
to  the  low  quality  or  poor  design  of  Soviet  and  Czechoslovak  equip- 
ment. The  fifth  reactor,  a  constant  source  of  trouble,  was  out  of 
commission  for  several  months  in  1991  because  of  extensive  tur- 
bine damage.  This  setback  put  the  entire  country  on  a  brownout 
schedule  that  shut  off  electricity  two  out  of  every  four  hours. 

The  Chernobyl'  disaster  in  1986  made  nuclear  safety  a  sensi- 
tive political  issue  in  Bulgaria,  and  by  the  late  1980s  public  opin- 
ion, now  a  much  more  significant  factor  for  policy  makers,  had 
turned  strongly  against  the  nuclear  industry.  A  second  nuclear 
power  complex  was  started  at  Belene,  to  add  six  1 ,000-megawatt 
reactors  by  the  end  of  the  Tenth  Five- Year  Plan.  But  construction 
was  halted  in  1989  by  public  opposition  and  disclosure  that  both 
Kozloduy  and  Belene  were  located  in  earthquake-prone  regions. 
Long-term  plans  for  nuclear  heat  generation  also  were  shelved  at 
that  time.  In  1991  the  government's  Commission  on  Nuclear  Power 
Supply  reported  that  the  supply  system  was  poorly  organized  and 
managed,  and  that  managers  relied  on  expensive  foreign  techni- 
cal help  instead  of  available  domestic  engineers.  The  commission 
also  reported  that,  once  Soviet  specialists  left,  a  shortage  of  quali- 
fied personnel  delayed  activation  of  the  sixth  reactor  at  Kozloduy 
(considered  a  top  priority  once  Belene  was  rejected),  and  that  most 
monitoring  instruments  in  the  first  four  Kozloduy  reactors  were 
out  of  operation. 

In  mid- 1991  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA) 
declared  the  Kozloduy  reactors  unsafe.  Two  reactors  were  shut 
down.  Meanwhile,  also  in  1991,  the  planned  activation  of  the  two 
newest  reactors  at  Kozloduy  raised  the  problem  of  nuclear  waste 
disposal  because  the  Soviet  Union  had  begun  charging  hard  cur- 
rency to  reprocess  waste  from  East  European  reactors,  formerly 
one  of  its  functions  under  Comecon.  In  1991  Bulgaria  requested 


140 


The  Economy 


European  Economic  Community  (EEC — see  Glossary)  aid  to  build 
its  first  permanent  domestic  repository  for  nuclear  waste. 

The  Bulgarian  power  transmission  network  was  supplemented 
in  1988  when  a  high-capacity  transmission  line  from  the  South 
Ukraine  Nuclear  Power  Station  in  the  Soviet  Union  reached  the 
northeastern  port  city  of  Varna.  But  like  Soviet  fuels,  imported 
Soviet  electricity  required  hard  currency  in  1991,  mitigating  the 
advantages  of  the  old  Comecon  agreement. 

Industry 

From  1956  through  1988,  industrial  production  rose  an  aver- 
age of  8.9  percent  per  year  according  to  official  figures,  but  the 
actual  rates  declined  steadily  during  the  thirty-three-year  period. 
The  annual  average  rate  of  industrial  growth  for  the  periods 
1956-60,  1961-70,  1971-80,  and  1981-88  was  15.5,  11.6,  7.5,  and 
4.4  percent,  respectively.  By  the  late  1980s,  Bulgarian  industry  had 
completely  exhausted  the  advantages  it  had  used  in  earlier  decades 
to  post  impressive  growth  statistics  (see  table  12,  Appendix). 

Industrial  Policy 

The  cost  of  Bulgaria's  industrial  growth  was  substantial.  Besides 
environmental  problems,  the  commitment  to  heavy  industry  came 
at  the  expense  of  light  industry — especially  food  processing  and 
textiles — and  agriculture.  These  were  sectors  in  which  prewar  Bul- 
garia had  relatively  high  production  potential.  But  de-emphasis  held 
the  official  annual  NMP  growth  figures  for  light  industry  and 
agriculture  to  7.5  and  2.8  percent,  respectively,  between  1956  and 
1988. 

In  the  postwar  command  economy,  the  chief  beneficiaries  of  this 
emphasis  were  the  chemical,  electronics,  and  machinery  industries. 
Their  respective  share  of  total  industrial  production  rose  from  1.9, 
0,  and  2.4  percent  in  1939  to  8.8,  14.4,  and  15  percent  in  1988. 
Similar  statistics  indicate  big  drops  in  production  shares  for  the 
food  processing  and  textiles  industries — from  51.2  to  23.3  percent, 
and  from  19.8  to  5.1  percent,  respectively,  in  the  same  period. 

Besides  the  unchanging  commitment  to  heavy  industry,  two  other 
major  trends  appeared  in  postwar  industrial  policy.  The  first  was 
steady  and  substantial  support  for  a  basic  ferrous  metals  industry, 
regardless  of  cost,  in  order  to  reduce  dependence  on  imports.  The 
second  was  an  effort  to  produce  machinery  competitive  in  inter- 
national markets,  with  special  emphasis  on  electrical  equipment. 

A  result  of  the  first  policy  was  the  Kremikovtsi  Metallurgical 
Complex.  In  1954  Soviet-supported  geological  surveys  indicated 
major  new  deposits  of  higher  quality  iron  ore  that  would  support 


141 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

a  second  complex  to  supplement  the  existing  V.I.  Lenin  Ferrous 
Metals  Combine  at  Pernik.  Although  the  deposits  were  actually 
found  to  be  inadequate,  the  extremely  expensive  Kremikovtsi  plant 
finally  opened  in  1963  and  used  Soviet  iron  ore  to  produce  over 
half  of  the  national  production  of  steel  and  iron  through  1978. 

The  Kremikovtsi  complex  brought  numerous  problems.  By  the 
mid-1970s,  over  75  percent  of  its  ore  and  coking  coal  was  imported. 
Costs  were  inflated  by  premium  wages  paid  to  maintain  the  labor 
force  and  by  delays  in  construction  and  delivery.  Production  at 
Kremikovtsi  consistently  failed  to  meet  planned  targets,  and  less 
than  three-quarters  of  plant  capacity  was  used.  The  enterprise  never 
showed  a  profit;  in  1989  it  lost  99.5  million  leva  despite  receiving 
600  million  leva  in  state  subsidies.  Using  15  percent  of  the  coun- 
try's total  energy  output,  Kremikovtsi  generated  only  1  percent 
of  national  income  in  the  late  1980s. 

The  strategy  of  heavy  equipment  production  for  export  fared 
better  than  did  metallurgy  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In  fact,  the  most 
competitive  Bulgarian  industries  were  those  most  committed  to  ex- 
port markets.  The  machine  building  and  electronics  industries  aver- 
aged 16  percent  growth  between  1960  and  1980  while  their 
combined  share  of  export  value  jumped  from  13  to  55  percent  from 
1960  to  1982.  The  primary  exports  in  these  sectors  were  forklift 
trucks  and  electrical  hoisting  gear  produced  by  the  Balkancar 
enterprise.  Computer  equipment  and  chemicals  also  showed  im- 
proved export  performance. 

Bulgaria's  postwar  industrialization  was  clearly  positive  in  some 
sectors.  Two  notable  examples  were  the  construction  of  electric 
power  plants  in  the  1950s,  which  made  possible  the  nationwide 
spread  of  industry  and  the  development  of  an  electrical  equipment 
industry  that  produced  exportable  products.  Nonetheless,  as  the 
1980s  drew  to  a  close,  it  became  increasingly  clear  that  even  the 
most  competitive  sectors  had  serious  problems  that  the  BCP's  half- 
way reforms  could  not  solve.  After  the  initial  postwar  climb,  four 
decades  of  socialist  central  planning  had  left  the  industrial  sector 
in  a  very  poor  state. 

Industrial  Centers 

Bulgarian  heavy  industries,  mostly  machine  building,  chemicals, 
and  electronics,  were  concentrated  in  relatively  few  production 
centers.  Important  machine  tool  plants  were  the  Bolshevik  Tool 
Plant  at  Gabrovo,  the  Nikola  Vaptsarov  Combine  at  Pleven,  and 
the  Radomir  Heavy  Equipment  Plant  in  southwest  Bulgaria.  The 
Electronic  Materials  Processing  and  Equipment  Scientific- 
Production  Combine  was  a  combined  scientific  and  industrial  center 


142 


The  Economy 


at  Sofia.  Electronic  instrument  production  centers  were  located  at 
the  Plovdiv  Power  Electronics  Plant,  the  Shabla  Electromechani- 
cal Plant  on  the  northeast  coast,  the  Stara  Zagora  Industrial  Robot 
Plant,  the  Pravets  Instrument  Plant  in  the  southwest,  and  the 
Petkov  Instrument  Plant  at  Turgovishte.  Major  chemical  and  petro- 
chemical producers  were  the  Industrial  Petrochemical  Plant  at 
Pleven  (specializing  in  vehicle  lubricants  and  oils),  the  Burgas 
Petrochemical  Combine  (plastics),  the  Vratsa  Industrial  Chemi- 
cal Combine  (chemical  fertilizers),  and  four  chemical  plants  at 
Dimitrovgrad  (see  fig.  10).  Bulgaria  also  built  large  numbers  of 
ships,  many  for  Soviet  customers,  at  its  Ruse  and  Varna  shipyards 
on  the  Black  Sea.  The  Shumen  Vehicle  Plant  assembled  LIAZ- 
Madara  heavy  trucks  in  a  three-way  arrangement  with  the  Liberac 
Auto  Plant  of  Czechoslovakia  and  the  Soviet  Union. 

Obstacles  to  Industrial  Growth 

In  1989  the  domestic  market  still  featured  little  or  no  competi- 
tion. Over  80  percent  of  exports  went  to  Comecon  countries,  and 
75  percent  of  that  total  went  to  the  Soviet  Union.  This  situation 
insulated  the  computers,  industrial  robots,  microprocessors,  and 
other  high-technology  exports  of  Bulgarian  industry  from  the  market 
competition  that  would  require  backing  by  substantial  investment 
in  research  and  development.  Bulgaria  thus  developed  a  practice 
of  expending  a  small  proportion  of  its  national  income  on  applied 
science,  even  compared  with  other  East  European  states. 

Falling  productivity  was  a  major  problem  in  a  number  of  key 
industries.  Many  of  these  industries  were  inherently  uncompeti- 
tive, and  attempts  to  raise  productivity  through  large-scale  produc- 
tion concentrated  industrial  and  research  facilities  into  enormous 
enterprises  that  further  reduced  industrial  flexibility.  Unprofita- 
bility  made  Bulgarian  industry  dependent  on  a  system  of  widespread 
state  subsidies.  It  was  reported  at  the  BCP  Central  Committee  ple- 
num in  December  1989  that  a  quarter  of  all  state  companies  had 
received  state  support  during  the  year,  totaling  7  billion  leva — 
almost  a  quarter  of  the  national  income.  Machine  building,  one 
of  Bulgaria's  key  export  industries,  became  a  problem  area  for  the 
economy  in  the  1980s.  Because  it  was  the  chief  consumer  of  the 
overpriced,  low-quality  output  of  the  metallurgical  industry,  the 
machine  industry  eventually  became  unprofitable  as  well.  In  1990 
Balkancar,  the  country's  biggest  company,  one  of  its  most  successful 
exporters,  and  another  major  customer  of  the  metallurgy  enter- 
prises, lost  money  for  the  first  time. 

A  critical  economic  policy  decision  in  the  late  1980s  was  Zhivkov's 
special  emphasis  on  several  energy-intensive  industries,  despite  the 


143 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

inadequacy  of  domestic  energy  supply.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  new 
regime  faced  a  choice  of  dismantling  many  of  those  enterprises, 
finding  less  expensive  energy  sources  to  keep  them  running,  or 
acquiring  enough  hard  currency  to  upgrade  their  technological  level 
and  make  them  less  energy-intensive.  To  further  complicate  in- 
dustrial policy,  beginning  in  1991  the  Soviet  Union  began  charg- 
ing market  prices  in  hard  currency  for  its  oil  and  gas. 

Finally,  emergence  of  a  significant,  fast-growing  environmen- 
tal movement  cast  the  tradeoff  of  environmental  quality  for  eco- 
nomic growth  in  starkly  negative  terms.  Barring  substantial 
technical  aid  (most  likely  from  the  West)  to  reduce  industrial  waste, 
public  demand  for  environmentally  sound  economic  policy  stood 
as  a  formidable  obstacle  to  industrial  expansion. 

Agriculture 

Prior  to  World  War  II,  agriculture  was  the  leading  sector  in  the 
Bulgarian  economy.  In  1939  agriculture  contributed  65  percent 
of  NMP,  and  four  out  of  every  five  Bulgarians  were  employed  in 
agriculture  (see  fig.  11).  The  importance  and  organization  of  Bul- 
garian agriculture  changed  drastically  after  the  war,  however.  By 
1958  the  BCP  had  collectivized  a  high  percentage  of  Bulgarian 
farms;  in  the  next  three  decades,  the  state  used  various  forms  of 
organization  to  improve  productivity,  but  none  succeeded.  Mean- 
while, private  plots  remained  productive  and  often  alleviated 
agricultural  shortages  during  the  Zhivkov  era. 

Early  Collectivization  Campaigns 

When  the  BCP  came  to  power,  Bulgarian  agriculture  consisted 
primarily  of  1 . 1  million  peasant  smallholdings.  The  party  saw  con- 
solidation of  these  holdings  as  its  most  immediate  agricultural  ob- 
jective. It  dismantled  the  agricultural  bank  that  had  been  a  primary 
source  of  investment  for  the  agriculture  and  food  processing  sec- 
tors before  World  War  II. 

The  first  attempts  at  voluntary  collectivization  yielded  modest 
results,  partly  because  open  coercion  was  impossible  until  a  peace 
treaty  was  signed  with  the  Allies.  The  labor-cooperative  farm 
(trudovo-kooperativno  zemedelsko  stopanstvo — TKZS)  received  official 
approval  in  1945.  It  closely  resembled  Soviet  cooperatives  in  or- 
ganization, although  members  were  guaranteed  a  share  of  profits 
and  membership  was  (nominally)  completely  voluntary.  By  1947 
only  3.8  percent  of  arable  land  had  been  collectivized.  After  the 
communists  won  the  first  postwar  election  and  the  peace  was 
concluded  in  1947,  pressure  on  private  landholders  increased. 
Although  most  small  farmers  had  joined  collectives,  by  1949  only 


144 


The  Economy 


12  percent  of  arable  land  was  under  state  control — mainly  because 
the  collectivization  program  alienated  many  peasants.  But  between 
1950  and  1953,  the  Stalinist  regime  of  Vulko  Chervenkov  used 
threats,  violence,  and  supply  discrimination  to  produce  the  fastest 
pace  of  collectivization  in  Eastern  Europe.  Sixty-one  percent  of 
arable  land  had  been  collectivized  by  1952.  The  process  was  declared 
complete  in  1958  when  92  percent  of  arable  land  belonged  to  the 
collective  farms.  This  ended  the  first  phase  of  Bulgarian  postwar 
agricultural  restructuring. 

Farm  Consolidation  in  the  1960s 

At  this  stage,  Bulgarian  collectives  were  much  smaller  than  the 
Soviet  organizations  on  which  they  were  modeled.  To  fulfill  the 
ambitious  goals  contained  in  the  Zhivkov  Theses  (January  1959) 
for  the  Third  Five- Year  Plan  (1958-60),  further  consolidation  was 
deemed  necessary.  This  process  reduced  the  number  of  collectives 
from  3,450  to  932,  and  the  average  size  of  a  collective  grew  from 
1,000  to  4,500  hectares. 

In  the  late  1960s,  an  agricultural  labor  shortage  combined  with 
fascination  for  China's  agrarian  amalgamation  to  prompt  further 
consolidation  of  collective  farms  into  APKs.  By  the  end  of  1971, 
all  of  Bulgaria's  744  collectives  and  56  state  farms  had  been  merged 
into  161  complexes,  most  of  which  were  designated  APKs.  These 
units  averaged  24,000  hectares  and  6,500  members.  The  consoli- 
dation continued  until  there  were  only  143  complexes  in  1977. 
Several  complexes  were  larger  than  100,000  hectares,  and  twenty- 
five  were  between  36,000  and  100,000  hectares.  In  the  short  term, 
they  were  to  achieve  horizontal  integration  by  specializing  in  three 
or  fewer  crops  and  one  type  of  livestock.  In  the  longer  term,  they 
would  be  the  basis  for  linking  agriculture  with  manufacturing  and 
commerce.  On  the  political  level,  this  consolidation  was  to  be  a 
symbolic  merger  of  the  agricultural  and  urban  workers,  who  had 
remained  quite  distinct  parts  of  the  Bulgarian  population  since  the 
nineteenth  century  in  defiance  of  the  theory  of  the  unified  socialist 
society. 

The  new  organizations  never  met  the  higher  agricultural  quotas 
of  the  late  1970s,  however.  For  some  products,  yield  did  not  keep 
pace  with  investment.  Overall  growth  in  agriculture  continued  to 
fall  after  the  creation  of  the  APKs.  And  the  goal  of  freeing  farm 
workers  to  take  industrial  jobs  was  not  reached.  On  the  contrary, 
the  annual  reduction  in  agricultural  employment  dropped  from  4 
to  2  percent  while  farm  labor  productivity  declined.  As  a  result, 
agriculture's  share  of  gross  investment  in  fixed  capital  fell  to  18 
percent  by  1976,  a  level  last  seen  in  the  mid-1950s.  In  1978  this 


147 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

failure  triggered  a  new  policy  emphasizing  smaller  complexes. 
Reduced  agricultural  quotas  in  the  Eighth  Five- Year  Plan  (1981-85) 
were  an  admission  that  too  much  had  been  expected  from  the  con- 
stant tinkering  process. 

Reform  in  the  1980s 

By  1982  the  total  of  old  and  new  APKs  reached  296,  the  aver- 
age size  was  halved  to  16,000  hectares,  and  the  management  hier- 
archy was  simplified.  Most  importantly,  the  number  of  annual 
indicators  of  plan  fulfillment  was  reduced  from  fourteen  to  four. 
The  new,  simpler  approach  also  allowed  greater  freedom  for  APKs 
to  negotiate  prices  on  surplus  production  and  to  purchase  their  own 
supplies. 

In  the  last  Zhivkov  years,  the  communist  regime  attempted  other 
agricultural  reforms,  including  autonomy  for  the  collectives.  At  that 
point,  the  only  funds  the  state  received  from  agriculture  were  60 
percent  of  foreign  currency  from  exports.  Even  then,  government 
delivery  prices  remained  so  low  that  state  foodstuff  monopolies 
received  only  the  absolute  minimum  supply.  In  1989  the  exodus 
of  310,000  ethnic  Turks,  many  of  whom  had  cultivated  personal 
plots,  also  hurt  agricultural  output. 

Despite  these  handicaps,  the  United  States  Department  of 
Agriculture  estimated  that  within  Eastern  Europe  Bulgaria  was  sec- 
ond only  to  Hungary  in  agricultural  trade  surpluses  through  1987. 
After  that  time,  however,  agricultural  output  dropped  so  far  that 
the  country  could  no  longer  feed  its  own  people.  In  1990  the  first 
rationing  and  shortages  since  World  War  II  were  the  most  obvi- 
ous indications  of  this  situation.  Because  of  domestic  shortages, 
export  of  several  agricultural  products  was  banned  in  1990. 

Agricultural  Products 

Two  long-term  policies  strongly  determined  priorities  in  Bul- 
garian agricultural  production  after  1960.  First,  livestock  was 
promoted  at  the  expense  of  crop  cultivation,  mainly  to  meet  ex- 
port demand.  Between  1970  and  1988,  the  share  of  livestock  in 
agricultural  production  rose  from  35.3  to  55.6  percent.  As  a  result, 
less  land  was  available  for  crops  in  that  period.  Pig  and  poultry 
production  increased  the  most,  but  large  numbers  of  sheep  also 
were  raised.  The  second  policy  was  a  shift  away  from  industrial 
crops  (primarily  tobacco  and  cotton),  toward  production  of  fruit 
(most  notably  apples),  vegetables  (most  notably  tomatoes),  and 
grapes.  Bulgaria  remained  an  important  exporter  of  tobacco, 
however,  averaging  65  percent  of  East  European  exports  of  that 
crop  in  the  1980s.  Grain  production  concentrated  on  wheat,  corn,

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

and  barley,  crops  that  are  vulnerable  to  weather  conditions.  Poor 
harvests  in  1985  and  1986  led  to  grain  imports  of  1.8  and  1.5  mil- 
lion tons,  respectively.  Sugar  beets,  potatoes,  sunflower  seeds,  and 
soybeans  also  were  important  crops  at  the  end  of  the  1980s.  In  1990 
Bulgaria  was  the  world's  largest  exporter  of  attar  of  roses,  used 
in  making  perfume  (see  fig.  11). 

The  Role  of  Private  Plots 

After  1970  the  only  consistent  contribution  to  agricultural  produc- 
tion growth  was  family  farming  on  private  plots  leased  from  the 
agricultural  complexes.  These  plots  could  not  be  bought  or  sold 
or  worked  by  hired  labor,  but  their  yield  belonged  to  the  tenant. 
In  1971  special  measures  were  instituted  to  increase  the  number 
and  the  availability  of  personal  plots.  Beginning  in  1974,  peasant 
households  were  permitted  to  lease  additional  plots  and  given  free 
access  to  fertilizer,  fodder  seed,  and  equipment  belonging  to  their 
agricultural  complexes.  To  encourage  this  practice,  the  government 
extended  loans  and  waived  income  taxes.  More  importantly,  deliv- 
ery prices  increased  for  agricultural  products.  In  the  mid-1970s, 
a  reduced  work  week  for  urban  workers  and  relaxed  requirements 
for  plot  leasing  encouraged  weekend  cultivation  of  personal  plots 
by  the  nonagricultural  population.  Plot  size  limits  were  removed 
in  1977. 

By  1982  personal  plots  accounted  for  25  percent  of  Bulgaria's 
agricultural  output  and  farm  worker  income.  In  1988  personal  plots 
accounted  for  large  shares  of  basic  agricultural  goods:  corn,  43.5 
percent;  tomatoes,  36.8  percent;  potatoes,  61.5  percent;  apples, 
24.8  percent;  grapes,  43.2  percent;  meat,  40.8  percent;  milk,  25.2 
percent;  eggs,  49.4  percent;  and  honey,  86  percent.  The  sales  from 
plots  to  town  markets  meant  that  despite  low  overall  agricultural 
growth  rates  in  the  1980s,  the  urban  food  supply  actually  improved 
in  many  areas  during  the  early  and  mid-1980s. 

Post-Zhivkov  Agricultural  Reform 

In  1991  privatization  of  agriculture  was  a  top  priority  of  the 
government  of  Prime  Minister  Dimitur  Popov.  That  spring  the 
National  Assembly  passed  a  new  Arable  Land  Law,  revising  the 
conditions  for  ownership  and  use  of  agricultural  land.  The  law  al- 
lowed every  Bulgarian  citizen  to  own  as  much  as  thirty  hectares 
of  land,  or  twenty  in  areas  of  intensive  cultivation.  Use  of  this  land 
was  at  the  complete  discretion  of  the  owner.  Conditions  were  stated 
for  voluntary  formation  of  cooperatives  by  private  landowners  and 
resale  of  their  land.  With  some  limitations,  landowners  whose 
property  had  been  incorporated  into  state  farms  were  to  receive 


150 


The  Economy 


"comparable"  plots  elsewhere  or  other  appropriate  compensation. 
The  state  or  municipality  retained  title  to  land  not  in  private  hands. 
Another  provision  described  redistribution  of  land  seized  by  the 
state  from  cooperatives  and  individuals  during  Zhivkov's  several 
agricultural  consolidations.  A  National  Land  Council  under  the 
Council  of  Ministers  was  to  oversee  land  distribution  and  arbitrate 
disputes,  aided  by  a  system  of  municipal  land  commissions. 

As  was  true  for  reform  elsewhere  in  the  Bulgarian  economy, 
agricultural  reform  encountered  stout  resistance  from  entrenched 
local  Zhivkovite  officials.  Pre-collectivization  land  ownership  records 
were  destroyed,  and  farmers  were  threatened  or  bribed  to  remain 
in  collectives  rather  than  seeking  private  farms.  Although  the  Arable 
Land  Law  was  widely  hailed  as  an  equitable  and  useful  economic 
reform,  its  association  with  the  Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  (BSP, 
formerly  the  BCP)  majority  brought  criticism  from  the  opposition 
Union  of  Democratic  Forces  (UDF).  Some  farmers  circumvented 
the  law  simply  by  seizing  land.  The  government,  meanwhile,  an- 
nounced that  no  state  land  would  be  redistributed  before  the  1991 
harvest. 

In  early  1991,  staples  such  as  sugar  and  olive  oil  were  unavail- 
able in  many  areas;  livestock  feed  rations  had  been  cut  by  more 
than  half;  a  grain  shortfall  of  1.7  million  tons  was  expected;  meat, 
withheld  from  markets  until  new  government  prices  were  an- 
nounced, was  very  scarce  and  expensive  in  cities;  and  fertilizers 
for  the  year's  crops  were  in  very  short  supply.  Western  firms  ex- 
pressed interest  in  joint  agricultural  ventures  in  Bulgaria,  but  hesi- 
tated because  of  uncertainty  about  political  and  legal  conditions 
for  such  projects.  A  new  round  of  government  price-fixing  in  Febru- 
ary 1991  substantially  raised  food  prices  but  did  restore  supplies 
of  some  items. 

Transportation 

The  Bulgarian  transportation  system  in  1987  was  poorly  devel- 
oped compared  with  systems  elsewhere  in  Europe.  The  rail  system 
totaled  4,300  kilometers  of  track,  of  which  4,055  were  standard 
gauge,  2,510  were  electrified,  and  917  were  double  track.  In  the 
1980s,  Bulgaria  moved  away  from  diesel  engines  toward  electrical 
rail  haulage.  By  1988  some  83  percent  of  freight  was  moved  by  this 
method,  compared  with  60  percent  in  1980.  In  1987  the  rails  car- 
ried 83  million  tons  of  freight  and  110,000,000  passengers.  In  1987 
Bulgaria  had  36,908  kilometers  of  roads,  33,535  of  which  were  hard 
surfaced  and  242  of  which  were  classified  as  motorways  (highways). 
In  1987  some  940  million  passengers  and  917  million  tons  of  freight 


151 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

traveled  by  road.  No  major  extension  of  the  rail  or  the  road  sys- 
tem was  built  in  the  late  1980s. 

In  1988  the  freight  system  moved  103  billion  ton  kilometers  (see 
Glossary)  of  freight,  the  majority  (62.9  percent)  by  seagoing  trans- 
port (see  fig.  12).  Of  the  dozen  Bulgarian  ports  on  the  Danube, 
the  most  important  was  Ruse.  The  remaining  freight  was  moved 
by  rail  (17.1  percent),  road  (16.9  percent),  inland  waterway  (2.1 
percent),  and  pipeline  (1  percent).  In  1988  the  national  airline, 
Balkan  Airline,  totalled  32  billion  passenger  kilometers  (see  Glos- 
sary). Rail  provided  25.5  percent  of  passenger  transport,  roads  62.2 
percent,  and  air  12.2  percent. 

The  Bulgarian  transportation  system  suffered  financial  neglect 
through  most  of  the  communist  era.  Investment  in  this  sector  was 
never  extremely  high,  but  in  1988  overall  investment  fell  almost 
25  percent.  The  largest  drops  were  in  sea  transport  (96  percent), 
river  transport  (63  percent),  pipeline  transport  (62  percent),  and 
rail  transport  (18  percent).  The  Bulgarian  State  Railroad  typified 
the  neglect  and  overuse  of  the  transportation  system.  In  1990 
authorities  estimated  that  27  million  leva  would  be  needed  to  re- 
store the  railroads  to  satisfactory  operating  condition.  Meanwhile, 
rail  revenues  fell  by  10  million  leva  during  the  first  five  months 
of  1990  as  a  result  of  lower  industrial  production  and  equipment 
breakdowns.  At  that  point,  about  one-third  of  Bulgaria's  passenger 
railcars  and  two-thirds  of  railroad  equipment  were  completely 
depreciated,  and  78  locomotives  and  3,500  freight  cars  were  idle 
due  to  breakdowns.  Some  300  kilometers  of  track  were  classified 
as  urgently  needing  repair. 

Communications 

Throughout  the  communist  period,  the  state  controlled  all  media. 
In  1987  Bulgaria  had  eighty  radio  and  forty-three  television  trans- 
mitters. Two  television  networks  broadcast  over  nineteen  stations 
in  1991 ,  with  250  low-power  repeaters  extending  coverage  to  rural 
areas.  The  radio  system  featured  three  networks  with  twenty  long- 
and  medium-wave  stations.  Foreign-language  programming  in 
Albanian,  Arabic,  English,  French,  German,  Greek,  Italian,  Portu- 
guese, Serbo-Croatian,  Spanish,  and  Turkish  was  broadcast  from 
short-  and  medium-wave  stations  in  Vidin,  Stolnik,  Kostinbrod, 
and  Plovdiv.  Bulgaria  was  a  member  of  the  Intervision  East  Euro- 
pean television  network,  but  in  1991  it  had  not  joined  the  Interna- 
tional Telecommunications  Satellite  Organization  (Intelsat).  In  1990 
approximately  2  million  radio  receivers  and  2.1  million  television 
sets  were  in  use.  Some  2.23  million  telephones  were  in  operation 
in  1987  (see  table  14,  Appendix).

The  Economy 


In  1991  Bulgaria  began  privatizing  its  communications  sector. 
The  Commission  on  Communications  and  Information  Science, 
with  the  help  of  West  European  communications  experts,  developed 
a  plan  for  formation  of  ten  independent  companies  to  operate  in 
communications  services,  the  equipment  industry,  construction, 
and  other  related  areas.  The  companies  would  operate  under  au- 
thority of  a  state  regulatory  organization  similar  to  those  in  Western 
Europe.  This  plan  would  mean  gradually  dismantling  the  national 
communications  monopoly  while  retaining  the  unified  national  tele- 
graph, postal,  telephone,  radio,  and  television  services.  Meanwhile, 
private  companies  outside  the  existing  networks  were  to  be  en- 
couraged to  compete  for  new  customers,  and  prices  were  to  rise 
accordingly  from  the  artificially  low  levels  of  the  command  econ- 
omy period. 

Banking  and  Finance 

Under  the  Zhivkov  regime,  Bulgaria  followed  the  customary  com- 
munist pattern  of  a  single  state-run  bank  performing  all  banking 
and  investment  functions.  Investment  policy  was  the  province  of 
state  planning  agencies,  with  substantial  input  from  the  BCP  and 
the  national  bank.  Post-Zhivkov  reform  aimed  at  privatizing  and 
compartmentalizing  the  banking  system,  a  goal  that  would  likely 
require  years  of  gradual  reform. 

Currency  and  Exchange 

The  national  currency  of  Bulgaria  is  the  lev  (plural,  leva — see 
Glossary),  which  is  divided  into  100  stotinki  (sing.,  stotinka). 
Throughout  the  communist  era,  the  lev  could  be  used  only  in 
domestic  transactions  because  it  was  not  convertible  into  foreign 
currency.  Bulgarian  nationals  were  prohibited  from  owning  for- 
eign currency,  and  the  law  prohibited  citizens  and  foreigners  from 
entering  or  leaving  the  country  with  leva.  As  was  true  for  domes- 
tic prices,  the  value  of  the  lev  was  administratively  determined. 
This  fact  led  to  frequent  overvaluing  of  the  lev  in  terms  of  hard 
currencies  and  black  market  rates  well  below  official  exchange  rates. 
Besides  official  rates,  which  were  based  on  a  gold  parity  developed 
after  World  War  II,  a  commercial  rate  was  used  for  business  trans- 
actions and  statistical  purposes,  and  a  tourist  rate  determined  the 
amount  received  by  foreigners  in  Bulgaria  for  their  domestic  cur- 
rencies. None  of  these  arbitrary  rates  reflected  the  relationship  of 
domestic  and  foreign  prices.  Trade  with  Western  countries  was  con- 
ducted in  hard  currency,  while  the  transferable  ruble,  an  account- 
ing device  with  no  convertible  value,  was  primarily  used  to  clear 
commercial  accounts  within  Comecon.  In  1990  the  lev  was  devalued 


155 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

several  times,  finally  settling  at  rates  of  about  0.76  lev  to  the  United 
States  dollar  (official),  3  leva  to  the  dollar  (commercial),  and  7  leva 
to  the  dollar  (tourist).  The  black  market  rate  fluctuated  consider- 
ably, but  ended  1990  at  approximately  11  leva  to  the  dollar.  In 
mid- 1991  the  Bulgarian  National  Bank  (BNB)  issued  conversion 
tables  for  the  lev  into  major  world  currencies  (see  table  15,  Ap- 
pendix). The  official  value  at  that  time  was  18  leva  to  the  United 
States  dollar. 

Banking  System 

As  the  chief  financial  instrument  of  economic  policy  making,  the 
BNB  assumed  virtually  all  of  the  financial  functions  in  the  coun- 
try under  the  centrally  planned  economy.  Only  the  granting  of  for- 
eign trade  and  consumer  credits  were  separate  functions,  performed 
respectively  by  the  Bulgarian  Foreign  Trade  Bank  and  the  State 
Savings  Bank — both  of  which  were  subordinate  to  the  BNB.  The 
BNB  worked  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  finance  capital  in- 
vestments in  the  economy.  The  BNB  also  monitored  the  economic 
organizations  that  received  investment  funds  to  ensure  their  use 
for  accomplishing  plan  targets.  As  enterprises  became  more  self- 
fmancing  in  the  1970s,  a  greater  share  of  their  investment  capital 
was  composed  of  bank  credits  granted  by  the  BNB.  Between  1965 
and  1975,  the  BNB  share  of  investment  funds  jumped  from  7  per- 
cent to  54  percent;  the  trend  then  moderated  as  enterprises  began 
to  rely  more  on  retained  earnings  to  finance  investments. 

Like  industry  and  agriculture,  banking  under  the  BCP  ex- 
perimented occasionally  with  decentralization  but  remained  quite 
centralized  until  shortly  before  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov.  A  1987 
reform  nominally  split  Bulgarian  banking  into  a  two-tiered  system. 
The  function  of  the  BNB  was  restricted  to  money  supply,  although 
it  also  retained  significant  supervisory  power.  The  reform  also 
created  several  specialized  banks  including  the  Agricultural  and 
Cooperative  Bank,  the  Biochemical  Bank,  the  Construction  Bank, 
the  Electronics  Bank,  the  Transportation  Bank,  and  the  Transport, 
Agricultural,  and  Building  Equipment  Bank — each  responsible  for 
an  industrial  sector. 

Post-Zhivkov  banking  reform  began  hesitantly  but  grew  more 
comprehensive  in  1991.  In  a  controversial  policy  decision,  the 
government  first  increased  interest  rates  from  4.5  to  8  percent  in 
1990,  then  let  them  float  freely  beginning  in  1991.  Although  the 
first  private  commercial  bank  was  established  in  May  1990,  a  new 
National  Bank  Bill  was  not  passed  until  June  1991.  That  law  pro- 
vided for  a  two-tier  bank  system  independent  of  direct  government 
control  but  accountable  to  the  National  Assembly.  The  first  tier 


156

of  the  new  system  was  to  be  the  Central  Bank,  the  second  a  separate 
system  of  commercial  banks  and  lending  institutions  serving  pri- 
vate citizens  and  enterprises.  Three-month  bank  credits  would  be 
available  to  cabinet  ministries.  The  BNB  was  to  issue  monthly 
balance  statements  and  report  semiannually  to  the  National  As- 
sembly. 

Investment  Policy 

In  choosing  among  alternative  investment  projects,  Bulgarian 
planners  in  the  Zhivkov  era  faced  greater  difficulties  than  invest- 
ment decision  makers  in  Western  economies.  True  relative  costs 
of  labor  and  materials  were  masked  by  state  assignment  of  prices, 
meaning  that  funding  allocations  among  projects  often  were  ar- 
bitrary. In  most  cases,  investments  were  not  based  on  efficiency 
criteria,  but  rather  on  plan  goals.  Artificially  low  interest  rates  also 
discouraged  enterprises  from  efficient  investment  fund  allocation. 

The  state  budget  also  guided  party  economic  policy  under  the 
old  regime.  Until  the  reforms  of  the  1970s,  the  budget  was  the 
primary  source  of  funds  for  enterprise  investment.  Budget  reve- 
nues were  originally  derived  mainly  from  the  turnover  tax,  a  re- 
tail sales  tax  that  was  also  used  to  regulate  demand  for  various 
products.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1960s,  budget  revenues  were 


157 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

derived  progressively  less  from  the  turnover  tax  and  more  from 
taxes  on  net  enterprise  income. 

Prices 

Investments  in  inefficient  operations  and  subsidies  on  consumer 
items  often  led  to  budget  deficits.  Often  the  state  simply  printed 
more  money  to  cover  its  obligations.  Eventually  this  practice  led 
to  circulation  of  excess  currency  compared  with  consumer  goods 
and  services  available  at  prevailing  prices.  Because  prices  were  ad- 
ministratively set,  shortages  and  long  lines  occurred  more  often 
than  inflation  under  the  CPE.  But  party-directed  general  price  in- 
creases such  as  the  average  15  percent  rise  in  1979  usually  were 
quite  steep. 

In  the  post-Zhivkov  era,  economic  planners  saw  market- 
determined  prices  for  most  goods  and  services  as  their  long-term 
goal.  In  1990  the  prices  of  40  percent  of  goods  and  60  percent  of 
services  were  freed  from  administrative  control.  In  the  second  half 
of  1990,  price  liberalization  raised  consumer  prices  an  average  of 
over  50  percent.  In  February  1991,  price  controls  were  removed 
from  all  goods  and  services  except  fuels,  heat,  and  electricity.  Im- 
mediately after  this  step,  average  food  prices  were  nearly  six  times 
their  1989  level;  housing  was  up  3.7  times,  clothing  three  times 
more  expensive.  These  levels,  established  by  an  independent  trade 
union  study,  were  above  the  level  triggering  new  talks  on  com- 
pensation payments.  (For  the  second  consecutive  year,  a  govern- 
ment indexation  program  was  established  to  reimburse  a  share 
(estimated  at  an  average  65  percent)  of  the  higher  cost  of  living 
caused  by  the  new  price  policy  in  the  first  half  of  1991 .)  In  a  two- 
month  period  of  early  1991 ,  consumption  dropped  by  over  50  per- 
cent, but  total  consumer  spending  still  increased  by  11.5  percent. 

Foreign  Trade 

Membership  in  Comecon  tied  Bulgarian  trade  policy  closely  to 
the  Soviet  economic  sphere  following  World  War  II.  By  1991, 
however,  trade  policy  was  on  the  verge  of  significant  diversifica- 
tion. With  the  trade  protection  of  Comecon  no  longer  available, 
Bulgaria  aggressively  sought  new  markets  in  the  West  while  seek- 
ing to  retain  the  most  advantageous  commercial  relations  with  its 
former  Comecon  partners. 

Postwar  Trade  Policy 

The  adoption  of  the  Soviet  economic  model  had  direct  and  in- 
direct impact  on  Bulgarian  international  trade  after  World  War 
II.  Among  direct  results  was  the  decision  to  reduce  dependency

on  prewar  Western  trade  partners.  This  decision  meant  strong  pro- 
motion of  import  substitution  policies  to  bolster  domestic  produc- 
tion of  goods  previously  imported.  In  1960  Bulgaria's  total  foreign 
trade  (exports  plus  imports)  was  31  percent  of  NMP,  quite  low 
for  a  country  with  a  small  internal  market  and  few  natural  resources. 
By  the  1980s,  however,  this  figure  had  risen  to  over  90  percent. 
Before  World  War  II,  Germany  was  well-established  as  Bulgaria's 
top  trading  partner.  Postwar  economic  policy  diverted  trade  from 
Central  Europe  to  Eastern  Europe,  and  primarily  to  the  Soviet 
Union.  The  new  domestic  economic  priorities  dictated  a  revised 
foreign  trade  structure  (see  table  16;  table  17,  Appendix).  The  policy 
of  promoting  heavy  industry,  for  example,  required  huge  imports 
of  machinery  and  raw  materials  (see  table  18;  table  19,  Appen- 
dix). Beginning  in  the  mid-1950s,  imports  of  machinery  accounted 
for  approximately  half  the  value  of  total  imports,  while  fuels,  metals, 
and  minerals  made  up  more  than  a  quarter  of  this  value.  Lower 
postwar  investment  in  agriculture  eventually  lessened  the  share  of 
foodstuffs  in  total  exports. 

The  state  monopoly  of  foreign  trade  also  changed  the  way  deci- 
sions were  reached  on  international  allocation  of  goods.  Trade  de- 
cisions were  reached  administratively  by  planning  authorities  or 
negotiated  with  other  members  of  Comecon.  Overall  control  of  for- 
eign trade  was  shared  among  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade,  the 
Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Bulgarian  Foreign  Trade  Bank. 

Import  and  export  operations  were  conducted  by  foreign  trade 
enterprises,  most  of  which  were  affiliated  with  one  or  more  associ- 
ations but  retained  a  legal  identity  outside  the  associations.  Although 
reform  measures  by  the  Zhivkov  regime  gave  associations  some 
profit  incentives  in  international  trade,  the  producing  enterprises 
themselves  were  completely  isolated  from  the  foreign  customer.  This 
situation  meant  that  world  quality  standards  had  no  influence  on 
Bulgarian  producers. 

Bulgaria  in  Comecon 

The  most  important  event  in  postwar  Bulgarian  international 
economic  relations  occurred  in  1949  when  it  became  a  founding 
member  of  Comecon.  Comecon  was  an  attempt  by  the  socialist 
economies  to  simplify  the  planning  process  by  synchronizing  the 
five-year  plans  of  member  countries  and,  more  importantly,  by 
achieving  what  Marxists  called  an  international  division  of  labor. 
Countries  within  Comecon  would  specialize  in  the  products  they 
made  most  efficiently  and  export  the  surplus.  Products  that  a  coun- 
try could  not  produce  efficiently  would  be  available  from  one  or 
more  of  its  Comecon  partners.  This  design  was  intended  to 


160 


The  Economy 


eliminate  some  redundancies  inherent  in  the  Soviet  economic  model 
where  each  country  produced  goods  of  all  categories.  Although  the 
concept  achieved  isolated  successes  such  as  Bulgarian  forklift  trucks, 
broad  growth  was  blocked  by  the  uniform  socialist  preoccupation 
with  heavy  industry  and  the  lack  of  a  single  convertible  currency. 
The  currency  issue  in  particular  made  intra-Comecon  trade  a  cum- 
bersome process  requiring  negotiation  of  annual  bilateral  trade 
agreements  for  all  member  nations. 

In  the  1980s,  exports  to  the  Soviet  Union  consisted  primarily 
of  machinery,  electronic  components,  and  agricultural  goods.  These 
included  forklift  trucks,  electric  engines,  telephones,  tobacco,  fresh 
fruits  and  vegetables,  and  wine.  Imports  from  the  Soviet  Union 
were  mainly  energy  and  raw  materials,  including  oil,  natural  gas, 
iron  ore,  ferrous  metals,  and  cotton.  In  1988  Bulgaria  still  relied 
almost  entirely  on  Soviet  oil  and  natural  gas.  East  Germany  and 
Czechoslovakia  were  the  next  most  important  Comecon  trading 
partners,  accounting  for  5.2  and  4.6  percent  of  exports,  respec- 
tively, and  5.9  and  5.4  percent  of  imports,  respectively.  Exchanges 
of  goods  between  Bulgaria  and  these  countries  emphasized  both 
exports  and  imports  of  machinery  and  the  export  of  agricultural 
products. 

In  the  initial  years  of  Bulgaria's  Comecon  membership,  the  coun- 
try benefited  from  energy  prices  below  world  levels,  especially  for 
oil,  in  two  ways.  The  cost  of  developing  otherwise  inefficient  in- 
dustries was  lower,  and  reexport  of  crude  and  refined  oil  for  hard 
currency  bought  Western  technology  to  upgrade  the  industrial  in- 
frastructure. Comecon  members  paid  for  their  imports  through 
bilateral  clearing  agreements,  with  no  exchange  of  hard  currency. 
In  the  initial  stages  of  Comecon,  Bulgaria  exported  mainly  food, 
the  price  of  which  was  lower  in  Comecon  than  on  the  world  mar- 
ket. Later,  however,  Bulgaria  paid  for  imported  Soviet  raw  materi- 
als largely  with  machinery  that  was  priced  higher  than  on  the  world 
market. 

Beginning  in  1974,  Soviet  energy  exports  were  based  on  a  float- 
ing five-year  average  of  world  prices  that  rarely  matched  market 
prices  at  a  given  time.  Even  when  Comecon  prices  were  above  the 
world  level,  Bulgaria  benefited  from  the  lack  of  currency  exchange 
in  the  Comecon  system.  But  dependence  on  Comecon  trade,  es- 
pecially Soviet  energy  exports,  damaged  Bulgaria  tremendously 
when  economic  reform  swept  through  the  Soviet  sphere  in  1989 
and  1990.  Of  Bulgarian  exports,  62.5  percent  still  went  to  the  Soviet 
Union  in  1988,  and  53.5  percent  of  imports  came  from  that  coun- 
try. The  new  trade  system,  established  after  reforms,  required  trade 
accounts  to  be  cleared  in  hard  currency  at  current  world  prices  as 


161 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

of  January  1,  1991.  (Bilateral  protocols  for  this  procedure  had  not 
been  signed  by  that  time,  however;  Bulgaria  still  owed  Hungary 
87  million  transferable  rubles  in  1991.) 

After  the  political  reforms  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  Soviet  Union 
announced  cutbacks  in  energy  exports  to  Eastern  Europe.  The  cut- 
backs caused  energy  and  raw  materials  shortages.  In  1990  Bulgar- 
ian industry  was  forced  to  curtail  production  sharply;  meanwhile, 
consumers  endured  severe  shortages  of  gasoline  as  fuel  prices  dou- 
bled. A  new  set  of  export  and  import  regulations  adopted  in 
mid- 1991  removed  import  taxes  from  200  types  of  raw  materials 
and  consumer  goods  in  critically  short  supply.  The  same  regula- 
tions set  export  price  minimums  to  eliminate  pricing  below  world 
market  levels;  export  of  crude  oil,  metals,  grains,  and  textile  raw 
materials  was  banned. 

Trade  with  the  West  and  the  Third  World 

After  1960  Bulgaria's  trade  with  the  West  increased,  partly  be- 
cause Bulgaria  needed  Western  machinery  to  supplement  the  out-

Between  1960  and  1975,  the  Western  share  of  Bulgarian  imports 
went  from  13.6  percent  to  23.6  percent.  In  the  same  period, 
however,  exports  dropped  from  12.4  to  9.3  percent,  creating  an 
external  debt  problem  with  the  West.  Increased  exports  to  Third 
World  nations  did  little  to  help  Bulgaria  reduce  this  trade  deficit 
because  most  Third  World  trade  was  not  in  convertible  currencies. 

Throughout  the  1970s,  Bulgarian  trade  balances  alternated  be- 
tween solvency  and  high  deficits.  Although  the  trade  deficit  was 
eliminated  in  1975,  many  short-term  debts  to  West  European  banks 
remained.  By  1976  Bulgarian  debt  was  13  percent  of  estimated 
GNP — the  highest  ratio  in  Eastern  Europe  at  the  time.  Bulgaria 
greatly  diminished  this  debt  by  reexporting  Soviet  oil  to  Western 
buyers  in  the  late  1970s. 

From  that  point,  Bulgaria  maintained  trade  surpluses  in  hard 
currency  until  1985,  when  emergency  imports  of  grain  and  coal 
created  a  deficit  of  US$200  million.  A  series  of  poor  harvests,  high 
machinery  imports  in  the  investment  push  of  the  Ninth  Five-Year 
Plan  (1986-90),  and  sharply  dropping  oil  prices  deprived  Bulgaria 
of  hard  currency  and  created  a  major  new  trade  deficit.  Libya  and 
Iraq,  the  main  Third  World  customers  with  which  a  surplus  had 
been  accumulated,  also  reduced  their  purchase  of  Bulgarian  goods 
at  this  time. 

The  resulting  trade  deficits  were  financed  by  credits  from  Western 
banks.  After  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov,  the  government  announced 
that  the  gross  hard  currency  debt  had  reached  US$10.6  billion  by

the  end  of  1989.  Net  indebtedness  was  somewhat  lower  at  US$7.7 
billion,  but  much  of  the  hard  currency  export  credits  that  Bulgaria 
granted  were  to  Libya  and  Iraq,  who  were  likely  to  default  on  many 
of  their  deals.  Bulgaria  had  arranged  for  Iraq  to  repay  these  loans 
with  oil,  but  in  1991  the  trade  embargo  and  ensuing  Persian  Gulf 
War  negated  that  agreement.  In  March  1990,  the  incoming  Bul- 
garian government  announced  unilateral  suspension  of  principal 
payments  on  outstanding  debt,  and  later  interest  payments  were 
suspended  as  well.  Western  lines  of  credit  immediately  were  frozen, 
and  Bulgarian  hard  currency  holdings  dropped  to  the  minimal  level 
of  US$200  million  in  May  1990.  " 

Bulgaria's  main  Western  trading  partners  were  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany)  before  German  unification 
in  1990,  Switzerland,  and  Italy.  Exports  to  these  countries  were 
relatively  minor,  accounting  for  between  1  and  0.7  percent  of  total 
exports.  Imports  from  West  Germany  were  4.9  percent  of  the  total, 
while  Switzerland  accounted  for  1.4  percent  of  imports,  and  Italy 
1.1  percent.  Trade  with  the  developed,  Western  economies  re- 
sembled trade  between  an  undeveloped  country  and  an  industri- 
alized one.  Bulgaria  imported  mostly  machinery  from  those 
countries  and  sold  them  raw  and  semifinished  materials  and  agricul- 
tural products.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  most  important  Third  World  trading  partners,  Iraq  and 
Libya,  purchased  2.8  and  2.3  percent  of  Bulgarian  exports,  respec- 
tively. These  exports  consisted  mainly  of  major  construction  projects 
and  agricultural  goods.  The  overthrow  of  the  Zhivkov  regime  re- 
vived talk  of  establishing  a  Black  Sea  Trading  Zone  that  also  would 
include  Turkey  and  Greece  and  perhaps  Romania.  In  establish- 
ing its  new  trade  policy  in  1991 ,  Bulgaria  faced  a  choice  of  expand- 
ing its  traditional  commercial  ties  with  Germany  and  Germany's 
partners  in  the  EEC  or  cultivating  new  ties  with  closer  markets 
such  as  Turkey.  In  1991  Turkey  offered  to  invest  US$13  billion 
in  Bulgaria's  economy.  An  independent  Union  for  Cooperation 
between  Bulgaria  and  Turkey  was  founded  to  foster  direct  cooper- 
ation between  enterprises  of  the  two  countries,  and  transportation 
links  were  solidified  by  ministerial  agreements  in  1991 .  Talks  with 
the  EEC  early  in  1991  yielded  assurance  of  short-term  EEC  finan- 
cial support  through  the  PHARE  (Polish  and  Hungarian  Assistance 
for  the  Reconstruction  of  Europe)  program  and  closer  future  ties, 
assuming  that  Bulgaria  continued  to  make  progress  in  its  political 
and  economic  reform  programs. 

New  Trade  Conditions,  1990 

The  end  of  central  planning  opened  the  Bulgarian  economy  to 
world  competition  and  began  a  wrenching  transition  for  which  it 
was  ill-equipped  in  finance,  industrial  diversity,  agricultural  in- 
frastructure, and  available  natural  resources.  The  transition  was 
made  doubly  difficult  because  the  long  years  of  privileged  access 
to  energy  had  fostered  inefficient  energy  use  in  the  Bulgarian 
economy. 

Under  the  new  economic  conditions,  imports  would  be  purchased 
only  in  hard  currency.  Although  Western  firms  and  governments 
offered  some  credits  and  aid  in  1991,  Western  investors  preferred 
Poland,  Hungary,  and  Czechoslovakia  to  Bulgaria.  Those  coun- 
tries were  more  familiar  to  Westerners,  and  they  had  had  relative- 
ly advanced  market  economies  before  World  Wrar  II.  For  these 
reasons,  in  the  early  1990s  they  received  the  lion's  share  of  a  rather 
meager  Western  investment  in  Eastern  Europe. 

Standard  of  Living 

From  the  end  of  World  War  II  until  the  1960s,  the  Bulgarian 
standard  of  living  experienced  no  significant  improvements.  A  net 
decline  may  have  occurred  during  some  of  the  collectivization 
drives.  The  first  improvements  came  when  the  government  insti- 
tuted a  minimum  agricultural  wage  as  part  of  its  reconciliation  with 
the  peasants  after  the  Zhivkov  Theses  failed  in  1960.  Increases  in 


164 


The  Economy 


real  incomes  in  agriculture  rose  by  6.7  percent  per  year  during  the 
1960s.  During  this  same  period,  industrial  wages  increased  by  4.9 
percent  annually.  Early  in  the  1960s,  higher  prices  offset  those  wage 
increases;  but  by  1970,  increased  urban  food  supplies  made  im- 
proved urban  incomes  meaningful.  According  to  official  data,  from 
the  Fourth  through  the  Eighth  Five- Year  Plans  (1961-85),  growth 
in  real  wages  ranged  from  5.3  percent  (1966-70)  to  0.5  percent 
(1976-80).  The  latter  figure  is  low  because  a  major  price  revision 
in  1979  raised  prices  of  foodstuffs  by  25  percent  and  consumer  goods 
by  15  percent.  Real  growth  in  Bulgaria  at  that  point  was  the  lowest 
in  Europe.  Bulgarian  statistics  indicating  real  income  growth  often 
were  inaccurate,  however.  A  major  distortion  resulted  from  the 
failure  of  official  figures  to  account  for  variations  in  availability 
of  commodities  or  services  or  for  government  subsidies  for  food, 
housing,  education,  and  health  care — vital  factors  in  evaluating 
standard  of  living  and  purchasing  power. 

In  1990  a  Bulgarian  economist  made  an  independent  attempt 
to  construct  a  consumer  price  index  for  the  period  1979  through 
1989.  Based  on  those  findings,  inflation  during  that  period  was  131 
percent,  or  8.7  percent  per  year.  Official  data  showed  a  9.0  per- 
cent increase  in  consumer  prices  between  1980  through  1988,  or 
1.1  percent  annually.  The  same  study  compared  the  quantity  of 
various  food  items  that  could  be  purchased  with  the  average  monthly 
salary  in  nine  different  countries,  including  four  in  the  West  (Aus- 
tria, France,  West  Germany,  and  Britain).  Of  ten  basic  food 
categories,  the  lowest  amount  that  average  monthly  earnings  could 
purchase  in  the  Western  economies  was  3.3  times  the  amount  ob- 
tainable from  average  monthly  earnings  in  Bulgaria.  Even  in  com- 
parison with  the  other  socialist  countries  in  the  study,  Bulgarian 
purchasing  power  was  the  lowest  by  at  least  25  percent.  A  mitigat- 
ing factor  in  the  latter  set  of  comparisons  is  that  official  encourage- 
ment of  private  plots  spurred  substantially  greater  availability  (albeit 
at  greater  cost)  than  in  most  other  East  European  economies. 

Some  improvement  was  achieved  in  the  Bulgarian  diet  in  the 
1970s  and  1980s.  Wary  of  popular  discontent,  Zhivkov  made  a 
major  speech  in  December  1972  in  which  he  promised  a  ten-year 
program  to  raise  living  standards  in  general  and  to  raise  food  con- 
sumption to  the  "scientific  norms"  set  by  the  United  Nations  (UN). 
Zhivkov  never  was  entirely  successful  in  this  effort,  however.  Bread 
and  sugar  were  the  only  foods  for  which  Bulgarian  consumption 
rates  reached  or  exceeded  UN  norms  in  the  later  Zhivkov  years. 

Availability  of  consumer  durables  significantly  improved  in  the 
1970s.  According  to  official  statistics,  between  1965  and  1988  the 
number  of  televisions  per  100  households  increased  from  8  to  100; 


165 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

radios  increased  from  59  to  95;  refrigerators  from  5  to  96;  wash- 
ing machines  from  23  to  96;  and  automobiles  from  2  to  40.  Avail- 
able automobiles  were  primarily  Soviet  Fiats,  some  of  which  were 
manufactured  in  Bulgaria.  Assembly  of  the  Soviet  Moskvich  began 
at  the  Lovech  Vehicle  Assembly  Plant  in  1988. 

Housing  was  one  of  the  most  serious  shortcomings  in  the  Bul- 
garian standard  of  living.  Residential  construction  targets  in  the 
Five- Year  Plans  were  regularly  underfulfllled.  Consequently,  fam- 
ilies often  waited  several  years  for  apartments;  in  Sofia,  where  over- 
crowding was  at  its  worst,  the  wait  was  as  long  as  ten  years  (see 
Housing,  ch.  2). 

Market  Reform 

The  first  year  of  post-Zhivkov  governance  brought  substantial 
political  confusion  and  paralysis,  despite  the  country's  desperate 
need  to  concentrate  on  economic  reform.  The  interim  cabinet  and 
parliament  of  1990  provided  only  stopgap  measures,  not  the  long- 
term  planning  that  all  factions  believed  necessary.  The  coalition 
government  of  Dimitur  Popov  came  to  power  at  the  beginning  of 
1991  with  broad  support  but  under  the  worst  economic  conditions 
since  World  War  II  (see  Governance  after  Zhivkov,  ch.  4).  The 
Popov  program  planned  first  to  use  support  from  the  International 
Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary),  the  European  Bank  for 
Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD — see  Glossary),  and  the 
EEC  to  achieve  financial  stability.  The  second  phase  of  the  plan 
was  privatization  of  the  Bulgarian  enterprise  system.  The  hard 
winter  of  1990-91  began  to  break  the  policy  stalemate  between  the 
ruling  BSP  and  its  increasingly  powerful  opposition,  the  UDF  (see 
Nongovernmental  Political  Institutions,  ch.  4). 

Reform  Mechanisms 

Although  both  the  BSP  and  the  UDF  agreed  on  the  need  for 
market-oriented  reforms,  disagreements  on  methods  and  timing 
continued  in  1991.  The  BSP  advocated  slow  transformation,  to 
minimize  economic  dislocations  and  hardship  (and  also  to  preserve 
privileged  positions  for  party  members  whenever  possible).  The 
UDF  believed  that  a  market  economy  could  not  be  installed 
piecemeal,  but  could  be  effective  only  as  a  form  of  "shock  ther- 
apy." The  UDF  saw  free  market  features  such  as  market  prices 
and  privatization  as  incompatible  with  socialist  institutions  such 
as  large  state-owned  enterprises.  The  huge  operating  losses  of  such 
enterprises  were  largely  responsible  for  a  severe  1990  decline  in 
NMP.  The  model  advocated  by  the  UDF  was  the  renaissance  of 
the  Polish  economy  through  private  enterprise.  This  model  justi- 
fied severe,  short-term  social  costs  because  only  by  inflicting  them

could  the  economy  be  disentangled  from  the  moribund  apparatus 
that  remained  from  the  central  planning  era. 

Progress  was  made  on  some  fronts  even  before  formation  of  the 
first  coalition  government  in  early  1991.  In  September  1990,  Bul- 
garia's admission  to  the  IMF  promised  access  to  hard  currency  loans 
and  help  in  restructuring  the  economy.  New  agricultural  banks 
began  providing  credit  to  private  farmers  tilling  the  land  provided 
in  the  1991  Arable  Land  Law;  the  first  private  bank  was  opened; 
and  Bulgaria  applied  for  membership  to  the  General  Agreements 
on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT — see  Glossary)  and  the  World  Bank 
(see  Glossary)  (see  Agriculture,  this  ch.). 

The  Economic  Policy  Commission 

By  1991  the  Economic  Policy  Commission  was  the  most  impor- 
tant advisory  body  on  economic  reform  for  its  parent  body,  the 
National  Assembly.  A  number  of  economic  proposals  made  in  1990 
by  the  government  of  Prime  Minister  Andrei  Lukanov  were  found 
inadequate  and  redrawn  in  1991.  A  particularly  difficult  obstacle 
in  establishing  truly  private  enterprises  was  Decree  Number  56, 
the  1 989  formula  that  established  semi-decentralized  operating  prin- 
ciples for  firms  and  commercial  organizations  (see  The  Era  of 


167 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


Experimentation  and  Reform,  this  ch.).  In  1991  the  National  As- 
sembly considered  new  laws  addressing  aspects  of  the  transition 
to  a  market  economy:  the  Commercial  Law  was  to  replace  Decree 
Number  56  as  the  basic  description  of  commercial  enterprise  oper- 
ation: a  complex  of  auditing  and  statistical  laws  were  to  put  Bul- 
garian commerce  on  the  same  standards  as  potential  Western 
investors.  The  Privatization  Law  was  the  last  and  most  problematic 
item  because,  unlike  the  recipients  of  agricultural  land  under  the 
Arable  Land  Law.  private  recipients  of  former  state  commercial 
enterprises  had  not  been  identified.  The  first  goal  of  the  Economic 
Policy  Commission  was  to  use  tight  monetary  policy  to  eliminate 
unprofitable  enterprises  inherited  from  the  CPE  era:  this  would 
finally  stabilize  productivity  after  the  precipitous  fall  that  began 
in  1990  and  accelerated  in  1991 .  Once  stability  was  reached,  a  full- 
scale  privatization  process  would  begin:  the  1991  timetable  called 
for  the  latter  process  to  be  well  under  way  by  early  1992. 

Domestic  and  International  Economic  Policies  in  the  1990s 

Whatever  the  pace  of  the  Bulgarian  economic  transition.  1991 
promised  substantial  dislocation  before  an  upturn  could  be  expected. 
In  1990  industrial  production  had  fallen  by  10.7  percent.  Prime 
Minister  Popov  warned  that  as  much  as  25  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion would  require  social  assistance  in  1991.  an  increase  from  the 
20  percent  of  1990.  Although  the  Popov  government  launched  a 
consensus  economic  reform  plan,  pending  national  elections  in 
mid- 1991  it  remained  only  a  caretaker  government.  Popov's  com- 
mitment to  tough  financial  measures  and  the  political  calm  that 
prevailed  during  the  crisis  period  encouraged  foreign  financial  as- 
sistance. IMF  loan  requirements  included  liberalizing  foreign  trade 
policy,  lifting  price  and  currency  controls,  compensating  for  so- 
cial dislocation  that  resulted  from  reforms,  maintaining  a  low  na- 
tional budget  deficit,  eliminating  centralized  production  and 
resource  allocation,  initiating  privatization  of  small  firms,  and  de- 
emphasizing  trade  with  Comecon  countries. 

In  January  1991.  the  United  States  extended  most-favored-nation 
status  to  Bulgaria:  the  United  States  Congress  approved  the  move 
in  April.  The  recently  chartered  EBRD  committed  between  100 
and  120  million  European  currency  units  (ECUs — see  Glossary) 
to  Bulgaria  in  1991  and  1992.  Most  of  the  money  was  to  go  through 
the  PHARE  program.  Of  that  amount.  40  percent  was  earmarked 
for  restructuring  the  economy,  25  percent  for  agriculture,  20  per- 
cent for  health  care,  and  10  percent  for  the  environment.  In  March 
1991.  the  IMF  approved  USS500  million  in  loans,  and  the  EEC 
added  a  loan  of  L'SS377  million.  A  request  to  reschedule  part  of

The  Economy 


Bulgaria's  international  debt  was  denied  in  early  1991,  however. 
Western  aid  was  conditioned  on  visible  evidence  that  the  govern- 
ment remained  in  control  of  its  reform  program.  The  immediate 
goal  of  the  reform  program  was  to  reduce  inflationary  pressure  by 
removing  the  surplus  money  supply  that  had  been  caused  by  short- 
ages. Prices  would  remain  subject  to  the  Regulations  on  the  Con- 
trol of  Prices  issued  in  February  1991,  to  limit  price  fluctuations 
and  prevent  monopolies  from  gaining  huge  profits.  Meanwhile, 
privatization  remained  a  potential  political  quagmire  because,  un- 
like many  of  the  measures  in  the  first  phase,  differences  in  approach 
and  timing  remained  substantial  among  major  political  factions. 
The  National  Assembly  still  included  many  politicians  from  the 
Zhivkov  years  who  would  lose  their  power  base  if  reform  went  too 
far.  For  that  reason,  the  National  Assembly  delayed  deliberation 
on  several  vital  economic  bills  in  1991 .  For  the  same  reason,  many 
remaining  Zhivkovite  industrial  managers  opposed  application  of 
reforms  to  their  enterprises.  Advocates  of  reform  hoped  that  the 
1991  parliamentary  elections  would  redistribute  legislative  power, 
enabling  reform  to  continue  and  shortening  the  traumatic  transi- 
tional period.  .

Several  English-language  monographs  provide  useful  informa- 
tion on  the  Bulgarian  economy.  Unquestionably,  the  most  com- 
prehensive is  John  R.  Lampe's  The  Bulgarian  Economy  in  the  Twentieth 
Century,  which  covers  economic  structure,  development,  and  per- 
formance and  provides  abundant  statistics.  Although  somewhat 
dated  and  less  inclusive,  Growth  and  Reforms  in  Centrally  Planned  Econ- 
omies by  George  R.  Feiwel  covers  the  same  general  field.  Robert  J.

ter to  postwar  economic  development  through  the  1980s,  and 
John  D.  Bell's  The  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  from  Blagoev  to  Zhivkov 
analyzes  the  theory  and  practice  of  Bulgarian  economic  planning 
from  1947  through  1985.  The  Statistical  Yearbook  of  the  People's  Republic 
of  Bulgaria  (the  English-language  version  of  which  is  an  abridge-

Chapter  4.  Government  and  Politics 


Official  party  banner  combining  Soviet  and  Bulgarian  flags,  hanging  above 
national  party  congress  of  Bulgarian  Communist  Party,  Sofia,  1970 


ON  NOVEMBER  10,  1989,  after  thirty-five  years  as  undisputed 
leader,  Todor  Zhivkov  resigned  his  positions  as  head  of  the  Bul- 
garian Communist  Party  (BCP)  and  head  of  state  of  Bulgaria.  This 
act,  forced  by  political  opposition  and  turmoil,  was  the  symbolic 
watershed  between  two  very  different  eras  in  Bulgarian  governance. 
One  year  after  Zhivkov 's  resignation,  Bulgaria  had  at  least  some 
of  the  primary  building  blocks  for  a  democratic  state:  a  freely  elected 
parliament,  a  coalition  cabinet,  independent  newspapers,  and 
vigorous,  independent  trade  unions. 

Beginning  with  Soviet  occupation  of  Nazi-allied  Bulgaria  in  Sep- 
tember 1944,  the  political  culture  of  that  country  had  been  totally 
dominated  by  a  monolithic  communist  party.  In  the  following  three 
years,  that  party  took  advantage  of  the  presence  of  Soviet  troops, 
decades-long  disorder  in  the  Bulgarian  political  system,  and  its  own 
high  visibility  as  an  anti-Nazi  resistance  force  to  complete  a  rapid 
communization  process. 

Postwar  communist  rule  in  Bulgaria  can  be  divided  into  three 
periods  with  varying  political  characteristics.  The  first  period,  1944 
through  1947,  saw  the  consolidation  of  communist  power.  The 
Fatherland  Front,  which  began  in  1942  as  a  small  illegal  antifascist 
coalition,  led  a  coup  that  coincided  with  the  1944  Soviet  invasion 
and  installed  communists  for  the  first  time  in  crucial  government 
positions.  In  the  next  three  years,  the  BCP  gradually  eliminated 
disorganized  blocks  of  political  opposition,  cut  Bulgaria  off  from 
foreign  influences  except  that  of  the  Soviet  Bloc,  and  confiscated 
most  private  economic  resources.  By  the  end  of  1947,  the  last  ef- 
fective political  opposition  had  been  eliminated  and  Soviet  troops 
had  left  Bulgaria.  Longtime  communist  leader  Georgi  Dimitrov 
was  prime  minister  of  a  Bulgarian  government  that  ruled  accord- 
ing to  a  new  constitution  modeled  after  that  of  the  Soviet  Union. 
Although  that  constitution  left  the  political  institutions  of  prewar 
Bulgaria  nominally  intact,  the  consolidation  period  set  the  pattern 
for  a  very  different  set  of  political  relationships.  Actual  political 
power  was  concentrated  entirely  in  the  national  BCP.  From  1947 
until  1989,  nominations  and  elections  to  judicial,  legislative,  and 
executive  posts  required  party  approval.  During  that  time,  a  nomi- 
nal second  party  existed,  but  party  nominees  were  elected  without 
opposition  at  all  levels  of  government.  The  National  Assembly 
(Narodno  Subranie)  met  only  to  rubber-stamp  proposals  from  the 
party  or  the  executive  branch.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  second  phase  of  the  communist  period,  from  1948  through 
1953,  strengthened  Bulgaria's  traditionally  close  ties  with  the  Soviet 
Union  and  established  a  pattern  of  imitating  the  Soviet  Union  in 
all  major  aspects  of  foreign  and  domestic  policy.  The  first  Bulgar- 
ian Five- Year  Plan  began  in  1949,  by  which  time  most  means  of 
production  were  in  state  hands.  In  1949  Dimitrov  was  succeeded 
by  Vulko  Chervenkov,  a  protege  of  Soviet  leader  Joseph  V.  Stalin. 
Chervenkov  imitated  his  patron's  cult  of  personality  by  assuming 
total  control  of  the  BCP  and  the  government  and  enforcing  com- 
plete conformity  to  party  policy  through  1954.  Chervenkov  inten- 
sified the  sovietization  that  began  under  Dimitrov;  the  only  vestiges 
of  political  diversity  at  this  point  were  a  few  national  party  leaders 
who  survived  Chervenkov' s  purges. 

In  1953  the  death  of  Stalin  brought  a  strong  reaction  in  Soviet 
politics  against  the  cult  of  personality  and  in  favor  of  collective  leader- 
ship. Accordingly,  in  1954  Todor  Zhivkov  replaced  Chervenkov  as 
first  secretary  of  the  BCP.  In  the  next  eight  years,  Zhivkov  gradu- 
ally consolidated  his  position  as  supreme  leader.  In  doing  so,  he 
maintained  the  totalitarian  state  machinery  of  his  predecessors  but 
showed  flexibility  and  resiliency — especially  in  maintaining  power 
at  home  while  following  the  winding  path  of  Soviet  policy  to  which 
Bulgaria  remained  scrupulously  loyal.  In  spite  of  dramatic  inter- 
national changes  and  crises  between  1954  and  1989,  the  Zhivkov 
era  was  the  longest  period  of  stable  rule  by  a  single  administration 
in  the  history  of  the  modern  Bulgarian  state. 

In  the  1980s,  however,  the  Zhivkov  regime  was  overtaken  by 
the  wave  of  political  liberation  that  swept  all  of  Eastern  Europe, 
and  by  the  lethargy  and  corruption  of  an  administration  totally 
without  opposition  for  nearly  thirty  years.  Immediately  after 
Zhivkov 's  fall,  Bulgaria  returned  to  its  precommunist  political  cul- 
ture, a  shifting  mosaic  of  major  and  minor  parties  and  coalitions. 
The  National  Assembly  was  resurrected  as  the  vehicle  for  demo- 
cratic representation,  and  the  first  free  parliamentary  election  was 
held  in  1990.  Unlike  the  communist  parties  of  other  East  Euro- 
pean nations,  the  BCP  (which  changed  its  name  in  1990  to  the  Bul- 
garian Socialist  Party,  BSP)  was  based  on  a  domestic  political 
movement  that  predated  the  1917  Russian  Revolution.  Partly  for 
this  reason,  the  BSP  was  able  to  win  the  first  free  elections  that 
followed  overthrow  of  the  old  regime.  But  internal  fragmentation, 
economic  crisis,  and  the  party's  connection  with  the  wrongs  of  the 
Zhivkov  era  diminished  the  BSP's  popular  support  as  the  1990s 
began. 

Meanwhile,  based  on  very  brief  experimentation  with  true 
parliamentary  democracy  before  World  War  II,  and  imitating  its 


174 


Government  and  Politics 


East  European  neighbors,  Bulgaria  had  decisively  rejected  repres- 
sive one-party  rule  and  professed  allegiance  to  democracy.  But  for- 
mation of  democratic  institutions  on  the  ruins  of  the  early  1900s 
proved  a  formidable  task  in  the  early  years  of  the  postcommunist 
era.  Coalition  government,  the  main  device  of  political  stability 
in  the  precommunist  era,  functioned  unevenly  in  solving  the  mas- 
sive problems  of  the  early  1990s,  and  the  remaining  power  centers 
of  the  old  regime  hindered  reform. 

The  Prewar  Political  Context 

From  its  separation  from  the  Ottoman  Empire  in  1878  until  1947, 
Bulgaria  was  ruled  as  a  constitutional  monarchy,  with  a  parliamen- 
tary system  based  on  the  Turnovo  Constitution  of  1879.  Although 
that  document  was  one  of  the  most  progressive  national  constitu- 
tions in  the  world  when  it  was  written,  actual  governance  of  Bul- 
garia under  it  was  a  constant  struggle  for  power  among  the  tsar, 
the  unicameral  parliament,  and  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  many 
political  factions  that  proliferated  in  the  twentieth  century  added 
another  dimension  to  this  struggle.  Parliaments  were  elected  and 
dissolved  for  purely  political  reasons;  strong  prime  ministers  such 
as  Stefan  Stambolov  (1886-94)  and  Aleksandur  Stamboliiski 
(1918-23)  ignored  parliament  to  advance  their  own  programs  (the 
constitution  had  no  provision  for  consultation  among  government 
branches,  although  the  Council  of  Ministers  was  nominally  sub- 
ordinate to  parliament);  a  succession  of  weak  prime  ministers  were 
controlled  by  the  tsar  or  by  political  factions  such  as  the  pro-fascist 
Zveno  coalition  of  the  1930s;  the  need  to  placate  the  forces  of 
Macedonian  irredentism  distorted  both  domestic  and  foreign  pol- 
itics throughout  the  post-independence  period;  and  no  prime 
minister  survived  without  stitching  together  tenuous  coalitions  of 
parties,  many  of  which  had  only  narrow  political  agendas.  Frequent 
appeals  were  made  to  amend  the  Turnovo  Constitution;  in  other 
cases,  the  constitution  simply  was  ignored. 

The  last  arrangement  of  Bulgarian  political  forces  before  World 
War  II  was  the  royal  dictatorship  of  Boris  III.  Boris  devised  a  sys- 
tem of  "controlled  democracy"  after  the  short  totalitarian  regime 
of  Zveno  had  virtually  abolished  conventional  political  parties  in 
1934  (see  The  Crises  of  the  1930s,  ch.  1).  Boris's  system  was  based 
on  judicious  appointments  and  the  balancing  of  civilian  politicians 
against  the  army.  His  purpose  was  not  authoritarian  rule  but  to 
achieve  a  temporary  centralization  of  power  that  would  allow  Bul- 
garia to  return  to  stable  constitutionality  after  the  chaotic  post- World 
War  I  period.  Boris  believed  that  independent  parties  would  hinder 
this  process,  so  such  parties  did  not  reemerge  in  Bulgaria  under 


175 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

his  rule.  National  elections  were  not  held  between  1931  and  1938, 
and  subsequent  prewar  elections  were  held  under  strong  govern- 
ment control.  In  spite  of  that  control,  an  opposition  bloc  includ- 
ing the  communists  gained  sixty  parliament  seats  in  the  1938 
election,  compared  with  ninety-five  for  Boris's  nonpartisan  govern- 
ment candidates.  In  the  late  1930s,  Boris  struggled  in  vain  to  form 
a  lasting  coalition  that  could  provide  solid  middle  ground  between 
the  communist  and  pro-Nazi  factions,  both  of  which  rapidly  gained 
support  between  1935  and  1940.  But  when  Bulgaria  entered  the 
war  in  1940,  the  same  "temporary"  balance  remained  in  place. 

The  Early  Communist  Era 

During  World  War  II,  the  BCP  actively  opposed  Bulgaria's  Axis 
alliance  by  forming  partisan  terrorist  and  sabotage  groups.  In  1942 
the  broad  Fatherland  Front  coalition  was  formed  as  the  communists 
attempted  to  involve  legal  opposition  groups  in  exerting  antiwar 
pressure  on  the  government.  The  coalition's  activities  brought  se- 
vere government  reprisals.  By  1944  partisan  units  also  were  being 
formed  in  the  Bulgarian  army. 

The  Red  Army  invasion  of  September  1944  found  a  temporary 
Bulgarian  government  desperately  trying  to  avoid  accommodation 
with  the  communist  left  or  the  pro-German  right,  but  under  in- 
tense diplomatic  and  military  pressure  from  both  Germany  and 
the  Soviet  Union.  Boris  had  died  in  1943,  and  by  1944  severe  war- 
time shortages  (partly  caused  by  peasants  hoarding  food  supplies) 
had  eroded  support  for  the  government. 

When  Soviet  troops  entered  Bulgaria,  the  Fatherland  Front  en- 
gineered a  bloodless  coup  displacing  the  government  of  Prime 
Minister  Konstantin  Muraviev.  In  1946  the  first  Fatherland  Front 
government  divided  ministries  among  the  BCP,  Zveno,  the  Bul- 
garian Agrarian  National  Union  (BANU),  and  the  Bulgarian  So- 
cial Democratic  Party  (BSDP).  Within  a  year,  the  BCP  had  used 
that  power  base  to  purge  the  government  of  all  key  opposition 
figures  and  dominate  the  Fatherland  Front.  In  1946  a  national 
referendum  rejected  the  monarchy  in  favor  of  a  people's  republic, 
leading  to  the  immediate  exile  of  Simeon  II,  nine-year-old  son  of 
Boris  III.  The  following  month,  the  communists  easily  won  a  na- 
tional election  for  representatives  to  a  subranie  to  write  a  new  con- 
stitution over  the  objections  of  BANU,  which  sought  a  return  to 
the  Turnovo  Constitution.  In  early  1947,  the  conclusion  of  peace 
between  Bulgaria  and  the  Allies  eliminated  the  Allied  Control  Com- 
mission, through  which  Britain  had  maintained  some  influence  on 
domestic  Bulgarian  politics.  By  that  time,  the  only  remaining  ob- 
stacle to  total  BCP  domination  was  Nikola  Petkov's  BANU,  in  a 


176 


Government  and  Politics 


coalition  with  other  noncommunist  parties.  The  power  struggle 
ended  abruptly  in  mid- 1947,  when  the  Fatherland  Front  arrested 
and  executed  Petkov  as  a  Western  agent.  This  event  paved  the  way 
for  unanimous  adoption  of  a  new  constitution  in  December  1947. 
The  new  document  was  closely  modeled  on  the  1936  Soviet  con- 
stitution. 

The  parliamentary  election  of  fall  1946  gave  the  BCP  275  of  465 
seats  and  made  Georgi  Dimitrov  prime  minister.  The  communists 
gained  control  of  all  significant  ministries,  beginning  the  last  stage 
of  consolidating  communist  dictatorship.  The  ensuing  regimes  of 
Dimitrov  and  Chervenkov  defined  Bulgaria  as  a  highly  conven- 
tional communist  state  and  isolated  it  from  nearly  all  noncommunist 
commercial  and  cultural  influences. 

The  State  under  Dimitrov 

In  the  1946  elections,  noncommunist  parties  in  the  Fatherland 
Front  lost  influence  far  out  of  proportion  to  the  numerical  election 
results.  The  most  salient  new  feature  of  the  Dimitrov  Constitu- 
tion was  that  it  rejected  the  separation  of  powers  among  govern- 
ment branches  in  favor  of  a  "unity  of  state  power,"  lodged  in  a 
presidium  wielding  legislative,  judicial,  and  executive  powers  and 
chosen  by  the  National  Assembly  with  party  approval.  As  before, 
the  National  Assembly  was  a  unicameral  legislature;  elections  were 
to  be  held  every  four  years,  and  members  could  be  recalled  at  any 
time.  The  assembly  would  meet  in  regular  sessions  twice  a  year, 
or  by  special  order  of  the  Presidium — making  the  full  assembly  little 
more  than  a  rubber-stamp  body.  The  Presidium  met  continuously 
and  exercised  all  constitutional  powers  of  the  National  Assembly 
when  the  assembly  was  not  in  session.  The  Presidium's  powers 
included  controlling  the  selection  of  the  Council  of  Ministers, 
amending  the  constitution,  approving  the  national  economic  plan, 
declaring  war,  and  making  peace.  The  president  of  the  nineteen- 
member  Presidium  thus  became  one  of  the  two  most  powerful  men 
in  Bulgaria. 

The  Council  of  Ministers  retained  a  nominal  executive  author- 
ity as  a  cabinet,  but  it  was  overshadowed  by  the  designation  of  the 
National  Assembly  as  "supreme  organ  of  state  power."  In  prac- 
tice, the  council  chairman,  who  by  office  was  prime  minister  of 
the  country,  was  always  the  first  secretary  of  the  BCP.  This  gave 
the  prime  minister  power  equal  to  that  of  the  Presidium  president. 
The  judiciary,  now  also  chosen  by  the  legislative  branch  at  all  levels 
of  government,  lost  all  independence.  Independent  local  political 
power  was  eliminated  when  province  and  district  jurisdictions  were 
restructured  into  people's  councils.  The  councils  elected  executive 


177 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

committees  analogous  to  the  national  Presidium  and  overseen  by 
that  body.  As  at  the  national  level,  local  government  bodies  were 
filled  primarily  with  party  officials.  Thus,  the  Dimitrov  Constitu- 
tion achieved  unprecedented  centralization  of  political  power  in 
Bulgaria. 

Like  its  Soviet  model,  the  1947  constitution  guaranteed  broad 
freedoms  to  all  citizens  (religion,  conscience,  assembly,  speech,  the 
press,  emancipation  of  women,  and  inviolability  of  person,  domicile, 
and  correspondence).  The  Bulgarian  document  differed  from  the 
Soviet  by  allowing  private  property,  but  only  if  the  privilege  were 
not  used  "to  the  detriment  of  the  public  good."  All  means  of 
production  shifted  to  state  ownership.  Universal  suffrage  was 
guaranteed,  as  were  welfare  and  employment.  Guaranteed  employ- 
ment was  restricted  to  socially  useful  occupations,  however. 

Government  practice  soon  eroded  the  constitutional  guarantee 
of  religious  freedom.  Between  1948  and  1952,  several  official  acts 
repressed  the  Bulgarian  religious  community.  In  1948  the  exarch 
of  the  Bulgarian  Orthodox  Church  was  forced  into  retirement  for 
his  refusal  to  defend  the  communist  state  and  the  Soviet  Union. 
In  1 949  the  Law  on  Religious  Organizations  put  all  churches  under 
state  control;  over  the  next  four  years,  Catholic  and  Protestant 
clergy  were  harrassed  and  imprisoned  as  part  of  an  overall  policy 
of  preventing  contact  with  the  West.  During  this  period,  the 
Dimitrov  government  continued  purging  party  and  nonparty  offi- 
cials, imitating  the  contemporaneous  Stalinist  practice  of  eliminating 
all  possible  political  rivals.  The  most  notable  victim  was  the  hard- 
line Stalinist  and  long-time  party  leader  Traicho  Kostov,  convicted 
and  executed  in  1949  as  a  collaborator  with  the  fascists  and  Josip 
Broz  Tito,  the  heretical  Yugoslav  communist  leader. 

The  Chervenkov  Era 

The  Fifth  Party  Congress,  held  in  December  1948,  rightfully 
celebrated  the  complete  political  dominance  of  socialism  in  Bul- 
garia. When  Dimitrov  died  in  1949,  his  successor,  Stalin  protege 
Vulko  Chervenkov,  began  four  years  of  intense  party  purges  (dis- 
qualifying nearly  100,000  of  460,000  Bulgarian  communists).  Cher- 
venkov's  cultivation  of  a  cult  of  personality  earned  him  the 
nickname  "Little  Stalin."  The  breakaway  of  Tito's  Yugoslavia  from 
the  Cominform  (Communist  Information  Bureau — see  Glossary) 
in  1948  caused  Stalin  and  Chervenkov  to  put  additional  pressure 
on  the  BCP  to  conform  with  the  Soviet  line.  Stalin's  death  in  1953 
introduced  new  Soviet  leaders  who  disapproved  of  Chervenkov' s 
methodology,  but  the  Bulgarian  leader  remained  prime  minister 
and  dominated  politics  until  1956.  Chervenkov  announced  a  "new 


178 


Government  and  Politics 


course"  in  1953,  police  terror  abated,  and  some  political  prisoners 
were  released.  Meanwhile,  the  Bulgarian  government  under  the 
communists  followed  a  postwar  East  European  pattern  by  creat- 
ing large  numbers  of  bureaucratic  posts  that  were  filled  by  party- 
approved  functionaries,  the  nomenklatura.  A  swollen  bureaucracy 
had  been  traditional  in  Bulgaria  since  the  modern  state  was  founded 
in  1878;  but  previously  appointments  had  depended  on  member- 
ship in  the  civil  service  elite,  not  on  membership  in  a  particular 
party. 

The  Zhivkov  Era 

Todor  Zhivkov  was  the  dominant  figure  in  Bulgarian  govern- 
ment for  about  thirty-five  years,  during  which  time  the  political 
scene  remained  remarkably  stable.  In  the  context  of  post-Stalinist 
communist  statecraft,  Zhivkov  was  a  masterful  politician.  In  the 
context  of  popular  demands  for  meaningful  reform,  he  was  an 
anachronism  whose  removal  symbolized  the  beginning  of  a  new 
approach  to  governance. 

The  Rise  of  Zhivkov 

The  Chervenkov  era  firmly  established  Bulgarian  reliance  on 
the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  (CPSU)  for  policy  leader- 
ship and  resolution  of  domestic  party  rivalries.  Just  as  Stalin's  con- 
demnation had  doomed  Kostov,  so  condemnation  of  the  cult  of 
personality  by  Stalin's  successors  doomed  Chervenkov  and  pre- 
pared the  way  for  his  successor,  Todor  Zhivkov.  Zhivkov,  who 
began  his  political  career  in  the  party  youth  organization  and 
worked  his  way  to  the  party  Central  Committee  in  1948,  became 
party  chief  when  Chervenkov  resigned  that  position  in  1954.  Both 
the  Moscow  authorities  who  ultimately  chose  new  Bulgarian  lead- 
ers and  the  BCP  leaders  in  Sofia  approved  Zhivkov' s  flexibility, 
youth  (he  was  forty-two  when  selected),  and  lack  of  powerful  friends 
and  enemies. 

In  1956  Bulgarian  politics  again  felt  the  influence  of  the  Soviet 
Union.  When  Nikita  S.  Khrushchev  became  leader  of  the  CPSU, 
he  began  a  new  phase  of  de-Stalinization  and  party  reform  that 
echoed  strongly  in  Bulgaria.  This  action  left  Chervenkov  without 
support  outside  Bulgaria.  Then,  in  1956  the  April  Plenum  of  the 
BCP  Central  Committee  began  a  broad  party  liberalization  pol- 
icy that  caused  Chervenkov  to  resign  as  prime  minister.  Rather 
than  break  completely  with  the  past,  however,  the  party  retained 
Chervenkov  as  a  member  of  a  de  facto  ruling  triumvirate  that  in- 
cluded Zhivkov  and  longtime  party  leader  and  purge  partici- 
pant Anton  Yugov,  who  became  prime  minister.  Although  party 


179 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

liberalization  was  stalled  by  1956  uprisings  in  Hungary  and  Poland, 
the  April  Plenum  identified  Zhivkov  as  the  leader  of  the  Politburo. 
In  doing  so,  it  also  shifted  power  conclusively  to  the  "home"  branch 
of  the  BCP,  more  attuned  to  Bulgarian  issues  and  less  to  total  obe- 
dience to  the  Soviet  line. 

Zhivkov  Takes  Control 

By  the  end  of  1961,  a  new  wave  of  Soviet  anti-Stalinism  gave 
Zhivkov  the  support  he  needed  to  oust  Chervenkov  and  Yugov. 
Zhivkov' s  political  position  had  deteriorated  because  his  grandi- 
ose, failed  plans  for  industrialization  and  agricultural  collectiviza- 
tion had  evoked  strong  social  protests  between  1959  and  1961 ,  but 
he  succeeded  Yugov  as  prime  minister  in  1962  (see  The  First  Five- 
Year  Plans,  ch.  3).  Khrushchev  formally  endorsed  Zhivkov  with 
a  state  visit  to  Bulgaria  in  1962.  Although  no  additional  changes 
occurred  in  the  party  or  the  government  until  1971 ,  Zhivkov  began 
introducing  a  new  generation  of  leaders  in  the  mid-1960s,  and  po- 
litical repression  eased  noticeably.  The  old  guard  of  officials  re- 
maining from  the  1944  revolution  remained  a  powerful  party 
element  with  important  Soviet  connections;  therefore,  Zhivkov 
provided  that  group  enough  Politburo  positions  to  ensure  its  sup- 
port. Meanwhile,  Zhivkov  selectively  purged  officials  throughout 
the  early  period  to  prevent  development  of  alternative  power  centers 
in  the  party.  In  1964  Zhivkov  earned  peasant  support  by  appoint- 
ing Georgi  Traikov,  chief  of  the  nominally  independent  BANU, 
head  of  state  and  by  pardoning  comrades  of  the  executed  BANU 
leader  Petkov. 

In  1966  a  strong  resurgence  of  the  conservative  wing  of  the  BCP 
at  the  Ninth  Party  Congress  curtailed  Bulgarian  diplomatic  and 
economic  overtures  to  the  West  and  to  its  Balkan  neighbors.  The 
new  conservatism  also  tightened  government  control  over  the  media 
and  the  arts,  and  the  government  resumed  anti-Western  propa- 
ganda to  protect  Bulgarian  society  from  bourgeois  influences.  As 
was  the  case  in  the  1956  invasion  of  Hungary,  Bulgarian  support 
for  the  1968  Soviet  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  brought  tighter  party 
control  of  all  social  organizations  and  reaffirmation  of  "democratic 
centralism"  within  the  party — all  with  the  goal  of  reassuring  the 
Soviet  Union  that  Bulgaria  would  not  follow  in  the  heretical  foot- 
steps of  Czechoslovakia. 

The  Constitution  of  1971 

A  later  echo  of  the  events  of  1968  was  the  drafting  of  a  new  con- 
stitution at  the  Tenth  Party  Congress  in  1971 .  Unlike  the  Dimitrov 
Constitution,  the  new  document  specified  the  role  of  the  BCP  as 


180

"the  leading  force  in  society  and  the  state,"  and  the  role  of  the 
BANU  as  its  collaborator  within  the  Fatherland  Front.  The  1971 
constitution  also  defined  Bulgaria  as  a  socialist  state  with  mem- 
bership in  the  international  socialist  community.  As  before,  broad 
citizen  rights  were  guaranteed  but  limited  by  the  requirement  that 
they  be  exercised  only  in  the  interest  of  the  state.  Citizen  obliga- 
tions included  working  according  to  one's  ability  to  build  the  foun- 
dation of  the  socialist  state  and  defend  the  state,  compulsory  military 
service,  and  paying  taxes.  Most  of  the  governmental  structure  speci- 
fied in  the  Dimitrov  Constitution  remained,  but  a  new  body,  the 
State  Council,  replaced  the  Presidium  as  supreme  organ  of  state 
power.  This  council  consisted  of  twenty-two  members  and  a  chair- 
man who  was  de  facto  head  of  state.  The  State  Council  was  more 
powerful  than  the  Presidium  because  it  could  initiate  as  well  as  ap- 
prove legislation,  and  because  it  exercised  some  of  the  non- 
governmental supervision  normally  delegated  to  ruling  parties  in 
East  European  communist  states  of  that  period.  Council  members, 
nominally  elected  by  the  National  Assembly,  were  members  of  the 
BCP  or  other  mass  organizations  (see  Nongovernmental  Political 
Institutions,  this  ch.). 

In  1971  Zhivkov  resigned  as  prime  minister  to  become  chairman 
of  the  State  Council.  The  National  Assembly,  traditional  center  of 
political  power  in  Bulgaria  until  the  1947  constitution  stripped  it  of 
power,  received  some  new  responsibilities.  Permanent  commissions 


181 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

were  to  supervise  the  work  of  ministries,  and  legislation  could  now 
be  submitted  by  labor  and  youth  groups  (all  of  which  were  party- 
controlled).  In  practice,  however,  the  National  Assembly  still 
rubber-stamped  legislation  and  nominations  for  the  State  Coun- 
cil, Supreme  Court,  and  Council  of  Ministers.  As  a  follow-up  to 
the  constitution's  prescription  of  private  property  rights,  the  1973 
Law  on  Citizens'  Property  virtually  abolished  private  ownership 
of  means  of  production,  confining  such  ownership  to  "items  for 
personal  use." 

The  Tenth  Party  Congress  also  devised  a  new  BCP  program 
to  coincide  with  the  new  constitutional  description  of  party  power. 
The  program  specified  an  orthodox  hierarchical  party  structure  of 
democratic  centralism,  each  level  responsible  to  the  level  above. 
The  lowest-level  party  organizations  were  to  be  based  in  workplaces; 
all  other  levels  would  be  determined  by  territorial  divisions.  Loyalty 
to  the  CPSU  was  reiterated.  The  BCP  goal  was  described  as  build- 
ing an  advanced  socialist  society  lacking  differentiation  by  property 
and  social  standing — at  that  point,  all  of  society  was  to  be  a  single 
working  class.  Science  and  technology  were  to  receive  special  at- 
tention by  the  party,  to  improve  production  that  would  make  pos- 
sible the  next  jump  from  advanced  socialism  to  the  first  stage  of 
communism  (see  The  Bulgarian  Communist  (Socialist)  Party,  this 
ch.). 

After  a  decade  of  political  calm  and  only  occasional  purges  of 
party  officials  by  Zhivkov,  social  unrest  stirred  in  the  mid-1970s 
and  alarmed  the  Zhivkov  government.  International  events  such 
as  the  Helsinki  Accords  (see  Glossary)  of  1975,  the  growth  of  Euro- 
communism in  the  1970s,  and  the  1973  oil  crisis  stimulated  hope 
for  liberalization  and  discontent  with  the  domestic  economy. 
Zhivkov  responded  in  1977  by  purging  Politburo  member  Boris 
Velchev  and  38,500  party  members — the  largest  such  change  since 
the  early  1960s.  Provincial  party  organizations  also  were  substan- 
tially reorganized.  In  May  1978,  the  Bulgarian  government  ac- 
knowledged for  the  first  time  that  an  antigovernment  demonstration 
had  occurred — indicating  that  the  1977  measures  had  not  quelled 
domestic  discontent. 

The  Last  Zhivkov  Decade 

The  period  between  1978  and  1988  was  one  of  political  calm. 
With  minor  exceptions,  the  structure  and  operations  of  the  govern- 
ment and  the  BCP  remained  unchanged.  But  the  avoidance  of 
meaningful  change,  despite  cosmetic  adjustments  in  the  Zhivkov 
government,  assumed  that  Bulgarian  governance  was  the  same 


182 


Government  and  Politics 


uncomplicated  procedure  it  had  been  in  the  1970s  and  early 
1980s — a  major  miscalculation. 

Celebration  of  the  1,300th  anniversary  of  the  Bulgarian  state  in 
1981  brought  official  liberalization  and  rehabilitation  for  some  seg- 
ments of  Bulgarian  society.  Bourgeois  political  factions  that  had 
opposed  the  BCP  before  World  War  II  were  exonerated  and 
described  as  comrades  in  the  fight  for  Bulgarian  democracy. 
Zhivkov  also  raised  the  official  status  of  the  Orthodox  Church  to 
codefender  of  the  Bulgarian  nationality,  and  restrictions  on  reli- 
gious observances  were  eased. 

By  the  second  half  of  the  1980s,  substantial  maneuvering  and 
speculation  centered  on  identifying  the  successor  to  the  seventy- 
four-year-old  Zhivkov,  who  was  increasingly  isolated  from  every- 
day governance.  Four  younger  politicians  divided  most  of  the  key 
responsibilities  of  government  and  party  in  1986.  Although  specu- 
lation grew  that  Zhivkov  had  become  a  figurehead  or  was  prepar- 
ing to  resign,  in  the  late  1980s  he  was  still  able  to  divide  the  power 
of  his  rivals  and  avoid  naming  a  single  successor. 

The  BCP  maintained  complete  control  over  all  major  programs 
and  policies  in  the  Bulgarian  government,  although  the  role  of  the 
party  in  specific  instances  was  not  clear.  In  1987,  facing  a  bud- 
ding opposition  movement  and  pressure  from  the  Soviet  Union, 
the  BCP  began  planning  for  multiple-candidate  (not  multiparty) 
regional  elections  to  end  citizen  apathy  toward  both  government 
and  the  party.  Although  some  reforms  were  made  in  the  nomina- 
tion process,  local  electoral  commissions  retained  control  over  final 
lists  of  nominees. 

By  February  1989,  at  least  nine  independent  political  groups  had 
emerged.  Spurred  by  the  liberalized  domestic  policies  of  Mikhail 
S.  Gorbachev  in  the  Soviet  Union,  such  groups  demanded  similar 
concessions  from  the  Bulgarian  government.  Given  Bulgaria's  long 
record  of  mimicking  Soviet  policy  changes,  this  was  a  natural  ex- 
pectation. In  fact,  the  1987  BCP  Central  Committee  plenum  had 
officially  endorsed  perestroika  (see  Glossary)  and  glasnost  (see  Glos- 
sary), the  cornerstones  of  the  Gorbachev  reform  program.  The  ple- 
num also  substantially  reduced  official  state  ceremonies,  rituals, 
personal  awards,  and  propaganda,  explaining  that  such  formali- 
ties alienated  the  people. 

In  the  three  years  following  the  1987  plenum,  however,  the  Bul- 
garian government  and  the  BCP  gave  lip  service  to  Soviet  reforms, 
while  quietly  taking  a  more  hard-line  approach  to  many  issues. 
During  this  period,  reform  in  the  BCP  and  the  government  ap- 
paratus was  confined  to  reshuffling  ministries,  departments,  and 
personnel  as  a  gesture  of  solidarity  With,  perestroika.  At  the  same  time, 


183

dissident  groups  were  harrassed,  put  under  surveillance,  and  ac- 
cused of  unpatriotic  activities. 

Issues  of  Dissent 

In  the  late  1980s,  official  repression  of  the  Turkish  minority  was 
the  most  visible  domestic  issue  in  Bulgaria.  By  1989  this  policy  had 
brought  harsh  international  condemnation  and  provided  a  human 
rights  issue  for  the  domestic  opposition.  A  total  of  310,000  ethnic 
Turks  were  expelled  or  emigrated  voluntarily  in  1989,  and  the  Bul- 
garian economy  suffered  greatly  from  this  depletion  of  its  work  force 
(see  Labor  Force,  ch.  3,  and  The  Turkish  Problem,  this  ch.). 

In  July  1989,  more  than  a  hundred  well-known  Bulgarian  in- 
tellectuals petitioned  the  National  Assembly  to  restore  rights  to  the 
ethnic  Turks  suffering  forced  emigration.  Bulgarian  Turks  formed 
the  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  advocating  a  wide  range 
of  government  reforms  besides  the  Turkish  issue.  The  regime 
responded  by  accusing  Turkish  agents  of  fomenting  ethnic  strife, 
denying  the  existence  of  a  Turkish  minority  in  Bulgaria,  and  fan- 
ning the  racial  animosity  of  Bulgarians  toward  Turks. 

In  addition  to  ethnic  and  political  problems,  in  the  late  1980s 
Bulgaria  faced  the  need  for  strenuous  economic  reforms  to  improve 
efficiency,  technology,  and  product  quality.  Between  1987  and  1989, 
the  Zhivkov  regime  promised  expansion  of  trade  and  joint  ven- 
tures with  the  West,  banking  reform,  currency  convertability,  and 
decentralized  planning.  In  actuality,  however,  the  thirty-five-year- 
old  regime  lacked  the  political  will  and  energy  to  press  drastic  eco- 
nomic reform  (see  Era  of  Experimentation  and  Reform,  ch.  3). 
The  economic  stagnation  that  began  in  the  early  1980s,  with  which 
Zhivkov  had  become  identified,  continued  unchallenged  and  be- 
came another  major  cause  of  political  discontent. 

The  Removal  of  Zhivkov 

Despite  the  appearance  of  numerous  opposition  groups  in  the 
preceding  year,  the  Zhivkov  regime  was  unprepared  for  the  suc- 
cessive fall  of  communist  regimes  across  Eastern  Europe  in  late 
1989.  In  October  an  all-European  environmental  conference,  Eco- 
forum,  was  held  in  Sofia  under  the  auspices  of  the  Conference  on 
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE — see  Glossary).  This 
event  focused  world  attention  on  Bulgaria's  history  of  repressing 
environmental  activism  and  stimulated  open  demonstrations  by 
human  rights  advocates  and  the  Bulgarian  Ekoglasnost  environ- 
mental group  (see  Other  Political  Organizations,  this  ch.).  Although 
some  demonstrators  were  beaten  and  detained,  direct  communi- 
cation with  the  West  inspired  them  to  greater  self-expression.  This 


184 


Government  and  Politics 


activity  culminated  in  a  mass  demonstration  in  Sofia  on  Novem- 
ber 3.  Meanwhile,  in  a  speech  to  a  plenum  of  the  BCP  in  late  Oc- 
tober, Zhivkov  admitted  that  his  latest  restructuring  program, 
begun  in  1987  to  achieve  "fundamental  renewal"  of  society,  poli- 
tics, and  the  economy,  had  been  a  failure.  He  unveiled  a  new, 
detailed  program  to  counteract  "alienation  of  the  people  from  the 
government  and  the  production  process."  Other  party  spokesmen 
increasingly  noted  recent  drastic  reforms  in  other  socialist  states 
and  pointed  to  Bulgaria's  failure  to  keep  pace.  Then,  at  the  regu- 
lar plenary  meeting  of  the  BCP  Central  Committee  in  November, 
Prime  Minister  Georgi  Atanasov  announced  Zhivkov 's  resignation. 

Although  the  resignation  appeared  voluntary,  Western  observers 
agreed  that  top  party  figures,  increasingly  dissatisfied  with  Zhivkov' s 
refusal  to  recognize  problems  and  deal  with  public  protests,  had 
exerted  substantial  pressure  on  him.  The  leaders  of  the  movement 
to  remove  Zhivkov — Atanasov,  Foreign  Minister  Petur  Mladenov 
(who  became  head  of  state),  and  Defense  Minister  Dobri  Dzhurov — 
had  received  the  advance  blessing  of  Moscow  and  the  majority  of 
the  Bulgarian  Politburo.  Soviet  leader  Gorbachev  apparently  ap- 
proved the  change  because  Zhivkov  had  not  heeded  warnings  that 
cosmetic  reform  was  insufficient  given  the  drastic  restructuring 
sought  by  Gorbachev.  Within  a  month  of  his  resignation,  Zhivkov 
was  expelled  from  the  BCP,  accused  of  abuse  of  power,  and  ar- 
rested. Mladenov  became  chairman  of  the  State  Council  and  chief 
of  the  BCP. 

Governance  after  Zhivkov 

The  Zhivkov  ouster  brought  rapid  change  in  some  political  in- 
stitutions, little  or  no  change  in  others.  The  official  name  of  the 
country,  dropping  the  term  "People's,"  became  simply  the  Repub- 
lic of  Bulgaria.  For  two  years,  the  BCP  remained  entrenched  as 
the  most  powerful  party,  slowing  reform  and  clinging  tenaciously 
to  economic  and  political  positions  gained  under  Zhivkov.  But  a 
new  constitution  was  ratified  in  mid- 1991 ,  laying  the  basis  for  ac- 
celerated reform  on  all  fronts. 

The  Mladenov  Government 

The  first  few  months  of  the  Mladenov  regime  brought  few  of  the 
dramatic  changes  seen  in  Czechoslovakia  or  the  German  Democratic 
Republic  (East  Germany)  in  the  same  period.  Mladenov,  who  came 
to  power  without  a  personal  following,  left  much  of  the  old  govern- 
ment in  power  and  failed  to  separate  state  from  party  functions. 
Although  initial  reforms  came  from  the  Politburo,  Mladenov 
achieved  popularity  by  immediately  legalizing  political  protest, 


185 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

giving  the  media  unprecedented  freedom,  abolishing  privileges  of 
party  officials,  and  scheduling  free  elections  within  six  months.  Arti- 
cle 1  of  the  1971  constitution,  which  established  the  leading  role 
of  the  BCP  in  Bulgarian  government  and  society,  was  abolished 
in  January  1990.  Public  repudiation  of  Zhivkov  allowed  his  sub- 
ordinates to  treat  him  as  a  scapegoat,  thus  protecting  themselves 
from  blame  by  the  proliferating  opposition  groups. 

The  Bulgarian  communists  avoided  the  immediate  political  re- 
jection suffered  by  their  East  European  comrades  for  several  rea- 
sons. Because  the  BCP  had  begun  as  an  indigenous  Bulgarian 
movement  in  1891,  Bulgarians  did  not  resent  it  as  an  artificially 
imposed  foreign  organization.  In  1989  nearly  one  in  nine  Bulgari- 
ans belonged  to  the  party,  a  very  high  ratio  that  included  a  large 
part  of  the  intelligentsia.  Early  opposition  groups  were  concentrated 
in  Sofia  and  did  not  have  the  means  to  reach  the  more  conserva- 
tive hinterlands,  reflecting  a  political  dichotomy  between  town  and 
country  that  had  existed  since  pre-Ottoman  times  (see  Electoral 
Procedures,  this  ch.).  Visible  reorganization  and  reform  occurred 
in  the  BCP  shortly  after  Zhivkov  left  power;  the  Politburo  was 
abolished  and  some  old-guard  communists  were  purged.  The  BCP 
invited  opposition  representation  in  the  government  and  conducted 
a  series  of  round-table  discussions  with  opposition  leaders.  In  Febru- 
ary 1990,  Mladenov  resigned  as  party  chief,  removing  the  stigma 
of  party  interference  in  government;  in  April,  the  State  Council 
was  abolished  and  Mladenov  was  named  president. 

The  1990  Stalemate 

The  first  free  election  of  the  postwar  era,  the  national  election 
of  June  1990,  was  anticipated  as  an  indicator  of  Bulgaria's  post- 
Zhivkov  political  mood  and  as  an  end  to  the  extreme  uncertainty 
that  followed  the  Zhivkov  era.  But  the  election  results  provided 
no  decisive  answers  or  conclusions.  During  the  political  maneu- 
vering that  preceded  the  election,  the  contest  for  control  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  narrowed  to  the  BCP  and  the  Union  of  Democratic 
Forces  (UDF),  a  coalition  of  several  major  and  many  minor  par- 
ties and  groups  with  diverse  interests  (see  The  Union  of  Democratic 
Forces,  this  ch.).  The  BCP  presented  a  reformist  image,  liberally 
blaming  Zhivkov  for  national  problems  and  changing  its  name  to 
the  Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  (BSP)  to  stress  that  a  new  era  had 
begun.  In  March  an  agreement  with  opposition  groups  had  made 
approval  of  legislative  proposals  by  the  round  table  necessary  be- 
fore the  BCP-dominated  National  Assembly  could  consider  pas- 
sage (see  The  Role  of  Unofficial  Organizations,  this  ch.).  The  round 
table  also  signed  accords  defining  future  legal  changes  in  the  political 


186 


Government  and  Politics 


system,  including  multiple  parties,  separation  of  powers,  constitu- 
tional protection  of  media  freedom,  and  legalization  of  private 
property. 

The  parliamentary  election  was  followed  by  three  months  of  in- 
activity and  drift  in  the  summer  of  1990.  Although  the  Council 
of  Ministers  had  resigned  immediately  after  the  election,  a  new 
government  was  not  formed  until  late  August.  BSP  party  official 
Andrei  Lukanov  finally  became  prime  minister  in  an  all-socialist 
cabinet  because  UDF  and  other  opposition  parties  refused  to  form 
a  coalition.  At  the  same  time,  the  National  Assembly  required  sev- 
eral weeks  to  agree  on  compromise  candidate  Zheliu  Zhelev  to 
replace  Mladenov  as  president.  The  most  significant  political  sit- 
uation was  outside  government  institutions.  The  two  major  par- 
ties became  deadlocked  over  UDF  demands  that  the  BSP 
acknowledge  its  responsibility  for  the  economic  ruin  of  Bulgaria, 
and  that  the  government  adopt  the  UDF  plan  for  radical  economic 
reform  similar  to  that  in  Poland  (see  Market  Reform,  ch.  3). 
Although  much  of  the  Zhivkov  old  guard  had  been  forced  out  in 
favor  of  middle-of-the  road  socialists  in  1990,  the  UDF  demands 
activated  strong  pockets  of  reaction.  Zhelev,  a  dissident  philosopher 
and  UDF  leader,  spent  the  rest  of  1990  seeking  compromises  among 
the  factions. 

The  Lukanov  government,  tied  to  an  aging,  largely  conserva- 
tive constituency  and  full  of  little-known  BSP  figures,  met  few  of 
the  reform  demands.  In  October  Lukanov  presented  a  100-day  eco- 
nomic reform  plan  to  serve  as  a  transition  to  longer-term  planning 
in  1991 .  The  plan  borrowed  major  parts  of  the  program  advocated 
by  the  UDF.  The  National  Assembly  remained  too  divided  on  the 
reform  issue  to  give  Lukanov  the  legislative  support  he  needed. 
Meanwhile,  polls  showed  a  definite  drop  in  popular  support  for 
the  BSP;  under  these  circumstances,  the  UDF  intensified  efforts 
to  turn  out  the  government  by  refusing  to  support  any  of  Lukanov' s 
proposals. 

In  November  Bulgaria  was  paralyzed  by  student  demonstrations 
and  general  strikes  called  to  topple  Lukanov  (see  Trade  Unions, 
this  ch.).  Lukanov' s  resignation  ended  the  opposition's  refusal  to 
form  a  coalition  government.  Zhelev,  who  then  commanded  more 
political  power  than  any  other  figure,  proposed  a  compromise  can- 
didate, Dimitur  Popov,  as  prime  minister.  Popov,  a  judge  with 
no  party  allegiance,  received  a  mandate  to  form  a  new  cabinet  and 
proceed  with  reforms  as  soon  as  possible.  After  considerable  deliber- 
ation, cabinet  posts  were  distributed  among  major  factions,  and 
reform  legislation  began  slowly  moving  into  the  National  Assem- 
bly in  the  first  half  of  1991.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Government  Structure 

In  the  years  immediately  following  the  Zhivkov  regime,  the  nomi- 
nal structure  of  the  Bulgarian  government  remained  essentially  un- 
changed. Actual  decision  making,  however,  moved  from  the  elite 
level  of  the  communist  leadership  to  a  variety  of  political  figures 
and  institutions. 

The  Role  of  Unofficial  Organizations 

An  important  quasigovernmental  institution  in  the  early  stages 
of  this  process  was  the  national  round  table.  Conceived  by  opposi- 
tion groups  shortly  after  Zhivkov' s  fall,  the  round  table  format  was 
accepted  by  the  Atanasov  government  under  threat  of  general 
strikes.  In  March  1990,  a  declaration  on  the  role  and  status  of  the 
national  round  table,  formulated  by  all  major  political  groups,  gave 
the  round  table  approval  rights  to  all  major  legislation  proposed 
by  the  government,  prior  to  formal  consideration  by  the  National 
Assembly.  In  1990  round  table  discussions  included  key  govern- 
ment figures  and  representatives  of  all  constituent  groups  of  the 
UDS  and  other  opposition  parties  and  trade  unions.  This  forum 
was  an  effective  bridge  across  the  chaotic  months  preceding  the 
first  free  election.  It  reached  key  compromises  on  election  law,  major 
provisions  of  the  new  constitution,  and  economic  reforms.  Com- 
promise measures  were  then  forwarded  to  the  parliament  for  ratifi- 
cation. By  mid- 1990  round  table  proposals  were  dominated  by  the 
platform  of  the  UDF,  for  which  that  forum  had  become  the  chief 
input  to  government  policy.  The  national  round  table  thus  replaced 
the  BCP  as  the  de  facto  source  of  legislative  initiatives,  in  the  ab- 
sence of  a  coalition  government  representing  the  major  Bulgarian 
political  factions. 

In  late  1990,  President  Zhelev  convened  a  Political  Consulta- 
tive Council  that  was  able  to  unite  all  major  factions  behind  for- 
mation of  a  coalition  government  in  December  1990.  This  step 
ended  the  threat  that  chaos  would  follow  the  resignation  of  the 
Lukanov  government  (see  The  Council  of  Ministers,  this  ch.).  In 
January  1991,  the  parties  represented  in  the  National  Assembly 
signed  a  detailed  agreement  describing  political  rights,  the  legisla- 
tive agenda  for  1991,  BCP  (BSP)  responsibility  for  the  mistakes 
of  the  Zhivkov  regime,  property  rights,  resolution  of  social  con- 
flicts, and  ethnic  questions.  The  stated  purpose  of  this  agreement 
was  to  ease  national  tensions  and  provide  a  proper  working  at- 
mosphere for  the  immense  reform  program  envisioned  for  1991. 

The  National  Assembly 

In  the  post-Zhivkov  reforms,  the  National  Assembly  returned 


188 


Government  and  Politics 


to  its  prewar  status  as  a  forum  for  debate  of  legislation  among 
representatives  of  true  political  factions.  This  status  had  been  lost 
completely  from  1947  to  1989,  when  the  assembly  rubber-stamped 
legislation  originating  in  the  BCP  hierarchy. 

The  Assembly  under  Zhivkov 

According  to  the  1971  constitution,  the  unicameral  National  As- 
sembly was  the  supreme  organ  of  state  power,  acting  as  the  na- 
tional legislature  and  electing  all  the  other  bodies  of  the  national 
government.  In  practice  under  the  Zhivkov  regime,  the  National 
Assembly  met  for  three  short  sessions  each  year,  long  enough  to 
approve  policies  and  legislation  formulated  by  the  Council  of 
Ministers  and  the  State  Council.  The  National  Assembly  had  a 
chairman  (until  1990  elected  by  the  entire  body  at  the  recommen- 
dation of  the  BCP  Central  Committee)  and  four  deputy  chairs. 
In  the  intervals  between  sessions,  the  functions  of  the  assembly  were 
conducted  by  permanent  commissions  whose  number  and  desig- 
nation varied  through  the  years.  Not  designated  in  the  1971  con- 
stitution, the  duties  of  the  commissions  often  overlapped  those  of 
the  ministerial  departments.  The  National  Assembly  had  the  power 
to  dissolve  itself  or  extend  its  term  in  emergency  session. 

During  the  Zhivkov  years,  new  assemblies  were  elected  every 
five  years  to  coincide  with  party  congresses;  the  Central  Commit- 
tee of  the  BCP  met  immediately  before  the  first  session  of  each  new 
assembly  to  approve  candidates  who  were  then  rubber-stamped  by 
the  National  Assembly  for  the  leadership  positions  of  the  assem- 
bly, State  Council,  and  Council  of  Ministers.  The  ninth  National 
Assembly  (1986-90)  was  rarely  even  notified  of  policy  decisions 
of  the  Zhivkov-led  State  Council.  Nevertheless,  election  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  remained  the  most  important  political  ritual  in  Bul- 
garia throughout  the  communist  period,  and  the  return  to  free 
assembly  elections  in  1990  recalled  the  direct  popular  representa- 
tion prescribed  in  the  Turnovo  Constitution  of  1879,  still  revered 
as  a  model  for  Bulgarian  governance. 

The  First  Freely  Elected  Assembly,  1990 

The  first  significant  post-Zhivkov  act  of  the  holdover  (ninth)  Na- 
tional Assembly  was  passage  of  twenty-one  measures  of  constitu- 
tional reform.  These  measures  included  abolition  of  the  article  of 
the  1971  constitution  giving  the  BCP  sole  right  to  govern.  In  April 
1990,  that  National  Assembly  dissolved  itself  to  make  way  for  na- 
tional election  of  a  Grand  National  Assembly,  charged  with  writ- 
ing and  ratifying  a  new  constitution;  this  was  the  first  voluntary 
adjournment  of  that  body  since  World  War  II. 


189 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


In  accordance  with  the  provisions  under  which  the  1990 
parliamentary  elections  were  held,  after  passing  the  new  constitu- 
tion in  July  1991  the  Grand  National  Assembly  voted  to  dissolve 
itself  and  continue  working  as  a  normal  parliament  until  election 
of  the  new  body.  Thus,  in  the  second  half  of  1991  work  would  con- 
tinue on  critical  legislation  covering  issues  such  as  privatization, 
election  procedures,  and  local  government  reform. 

After  the  1990  national  elections,  the  National  Assembly  re- 
mained a  weak  legislative  body,  but  for  a  new  reason.  No  longer 
required  to  follow  party  orders  precisely,  representatives  often  were 
split  quite  evenly  on  reform  issues.  The  majority  BSP  included  re- 
form and  reactionary  factions,  and  the  144  UDF  members  were 
a  formidable  opposition  group.  Unlike  the  brief  assemblies  of  the 
Zhivkov  era,  the  new  body  remained  in  session  several  days  a  week 
throughout  the  remainder  of  1990  and  through  mid- 1991,  strug- 
gling for  compromise  on  reform  legislation. 

The  State  Council  and  the  Presidency 

The  State  Council,  technically  an  executive  committee  within 
the  National  Assembly,  was  created  by  the  1971  constitution  as 
the  primary  executive  agency  of  the  national  government.  Because 
of  that  role,  the  chairman  of  the  council  was  automatically  presi- 
dent of  the  country  and  thus  one  of  the  two  most  powerful  figures 
in  Bulgaria  in  the  Zhivkov  years.  The  State  Council  included 
representatives  from  trade  unions,  the  Communist  Youth  League 
of  Bulgaria  (Komsomol),  and  other  mass  organizations.  The  council 
supervised  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  had  the  right  to  repeal 
ministry  decisions — a  function  that  clearly  reduced  the  Council  of 
Ministers  to  secondary  executive  status.  In  addition  to  its  execu- 
tive functions,  the  State  Council  could  issue  direct  decrees  with 
full  legal  authority  when  the  National  Assembly  was  not  in  ses- 
sion, with  no  provision  for  later  approval  by  the  full  legislative  body. 
Under  Zhivkov  most  members  of  the  State  Council  were  high  offi- 
cials of  the  BCP.  When  Petur  Mladenov  replaced  Zhivkov  as  chair- 
man of  the  State  Council,  he  did  not  automatically  become  head 
of  state.  When  the  State  Council  was  abolished  in  April  1990,  the 
round  table  named  Mladenov  president  of  the  republic,  a  new  title 
for  the  Bulgarian  head  of  state.  The  appointment  was  made  with 
the  understanding  that  the  new  constitution  would  set  guidelines 
for  this  office.  Meanwhile,  Mladenov  and  his  successor  Zheliu 
Zhelev  retained  the  power  to  form  cabinets  with  the  consent  of  the 
National  Assembly,  to  represent  the  country  abroad,  and  to  act 
as  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed  forces.

The  Council  of  Ministers 

The  constitution  of  1971  substantially  diminished  the  power  of 
the  Council  of  Ministers,  or  cabinet,  which  had  been  an  intermit- 
tent center  of  executive  authority  in  Bulgarian  governments  since 
1878.  In  the  last  two  decades  of  the  Zhivkov  regime,  the  council 
acted  as  an  advisory  board  to  the  State  Council  and  directed  every- 
day operations  of  the  government  bureaucracies.  All  members  of 
the  Council  of  Ministers  belonged  to  the  BCP  or  the  BANU,  and 
many  held  top  party  posts  and  ministries  simultaneously.  Long- 
time Politburo  member  Stanko  Todorov  headed  the  executive  com- 
mittee of  the  council  from  its  creation  in  1971  until  1989.  Within 
their  areas  of  responsibility,  the  ministries  had  authority  to  form 
administrative  organs  and  to  overturn  acts  by  local  government 
agencies.  The  exact  makeup  of  the  council  was  not  prescribed  in 
the  constitution;  the  National  Assembly  had  authority  to  make 
changes  as  necessary,  and  the  council's  shape  and  size  changed 
often  in  the  last  Zhivkov  years. 

After  the  elections  of  1986,  the  Council  of  Ministers  was  reor- 
ganized and  reduced  in  size.  In  the  last  years  of  the  Zhivkov  re- 
gime, it  included  eleven  ministers,  a  chairman  (the  prime  minister), 


191 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

a  deputy  prime  minister,  and  the  chairman  of  the  Committee  on 
State  and  People's  Control  (see  Security  and  Intelligence  Services, 
ch.  5).  In  early  1990,  the  new  provisional  council  had  fourteen 
ministries:  agriculture  and  forests;  construction,  architecture,  and 
public  works;  economy  and  planning;  finance;  foreign  affairs;  for- 
eign economic  relations;  industry  and  technology;  internal  affairs; 
internal  trade;  justice;  national  defense;  national  education;  pub- 
lic health  and  social  welfare;  and  transport.  The  ambassador  to 
the  Soviet  Union  also  had  full  cabinet  status,  as  did  the  heads  of 
the  committees  for  protection  of  the  environment  and  state  and 
people's  control.  Five  deputy  prime  ministers  also  sat  in  that  cabi- 
net, which  was  headed  by  Zhivkov-era  holdover  Georgi  Atanasov. 
The  second  provisional  cabinet,  under  Andrei  Lukanov,  included 
ministers  of  the  environment,  culture,  and  science  and  higher  edu- 
cation in  its  seventeen  departments.  The  ambassador  to  the  Soviet 
Union  was  dropped,  and  a  minister  for  economic  reform  added. 

The  new  status  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  as  the  power  center 
of  Bulgarian  government  was  signaled  by  the  targeting  of  Prime 
Minister  Lukanov  for  opposition  pressure  in  the  fall  of  1990.  A 
second  signal  was  intense  bargaining  between  the  BSP  and  oppo- 
sition parties  for  positions  in  the  Popov  cabinet.  That  bargaining 
produced  a  compromise  agreement  that  gave  the  key  ministries  of 
foreign  economic  relations  and  finance  to  the  BSP,  with  national 
defense  going  to  the  UDF.  The  Ministry  of  the  Interior,  very  sen- 
sitive because  of  its  role  under  Zhivkov  as  the  enforcer  of  state  secu- 
rity, was  largely  reorganized  and  headed  by  a  nonpolitical  figure 
whose  two  deputies  represented  the  major  parties.  The  splitting 
of  the  deputy  minister  positions  was  a  key  compromise  to  gain  ap- 
proval of  the  Popov  cabinet.  In  all,  five  of  the  seventeen  ministers 
in  the  new  cabinet  were  politically  unaffiliated;  seven  remained  from 
the  last  Lukanov  cabinet  to  soften  the  transition;  and  the  UDF  filled 
only  three  posts.  The  multiparty  conference  that  reached  this  agree- 
ment also  allowed  for  further  adjustments  in  the  cabinet  structure 
for  the  Popov  government.  As  an  interim  head  of  government, 
Popov's  main  goal  was  to  establish  minimal  political  and  economic 
conditions  favorable  to  long-term  reforms. 

The  Judiciary 

Members  of  the  highest  national  judicial  body,  the  Supreme 
Court,  were  elected  to  five-year  terms  by  the  National  Assembly. 
Until  1990,  however,  National  Assembly  approval  really  meant 
control  by  the  State  Council,  hence  by  the  BCP.  The  national  court 
system  was  divided  into  criminal,  civil,  and  military  courts;  the 
Supreme  Court  had  jurisdiction  in  both  original  and  appellate  cases, 


192 


Government  and  Politics 


and  it  controlled  the  activities  of  all  lower  courts.  The  1971  consti- 
tution called  the  court  system  and  state  prosecutor's  office  "weapons 
of  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat."  The  chief  prosecutor,  chief 
legal  official  of  Bulgaria,  was  responsible  for  compliance  with  the 
law  by  ordinary  citizens,  local  and  national  political  entities  and 
officials,  and  other  public  organizations.  The  powers  of  this  office 
were  extended  by  law  in  1980  in  an  effort  to  forestall  public  dis- 
satisfaction with  the  crime  prevention  system.  Like  the  justices  of 
the  Supreme  Court,  the  chief  prosecutor  served  at  the  approval 
of  the  State  Council.  Together  with  the  chief  justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court,  the  chief  prosecutor  provided  absolute  BCP  control  of  the 
Bulgarian  judicial  system  until  1990.  The  election  of  all  judicial 
officials  further  guaranteed  this  control. 

Lower  courts  functioned  at  the  provincial  and  municipal  levels; 
election  was  by  people's  councils  at  the  provincial  level  and  directly 
by  citizens  at  the  municipal  level,  using  party-approved  lists.  In 
1990  each  of  Bulgaria's  provinces  (including  Sofia)  had  a  province 
court.  The  105  provincal  courts  tried  minor  offenses.  Both  profes- 
sional judges  and  lay  assessors  sat  in  the  lower  courts.  Specialized 
disputes  were  heard  outside  the  regular  court  system.  For  exam- 
ple, international  trade  cases  went  to  the  Foreign  Trade  Court  of 
Arbitration  of  the  Bulgarian  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Indus- 
try, civil  disputes  among  enterprises  and  public  organizations  were 
heard  by  the  State  Court  of  Arbitration,  and  labor  disputes  were 
settled  by  the  conciliation  committees  of  enterprises. 

Criticized  before  and  after  the  fall  of  Zhivkov,  the  Bulgarian 
justice  system  changed  little  with  the  reform  programs  of  1990  and 
1991.  The  round  table  resolutions  of  early  1990  alluded  only  to 
separation  of  the  judicial,  legislative,  and  executive  branches  to 
avoid  concentration  of  power  in  any  single  branch.  However,  es- 
tablishment of  an  independent,  authoritative  judiciary  would  be 
complicated  by  the  universal  view,  instilled  by  forty-five  years  of 
complete  control  by  the  BCP,  that  the  Bulgarian  court  system  was 
only  an  extension  of  the  state's  executive  power.  In  a  1991  poll, 
only  1.7  percent  of  Bulgarians  expressed  trust  in  the  courts  and 
the  prosecutor's  office.  In  1990  the  youngest  judges  were  over  forty 
years  old,  and  the  most  talented  had  left  for  other  careers  because 
of  the  short  term  of  office,  poor  pay,  low  professional  status,  and 
party  control.  In  late  1990,  Judge  Dimitur  Lozanchev  became  the 
first  politically  neutral  chairman  of  the  Supreme  Court  since  World 
War  II. 

Local  Government 

In  1987  Bulgaria  consolidated  its  local  government  structure  by 


193 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

combining  its  twenty-eight  districts  (okruzi;  sing.,  okrug),  into  nine 
provinces  (oblasti;  sing. ,  oblast),  including  the  city  of  Sofia  (see  fig.  1). 
A  tangible  part  of  the  Zhivkov  regime's  massive  (and  largely  the- 
oretical) plan  for  economic  and  political  restructuring,  the  reor- 
ganization imitated  restructuring  plans  in  the  Soviet  Union.  Local 
government  consolidation  was  to  eliminate  the  complex  and  in- 
efficient okrug  bureaucracies  and  improve  the  operation  of  "peo- 
ple's self-management,"  the  system  by  which  people's  councils 
nominally  managed  area  enterprises.  The  latter  improvement  was 
to  result  from  narrowing  the  primary  function  of  the  new  oblast 
government  to  the  assistance  of  local  workers'  collectives.  At  the 
same  time,  municipalities  and  townships  became  somewhat  more 
autonomous  because  the  restructuring  gave  them  some  of  the  ad- 
ministrative power  removed  from  the  higher  level. 

Although  the  number  of  districts  had  remained  stable  from  1959 
until  the  1987  reform,  the  number  and  allocation  of  smaller  urban 
and  rural  political  entities  changed  rapidly  during  that  period  as 
the  population  shifted  (see  Population,  ch.  2).  In  1990  there  were 
299  political  divisions  smaller  than  the  oblast  and  twenty-nine 
separate  urban  areas.  Both  oblasti  and  smaller  constituencies  were 
ruled  by  people's  councils,  elected  for  thirty-month  terms.  The  local 
multiple-candidate  elections  of  February  1988  were  another  aspect 
of  the  restructuring  program.  Although  local  election  commissions 
retained  considerable  influence  over  nominations,  about  26  per- 
cent of  successful  candidates  were  nonparty  in  1988.  At  that  time, 
51,161  councillors  and  3,953  mayors  were  elected. 

The  people's  councils  at  all  levels  were  run  by  elected  executive 
committees  that  met  continuously.  These  committees  had  full  ex- 
ecutive power  to  act  between  sessions  of  the  people's  councils,  in 
the  same  way  as  the  State  Council  acted  for  the  National  Assem- 
bly in  the  Zhivkov-era  national  government.  Each  council  was 
responsible  to  the  council  at  the  next  higher  level;  financial  plan- 
ning was  to  conform  to  the  goals  of  national  economic  programs. 
Local  councils  had  authority  over  the  People's  Militia,  or  police, 
as  well  as  over  local  services  and  administration.  The  Popov  govern- 
ment scheduled  new  local  elections  for  February  1991 ,  after  which 
time  reforms  were  expected  in  the  local  government  system.  Mean- 
while, most  provincial  governments  remained  under  the  control 
of  Zhivkovite  officials,  intensifying  the  schism  between  the  urban 
and  provincial  political  climates. 

Electoral  Procedures 

The  round  table  reforms  of  1 990  included  a  new  election  law  rati- 
fied by  the  National  Assembly.  As  in  other  aspects  of  governance,

prescribed  election  procedures  did  not  change  greatly  under  the 
new  regime,  but  the  intent  and  practice  of  the  law  did.  The  right 
to  vote  by  direct  secret  ballot  remained  universal  for  all  Bulgari- 
ans over  eighteen,  and  the  officials  they  elected  remained  theoret- 
ically responsible  only  to  the  voters.  Prescriptions  for  eligibility  for 
nomination  and  the  nomination  process  changed  little  with  the  new 
law.  The  main  difference  was  that  in  practice  the  BCP  (BSP)  no 
longer  could  indiscriminately  remove  elected  representatives  or 
members  of  people's  councils,  nor  did  it  control  the  nomination 
function  nominally  given  to  public  organizations,  trade  unions, 
youth  groups,  and  cooperatives. 

Under  the  election  law  of  1953,  all  candidate  lists  were  approved 
by  the  communist-controlled  Fatherland  Front.  Under  the  1990 
law,  all  parties  and  registered  nonparty  organizations  could  sub- 
mit candidates;  individuals  could  be  nominated  for  the  assembly 
with  500  signatures  of  voters  from  their  district,  and  an  unlimited 
number  of  candidates  might  run  from  each  district.  The  State  Coun- 
cil formerly  had  the  power  to  call  elections;  for  the  1990  Grand 
National  Assembly  election,  the  date  was  fixed  by  agreement  of 
the  UDF  and  the  BCP.  The  Central  Election  Commission,  form- 
erly a  creature  of  the  State  Council,  was  to  supervise  the  equitable 
implementation  of  election  laws,  overseeing  the  operation  of  equiva- 
lent commissions  at  local  levels.  Election  commissions  at  all  levels 
included  members  from  various  parties;  the  Central  Election 


195

Commission  was  headed  by  a  professor  of  law  with  no  political  con- 
nection. 

The  new  law  also  revised  the  representational  system  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly.  The  new  assembly  continued  to  have  400  seats, 
but  it  would  sit  for  four  instead  of  five  years.  A  new  electoral  struc- 
ture also  was  introduced.  Half  the  National  Assembly  members 
were  elected  in  multiple-seat  districts,  in  proportion  to  total  votes 
cast  for  each  party  in  the  district.  A  4  percent  minimum  was  re- 
quired for  a  party  to  achieve  representation.  The  law  designated 
twenty-eight  multiple-seat  voting  districts,  based  on  the  pre- 1987 
okruzi.  The  other  200  members  were  elected  from  200  single-seat 
voting  districts.  A  runoff  election  was  held  in  each  district  where 
no  candidate  received  50  percent  of  the  initial  vote  (this  occurred 
in  81  of  the  200  districts).  All  voters  in  the  1990  election  had  one 
vote  in  each  type  of  district  (see  The  National  Assembly,  this  ch.). 

The  election  was  supervised  by  the  CSCE.  According  to  impar- 
tial observers  and  the  parties  themselves,  the  election  was  reasonably 
free  of  interference  and  coercion,  considering  that  most  of  the  elec- 
torate had  never  faced  a  true  political  choice  and  the  registration 
and  voting  systems  were  quite  complex.  Party  strategies  were  dic- 
tated by  timing  and  geography.  The  UDF,  lacking  time  and  re- 
sources to  campaign  in  the  provinces,  confined  its  efforts  to  the 
more  congenial  constituency  in  Sofia  and  other  large  cities.  The 
BSP  campaigned  as  a  reform  party  in  progressive  Sofia,  but  it  took 
advantage  of  the  substantial  residue  of  Zhivkovite  local  officials  in 
the  provinces  (many  of  whom  were  accused  of  exerting  pressure 
on  their  constituents  to  vote  BSP)  to  gain  211  assembly  seats  to 
the  UDF's  144.  The  UDF  outpolled  the  BSP  in  Sofia,  Plovdiv, 
Varna,  and  most  other  Bulgarian  cities. 

The  timing  of  the  next  national  election  was  the  topic  of  heated 
debate  in  the  first  half  of  1991  as  political  factions  maneuvered  for 
advantage.  After  the  new  constitution  was  ratified  in  July  1991  and 
a  new  election  law  was  scheduled  for  August,  elections  were  tenta- 
tively set  for  October  1991.  The  new  election  law  was  to  free  the 
system  of  the  cumbersome  procedure  used  in  1990.  Controversial 
elements  of  the  law  were  a  BSP-backed  clause  disallowing  absen- 
tee ballots  from  emigres  and  the  restriction  of  all  campaign  activi- 
ties to  the  Bulgarian  language.  The  1991  law  prescribed  a  Central 
Electoral  Commission  of  twenty-five,  to  be  appointed  by  the  presi- 
dent in  consultation  with  major  political  factions.  The  central  com- 
mission would  then  appoint  and  oversee  like  commissions  at  lower 
jurisdictions  and  set  policy  for  election  administration.  National 
elections  were  to  be  held  by  the  proportional  system,  eliminating 
the  two-part  system  of  1990.  Recognized  parties,  coalitions  of 


196 


Government  and  Politics 


parties,  individual  nominees,  and  combinations  of  individuals  and 
parties  would  be  eligible  to  run.  The  country  was  divided  into  thirty- 
one  electoral  constituencies,  three  of  which  were  in  Sofia. 

Nongovernmental  Political  Institutions 

Until  1989  the  BCP  exerted  firm  control  over  such  nongovern- 
mental political  institutions  as  trade  unions,  youth  groups,  wom- 
en's groups,  and  the  nominally  oppositionist  BANU.  The  ouster 
of  Zhivkov,  however,  brought  a  torrent  of  new  and  revived  groups 
into  the  political  arena.  In  the  new  open  political  climate,  the 
groups'  fragmented  constituencies  often  spoke  loudly  for  their  own 
special  interests,  greatly  complicating  the  process  of  coalition- 
building  and  compromise  needed  to  accomplish  national  reform. 

The  Bulgarian  Communist  (Socialist)  Party 

The  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  (BCP),  which  renamed  itself 
the  Bulgarian  Socialist  Party  (BSP)  several  months  after  the  fall 
of  Zhivkov,  boasted  one  of  the  highest  membership-to-population 
ratios  (one  in  nine  Bulgarians)  in  any  communist  country  in  the 
late  1980s.  Between  1958  and  1987,  membership  grew  by  442,000, 
mainly  by  adding  bureaucrats  and  blue-collar  workers  in  younger 
age  groups.  In  1986  women  made  up  32.7  percent  of  party  mem- 
bership, but  few  women  held  high  positions.  The  proportion  of 
worker  members  had  grown  to  44.4  percent  by  1986,  and  the 
proportion  of  farm  members  had  dropped  to  16.3  percent,  reflect- 
ing an  even  sharper  drop  in  the  overall  farming  population  of  Bul- 
garia (see  table  20,  Appendix).  Party  recruitment  in  the  1980s 
targeted  individuals  already  successful  in  public  or  economic  life, 
and  the  proportion  of  white-collar  members  increased  in  that 
decade. 

In  1987  the  BCP  was  organized  into  2,900  local  units.  Until  1990 
primary  party  organizations  were  based  primarily  in  workplaces. 
The  next  level  in  the  hierarchy  was  municipal  organizations,  which 
were  overseen  by  city  or  province  and  ultimately  national  bodies. 
At  every  level,  party  and  government  personnel  were  closely  inter- 
woven, and  the  principle  of  democratic  centralism  kept  the  lower 
levels  strictly  subordinate  to  the  national  party.  The  primary  or- 
ganizations were  charged  with  recruitment  and  mobilization.  A 
major  concession  by  the  post-Zhivkov  party  was  removal  of  party 
cells  from  all  state  offices,  the  judiciary,  educational  and  health  agen- 
cies, as  well  as  all  nongovernmental  workplaces — a  concession  forced 
by  the  UDF's  threat  to  boycott  the  round  table  negotiations  that 
would  set  a  national  agenda  for  political  reform  early  in  1 990 .  That 
change  significantly  altered  the  primary  level  of  party  organization. 


197 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Until  1990  the  top  level  of  party  leadership  was  the  Politburo, 
of  which  Zhivkov  was  general  secretary.  That  position  had  been 
abolished  in  the  1950s  in  the  BCP  as  part  of  de-Stalinization.  It 
was  restored  in  1981,  however,  to  recognize  Zhivkov 's  long  ser- 
vice and  conform  to  Soviet  restoration  under  Leonid  Brezhnev. 
Politburo  members  usually  were  selected  from  the  central  committee 
and  nominally  elected  by  party  congresses,  which  normally  met 
every  five  years.  In  1986  the  Thirteenth  Party  Congress  elected 
an  eleven-member  Politburo  dominated  by  party  loyalists  of  Zhiv- 
kov's  generation  but  supplemented  by  a  few  younger  specialists 
in  politics  and  economics.  Following  tradition,  the  1986  congress 
made  few  changes  in  the  previous  Politburo.  The  party  congresses 
were  nominally  the  top  policy-making  body  of  the  party,  but,  like 
the  National  Assembly,  they  rubber-stamped  decisions  handed  them 
by  the  party  elite. 

The  BCP  hierarchy  also  included  the  Central  Committee,  whose 
members  the  congress  unanimously  approved  from  candidates  sup- 
plied by  the  party  leadership.  Through  a  number  of  specialized 
departments,  the  Central  Committee  performed  administrative 
party  work  between  sessions  of  congress.  After  considerable  size 
variation,  the  last  Central  Committee  included  190  members  and 
131  candidate  members  in  early  1990.  The  third  elite  group  was 
the  BCP  Secretariat,  a  group  somewhat  smaller  than  the  Politburo 
(its  number  also  varied  during  the  Zhivkov  years),  entrusted  with 
implementing  party  policy. 

Membership  in  the  BCP  required  recommendation  by  three  es- 
tablished members;  if  accepted  at  the  primary  and  next-highest 
level,  a  candidate  received  full  membership  with  no  probationary 
period.  Criminal  or  unethical  behavior  caused  withdrawal  of  mem- 
bership. Without  benefit  of  explanation,  a  varying  number  of  mem- 
bers also  failed  to  receive  the  new  party  cards  issued  before  each 
party  congress.  Abrupt  purging  of  cadre  and  membership  elements 
deemed  potentially  hostile  to  current  programs  was  a  procedure 
that  Zhivkov  used  with  great  skill  to  balance  and  weaken  opposi- 
tion forces  throughout  his  tenure  in  office. 

The  fall  of  Zhivkov  brought  immediate  and  dramatic  changes 
in  the  BCP,  including  removal  of  the  word  "communist"  from 
its  name.  The  Extraordinary  Fourteenth  Party  Congress  of  the  BCP 
was  held  in  the  winter  of  1990,  over  a  year  sooner  than  scheduled. 
That  congress  abolished  the  Central  Committee  and  the  Politburo 
in  favor  of  a  Supreme  Party  Council  headed  by  a  presidency.  To 
streamline  party  activity,  the  new  council  had  only  131  members, 
59  fewer  than  the  last  Central  Committee.  The  Secretariat  was 
abolished.  The  party  emerged  from  the  congress  with  significant 


198

splits  between  reform  and  conservative  factions  and  a  new  tem- 
porary program.  Only  about  10  percent  of  previous  Central  Com- 
mittee members  became  members  of  the  new  Supreme  Party 
Council;  several  party  stalwarts  who  had  survived  the  Zhivkov  over- 
throw, including  Prime  Minister  Atanasov,  were  not  elected.  The 
BCP's  constitutional  guarantee  of  the  leading  role  in  Bulgarian  so- 
ciety already  had  been  abolished.  In  a  compromise  with  the  UDF 
shortly  after  the  congress,  party  organizations  were  banned  from 
workplaces  and  the  armed  forces.  The  BSP  had  full  control  of  the 
government  (the  UDF  refused  to  form  a  coalition  both  before  and 
after  the  1990  elections),  but  BSP  popularity  and  power  ebbed 
rapidly  during  1990  and  1991 .  By  the  first  anniversary  of  Zhivkov' s 
resignation,  party  membership  had  decreased  to  an  estimated 
250,000.  (Membership  had  been  reported  as  984,000  at  the  time 
of  the  Fourteenth  Party  Congress.) 

The  Union  of  Democratic  Forces 

The  Union  of  Democratic  Forces  (UDF;  Bulgarian  Sayuz  na 
Demokratichnite  Sili — SDS),  which  emerged  as  the  chief  opposi- 
tion faction  to  the  BCP  after  1989,  was  a  motley  coalition  of  sev- 
eral major  and  many  minor  parties  and  groups.  Some  of  the  parties, 
such  as  the  BANU,  predated  the  communist  era  by  several  decades. 
Others,  such  as  the  Green  Party,  were  organized  after  the  over- 
throw of  Zhivkov.  When  the  UDF  was  founded  in  December  1989, 
it  included  ten  organizations;  by  the  following  spring,  six  more  par- 
ties and  movements  had  joined. 

The  basis  of  the  UDF  was  the  dissident  groups  that  formed  under 
the  faltering  Zhivkov  regime  in  the  late  1980s.  The  all-European 
Ecoforum  of  October  1989  allowed  many  such  groups  to  meet  and 
exchange  ideas  for  the  first  time;  once  Zhivkov  fell,  the  initial  con- 
tacts spawned  an  organizational  declaration  that  envisioned  a  loose 
confederation.  Within  the  confederation,  constituent  groups  would 
continue  to  work  for  their  own  specific  interests.  The  coordinat- 
ing council  was  to  include  three  members  from  each  organization. 
Longtime  dissident  philosopher  Zheliu  Zhelev  was  elected  chair- 
man and  Petur  Beron,  a  well-known  environmental  scientist,  was 
chosen  secretary. 

The  diversity  of  membership  required  substantial  compromise 
in  the  UDF  program.  At  least  one  issue  central  to  each  member 
group  was  included  in  the  program,  however.  The  general  goals 
of  the  program  were  a  civil  society,  market  economy,  multiparty 
system,  and  constitutional  government.  Sixteen  specific  steps  were 
outlined  to  achieve  those  goals.  The  main  criterion  for  acceptance 


199 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

of  new  member  organizations  was  compatibility  of  their  goals  with 
those  in  the  UDF  program. 

Shortly  after  the  UDF  was  founded,  a  vital  policy  decision  con- 
fronted its  leaders:  the  BCP-dominated  government  revoked  the 
Zhivkov  program  of  Bulgarizing  the  names  of  all  Turkish  citizens. 
Alienating  the  extreme  nationalist  factions  that  opposed  compromise 
with  the  ethnic  minority,  the  UDF  supported  the  government  de- 
cision in  its  first  major  policy  statement. 

In  the  first  half  of  1990,  the  stature  of  the  UDF  was  enhanced 
by  its  participation  as  an  equal  in  round  table  discussions  with  the 
BCP  (BSP)  on  a  range  of  policy  issues  that  would  set  future  eco- 
nomic and  political  policy.  By  March  1990,  the  coalition's  main 
goal  was  clearly  stated:  to  push  the  interim  National  Assembly  to 
draft  a  democratic  constitution  and  urgent  reform  legislation  as 
quickly  as  possible,  over  the  opposition  of  remaining  BSP  hard- 
liners and  noncommunist  splinter  groups.  All  factions  recognized 
that  once  this  was  completely  accomplished,  the  coalition  would 
dissolve  and  members  would  act  as  independent  political  parties 
with  varying  agendas. 

In  the  parliamentary  elections  of  June  1990,  the  UDF  platform 
advocated  a  wide  range  of  drastic  reforms  in  government  struc- 
ture, the  media,  foreign  policy,  and  the  economy.  Detailed  proposals 
were  offered  for  education,  the  environment,  and  a  two-phase 
"shock  therapy"  reform  leading  to  a  free  market  economy.  Finally, 
the  UDF  blamed  the  previous  communist  regime  for  Bulgaria's 
current  crises.  The  UDF  failed  to  gain  a  majority  in  the  National 
Assembly  because  many  rural  areas  remained  in  control  of  Zhiv- 
kovite  BSP  politicians.  Many  peasants  had  felt  relatively  secure 
under  the  old  collective  system,  and  the  timing  of  the  election  had 
forced  opposition  parties  to  concentrate  campaigns  in  the  cities, 
their  strongest  regions.  The  BSP  won  211  of  the  400  seats. 

In  the  year  following  parliamentary  elections,  BSP  obstructionism 
stymied  legalization  of  the  UDF's  reform  goals.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  UDF's  refusal  to  participate  in  the  Lukanov  cabinet  proved 
its  popular  strength  by  stalemating  Lukanov 's  economic  reform 
program.  In  the  crisis-driven  formation  of  the  Popov  government 
in  December  1990,  the  UDF  gained  strategic  cabinet  posts.  In  Janu- 
ary 1991 ,  the  UDF  and  the  BSP  agreed  on  a  timetable  for  passage 
of  the  new  constitution  and  other  urgent  legislation,  but  early  in 
1991  parliamentary  disagreements  set  back  the  schedule.  In  March 
1991,  the  UDF  sponsored  a  protest  rally  attended  by  more  than 
50,000  people  in  Sofia.  In  May  legislators  from  several  smaller  par- 
ties walked  out  of  the  National  Assembly  to  protest  its  inaction; 
the  BANU  contingent  promised  to  do  the  same  if  the  parliament

had  not  passed  a  new  constitution  by  the  end  of  June.  Meanwhile, 
however,  official  UDF  policy  continued  seeking  to  break  the  long 
stalemate  by  convincing  the  socialists  in  the  National  Assembly  to 
abandon  their  go-slow  approach  to  reform. 

By  mid- 1991  a  split  developed  between  the  largest  member 
groups  (the  reconstituted  BSDP,  the  BANU,  Ekoglasnost,  and  the 
Green  Party)  and  the  smaller  ones  over  using  quotas  and  preferen- 
tial lists  in  the  next  election — a  practice  that  would  contradict  the 
UDF's  role  as  a  single  national  movement  and  give  larger  parties 
substantially  more  influence  in  policy  making.  Easily  the  largest 
member  organizations  with  about  100,000  members  each,  the 
BANU  and  the  BSDP  would  benefit  most  from  such  a  shift.  In 
July  1991,  voting  in  the  National  Assembly  on  the  new  constitu- 
tion clarified  the  split  between  factions  viewing  the  UDF  as  a  sin- 
gle national  movement  and  those  seeking  individual  identity  within 
a  loose  confederation.  The  main  issue  was  the  constitutional 
prescription  for  legislative  representation  by  party.  By  summer 
1991,  disagreements  on  ratification  of  the  constitution  had  led 
splinter  groups  to  form  a  new  Political  Consultative  Council  to  rival 
the  UDF's  existing  National  Coordinating  Council  as  a  controll- 
ing agency  of  the  UDF.  This  action  threatened  to  split  the  UDF 
into  two  or  three  slates  of  candidates  for  the  1991  national  elec- 
tions. Thus,  by  mid- 1991  the  relative  harmony  of  the  UDF's  first 
year  had  evolved  into  persistent  divisiveness  affecting  tactics,  or- 
ganizational structure,  and  the  pace  of  reform.  In  spite  of  concilia- 
tory efforts  by  the  coordinating  council,  the  effective  united  front 
that  had  forced  major  concessions  from  the  BSP  in  1990  seemed 
less  potent  in  1991. 

Trade  Unions 

The  Bulgarian  trade  union  movement  was  rejuvenated  in  the 
pluralist  post-Zhivkov  political  atmosphere  after  being  forced  to 
adhere  totally  to  BCP  policy  throughout  the  postwar  period.  By 
1990  unions  were  a  powerful  policy-making  force,  using  well- 
organized  strikes  and  walkouts  to  emphasize  their  positions. 

Unions  under  Communist  Regimes 

In  the  decade  before  World  War  II,  the  benign  dictatorship  of 
Tsar  Boris  III  abolished  independent  trade  unions  in  favor  of  a 
single  government-sponsored  Bulgarian  Workers'  Union.  As  Bul- 
garia emerged  from  the  war  under  Soviet  occupation,  communists 
abolished  that  union  and  replaced  it  with  a  General  Workers' 
Professional  Union  that  included  both  white-  and  blue-collar  work- 
ers. Gradually,  independent  union  organizations  were  forced  to 


202 


Government  and  Politics 


disband  or  join  the  communist  organization.  By  1947  union  lead- 
ers were  an  important  instrument  in  consolidation  of  the  party's 
power.  When  capitalism  was  declared  illegal  in  1948,  the  Dimitrov 
government  united  thirteen  unions  under  the  Central  Council  of 
Trade  Unions,  which  endured  until  1989  as  the  single  umbrella 
organization  representing  Bulgarian  workers. 

During  that  entire  period,  all  workers'  and  professional  organi- 
zations followed  faithfully  the  economic  policies  of  the  BCP.  The 
official  goals  of  the  Bulgarian  trade  unions  were  first  to  help  manage- 
ment to  fulfill  state  economic  plans,  then  to  defend  workers'  interests 
when  they  did  not  conflict  with  such  fulfillment.  As  institutions 
the  unions  had  no  policy  input.  In  individual  enterprises,  union 
leaders  and  managers  developed  informal  advisory  relationships. 
The  only  official  role  of  the  unions  was  as  transmitters  of  party 
policies  to  the  working  masses.  Although  union  and  BCP  mem- 
bership were  theoretically  separate,  officials  at  the  national  and  local 
levels  often  overlapped  to  give  the  party  direct  control  of  workers. 
For  example,  members  of  the  district-level  people's  councils  often 
were  also  union  executives  (see  Local  Government,  this  ch.). 

General  congresses  of  trade  unions  were  held  explicitly  to  carry 
out  BCP  policy;  congress  delegate  structure  (2,997  attended  the 
ninth  congress  in  1982)  and  the  holding  of  preliminary  district  con- 
gresses mimicked  BCP  procedures.  The  many  industrial  reorgani- 
zation plans  of  the  Zhivkov  regime  meant  periodic  restructuring, 
if  not  new  roles,  for  the  unions.  In  the  early  1980s,  for  example, 
the  decentralizing  reforms  of  the  New  Economic  Model  (NEM) 
changed  the  labor  union  structure  from  one  divided  by  region  to 
one  divided  by  brigade,  collective,  and  enterprise,  matching  the 
NEM  industrial  structure  of  the  time.  Although  this  change  was 
controversial,  it  did  little  to  improve  the  influence  of  the  Bulgar- 
ian working  class  on  enterprise  policy. 

In  the  1980s,  union  membership  approached  4  million,  encom- 
passing an  estimated  98  percent  of  Bulgarian  workers.  Almost  a 
year  before  the  fall  of  Zhivkov,  the  Independent  Labor  Federa- 
tion, Podkrepa,  organized  as  a  white-collar  opposition  group  in- 
spired by  the  Polish  Solidarity  (see  Glossary)  movement.  In  1989 
Podkrepa  consistently  was  persecuted  for  its  outspoken  criticism 
of  Zhivkov's  policies. 

Independent  Union  Organizations 

When  the  communist  regime  was  overthrown,  the  central  coun- 
cil began  restructuring  the  trade  union  system,  declaring  the  or- 
ganization independent  of  the  BCP  and  renaming  its  umbrella 


203

organization  the  Confederation  of  Independent  Trade  Unions 
(CITU).  In  1990  BCP  organizations  were  banned  from  work  places, 
although  the  continuing  overlap  of  party  and  union  officials  main- 
tained substantial  communist  influence  in  the  CITU  at  local  lev- 
els. In  the  early  reform  years,  the  CITU  and  Podkrepa  were  the 
two  major  trade  union  federations,  although  many  independent 
unions  also  emerged  in  this  revival  period  for  the  movement.  Early 
in  1990,  Podkrepa  established  its  credibility  by  exacting  an  agree- 
ment with  CITU  guaranteeing  its  members  all  the  rights  (and  the 
substantial  privileges)  accorded  official  trade  unions  under  the  pre- 
vious system.  From  the  beginning,  Podkrepa  sought  maximum  in- 
fluence on  government  policy,  repeatedly  demanding  radical 
economic  reform. 

Podkrepa  grew  rapidly  in  1990  because  of  its  roles  as  a  charter 
member  of  the  UDF,  as  a  participant  in  the  policy  round  tables 
with  the  BCP,  and  as  the  organizer  of  strikes  and  demonstrations 
against  the  communist-dominated  Lukanov  government.  In  early 
1990,  an  estimated  300  strikes  helped  convince  the  government  that 
talks  with  opposition  groups  were  necessary.  Although  Podkrepa 
ran  no  candidates  in  the  national  elections  of  1990,  it  vigorously 
supported  candidates  who  espoused  labor  views.  In  late  1990, 
another  wave  of  strikes  pushed  the  Lukanov  government  out  and 
led  to  the  coalition  Popov  government.  Although  CITU  and  other 
unions  participitated,  Podkrepa  usually  was  the  prime  organizer 
in  such  actions. 

CITU,  whose  membership  of  3  million  dwarfed  the  400,000  of 
Podkrepa,  remained  politically  passive  in  the  early  post-Zhivkov 
period.  In  mid- 1990  CITU  began  issuing  statements  critical  of 
government  inactivity,  and  it  mobilized  500,000  workers  to  par- 
ticipate in  the  November  1990  strikes  initiated  by  Podkrepa  against 
the  Lukanov  government. 

The  strikes  that  forced  Lukanov' s  resignation  also  raised  criti- 
cism of  the  political  role  of  both  labor  organizations  late  in  1990 
(see  Governance  after  Zhivkov,  this  ch.).  CITU  received  criticism 
for  both  its  continued  ties  with  the  BSP  and  its  aggressive  refor- 
mist stance.  The  Supreme  Party  Council  of  the  BSP  declared  a 
policy  of  noninterference  in  CITU  affairs.  Meanwhile,  Podkrepa, 
led  by  controversial,  outspokenly  anticommunist  Konstantin  Tren- 
chev,  responded  to  internal  and  external  criticism  by  changing  from 
active  membership  to  observor  status  in  the  UDF. 

The  unions  continued  active  participation  in  political  decision 
making  in  1991,  however.  Because  economic  reforms  brought  sub- 
stantial unemployment  and  workplace  disruption,  representing 
worker  interests  was  synonymous  with  such  involvement  in  this 


204 


Government  and  Politics 


period.  In  January  1991,  CITU  and  Podkrepa  signed  a  "social  peace 
agreement"  with  the  Popov  government  to  refrain  from  striking  dur- 
ing the  first  phase  of  economic  reform  in  exchange  for  limitations 
on  work-force  cutbacks  (see  Market  Reform,  ch.  3).  However,  juris- 
dictional and  policy  disputes  threatened  to  undermine  the  agree- 
ment. Although  both  organizations  continued  to  support  the  Popov 
government,  in  March  1991  Podkrepa  proposed  that  UDF  represen- 
tatives boycott  the  National  Assembly  because  it  failed  to  pass  re- 
form measures. 

As  opposition  to  the  communists  declined  as  a  uniting  factor, 
Bulgaria's  trade  unions  maneuvered  to  shape  new  roles  for  them- 
selves in  1991 .  Representing  40  percent  of  the  population  in  a  wide- 
open  political  culture,  they  exerted  tremendous  influence  on  policy 
even  in  the  first  post-Zhivkov  year.  The  radical  economic  reform 
envisioned  by  Bulgarian  leaders  would  include  entirely  new  rela- 
tionships among  the  government,  enterprise  management,  and 
unions.  Movement  to  a  Western- style  free-market  economy  would 
mean  conceding  some  worker  rights  taken  for  granted  under  the 
command  economy,  but  compromise  with  the  Podkrepa-led  union 
movement  promised  to  be  a  severe  test  for  other  political  insti- 
tutions. 

Youth  Organizations 

Following  the  model  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  BCP  put  massive 
resources  into  its  party  youth  organization  when  it  came  to  power. 
Officially  called  the  Communist  Youth  League  of  Bulgaria  (later 
the  Dimitrov  Communist  Youth  League  of  Bulgaria)  and  abbrevi- 
ated to  Komsomol,  the  league  sought  to  ensure  that  proper  socialist 
values  would  pass  to  the  next  generation  and  to  supply  new  mem- 
bers for  the  party.  With  a  peak  membership  of  1 .5  million  in  1987, 
the  Komsomol  had  the  same  organizational  structure  as  the  BCP, 
with  a  secretariat  and  executive  bureau  analogous  to  the  Politburo 
at  the  top  and  a  pyramid  of  local  and  regional  sub-organizations. 
Besides  instilling  party  dogma  in  Bulgarian  youth,  the  organiza- 
tion was  a  vehicle  for  enforcing  party  directives,  a  source  of  reserve 
personnel,  an  organizer  of  social  and  recreational  activities,  and, 
in  the  1980s,  an  instrument  for  encouraging  computer  training  in 
the  schools.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1970s,  the  Komsomol's  lack  of 
self-confidence  was  revealed  in  a  series  of  party  meetings,  speeches, 
and  programs  aimed  at  explaining  and  combatting  apathy  and 
materialism  in  Bulgarian  youth.  By  the  late  1980s,  the  Komsomol 
was  widely  seen  as  a  hollow  facade;  between  1987  and  1989,  mem- 
bership dropped  by  30  percent  after  compulsory  registration  ended 
in  secondary  schools. 


205 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Immediately  after  the  overthrow  of  Zhivkov,  alternative  youth 
groups  began  to  form.  One  such  group,  the  Federation  of  Indepen- 
dent Students'  Unions  (FISU),  gained  support  by  advocating  com- 
plete separation  of  student  groups  from  the  BCP/BSP  and  its 
ideological  constraints  and  by  proclaiming  itself  a  student  voice  on 
questions  of  national  policy.  FISU  gained  stature  by  being  a  charter 
member  of  the  UDF. 

Meanwhile,  the  Komsomol  acknowledged  past  failures,  changed 
its  name  to  the  Bulgarian  Democratic  Youth  (BDY),  and  began 
issuing  policy  statements  on  student  rights  and  broader  social  is- 
sues. The  organization  was  decentralized  by  giving  local  affiliates 
substantial  autonomy,  and  democratized  by  limiting  the  terms  of 
officials.  Election  of  a  political  unknown,  Rosen  Karadimov,  as 
first  secretary  was  another  signal  that  the  youth  organization  had 
broken  with  conventional  communist  party  practices. 

The  BDY  was  overwhelmed  by  a  wave  of  student  activism  in 
alternative  groups.  Student  strikes  in  support  of  the  anti-Lukanov 
labor  strikes  in  late  1990  shut  down  major  universities.  And,  like 
the  BSP,  the  BDY  faced  reminders  and  accusations  of  its  misdeeds 
in  the  pre  reform  era.  In  late  1990,  the  BDY  returned  to  the  state 
much  of  the  property  the  Komsomol  had  accumulated  during  de- 
cades of  BCP  funding.  It  also  renounced  socialism  and  recast  it- 
self as  an  apolitical  social  organization. 

The  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms 

With  120,000  members,  the  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms 
(MRF)  was  the  fourth  largest  political  organization  in  Bulgaria  in 
1991,  but  it  occupied  a  special  place  in  the  political  process.  The 
leader  of  the  movement,  Ahmed  Dogan,  was  imprisoned  in  1986 
for  opposition  to  the  Zhivkov  policy  of  assimilating  ethnic  Turks 
(see  Bulgaria  in  the  1980s,  ch.  1).  Founded  in  1990  to  represent 
the  interests  of  the  Turkish  ethnic  minority,  the  MRF  gained 
twenty-three  seats  in  the  first  parliamentary  election  that  year,  giv- 
ing it  the  fourth-largest  parliamentary  voting  bloc.  Its  agenda 
precluded  mass  media  coverage  or  building  coalitions  with  other 
parties,  because  of  the  strong  anti-Turkish  element  in  Bulgaria's 
political  culture.  By  mid- 1991,  the  UDF  had  held  only  one  joint 
demonstration  with  the  MRF;  their  failure  to  reconcile  differences 
was  considered  a  major  weakness  in  the  opposition  to  the  majority 
BSP.  In  early  1990,  the  MRF  protested  vigorously  but  unsuccess- 
fully its  exclusion  from  national  round  table  discussions  among  the 
major  Bulgarian  parties. 

In  1991  the  MRF  broadened  its  platform  to  embrace  all  issues 
of  civil  rights  in  Bulgaria,  aiming  "to  contribute  to  the  unity  of 


206 


Government  and  Politics 


the  Bulgarian  people  and  to  the  full  and  unequivocal  compliance 
with  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  mankind  and  of  all  ethnic,  reli- 
gious, and  cultural  communities  in  Bulgaria."  The  MRF  took  this 
step  partly  to  avoid  the  constitutional  prohibition  of  political  par- 
ties based  on  ethnic  or  religious  groups.  The  group's  specific  goals 
were  ensuring  that  the  new  constitution  protect  ethnic  minorities 
adequately;  introducing  Turkish  as  an  optional  school  subject;  and 
bringing  to  trial  the  leaders  of  the  assimilation  campaign  in  the 
1980s.  To  calm  Bulgarian  nationalist  resentment,  the  MRF  cate- 
gorically renounced  Islamic  fundamentalism,  terrorism,  and  am- 
bitions for  autonomy  within  Bulgaria.  Political  overtures  were  made 
regularly  to  the  UDF,  and  some  local  cooperation  occurred  in  1991 . 
Although  the  MRF  remained  the  fastest  growing  party  in  Bulgaria, 
however,  the  sensitivity  of  the  Turkish  issue  caused  official  UDF 
policy  to  keep  the  MRF  in  isolation.

Besides  the  BSP  and  the  BANU,  parties  officially  sanctioned 
under  Zhivkov,  an  unofficial  list  of  political  organizations  in  early 
1990  contained  fourteen  political  parties,  seven  unions  and  labor 
federations,  and  sixteen  forums,  clubs,  movements,  committees, 
and  associations — diverging  widely  in  scope,  special  interests,  and 
size. 

Ecological  Organizations 

Two  ecological  organizations,  the  Green  Party  in  Bulgaria  and 
Ekoglasnost,  were  founding  members  of  the  UDF.  The  Greens, 
which  separated  from  Ekoglasnost  shortly  after  Zhivkov 's  fall,  in- 
cluded mostly  scientists  and  academics.  Their  platform  stressed  de- 
centralized government  and  a  strong  role  for  the  individual  in 
determining  quality  of  life  and  preservation  of  the  environment. 
The  government  was  to  play  a  leading  role,  however,  in  provid- 
ing social  security,  health  care,  and  support  for  scientific  reasearch. 
Ekoglasnost,  which  described  itself  as  nonpolitical  despite  its  role 
in  the  UDF,  was  founded  in  early  1989  as  an  open  association  of 
environmentally  concerned  citizens.  Its  purpose  was  to  collect  and 
publicize  ecological  information  about  proposed  projects,  and  to 
assist  decision  makers  in  following  environmentally  sound  policy. 
Ekoglasnost  had  a  membership  of  35,000  at  the  end  of  1990. 

Revived  Prewar  Parties 

The  Bulgarian  Social  Democratic  Party  (BSDP)  was  an  offshoot 
of  the  movement  that  produced  the  BCP.  The  main  socialist  party 
in  Bulgaria  between  the  world  wars,  the  BSDP  was  disbanded  by 


207

the  communists  in  1948.  It  resurfaced  in  1990,  resuming  its  ad- 
vocacy of  government  reform  and  elimination  of  social  privilege. 
The  BSDP  saw  a  freely  elected  National  Assembly  as  the  chief  in- 
strument of  popular  democracy.  The  BSDP  party  platform  also 
called  for  close  economic  ties  with  Europe,  disarmament,  and 
respect  for  private  property.  The  BSDP  was  a  founding  member 
of  the  UDF  and,  under  the  controversial  leadership  of  Petur 
Dertliev,  one  of  its  most  active  participants. 

The  history  of  the  BSDP  followed  closely  that  of  the  communists, 
except  that  the  latter  had  a  larger  following.  The  BSDP  recovered 
official  status  in  1990  after  being  disbanded  in  1948.  Represent- 
ing the  middle  class,  the  party  stood  for  private  property  rights, 
a  multiparty  parliamentary  system  of  government,  radical  reduc- 
tion of  the  military  budget,  and  active  participation  in  the  Euro- 
pean Community.  Membership  in  1991  was  25,000  to  30,000. 

The  Petkov  branch  of  the  Bulgarian  Agrarian  National  Union 
(BANU),  the  third  of  the  prewar  parties  to  emerge  as  an  indepen- 
dent entity  after  Zhivkov,  was  the  part  of  the  agrarian  movement 
that  had  actively  opposed  the  communists  between  1944  and  1947 
and  thus  did  not  survive  the  postwar  communist  consolidation.  The 
"official"  BANU,  showpiece  opposition  party  to  the  BCP  from 
1947  until  1989,  also  was  revitalized  in  1990.  In  1990  and  1991, 
efforts  were  made  to  reunite  the  two  factions.  (Petkov  himself  was 
officially  rehabilitated  by  the  National  Assembly  in  1990.)  In  its 
new  incarnation,  the  Petkov  branch  advocated  complete  govern- 
ment decentralization,  extensive  support  for  agricultural  privati- 
zation and  investment,  punishment  of  the  communists  and 
"official"  agrarians  for  crimes  against  the  Petkov  branch,  and  a 
general  return  to  the  populist  ideas  of  Stamboliiski  (see  Stamboliiski 
and  Agrarian  Reform,  ch.  1).  Together  with  the  BSDP,  the  Petkov 
BANU  was  the  largest  (110,000  members  in  1991)  and  most  ac- 
tive constituent  of  the  UDF. 

The  Monarchist  Movement 

Simeon  II,  exiled  son  of  Tsar  Boris  III,  was  54  years  old  in  1991 , 
healthy,  and  popular  with  many  Bulgarians.  In  the  difficult  reform 
years,  he  was  the  center  of  a  small  but  significant  movement  that 
saw  restoration  of  the  monarchy  as  a  solution  to  the  dilemmas  of 
governing  society.  Simeon  encouraged  the  movement  by  agree- 
ing to  return  if  his  people  wished  a  restoration.  Newly  available 
publications  on  the  history  of  the  Bulgarian  monarchy,  especially 
Boris  III,  had  evoked  considerable  public  interest  by  1991.  A 
referendum  on  monarchy-versus-republic  was  scheduled  for  July 
1991,  then  cancelled  by  the  National  Assembly  because  of  its 


208 


Government  and  Politics 


potentially  divisive  impact  and  because  of  strong  opposition  from 
the  BSP  and  most  UDF  factions.  The  new  constitution's  descrip- 
tion of  Bulgaria  as  a  republic  ended  official  consideration  of  resto- 
ration in  1991,  but  Simeon's  personal  popularity  preserved 
monarchism  as  a  political  option  for  many  disillusioned  Bulgari- 
ans in  the  early  1990s. 

The  Public  and  Political  Decision  Making 

In  the  post-Zhivkov  era,  extreme  diversification  of  political  or- 
ganizations and  activities  paralleled  a  similar  liberation  in  the  media 
and  the  arts.  Under  Zhivkov,  Bulgaria  had  followed  the  totalitarian 
formula  for  media  control,  allowing  only  official  radio  and  tele- 
vision stations  and  newspapers  that  were  conduits  for  the  official 
party  line  on  all  subjects.  Limited  artistic  freedom  came  in  several 
"thaw"  periods  (notably  in  the  mid-1960s  and  the  late  1970s)  that 
closely  followed  similar  relaxation  in  the  Soviet  Union.  The  cha- 
risma of  Liudmila  Zhivkova,  appointed  by  her  father  to  oversee 
cultural  affairs  in  1975,  notably  lightened  the  Bulgarian  cultural 
scene  from  the  late  1970s  through  1981.  The  early  1980s  was  a 
time  of  unprecedented  freedom  for  media  discussion  of  contro- 
versial topics;  the  Law  on  Plebiscites  (1983)  was  to  have  pro- 
moted discussion  of  preselected  issues  of  public  interest,  but  by  1984 
party  reactionaries  had  reasserted  control.  The  1984  Bulgarian 
Writers'  Conference  called  for  more  ideological  content  in  litera- 
ture, signaling  a  change  that  lasted  through  the  end  of  the  Zhiv- 
kov regime. 

The  Intelligentsia 

Intellectual  groups  developed  no  formal  organizations  comparable 
to  groups  in  other  East  European  countries  because  the  small  in- 
tellectual community  centered  in  one  city  (Sofia)  required  no  such 
measures.  Furthermore,  the  Bulgarian  Writers'  Union  already  con- 
tained a  large  percentage  of  the  intelligentsia.  Especially  during 
the  "thaw"  periods,  factions  in  the  union  showed  substantial  diver- 
sity in  their  approach  to  the  role  of  art  versus  that  of  the  state.  A 
much  smaller  Bulgarian  Artist's  Union  and  Bulgarian  Journalists' 
Union  had  similar  status.  A  samizdat  (underground  publication) 
network  did  circulate  dissident  writings  from  the  Soviet  Union  and 
elsewhere.  Among  official  publications,  Narodna  kultura  (People's 
Culture)  gained  a  singular  reputation  between  1984  and  1988  by 
publishing  provocative  articles  on  politics,  economics,  education, 
and  the  environment.  In  1988  Zhivkov  fired  its  editor  Stefan  Prodev 
for  helping  found  a  dissident  organization.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Zhivkov  and  the  Intelligentsia 

Until  the  late  1980s,  Zhivkov  successfully  prevented  unrest  in 
the  Bulgarian  intellectual  community.  Membership  in  the  writers' 
union  brought  enormous  privilege  and  social  stature,  and  that  drew 
many  dissident  writers  such  as  Georgi  Dzhagarov  and  Liubomir 
Levchev  into  the  circle  of  the  officially  approved  intelligentsia.  On 
the  other  hand,  entry  required  intellectual  compromise,  and  refusal 
to  compromise  led  to  dismissal  from  the  union  and  loss  of  all 
privileges.  The  punishment  of  dissident  writers  sometimes  went 
far  beyond  loss  of  privileges.  In  1978  emigre  writer  Georgi  Markov 
was  murdered  in  London  for  his  anticommunist  broadcasts  for  the 
British  Broadcasting  Corporation,  and  Blaga  Dimitrova  was  harshly 
denounced  for  her  critical  portrayal  of  party  officials  in  her  1982 
novel  Litse. 

Zhivkov  also  softened  organized  opposition  by  restoring  sym- 
bols of  the  Bulgarian  cultural  past  that  had  been  cast  aside  in  the 
postwar  campaign  to  consolidate  Soviet- style  party  control.  Begin- 
ning in  1967,  he  appealed  loudly  to  the  people  to  remember  "our 
motherland  Bulgaria."  In  the  late  1970s,  Zhivkov  mended  rela- 
tions with  the  Bulgarian  Orthodox  Church,  and  in  1981  Liudmila 
Zhivkova's  national  celebration  of  Bulgaria's  1,300th  anniversary 
raised  patriotic  feeling.  Zhivkov' s  extensive  campaign  of  cultural 
restoration  provided  at  least  some  common  ground  between  him 
and  the  Bulgarian  intelligentsia. 

The  Ferment  of  1988-90 

In  late  1987,  dissatisfaction  with  government  corruption,  pollu- 
tion, the  Turkish  issue,  and  repeated  failure  of  economic  reform 
programs  began  to  stimulate  open  political  dissent.  By  that  time, 
a  younger  generation  had  matured,  unimpressed  by  communist 
doctrine  and  disinclined  to  blind  obedience.  In  November  1987, 
the  Federation  of  Clubs  for  Glasnost  and  Democracy  (originally 
the  Discussion  Club  for  Support  of  Glasnost  and  Perestroika)  was 
founded  by  communist  intellectuals  to  promote  openness  in  Bul- 
garian society.  In  early  1988,  the  appearance  of  the  Independent 
Association  for  Defense  of  Human  Rights  in  Bulgaria  publicized 
the  repression  of  the  regime.  Meanwhile,  the  fragmented  intellec- 
tual community  had  been  galvanized  by  a  single  issue:  environ- 
mental degradation.  In  the  winter  of  1987-88,  an  ecological 
exhibition  in  Ruse,  one  of  the  most  seriously  polluted  industrial 
centers  in  Bulgaria,  received  national  media  attention.  The  com- 
munist regime's  failure  to  protect  its  people  from  such  dangers 
became  a  symbol  for  the  general  aura  of  incompetence  that 
surrounded  Zhivkov  in  the  late  1980s. 


210 


Government  and  Politics 


In  mid- 1988  Zhivkov  responded  to  the  new  opposition  by  purg- 
ing two  high  pro-glasnost  party  officials,  signaling  that  the  party 
would  permit  glasnost  only  on  its  own  terms.  The  BCP  also  tried 
to  preempt  environmental  opposition  by  forming  the  Movement 
for  Environmental  Protection  and  Restoration  amid  promises  for 
stiffer  environmental  regulation. 

In  late  1988  and  early  1989,  many  leaders  of  independent  Bul- 
garian groups  were  deported  or  harrassed.  Nevertheless,  by 
mid- 1989  at  least  thirteen  independent  associations  and  commit- 
tees had  been  founded  for  the  defense  of  human  rights  and  the  en- 
vironment. Then  in  1989,  communism  was  discredited  by  successful 
freedom  movements  in  Hungary,  Poland,  East  Germany,  and 
Czechoslovakia.  By  that  time,  glasnost  had  stimulated  political  di- 
alog in  the  Soviet  Union,  which  was  still  the  model  for  Bulgarian 
political  behavior.  Under  these  new  conditions,  government  in- 
timidation failed.  Although  Zhivkov  sought  reconciliation  with  the 
intelligentsia  by  proclaiming  a  "new  cultural  revolution"  in  early 
1989,  the  unions  of  writers,  journalists,  and  artists  leveled  strong 
criticism  on  the  environment  and  other  issues.  When  Ekoglasnost 
was  formed  that  year,  it  made  a  formidable  public  appeal  for  an 
accounting  of  economic  policies  that  harmed  the  environment  (see 
Other  Political  Organizations,  this  ch.). 

In  1989  the  Federation  of  Clubs  backed  the  National  Assembly 
petition  against  Turkish  assimilation  by  characterizing  the  policy 
as  against  the  best  traditions  of  the  Bulgarian  nation.  According 
to  one  theory,  the  Zhivkov  policy  toward  the  Turks  was  calculated 
to  alienate  the  intelligentsia  from  the  ethnocentric  Bulgarian  major- 
ity by  forcing  the  former  to  take  sides  with  the  Turks;  whatever 
its  purpose,  the  policy  failed  amid  the  massive  Turkish  exodus  of 
1989.  Leaders  of  the  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  deported 
for  defending  the  Turks,  were  welcomed  at  a  session  of  the  CSCE, 
severely  damaging  Zhivkov' s  image  in  Europe.  In  the  fall  of  1989, 
dissident  groups  received  further  validation  at  the  CSCE  Conference 
on  the  Environment  in  Sofia,  where  they  held  public  meetings  and 
were  received  by  Western  delegates.  The  mass  demonstrations  that 
followed  convinced  the  BCP  that  the  Zhivkov  regime  could  not 
survive . 

Dramatic  expression  of  public  discontent  continued  after  the 
Zhivkov  ouster.  In  mid- 1990  tent-city  demonstrations  in  Sofia  con- 
tinued for  several  weeks,  encountering  no  effective  official  resistance. 
Patterned  after  peaceful  antigovernment  protests  of  the  1960s  in 
the  West,  the  Sofia  campsite  of  over  100  tents  near  the  BSP  head- 
quarters building  began  as  a  protest  against  communist  reten- 
tion of  power  in  the  national  elections  of  June  1990.  The  protest 


211 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

eventually  included  demonstrators  of  many  political  viewpoints. 
Besides  election  fraud  by  the  BSP,  issues  targeted  were  the  Cher- 
nobyl' coverup,  corruption  among  former  and  present  BCP/BSP 
officials,  Bulgaria's  role  in  the  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia,  and  past 
actions  of  present  government  officials  such  as  Lukanov  and  In- 
terior Minister  Atanas  Semerdzhiev.  The  tent  city  played  an  impor- 
tant role  in  publicizing  reform  issues  as  a  new  national  government 
was  being  formed. 

The  Media  and  Public  Issues 

In  the  wake  of  Zhivkov's  overthrow,  fast-spreading  pluralism 
in  the  media  and  intellectual  circles  brought  a  din  of  conflicting 
opinion  to  the  public.  In  1987  Bulgaria  had  seventeen  daily 
newspapers,  most  of  which  were  local.  By  1991  eight  national 
newspapers  were  publishing,  and  an  expanding  variety  of  local  and 
weekly  papers  was  available.  Until  1990  the  chief  daily  newspaper 
was  Rabotnichesko  delo,  the  official  organ  of  the  BCP.  After  the  fall 
of  Zhivkov,  the  daily  was  renamed  Duma;  in  its  new  format,  it  began 
to  feature  more  balanced  accounts  of  national  problems,  reflect- 
ing the  moderate  image  now  cultivated  by  its  sponsoring  organi- 
zation. The  fragmentation  of  politics  in  1990  brought  a  newspaper 
boom  that  included  a  full  spectrum  of  political  views.  In  1991  the 
leading  papers  by  circulation  were  Duma,  Demokratsiya  (an  indepen- 
dent), the  trade  union  daily  Trud,  and  Zemia,  aimed  primarily  at 
rural  readers.  The  most  popular  weeklies  were  Sturshel,  featuring 
folk  humor,  and  the  long- running  Pogled.  The  weekly  168  Chasa 
went  furthest  in  rejecting  traditional  Bulgarian  journalism  in  favor 
of  sophisticated  parody  and  Western-style  in-depth  features. 

Universities  dropped  their  required  study  of  Marxist-Leninist 
ideology,  and  student  organizations  emerged  immediately  to  as- 
sert positions  on  a  wide  variety  of  issues  (see  Youth  Organizations, 
this  ch.).  In  numerous  national  polls,  the  public  expressed  dissatis- 
faction with  government  leaders,  economic  policies  (as  both  too 
radical  and  too  conservative),  and  the  BSP.  Vestiges  of  the  tradi- 
tional gap  between  city  and  village  remained,  however:  on  the  aver- 
age, rural  Bulgarians  expressed  less  support  for  market  reform  and 
noncommunist  leaders,  placed  less  blame  on  the  communists  for 
current  problems,  and  opposed  complete  rights  for  the  Turkish 
minority  more  strongly. 

In  1990-91  the  media  featured  major  exposes  on  malfeasance 
by  the  Zhivkov  regime  (acknowledged  by  the  present  BSP  under 
public  pressure),  coverups  of  radiation  exposure  from  the  Kozloduy 
Nuclear  Power  Plant  and  the  Chernobyl'  disaster  in  the  Soviet

Union,  and  the  murder  of  Georgi  Markov  (a  full-scale  investiga- 
tion of  which  opened  in  1990).  In  mid- 1991  Bulgaria  opened  its 
archives  to  an  international  commission  investigating  the  1981  as- 
sassination attempt  on  Pope  John  Paul  II.  In  spite  of  those  develop- 
ments, in  1991  government  agencies  and  individuals  still  threatened 
independent  publications  with  court  action  for  "treasonous"  state- 
ments. In  a  1991  poll  by  the  independent  168  Chasa,  46  percent 
of  respondents  expressed  the  belief  that  a  campaign  had  been  or- 
ganized to  control  the  Bulgarian  media  (the  BSP  and  party  offi- 
cials were  most  often  named  responsible),  and  37  percent  said  that 
freedom  of  the  press  was  not  in  danger  in  Bulgaria. 

The  Permanent  Commission  for  Human  Rights  and  the  National 
Problem  was  created  in  1990  as  an  advisory  and  investigatory 
agency  of  the  National  Assembly.  Composed  of  thirty-nine  mem- 
bers of  parliament,  the  commission  received  the  nominal  assign- 
ment of  investigating  past  and  present  human  rights  violations  in 
Bulgaria,  recommending  appropriate  compensation,  and  drafting 
new  human  rights  legislation.  Among  the  issues  addressed  in  the 
commission's  first  year  were  restoration  of  government-confiscated 
property  to  churches  and  Turkish  citizens;  verifying  complaints 
of  unfair  sentencing  and  inhumane  prison  conditions;  proposing 


213 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

laws  to  replace  restrictive  legislation  such  as  the  Law  on  Religious 
Beliefs  and  the  Law  on  Passports;  and  erecting  legal  barriers  against 
state  persecution  for  political  reasons  (see  Religion,  ch.  2).  In  Janu- 
ary 1991,  commission  chairman  Svetoslav  Shivarov  reported  that 
all  political  prisoners  in  Bulgaria  had  been  freed. 

The  Turkish  Problem 

As  in  other  parts  of  Eastern  Europe,  the  repeal  of  single-party 
rule  in  Bulgaria  exposed  the  long-standing  grievances  of  an  ethnic 
minority.  Especially  in  the  1980s,  the  Zhivkov  regime  had  syste- 
matically persecuted  the  Turkish  population,  which  at  one  time 
numbered  1.5  million  and  was  estimated  at  1.25  million  in  1991. 
Mosques  were  closed,  Turks  were  forced  to  Slavicize  their  names, 
education  in  the  native  language  was  denied,  and  police  brutality 
was  used  to  discourage  resistance  (see  Turks,  ch.  2).  The  urban 
intelligentsia  that  partcipated  in  the  1990  reform  movement  pushed 
the  post-Zhivkov  governments  toward  restoring  constitutionally 
guaranteed  human  rights  to  the  Turks.  But  abrogation  of  Zhiv- 
kov's  assimilation  program  soon  after  his  fall  brought  massive  pro- 
tests by  ethnic  Bulgarians,  even  in  Sofia. 

In  January  1990,  the  Social  Council  of  Citizens,  a  national  body 
representing  all  political  and  ethnic  groups,  reached  a  compromise 
that  guaranteed  the  Turks  freedom  of  religion,  choice  of  names, 
and  unimpeded  practice  of  cultural  traditions  and  use  of  Turkish 
within  the  community.  In  turn,  the  Bulgarian  nationalists  were 
promised  that  Bulgarian  would  remain  the  official  language  and 
that  no  movement  for  autonomy  or  separatism  would  be  tolerated. 
Especially  in  areas  where  Turks  outnumbered  Bulgarians,  the  lat- 
ter feared  progressive  "Islamification"  or  even  invasion  and  an- 
nexation by  Turkey — a  fear  that  had  been  fed  consciously  by  the 
Zhivkov  assimilation  campaign  and  was  revived  by  the  BSP  in  1991 . 
Because  radical  elements  of  the  Turkish  population  did  advocate 
separatism,  however,  the  nonannexation  provision  of  the  com- 
promise was  vital. 

The  Bulgarian  governments  that  followed  Zhivkov  tried  to  realize 
the  conditions  of  the  compromise  as  quickly  as  possible.  In  the  multi- 
party election  of  1990,  the  Turks  won  representation  in  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  by  twenty-three  candidates  of  the  predominantly 
Turkish  MRF  (see  The  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  this 
ch.).  At  that  point,  ethnic  Bulgarians,  many  remaining  from  the 
Zhivkov  regime,  still  held  nearly  all  top  jobs  in  government  and 
industry,  even  in  predominantly  Turkish  Kurdzhali  Province. 
Nevertheless,  parts  of  Bulgarian  society  felt  threatened  by  the  rise 
of  the  MRF.  In  1990  that  faction  collided  with  a  hard-line  Bulgarian 


214 


Government  and  Politics 


group,  the  National  Committee  for  Defense  of  National  Interests — 
an  organization  containing  many  former  communists  instrumen- 
tal in  the  Zhivkov  assimilation  program.  In  November  1990,  Bul- 
garian nationalists  established  the  Razgrad  Bulgarian  Republic  in 
a  heavily  Turkish  region  to  protest  the  government's  program  of 
restoring  rights  to  the  Turks.  In  the  first  half  of  1991,  intermittent 
violence  and  demonstrations  were  directed  at  both  Turks  and  Bul- 
garians in  Razgrad. 

These  conditions  forced  the  government  to  find  a  balance  be- 
tween Turkish  demands  and  demonstrations  for  full  recognition 
of  their  culture  and  language,  and  Bulgarian  nationalist  complaints 
against  preferential  treatment  for  the  ethnic  minority.  In  1991  the 
most  important  issue  of  the  controversy  was  restoring  Turkish- 
language  teaching  in  the  schools  of  Turkish  ethnic  districts  (see  Edu- 
cation, ch.  2).  In  1991  the  Popov  government  took  initial  steps  in 
this  direction,  but  long  delays  brought  massive  Turkish  protests, 
especially  in  Kurdzhali.  In  mid- 1991  continuing  strikes  and  pro- 
tests on  both  sides  of  the  issue  had  brought  no  new  discussions  of 
compromise.  Frustration  with  unmet  promises  encouraged  Tur- 
kish separatists  in  both  Bulgaria  and  Turkey,  which  in  turn  fueled 
the  ethnocentric  fears  of  the  Bulgarian  majority — and  the  entire 
issue  diverted  valuable  energy  from  the  national  reform  effort. 
Although  most  political  parties  supported  full  minority  rights,  in 
1991  the  strength  of  Bulgarian  nationalist  sentiment,  deeply  rooted 
in  centuries  of  conflict  with  the  Ottoman  Empire  and  not  inclined 
to  compromise,  promised  to  make  the  Turkish  question  the  most 
pressing  human  rights  issue  in  Bulgaria  for  the  foreseeable  future. 

Foreign  Policy 

From  World  War  II  until  1989,  Bulgarian  foreign  policy  revolved 
around  the  Soviet  Union.  Without  exception  Sofia  imitated  or  sup- 
ported Soviet  twists  and  turns  such  as  Khrushchev's  denunciation 
of  Stalin  in  1956  and  the  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  in  1968.  Sub- 
stantial historical  and  economic  ties  supplemented  the  ideological 
foundation  of  the  relationship.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  Bulgaria 
improved  its  diplomatic  relations  with  nations  outside  the  Soviet 
sphere.  But  in  1989,  domestic  and  international  events  jolted  Bul- 
garia from  forty  years  of  uniformity  and  forced  it  to  consider  for 
the  first  time  major  diversification  of  its  foreign  policy,  abandon- 
ing its  paramount  reliance  on  the  Soviet  Union.  This  meant  a 
lengthy  period  of  reevaluation,  during  which  general  goals  were 
agreed  upon  but  specific  policy  was  hotly  debated. 

In  1991  Foreign  Affairs  Minister  Viktor  Vulkov  listed  several 
general  goals  of  his  ministry:  the  integration  of  Bulgaria  as  fully 


215 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

as  possible  into  the  unified  European  Community  to  facilitate  de- 
velopment of  a  market  economy  and  Western  political  institutions; 
improving  relations  with  all  Bulgaria's  Balkan  neighbors  and  the 
countries  of  the  Black  Sea  region,  with  emphasis  on  mutual  ter- 
ritorial integrity  and  sovereignty;  active  participation  in  the  United 
Nations  and  other  international  organizations  able  to  guarantee 
the  security  of  small  states;  and  maintaining  as  much  as  possible 
of  Bulgaria's  unique  relationship  with  the  Soviet  Union  while  draw- 
ing much  closer  to  the  United  States.  Once  the  economic  advan- 
tages of  membership  in  the  Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance 
(Comecon — see  Glossary)  disappeared  in  1990  and  instability  be- 
came chronic  in  the  Soviet  Union,  other  sources  of  economic  and 
geopolitical  security  became  the  primary  quest  in  Bulgaria's  prag- 
matic search  for  foreign  partners  (see  Bulgaria  in  Comecon,  ch.  3). 
In  1990  indications  of  the  new  pragmatism  were  recognition  of  the 
Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  and  Israel  and  an  official  invita- 
tion for  the  pope  to  visit  Bulgaria. 

The  Foreign  Policy  Establishment 

Major  changes  were  made  in  the  organizations  conducting  Bul- 
garian foreign  affairs  after  the  ouster  of  Zhivkov.  Post-Zhivkov 
governments  ended  the  practice  of  selecting  members  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Internal  Affairs  for  diplomatic  positions  in  which  they  gathered 
intelligence  and  carried  out  subversive  activities  abroad  (see  Security 
and  Intelligence  Services,  ch.  5).  Admitting  that  the  Bulgarian  in- 
telligence presence  abroad  had  been  extensive  under  Zhivkov,  the 
Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  declared  in  mid- 1991  that  henceforth 
only  a  single,  identified  intelligence  officer  would  remain  in  each 
Western  embassy.  In  a  sharp  streamlining  of  the  diplomatic  corps, 
200  of  Bulgaria's  544  foreign  diplomats  were  called  home  in  1990 
and  1991,  and  20  of  its  79  foreign  missions  were  closed,  mostly 
in  Third  World  countries  (relations  with  those  countries  continued, 
however). 

Under  the  communist  Lukanov  government  of  1990,  President 
Zheliu  Zhelev  assumed  major  responsibilities  as  head  of  state  in 
talks  with  foreign  leaders;  his  nonpartisan  political  position  at  home 
and  his  direct  approach  to  foreign  and  economic  issues  gained 
Zhelev  respect  as  a  spokesman  in  Bulgaria  and  abroad,  as  well  as 
large-scale  commitments  of  aid  from  several  Western  sources  (see 
Domestic  and  International  Economic  Policies  in  the  1990s,  ch.  3). 
When  Popov  formed  his  government  in  1991 ,  Vulkov  (leader  of  the 
BANU)  replaced  a  former  Zhivkovite  intelligence  official  as  minister 
of  foreign  affairs,  supplementing  Zhelev' s  efforts  and  improving 
the  world  image  of  Bulgaria's  official  foreign  policy  agency.

Government  and  Politics 


Relations  with  Balkan  Neighbors 

Although  the  Zhivkov  regime  often  advocated  closer  relations 
and  multilateral  cooperation  with  Yugoslavia,  Turkey,  Greece, 
Albania,  and  Romania,  a  number  of  traditional  issues  barred  sig- 
nificant improvement  until  the  late  1980s.  Bulgarian  proposals  to 
make  the  Balkans  a  zone  free  of  chemical  and  nuclear  weapons, 
or  a  "zone  of  peace  and  understanding"  (advanced  by  Zhivkov 
at  the  behest  of  the  Soviet  Union,  to  eliminate  weapons  of  the  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary)  from  the 
region)  was  vetoed  on  several  occasions.  But  in  1990,  Zhelev  was 
able  to  remove  some  of  the  suspicion  that  had  barred  rapproche- 
ment by  the  Zhivkov  regime.  Post-Zhivkov  regimes  sought  closer 
relations  with  both  Greece  and  Turkey,  partly  in  the  hope  that 
NATO  would  grant  Bulgaria  membership  to  form  a  bridge  between 
its  two  mutually  hostile  members. 

Yugoslavia 

Bulgarian  relations  with  Yugoslavia  were  conditioned  by  old 
issues  of  Balkan  politics  and  by  strong  domestic  political  forces  at 
work  in  both  countries.  Throughout  the  1980s,  the  Yugoslav  media 
complained  loudly  that  Bulgaria  mistreated  its  Macedonian  citizens 
by  insisting  that  Macedonians  were  ethnically  Bulgarians,  mak- 
ing separate  ethnic  recognition  inappropriate.  The  Zhivkov  regime 
(and  its  successors),  fearing  that  inflamed  nationalism  in  Yugo- 
slavia would  intensify  demands  for  Macedonian  autonomy  across 
the  border  in  Bulgaria,  largely  ignored  the  Yugoslav  propaganda 
campaign  on  the  Macedonian  issue.  The  dispute  over  Macedonia 
survived  and  prospered  after  communism  lost  its  grip  on  both  coun- 
tries. Bulgarian  nationalists,  stronger  after  Zhivkov,  held  that  the 
Slavic  population  of  the  Republic  of  Macedonia  was  ethnically 
Bulgarian,  a  claim  leading  naturally  to  assertion  of  a  Greater  Bul- 
garia. To  defuse  nationalist  fervor  on  both  sides,  and  in  keeping 
with  the  policy  of  improved  relations  with  all  neighbors,  Zhelev 
officially  advocated  nonintervention  in  the  ethnic  affairs  of  other 
nations. 

The  nonintervention  strategy  assumed  greater  importance  when 
the  Republic  of  Macedonia  sought  independence  from  the  Yugo- 
slav federation  in  1991  in  an  effort  to  escape  the  increasing  domi- 
nance of  the  Republic  of  Serbia  in  the  federation.  That  effort 
reinforced  the  protective  attitude  of  Macedonian  nationalists  in  Bul- 
garia toward  Yugoslav  Macedonia,  which  had  been  part  of  Serbia 
in  the  interwar  period.  Serbia's  use  of  force  to  prevent  the  breakup 


217 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  Yugoslav  federation  in  1991  triggered  Bulgarian  fears  of  wider 
destabilization  in  the  Balkans  if  Serbian  expansionism  were  fully 
revived. 

In  1991  Bulgarian  policy  toward  Yugoslavia  was  complicated 
by  the  rejuvenation  of  Macedonian  national  groups  in  Bulgaria. 
The  largest  of  these  was  the  Union  of  Macedonian  Societies,  a  long- 
standing cultural  and  educational  society  that  in  1990  took  the  prefix 
IMRO  (Internal  Macedonian  Revolutionary  Organization),  which 
was  the  name  of  the  terrorist  organization  active  in  Bulgaria, 
Greece,  and  Serbia  between  1893  and  1935  (see  The  Macedonian 
Issue,  ch.  1).  But  the  threat  posed  by  such  groups  remained  small 
because  the  focus  of  Bulgarian  nationalism  was  the  Turkish  issue 
in  1991,  and  because  economic  reform  was  the  major  concern  of 
all  factions.  In  spite  of  claims  by  the  Serbian  press  that  Bulgaria 
was  aiding  Croatia  in  the  civil  war  of  1991  and  that  Bulgaria  owed 
Serbia  reparations  from  World  War  II,  Bulgaria  followed  Zhelev's 
policy  of  nonintervention  as  the  Yugoslav  civil  war  continued. 

Romania 

In  the  early  1980s,  Bulgarian  relations  with  Romania  featured 
regular  official  visits  by  Zhivkov  and  Romanian  President  Nico- 
lae  Ceau§escu  and  diplomatic  avoidance  of  differing  approaches 
to  internal  control  (Romania  being  the  more  totalitarian)  and  the 
Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary)  (Bulgaria  being  the  more  loyal  mem- 
ber). At  that  point,  both  countries  concentrated  on  more  pressing 
foreign  issues,  and  both  advocated  creating  a  Balkan  nuclear-free 
zone.  But  during  the  1980s,  relations  were  strained  by  the  indepen- 
dent foreign  policy  of  Romania,  its  opposition  to  perestroika  in  the 
late  1980s,  and  mutual  accusations  of  environmental  pollution  af- 
fecting the  other  country.  Deteriorating  personal  relations  between 
Zhivkov  and  the  maverick  Ceau§escu  also  may  have  contributed 
to  the  decline.  But,  in  the  name  of  Warsaw  Pact  solidarity,  the 
Zhivkov  regime  subdued  criticism  of  chemical  pollution  from 
Romanian  plants  across  the  Danube,  and  it  remained  neutral  in 
the  Hungarian-Romanian  dispute  over  Romanian  treatment  of  eth- 
nic Hungarians  in  that  country  in  the  late  1980s.  After  the  emer- 
gence of  the  environment  as  a  political  issue  in  1989,  however, 
accusations  became  more  harsh  on  both  sides.  In  1991  joint  com- 
missions attempted  to  reach  a  compromise  on  the  environmental 
issue  and  restore  the  pragmatic,  relatively  amicable  relationship 
of  the  postwar  years. 

Greece 

Bulgarian  relations  with  Greece,  a  traditional  enemy,  were  sta- 
ble throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  in  spite  of  major  government 


218 


Government  and  Politics 


changes  in  both  countries.  Zhivkov  made  this  stability  a  model  for 
the  overall  Balkan  cooperation  that  was  a  centerpiece  of  his  for- 
eign policy  in  the  1980s.  In  1986  the  two  countries  signed  a  decla- 
ration of  good-neighborliness,  friendship,  and  cooperation  that  was 
based  on  mutual  enmity  toward  Turkey  and  toward  Yugoslav  de- 
mands for  recognition  of  Macedonian  minorities  in  Bulgaria  and 
Greece.  An  important  motivation  for  friendship  with  Greece  was 
to  exploit  NATO's  Greek-Turkish  split,  which  was  based  on  the 
claims  of  the  two  countries  in  Cyprus.  In  early  1989,  Bulgaria  signed 
a  ten-year  bilateral  economic  agreement  with  Greece. 

The  main  historical  issue  between  Bulgaria  and  Greece,  dispo- 
sition of  their  Macedonian  minorities,  was  settled  during  the  1970s; 
after  that  time,  the  parties  adopted  mutual  policies  of  strict  non- 
interference in  internal  affairs.  In  mid- 1991  the  possibility  of  in- 
dependence for  Yugoslav  Macedonia  threatened  to  renew  tension 
in  that  area.  Post-Zhivkov  Bulgarian  policy  toward  Greece  remained 
very  conciliatory,  however;  in  1991  Zhelev  stressed  cooperation 
with  Greece  as  a  foundation  for  Balkan  stability  and  reassured  the 
Greeks  that  Bulgarian  rapprochement  with  Turkey  did  not  threaten 
this  relationship. 

Turkey 

In  spite  of  intermittent  rapprochement,  Turkey  was  hostile  to 
Bulgaria  through  most  of  the  1980s  because  of  Zhivkov' s  mistreat- 
ment of  Bulgarian  Turks  and  the  economic  hardship  caused  in  Tur- 
key by  mass  immigration  of  Turks  from  Bulgaria  in  1989.  The  last 
rapprochement,  a  protocol  of  friendship  in  early  1988,  was  signed 
by  Bulgaria  to  defuse  international  criticism  of  its  ethnic  policy. 
That  agreement  dissolved  rapidly  in  1988,  when  Turkey  saw  no 
change  in  Bulgarian  ethnic  assimilation;  by  1989  Turkey  was  vow- 
ing to  defend  the  Turkish  minority,  while  Bulgaria  claimed  that 
its  "Turks"  were  all  Bulgarians  converted  to  Islam  under  the 
Ottoman  Empire  (see  The  Turkish  Problem,  this  ch.). 

The  ouster  of  Zhivkov  and  subsequent  Bulgarian  commitment 
to  repatriate  deported  Turks  and  grant  them  full  human  rights 
brought  a  marked  change  in  Turkish  policy.  Despite  delays  and 
complaints  from  the  Bulgarian  Turks,  Turkey  remained  patient 
and  positive  toward  all  signs  of  progress.  The  former  dissident 
Zhelev,  long  a  vocal  critic  of  assimilation,  became  president  and 
met  with  Turkish  President  Turgut  Ozal  in  September  1990.  That 
meeting  began  a  series  of  high-level  economic  talks  in  1990-91  that 
yielded  Turkish  loans  and  technical  assistance  to  Bulgaria  and 
promised  to  bolster  bilateral  trade,  which  had  shrunk  by  80  to  90 


219

percent  in  the  mid-1980s.  A  new  treaty  of  friendship  and  coopera- 
tion was  prepared  in  the  summer  of  1991. 

Despite  the  thaw,  obstacles  remained  in  Bulgarian-Turkish  rap- 
prochement. The  ill  will  caused  by  Zhivkov's  shrill  anti-Turkish 
propaganda  remained  fresh  in  the  early  1990s.  Strident  anti-Muslim 
and  anti-Turkish  statements  in  the  media  by  Bulgarian  nationalist 
factions  kept  tension  high,  and  minor  border  incidents  continued 
in  1991.  And  Bulgarian  friendship  with  Greece  created  a  precari- 
ous balancing  act  that  required  caution  toward  such  moves  as  the 
Bulgarian-Turkish  nonagression  pact  proposed  by  Turkey  in  late 
1990. 

The  Soviet  Union 

In  the  post-Zhivkov  era,  the  most  controversial  foreign  policy 
problem  was  defining  Bulgaria's  new  relationship  with  its  traditional 
protector  and  best  trading  partner,  the  Soviet  Union.  Although 
Zhivkov's  relations  with  Gorbachev  had  not  been  as  warm  as  those 
with  earlier  Soviet  leaders,  Bulgaria  remained  strongly  dependent 
on  the  Soviet  Union  economically  even  in  the  years  immediately 
following  Zhivkov's  ouster  (permission  for  which  Bulgarian  Polit- 
buro members  duly  sought  and  received  from  Moscow).  In  mid- 
1992  the  1967  Treaty  for  Cooperation,  Security,  and  Friendship 
with  the  Soviet  Union  was  to  expire. 

Because  the  treaty  called  for  notice  of  abrogation  to  be  given 
a  year  in  advance,  by  mid- 1991  Bulgarian  national  opinion  was 
divided  over  what  terms  should  be  included  in  the  National  As- 
sembly's draft  of  a  new  treaty.  Led  by  the  BSP,  one  body  of  Bul- 
garian opinion  advocated  essentially  renewing  the  existing  treaty, 
giving  the  Soviet  Union  top  priority  in  the  new  foreign  policy  to 
ensure  continued  supply  of  fuels  and  other  vital  materials.  A  sec- 
ond body  of  opinion,  led  by  the  UDF  and  Podkrepa,  conceded  the 
pragmatic  necessity  of  continued  economic  relations  but  urged  that 
a  new  treaty  eliminate  all  subordination  of  Bulgarian  to  Soviet  in- 
terests and  provide  complete  flexibility  for  Bulgaria  to  establish  com- 
mercial and  diplomatic  ties  with  the  West.  Amid  heated  public 
debate,  the  Popov  government  reached  agreement  with  the  Soviet 
Union  on  a  short-term  abrogation  followed  by  accelerated  joint  de- 
velopment of  a  new  treaty  reflecting  the  changed  positions  of  both 
sides.  The  Bulgarian  National  Assembly  was  expected  to  pass  a 
bill  to  that  effect  in  August  1991  (see  Foreign  Trade,  ch.  3;  see 
Foreign  Military  Relations,  ch.  5). 

Because  the  two  countries  had  no  disputed  territory  and  were 
on  roughly  parallel  paths  of  political  reform  in  1991,  major  issues 
between  them  were  mostly  economic.  The  primary  Bulgarian 


220 


Government  and  Politics 


concern  was  to  protect  its  newborn  geopolitical  independence  from 
any  recurrence  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  mentality  in  Moscow.  Other 
critical  goals  in  1991  were  stabilizing  the  unpredictable  supply  of 
Soviet  oil,  protecting  large  numbers  of  Bulgarian  guest  workers 
threatened  with  layoff  in  the  Komi  Autonomous  Soviet  Socialist 
Republic  (Komi  ASSR),  and  reestablishing  Soviet  markets  for  Bul- 
garian goods  that  had  shrunk  drastically  in  1990.  A  new  bilateral 
defense  agreement  also  was  a  priority  in  the  wake  of  Warsaw  Pact 
disestablishment.  In  July  1991,  Bulgaria  set  a  precedent  by  sign- 
ing a  trade  agreement  with  the  Byelorussian  Republic,  the  first  inter- 
governmental pact  made  directly  with  one  of  the  Soviet  republics. 

Western  Europe  and  the  United  States 

Under  Zhivkov,  Bulgaria's  policy  toward  Western  Europe  and 
the  United  States  was  determined  largely  by  the  position  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  Events  such  as  the  invasions  of  Czechoslovakia  and 
Afghanistan  automatically  distanced  Bulgaria  from  the  West;  then, 
in  the  early  1980s  Soviet  efforts  to  split  NATO  by  cultivating 
Western  Europe  brought  Bulgaria  closer  to  France  and  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany) — a  position  that  con- 
tinued through  the  1980s.  A  1988  application  for  membership  in 
the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT — see  Glos- 
sary) was  refused  because  of  the  Turkish  assimilation  program,  after 
widespread  expectations  of  success. 

Decades  of  complete  isolation  from  the  West  left  traces  on  Bul- 
garian policy  even  in  the  1980s.  In  early  1989,  President  Francois 
Mitterrand  of  France  was  the  first  Western  head  of  state  to  visit 
Bulgaria  since  before  World  War  II.  Between  1945  and  1989,  the 
highest  visiting  United  States  official  was  an  assistant  secretary  of 
state.  And  in  1985  Sir  Jeffrey  Howe  became  the  first  British  for- 
eign secretary  to  visit  Bulgaria  since  the  nineteenth  century — an 
indication  that  isolation  began  before  the  onset  of  communism. 

The  first  post-Zhivkov  regime  recognized  quite  early,  however, 
that  Cold  War  politics  no  longer  could  limit  Bulgaria's  choice  of 
economic  or  diplomatic  partners.  Within  a  few  months  of  the  Zhiv- 
kov ouster,  the  National  Assembly  Committee  on  Foreign  Policy 
had  received  the  head  of  the  Council  of  Europe  and  received  a 
pledge  of  closer  ties,  and  Bulgarian  diplomats  and  businessmen 
had  described  reform  goals,  priorities,  and  investment  opportuni- 
ties to  a  CSCE  Conference  on  Economic  Cooperation.  Shortly 
thereafter  Prime  Minister  Lukanov  visited  the  headquarters  of  the 
European  Economic  Community  (EEC — see  Glossary)  in  Brus- 
sels. Lukanov  signed  a  treaty  on  trade  and  economic  cooperation 
to  remove  all  trade  barriers  by  1 995  and  guarantee  Bulgarian  access 


221 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

to  EEC  markets.  Lukanov  also  gained  substantial  support  for  Bul- 
garian membership  in  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — 
see  Glossary),  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  De- 
velopment, and  GATT. 

A  critical  stage  in  the  new  policy  was  Zhelev's  meeting  with 
Western  leaders  in  Europe  and  the  United  States  in  the  fall  of  1 990 . 
Zhelev  explained  Bulgaria's  nonaligned  position  and  its  needs  to 
United  States  President  George  H.W.  Bush  and  to  Mitterrand, 
receiving  substantial  pledges  of  aid  from  both  leaders.  Traditional 
trading  partner  Austria  also  pledged  substantial  new  investment 
in  the  Bulgarian  economy  during  Zhelev's  tour  of  the  West. 

Bulgaria's  new  policy  toward  the  West  was  reflected  in  a  series 
of  decisions  taken  in  1990.  Diplomatic  relations  were  restored  with 
South  Korea  and  Israel,  Western  allies  in  sensitive  areas  of  Cold 
War  confrontation.  An  official  invitation  for  Pope  John  Paul  II 
to  visit  Bulgaria  constituted  a  new  level  of  recognition  of  that  reli- 
gious leader's  authority.  And  in  early  1991,  Bulgaria  sent  token 
noncombat  forces  in  support  of  the  United  States-led  Persian  Gulf 
War  effort.  In  1991  Zhelev's  cooperation  with  an  international  in- 
vestigation of  the  Markov  murder  was  another  significant  gesture 
to  the  Western  world. 

From  the  beginning,  the  success  of  Bulgaria's  intense  campaign 
for  closer  relations  with  the  West  depended  on  continued  progress 
in  economic  and  human  rights  reform  and  was  measured  in  eco- 
nomic terms.  As  the  stature  of  the  Soviet  Union  dwindled  steadily 
in  1991,  the  hope  of  gaining  full  status  in  the  European  commu- 
nity was  a  powerful  weapon  for  reformers  within  Bulgaria.  Given 
Bulgaria's  strategic  position  and  chronic  instability  elsewhere  in 
the  Balkans,  Western  nations  monitored  Bulgaria  carefully  and  re- 
warded its  progressive  steps.  Nonetheless,  in  1991  Bulgaria  re- 
mained far  behind  Hungary,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Poland  in 
receiving  Western  aid.

Chapter  5.  National  Security 


Thracian  warrior  in  Roman  mural,  Serditsa 


IN  1991  BULGARIA  GRAPPLED  with  political  changes  and  eco- 
nomic difficulties  that  threatened  its  national  security.  The  coun- 
try's most  intractable  problems  were  internal  crises  rather  than 
external  threats.  The  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary),  which  had  guided 
national  security  policy  since  1955,  became  defunct  as  a  military 
organization  on  April  1,  1991.  A  concurrent  shift  from  one-party 
communist  rule  to  multiparty  politics  made  the  future  political 
character  and  role  of  the  Bulgarian  People's  Army  (BPA)  uncer- 
tain. Grave  economic  problems  also  portended  that  a  smaller 
proportion  of  national  resources  would  be  devoted  to  defense  in 
the  future.  The  European  strategic  environment  seemed  less  tense 
and  threatening  than  at  any  time  in  the  recent  past,  largely  be- 
cause of  the  waning  of  the  Cold  War;  however,  the  more  imme- 
diate situation  in  the  Balkans  appeared  less  secure  in  1991. 
Neighboring  countries  Yugoslavia  and  Greece  were  apprehensive 
that  Bulgarians  might  renew  their  interest  in  the  Greater  Bulgaria 
established  briefly  under  the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  in  1878. 

The  Bulgarian  military  establishment  was  substantial  and  well 
equipped  considering  the  small  size  and  population  of  the  coun- 
try. One  expert  observer  described  it  aptly  as  a  regional  force  of 
significance.  The  data  exchanged  at  the  signing  of  the  Treaty  on 
Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  (CFE — see  Glossary)  on 
November  19,  1990,  revealed  previously  unknown  details  on  the 
command  organization,  structure,  strength,  and  disposition  of  Bul- 
garia's ground  and  air  forces.  The  BPA  appeared  to  be  a  relatively 
cohesive  force  without  serious  ethnic  or  other  internal  fragmenta- 
tion. Despite  the  end  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  a  continued  military 
relationship  with  the  Soviet  Union  was  expected,  based  on  genuine 
affinity  and  mutual  interest  between  the  two  countries.  In  the  late 
1980s,  Bulgaria  imitated  several  major  military  reforms  then  being 
introduced  in  the  Soviet  Armed  Forces,  which  long  had  served  as 
the  model  for  developing  Bulgaria's  armed  forces.  The  BPA  in- 
stituted unilateral  force  reductions,  restructuring,  defense  indus- 
try conversion,  and  a  new  openness  in  military  affairs  that  imitated 
Soviet  glasnost  (see  Glossary). 

In  1991  Bulgaria's  uncertain  internal  security  situation  reflected 
the  unsettled  state  of  politics  and  the  economy.  Increased  political 
freedom,  economic  hardship,  and  the  inability  or  reluctance  of  the 
governments  that  followed  the  regime  of  Todor  Zhivkov  (1962-89) 
to  use  force  or  coercion  against  the  population  created  the  potential 


227 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

for  domestic  unrest.  These  factors  made  possible  increased  reli- 
ance on  the  internal  security  apparatus,  and  ultimately  the  BP  A, 
to  maintain  order  and  even  to  carry  out  basic  government  func- 
tions. In  the  immediate  post-Zhivkov  years,  the  army  was  the  pivo- 
tal institution  protecting  legitimate  national  security  interests  and 
territorial  integrity  during  the  transition  to  democracy  and  the  rule 
of  law. 

Development  of  the  Armed  Forces 

The  ancestors  of  the  modern  Bulgarians  established  a  respecta- 
ble martial  tradition  during  centuries  of  combat  with  the  Byzan- 
tine and  Ottoman  empires.  After  Russian  armies  freed  it  from 
Ottoman  control  in  the  late  nineteenth  century,  Bulgaria  became 
an  independent  military  force  in  the  Balkans.  Bulgaria's  neighbors 
viewed  it  as  the  major  regional  power  with  outstanding  territorial 
ambitions;  for  that  reason,  they  joined  forces  to  offset  Bulgarian 
military  power  before  1914.  Bulgaria  participated  actively  in  combat 
operations  as  a  German  ally  in  World  War  I.  Although  again  al- 
lied with  Germany  in  World  War  II,  Bulgaria  did  not  join  in  Ger- 
man offensive  operations.  After  World  War  II,  Bulgaria  came  under 
Soviet  military  influence  and  in  1955  joined  the  Soviet-led  War- 
saw Pact  (see  World  War  II,  ch.  1).  In  that  capacity,  Bulgaria  be- 
came an  integral  part  of  Soviet  military  and  political  policy  toward 
the  southern  flank  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 
(NATO — see  Glossary).  Although  the  end  of  superpower  confron- 
tation in  Europe  had  loosened  the  bilateral  military  connection  to 
the  Soviet  Union  by  1991,  extensive  military  ties  remained. 

Early  Development 

For  several  centuries  after  they  migrated  to  the  Balkans  in  the 
middle  of  the  seventh  century  A.D. ,  the  Bulgars  were  the  primary 
rivals  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  for  control  of  the  eastern  Balkans. 
In  the  seventh  and  eighth  centuries,  Bulgar  kings  established  an 
independent  empire  that  inflicted  several  defeats  on  the  Byzantines 
in  Macedonia  and  Thrace.  King  Terbelis  defeated  the  Byzantine 
army  at  the  Battle  of  Anchialus  in  708,  drove  through  Thrace  to 
the  walls  of  Constantinople,  and  besieged  the  Byzantine  capital  in 
712.  In  717,  however,  Terbelis  allied  with  the  Byzantine  Emperor 
Leo  III  against  the  Arabs.  Terbelis  led  the  Bulgar  army  into  Thrace, 
won  the  Battle  of  Adrianople  in  718,  and  defended  Constanti- 
nople against  a  Muslim  siege  from  across  the  Bosporus.  Emperor 
Constantine  V  reasserted  Byzantine  control  over  the  Bulgars  in  the 
mid-  to  late  eighth  century.  King  Kardan  regained  the  initiative 


228

by  the  end  of  the  century  and  forced  Byzantium  to  pay  tribute  to 
the  Bulgars. 

The  power  of  the  First  Bulgarian  Empire  waxed  during  the  ninth 
and  early  tenth  centuries.  The  Bulgars  continued  their  struggle  with 
Byzantium  and  encountered  new  foes  as  well.  They  fought  the 
Magyars  and  Pechenegs,  who  raided  them  from  north  of  the 
Danube  River  (see  fig.  2).  Beginning  in  808,  Tsar  Krum  fought 
a  successful  war  against  the  Byzantines,  winning  the  Battle  of 
Versinikia  in  813,  capturing  Adrianople,  and  advancing  to  the  walls 
of  Constantinople.  However,  Krum's  son  was  defeated  at  the  Battle 
of  Mesembria  in  817.  Tsar  Simeon  fought  successful  wars  against 
the  Byzantines  in  the  late  ninth  and  early  tenth  centuries,  captur- 
ing Thessaly,  Macedonia,  and  Albania  from  the  Byzantines,  con- 
quering Serbia,  and  threatening  Constantinople  itself. 

Between  967  and  969,  the  Byzantines  and  Russians  invaded  and 
annexed  Bulgaria.  Samuil,  an  expatriate  noble,  then  regained  con- 
trol of  eastern  Bulgaria  and  Serbia  by  defeating  the  Byzantines  near 
Sofia  in  981.  Throughout  the  late  tenth  and  early  eleventh  centu- 
ries, he  fought  the  Byzantines  in  Macedonia  and  Thrace.  In  1014, 
however,  the  Byzantines  crushed  the  Bulgarian  army  and  re- 
occupied  Bulgaria. 

Bulgaria  became  a  vassal  state  of  the  Byzantine  Empire  as  well 
as  a  march  route  and  battleground  for  advancing  Mongols,  Turks, 
Serbs,  Magyars,  and  European  crusaders  beginning  in  the  twelfth 
century.  The  Bulgarians  fought  alongside  the  Serbs  in  the  unsuc- 
cessful Battle  of  Kosovo  Polje  in  1389 — a  defeat  that  began  nearly 
five  centuries  of  Ottoman  domination  during  which  tsarist  Russia 
represented  the  only  hope  for  liberation. 

From  the  Struggle  for  National  Independence  to  World  War  I 

Uprisings  against  Ottoman  control  in  1875  and  1876  began  mili- 
tary action  that  finally  brought  Bulgaria  conditional  independence 
in  1878.  Bulgaria  was  a  major  battleground  in  the  Russo-Turkish 
War  of  1877-78.  Russia  fought  the  war  as  the  champion  of  Slavs 
living  under  the  Ottoman  Empire  in  the  Balkans.  Under  the  Treaty 
of  San  Stefano,  signed  March  3,  1878,  Bulgaria  became  an  au- 
tonomous state  under  Russian  protection.  The  same  year,  the  Eu- 
ropean powers  forced  Bulgaria  to  sign  the  Treaty  of  Berlin, 
returning  substantial  territory  to  the  Ottoman  Empire  in  the  name 
of  regional  balance.  Bulgaria  retained  its  autonomy,  however. 

Conflict  with  Balkan  neighbors  began  when  the  new  nation 
sparked  a  brief  war  with  Serbia  in  1885  over  control  of  the  province 
of  Eastern  Rumelia.  Seeking  compensation  for  Bulgaria's  annexa- 
tion, Serbia  invaded  the  province  and  was  defeated  by  Prince 


229 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


Alexander,  modern  Bulgaria's  first  ruler.  After  inconclusive  fight- 
ing, Bulgaria  and  Serbia  agreed  to  the  Treaty  of  Bucharest,  which 
restored  prewar  borders  in  1886. 

During  the  twentieth  century,  persistent  territorial  disputes  and 
dissatisfaction  with  borders  determined  Bulgaria's  position  in  four 
wars.  In  1912  Bulgaria  entered  the  Balkan  League,  a  military 
alliance  with  Serbia  and  Greece,  to  eliminate  the  last  vestiges  of 
Turkish  rule  in  the  Balkans  and  to  expand  its  own  territory  in  the 
process.  Fielding  approximately  180,000  troops,  Bulgaria  provided 
the  bulk  of  the  military  personnel  for  operations  against  Turkish 
forces  in  the  First  Balkan  War.  Bulgarian  armies  besieged  Con- 
stantinople in  November  1912,  but  they  were  driven  back  tem- 
porarily by  the  Turks.  When  the  key  city  of  Adrianople  fell  to 
Bulgarian  and  Serbian  forces  in  March  1913,  Turkey  capitulated. 
It  surrendered  its  European  possessions  under  the  Treaty  of  Lon- 
don in  May  1913. 

A  dispute  over  the  spoils  of  the  First  Balkan  War  led  directly 
to  the  Second  Balkan  War.  Bulgaria  asserted  that  Serbia  occupied 
more  of  Macedonia  and  Thessaloniki  than  it  was  allowed  by  the 
prewar  agreement.  In  June  1913,  Bulgarian  armies  attacked  Ser- 
bian forces  in  Macedonia  and  another  army  advanced  into  Thes- 
saloniki. After  checking  this  offensive,  Serbian  and  Greek  forces 
pushed  the  Bulgarians  back  into  Bulgaria  in  July.  Romania  then 
declared  war  on  Bulgaria  and  advanced  unopposed  toward  Sofia, 
while  Turkey  capitalized  on  the  situation  to  retake  Andrianople. 
Bulgaria  sued  for  peace  and  lost  territory  in  Macedonia,  Thrace, 
and  Southern  Dobruja  to  Greece,  Serbia,  and  Romania,  respec- 
tively, in  the  Treaty  of  Bucharest  (August  1913). 

Bulgaria's  rivalry  with  Serbia  and  Greece  defined  its  participa- 
tion in  World  War  I .  Bulgaria  avoided  involvement  in  the  war  until 
1915  when  it  mobilized  1.2  million  soldiers  and  joined  the  Central 
Powers  in  attacking  Serbia.  Bulgaria  took  this  action  in  the  expec- 
tation that  a  victory  by  the  Central  Powers  would  restore  Greater 
Bulgaria.  In  October  1915,  two  of  Bulgaria's  armies  drove  west 
into  Serbia  while  allied  Austro-Hungarian  and  German  armies 
drove  south.  Bulgarian  forces  blocked  British  and  French  troops 
in  Thessaloniki  from  linking  with  Serbian  forces. 

In  mid-1916  over  250,000  British,  French,  and  Serbian  troops 
prepared  for  an  offensive  from  Thessaloniki  northwest  along  the 
Vardar  River.  Although  the  Germans  and  Bulgarians  preempted 
the  offensive  and  drove  this  force  beyond  the  Struma  River  by  late 
August,  the  war  then  settled  into  a  long,  costly  stalemate  along 
the  Vardar.  Seriously  weakened  by  a  poor  military  supply  system 
and  widespread  unrest  among  the  soldiers,  Bulgaria  collapsed  and 


230 


National  Security 


surrendered  in  1918.  The  country  suffered  greatly  during  the  war. 
Mobilization  disrupted  food  production,  and  German  requisitioning 
of  grain  and  other  foodstuffs  taxed  stored  food  supplies.  About 
100,000  Bulgarian  soldiers  were  killed  in  combat,  and  275,000  non- 
combatants  died  as  a  direct  result  of  the  war  (see  World  War  I, 
ch.  1). 

The  Interwar  Years  and  World  War  II 

The  harsh  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Neuilly-sur-Seine  (November 
1919)  limited  the  postwar  Bulgarian  army  to  20,000,  and  con- 
scription was  forbidden.  Many  embittered  former  officers  became 
politically  active  in  the  Military  League,  a  formidable  and  well- 
organized  opposition  faction  in  the  1920s  and  1930s.  Irredentism 
made  Bulgaria  a  natural  ally  of  Germany  during  the  interwar  years. 
After  border  skirmishes  with  Bulgaria  in  1925  and  1931,  Greece 
joined  Romania,  Yugoslavia,  and  Turkey  in  forming  the  Balkan 
Entente  in  1934  to  contain  perceived  Bulgarian  expansionism.  Bul- 
garia began  to  rearm  in  1936  with  German,  British,  and  French 
assistance.  Meanwhile,  the  Military  League  had  been  influential 
in  staging  coups  in  the  early  1930s.  In  1936,  however,  Tsar  Boris 
III  (1918-43)  dismantled  the  organization,  stripping  the  military 
of  the  political  influence  it  had  accumulated  after  World  War  I. 

After  several  years  of  hesitating  between  alignment  with  Ger- 
many or  the  Soviet  Union,  Bulgaria  finally  sought  to  satisfy  ter- 
ritorial claims  to  the  south  and  west  by  signing  the  Tripartite  Pact 
with  the  Axis  powers  in  March  1941.  But  Bulgaria  minimized  its 
involvement  in  the  war,  managing  to  satisfy  the  terms  of  alliance 
with  Germany  without  a  declaration  of  war  on  the  Soviet  Union. 

In  spite  of  its  passive  policy,  Bulgaria  was  a  vital  pivot  for  Ger- 
man operations  in  the  Balkans,  North  Africa,  and  on  the  eastern 
front  against  the  Soviet  Union.  Germany  launched  invasions  of 
Greece  and  Yugoslavia  from  Bulgaria  in  April  1941 ,  and  Bulgaria 
occupied  parts  of  the  territory  it  expected  to  retain  after  the  war. 
German  forces  used  the  country  as  a  rear  area  for  transporting 
troops  and  supplies  and  providing  training,  and  as  a  rest  and  recre- 
ation point.  Its  railroads  and  ports  were  critical  to  the  German  war 
effort.  More  than  fifty  German  ships  and  submarines  were  berthed 
in  the  harbor  at  Varna  as  late  as  the  summer  of  1944. 

The  Bulgarian  Communist  Party  (BCP)  dominated  the  anti- 
German  partisan  movement  that  arose  in  1941 .  Although  the  move- 
ment had  a  central  military  commission  to  direct  armed  activities, 
the  partisans  generally  were  poorly  organized  and  armed.  Their 
total  number  never  exceeded  18,000  and,  unlike  partisans  else- 
where, they  were  more  active  in  the  cities  than  in  the  countryside. 


231 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  partisans  received  arms  and  supplies  from  the  Soviet  Union 
and  Britain.  The  most  successful  aspect  of  partisan  activity  was 
pro-Soviet  propaganda,  demonstrations,  terrorism,  and  sabotage 
against  installations  in  Bulgaria  critical  to  the  German  war  effort. 
Among  assassination  attempts  against  German  officials  and  Bul- 
garian fascists,  the  assassination  of  Minister  of  War  Khristo  Lukov 
in  1943  had  the  greatest  impact.  Harsh  recriminations  discouraged 
such  activities,  however.  In  1943  the  partisans  formed  the  first  fight- 
ing units  of  the  People's  Revolutionary  Army  of  Liberation 
(PRAL),  which  eventually  included  brigade-sized  units.  Still,  their 
armed  attacks  on  German  forces  generally  ended  in  failure.  As  late 
as  1944,  entire  units  were  captured  or  killed  in  action. 

The  Soviet  Union  declared  war  on  Bulgaria  on  September  5, 
1944,  as  the  Red  Army  forces  of  the  Third  Ukrainian  Front  under 
General  Fedor  Tolbukhin  crossed  its  northern  border  from  Roma- 
nia. Bulgaria  changed  sides  on  September  8  and  declared  war  on 
Germany.  Tolbukhin  took  command  of  the  Bulgarian  forces  and 
reorganized  them.  By  September  17,  a  Bulgarian  army  of  200,000 
troops  was  mobilized  and  attached  to  the  Third  Ukrainian  Front 
fighting  German  forces  in  Macedonia  and  Serbia.  At  the  end  of 
World  War  II,  Bulgaria  again  returned  the  Greek  and  Yugoslav 
territory  that  it  had  occupied  in  1941. 

Postwar  Development 

The  Red  Army  met  little  hostility  during  its  occupation  of  Bul- 
garia from  1944  to  1947.  At  the  time  of  invasion,  the  Soviet  Union 
did  not  regard  Bulgaria  as  an  enemy  state,  because  Bulgaria  had 
not  declared  war  or  participated  actively  in  the  German  eastern 
front.  According  to  the  Yalta  agreements  of  1945,  the  Allied  Con- 
trol Commission  for  Bulgaria,  assigned  to  administer  the  country 
until  a  peace  treaty  was  signed,  was  essentially  an  extension  of  the 
Red  Army  military  administration.  Under  pressure  from  Britain, 
the  preponderant  interest  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  Bulgaria  was  recog- 
nized by  giving  it  75  percent  control  of  the  commission. 

The  Soviet  Union  immediately  reorganized  the  Bulgarian  Army 
to  ensure  that  the  BCP  would  have  a  leading  role.  More  than  40 
generals  and  800  officers  discredited  by  their  association  with  the 
German  Army  were  purged  or  resigned  when  Bulgaria  switched 
sides  in  the  war.  Although  former  Minister  of  War  Damian  Vel- 
chev  returned  to  his  post  in  the  Fatherland  Front  coalition  govern- 
ment, the  BCP  used  the  presence  of  Soviet  occupation  forces  to 
push  the  old  officer  corps  out  of  domestic  politics.  In  July  1946, 
control  of  the  army  shifted  from  the  Ministry  of  War  to  the  full 
cabinet,  2,000  allegedly  reactionary  officers  were  purged,  and 


232 


National  Security 


Velchev  resigned  in  protest.  The  combination  of  events  provided 
an  opening  for  the  BCP  to  establish  full  control  over  the  military. 
It  conducted  a  decisive  purge  in  October  1947.  Accusing  the  re- 
maining noncommunist  senior  officers  of  plotting  to  overthrow  the 
Fatherland  Front,  the  BCP  dismissed  one-third  of  the  officer  corps. 
After  1949  the  BCP  dominated  the  army,  and  party  membership 
was  obligatory  for  officers  on  active  duty. 

In  the  first  postwar  years,  Bulgaria  closely  followed  the  exam- 
ple of  Soviet  military  development  and  served  Soviet  interests  in 
the  Balkans.  BCP  leader  Georgi  Dimitrov  exhorted  Bulgarian 
officers  to  learn  from  the  experience,  strategy,  and  military  art  of 
the  Soviet  Union.  He  wanted  the  BP  A  to  be  exactly  like  the  Soviet 
armed  forces,  with  common  missions,  organization,  weapons  and 
equipment,  and  military  science. 

In  1946  Bulgaria  participated  in  the  initial  conflict  of  the  Cold 
War  by  aiding  communist  forces  in  the  Greek  civil  war.  Bulgar- 
ian support,  including  operating  bases  on  Bulgarian  territory,  made 
possible  communist  victories  near  the  border.  As  a  result,  Greece 
charged  Bulgaria  with  numerous  violations  of  its  northern  border. 
In  1947  the  United  Nations  (UN)  confirmed  the  Greek  charges 
and  later  officially  condemned  Bulgaria  for  aiding  communist  guer- 
rilla forces. 

In  the  late  1940s,  the  Bulgarian  armed  forces  were  composed 
almost  entirely  of  former  partisans,  peasants,  and  workers.  Ap- 
proximately 75  percent  were  members  of  the  BCP  or  the  Com- 
munist Youth  League  of  Bulgaria  (Komsomol).  Many  peasants  and 
workers  were  attracted  to  the  military  by  upward  mobility  and  pay 
that  was  higher  than  in  factories  or  farms.  The  armed  forces  were 
officially  named  the  Bulgarian  People's  Army  (BP A)  in  1952.  Bul- 
garia joined  the  Warsaw  Pact  on  May  14,  1955,  and  contributed 
a  token  battalion  to  the  Soviet-led  invasion  of  Czechoslovakia  on 
August  20,  1968.  Bulgaria  initiated  a  major  military  moderniza- 
tion program  in  the  1980s,  adding  its  first  T-72  tanks,  MiG-23 
fighters,  Su-25  fighter-bombers,  Mi-24  attack  helicopters,  and  130 
surface-to-surface  missiles  to  its  inventory.  During  that  period,  the 
education  level  and  technical  competence  of  the  officer  corps  rose; 
by  1985  nearly  85  percent  had  received  at  least  a  secondary  edu- 
cation (see  Education,  ch.  2). 

National  Defense  Posture 

In  1991  the  Warsaw  Pact  disbanded  as  a  military  alliance.  Bul- 
garian commitment  to  the  Soviet-led  alliance  accordingly  ceased 
to  be  the  main  direction  of  its  national  defense.  The  disintegration 
of  the  Warsaw  Pact  presaged  a  major  shift  in  threat  perception, 


233 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

military  doctrine,  and  strategy.  Historical,  geographic,  and  eco- 
nomic factors  promised  to  assume  greater  importance  in  shaping 
Bulgaria's  approach  to  national  defense.  Traditional  allies  and  ad- 
versaries such  as  Germany  and  Turkey  now  exerted  critical  in- 
fluence on  decisions  about  military  requirements,  doctrine,  and 
strategy.  The  country's  geopolitical  position  in  the  volatile  Balkans 
at  the  crossroads  of  Europe  and  Asia  was  another  important  de- 
terminant. Economic  considerations  limited  the  development  and 
retention  of  military  capabilities.  In  the  early  1990s,  Bulgarian  offi- 
cials began  to  stress  guaranteeing  national  security  through  politi- 
cal agreements  with  neighboring  countries  rather  than  military 
force. 

Threat  Perception 

Bulgaria  was  the  only  Warsaw  Pact  country  without  a  frontier 
with  the  Soviet  Union.  Of  the  nearly  1 ,900  kilometers  of  land  bor- 
ders, 520  were  with  Romania,  500  with  Yugoslavia,  480  with 
Greece,  and  380  with  Turkey.  With  the  general  exception  of  Roma- 
nia, Bulgaria  had  had  serious  past  conflicts  with  each  of  these  coun- 
tries. Bulgaria  and  neighboring  NATO  members  Greece  and 
Turkey  had  historical  disputes  that  long  predated  the  establishment 
of  their  respective  rival  alliances  after  World  War  II.  However, 
unlike  its  former  Warsaw  Pact  allies  in  Europe,  Bulgaria's  tradi- 
tional enemies  were  NATO  members  or  nonaligned  nations.  Re- 
lations with  Greece  had  been  friendly  since  1980,  based  primarily 
on  a  shared  antipathy  toward  Turkey.  In  1986  Bulgaria  and  Greece 
signed  a  joint  declaration  of  friendship  and  cooperation. 

The  issue  of  Macedonia  was  a  source  of  potential  conflict  be- 
tween Bulgaria  and  its  neighbors.  In  1991  the  prospect  of  civil  war 
in  Yugoslavia  raised  concern  that  Bulgaria  could  reclaim  Macedonia 
as  a  step  toward  reestablishing  the  Greater  Bulgaria  prescribed  in 
the  Treaty  of  San  Stefano  (see  San  Stefano,  Berlin,  and  Indepen- 
dence, ch.  1).  Bulgaria's  Macedonian  border  had  been  tense  since 
the  Second  Balkan  War;  in  1989  the  ouster  of  Zhivkov  escalated 
the  risk  that  Macedonia  would  set  off  political  or  military  conflict 
with  all  of  Yugoslavia  or  with  its  neighboring  Republic  of  Serbia. 
Bulgarian  spokesmen  denied  having  territorial  ambitions  against 
Yugoslav  Macedonia,  but  they  added  ambiguity  by  referring  to 
it  as  an  open  issue.  Unlike  the  Yugoslavs,  the  Bulgarians  did  not 
recognize  Macedonians  as  an  ethnic  group  distinct  from  Bulgarians. 

Proximity  to  NATO  members  Greece  and  Turkey,  both  with 
strong  armed  forces  and  significant  military  potential,  was  Bulgar- 
ia's primary  strategic  concern  in  the  post-Warsaw  Pact  era.  The 
plan  for  the  development  of  the  BPA  was  measured  against  the 


234 


National  Security 


military  programs  of  those  two  neighbors.  The  BP  A  leadership 
openly  rated  both  their  armies  as  superior  to  its  own  forces,  stress- 
ing that  Turkey  boasted  military  manpower  second  only  to  the 
United  States  among  NATO  countries  and  a  population  of  over 
100  million.  In  the  view  of  the  Bulgarian  military  establishment, 
the  size  of  the  Turkish  armed  forces  was  the  primary  standard  for 
determining  appropriate  reductions  in  BPA  forces,  as  well  as  in 
strategic  defense  planning.  Despite  the  relative  lack  of  tension  in 
bilateral  relations  with  Turkey  and  an  apparent  absence  of  hostile 
intentions  on  its  part  in  1990,  the  treatment  of  ethnic  Turks  in  Bul- 
garia remained  an  irritating  and  potentially  explosive  issue  in 
bilateral  relations.  In  1987  veiled  threats  by  Turkey  to  resolve  the 
issue  by  force  had  caused  alarm  in  Bulgaria.  The  outburst  of  pro- 
Turkish  and  Bulgarian  nationalist  rhetoric  that  followed  the  fall 
of  the  BCP  regime,  which  had  been  willing  to  suppress  ethnic  un- 
rest by  force,  raised  ethnic  tensions  in  a  period  when  central  govern- 
ment control  over  society  had  substantially  decreased  (see  The 
Turkish  Problem,  ch.  4). 

Even  in  decline,  the  Warsaw  Pact  alliance  remained  a  major  fac- 
tor in  Bulgarian  threat  perception  and  military  planning.  Bulgaria 
continued  to  count  on  an  ongoing  close  military  relationship  and 
practical  cooperation  with  the  Soviet  Union  to  balance  perceived 
security  threats.  In  1991  the  Bulgarian  government  conducted 
negotiations  for  a  new  bilateral  treaty  with  the  Soviet  Union  to 
guarantee  it  against  external  aggression.  In  return  Bulgaria  would 
pledge  not  to  join  any  organization,  such  as  NATO,  perceived 
hostile  to  the  Soviet  Union.  Whatever  its  relation  to  the  Soviet 
Union,  by  1991  Bulgaria  was  entering  a  new,  shifting  local  balance 
of  power  similar  to  the  balance  that  existed  in  the  Balkans  before 
World  War  II. 

Doctrine  and  Strategy 

The  assigned  mission  of  the  BPA  under  the  Warsaw  Pact  was 
to  defend  the  southwestern  border  of  the  alliance.  In  practice,  this 
mission  was  considerably  more  oriented  to  offensive  operations  than 
official  pronouncements  implied.  Located  within  what  the  Soviet 
General  Staff  called  the  Southwest  Theater  of  Military  Operations, 
Bulgaria  would  have  confronted  Turkey  in  case  of  a  Warsaw  Pact 
conflict  with  NATO.  As  indicated  by  several  joint  amphibious  land- 
ing exercises  undertaken  with  the  Soviet  Union,  Bulgaria's  prin- 
cipal objectives  would  have  been  to  control  Thrace  and  to  help 
Soviet  forces  seize  and  hold  the  critical  straits  at  the  Bosporus  and 
the  Dardanelles.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  new  geopolitical  climate  of  1991,  military  spokespersons 
emphasized  different  sources  of  military  doctrine,  including  the  con- 
stitution, resolutions  passed  by  the  National  Assembly  (Subranie), 
the  United  Nations  Charter,  international  law,  and  declarations 
of  the  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE — 
see  Glossary).  Military  spokespersons  cited  active  efforts  to  pur- 
sue mutual  security  and  trust  with  Turkey  and  Greece  as  well  as 
good  relations  with  Yugoslavia,  Romania,  and  other  European  na- 
tions. The  military  denied  all  territorial  claims  against  neighbor- 
ing countries  and  stressed  that  participation  in  the  CSCE  process 
indicated  its  respect  for  the  inviolability  of  European  borders.  It 
publicly  rejected  the  threat  or  use  of  force  against  any  country  ex- 
cept in  legitimate  self-defense  of  territorial  integrity,  national  in- 
dependence, and  sovereignty.  Arms  control  was  an  important 
element  of  military  doctrine  before  and  after  the  overthrow  of  Zhiv- 
kov.  Bulgaria  had  long  advocated,  without  success,  the  establish- 
ment of  a  nuclear-free  zone  in  the  Balkans.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the 
Zhivkov  government  arranged  several  unproductive  meetings  of 
the  Balkan  countries  on  nuclear  disarmament.  The  primary  aim 
of  this  effort  was  elimination  of  NATO  nuclear  weapons  in  Tur- 
key. A  signatory  to  the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Treaty  of  1968, 
Bulgaria  regularly  pledged  not  to  possess  or  produce  nuclear 
weapons  or  other  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  In  1990  the  coun- 
try was  embarrassed,  however,  by  the  revelation  that  it  possessed 
eight  Soviet-made  SS-23  missile  launchers  eliminated  from  the 
Soviet  inventory  under  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Elimination 
of  Intermediate-  and  Shorter-Range  Nuclear  Missiles  in  1987. 
Although  acknowledging  receipt  of  SS-23  missiles  and  launchers 
in  1986,  Bulgaria  categorically  denied  having  any  nuclear  capa- 
bility associated  with  them.  It  offered  to  dismantle  the  systems  in 
accordance  with  the  treaty.  Similar  allegations  about  the  presence 
of  intermediate-range  Soviet  SS-20  missile  launchers  in  Bulgaria 
had  appeared  in  the  foreign  press  in  1984  but  were  never  substan- 
tiated. Zhivkov  called  for  a  ban  on  chemical  weapons  in  the  Balkans 
in  1985  at  the  same  time  as  the  United  States  accused  Bulgaria 
of  storing  chemical  weapons  on  its  territory. 

The  Treaty  on  Conventional  Armed  Forces  in  Europe  (CFE) 
was  a  contentious  issue  within  the  Warsaw  Pact  in  1990.  The  treaty 
committed  Bulgaria  to  limiting  its  ground  and  air  forces  to  a  per- 
centage of  the  Warsaw  Pact's  combined  ceiling  of  20,000  tanks, 
30,000  armored  combat  vehicles,  20,000  artillery  pieces,  6,800  com- 
bat aircraft,  and  4,000  attack  helicopters.  However,  the  Warsaw 
Pact  divided  its  overall  ceilings  so  that  the  Soviet  Union  received 
most  of  the  apportionment  and  the  other  former  Warsaw  Pact 


236 


National  Security 


countries  were  limited  to  smaller  quotas.  Bulgaria's  quotas  were 
1,475  tanks,  2,000  armored  combat  vehicles,  1,750  artillery  pieces, 
235  combat  aircraft,  and  67  attack  helicopters.  In  1990  the  minister 
of  national  defense  disclosed  that  the  Warsaw  Pact  debate  over 
weapons  allocation  had  been  acrimonious  because  each  member 
had  tried  to  maximize  its  quota,  hence  its  security,  before  the  alli- 
ance's military  organization  dissolved. 

In  1991  Bulgaria  did  not  have  a  formal  law  on  national  defense, 
and  its  military  doctrine  was  still  largely  defined  by  Warsaw  Pact 
declarations  and  documents.  The  Warsaw  Pact's  Political  Consul- 
tative Committee  had  formally  adopted  a  defense  doctrine  and  the 
principle  of  reasonable  sufficiency  during  its  May  1987  meeting 
in  Berlin.  Closely  following  this  doctrine  and  the  Soviet  example, 
Bulgaria  then  implemented  a  new  national  defensive  doctrine  calling 
for  reasonable  sufficiency.  In  the  inexact  and  halting  process  of 
quantifying  this  term,  military  leaders  basically  agreed  on  the  need 
to  ensure  national  security  at  the  lowest  possible  level  of  armaments. 
But  the  levels  required  to  deter  potential  enemies  or  defend  the 
country  against  them  proved  to  be  more  debatable.  By  1990  some 
clear  steps  had  been  taken  toward  reducing  offensive  weapons 
systems  in  favor  of  defensive  ones  (see  Armed  Services,  this  ch.). 

Like  professional  military  officers  in  other  countries,  the  Bul- 
garian general  staff  viewed  doctrine  less  from  its  political  and  dip- 
lomatic aspect  than  from  its  strictly  technical  military  aspect.  The 
technical  side  of  doctrine  focused  on  planning  for  a  number  of  likely 
military  contingencies  and  scenarios  threatening  national  se- 
curity. Although  Bulgaria's  political  stance  was  based  on  a  lack  of 
enemies,  the  technical  or  worst-case  military  planning  aspect  of 
doctrine  was  dictated  by  the  country's  geopolitical  position,  the 
decline  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  and  the  possibility  of  instability  in  the 
Balkans. 

Defense  Organization 

Like  most  other  national  institutions,  the  defense  establishment 
was  in  the  midst  of  a  major  transition  in  1991.  The  new  political 
course  brought  changes  to  a  military  system  long  based  on  the  Soviet 
model.  Democratic,  multiparty  politics  brought  the  issue  of  depo- 
liticization  in  the  armed  forces  to  the  forefront.  The  state  organi- 
zation for  national  security  and  defense  decision  making,  including 
the  high  command,  retained  its  former  structure.  Major  changes, 
including  unilateral  reductions  and  restructuring  in  accordance  with 
defensive  doctrine,  were  carried  out  in  the  ground,  air  and  air 
defense,  and  naval  forces.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  Military  in  the  Political  System 

In  1991  Bulgaria  was  in  the  midst  of  shifting  from  a  highly  politi- 
cized army  to  a  depoliticized  one.  The  military  had  always  been 
involved  in  domestic  political  struggles.  The  Military  League  ex- 
erted strong  political  influence  through  its  support  for  the  Zveno 
coalition  after  World  War  I  (see  The  Crises  of  the  1930s,  ch.  1). 
In  1934  the  Military  League  took  a  leading  role  in  overthrowing 
the  government,  and  as  recently  as  1965  military  officers  were  in- 
volved in  political  intrigue.  The  reported  1965  coup  attempt  led 
by  General  Ivan  Todorov-Gorunia  was  allegedly  aimed  at  replac- 
ing Zhivkov  and  establishing  a  more  nationalist,  less  pro-Soviet 
leadership  in  the  country.  By  1990  communist  Bulgaria  had  ap- 
parently made  more  progress  in  separating  the  military  from  poli- 
tics than  the  Soviet  Union,  but  perhaps  less  than  other  communist 
countries  of  Eastern  Europe. 

After  World  War  II,  the  BCP  quickly  established  control  over 
the  army.  It  purged  old  officers  and  made  political  loyalty  to  the 
new  regime  a  more  important  criterion  than  professional  compe- 
tence for  the  selection  of  new  officers  (see  Postwar  Development, 
this  ch.).  Political  officers  in  the  ranks  of  the  BPA  ensured  loyalty 
by  extending  the  party  apparatus  throughout  the  military  estab- 
lishment. As  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  other  Soviet-allied  countries, 
party  membership  in  the  officer  corps  exceeded  80  percent. 

Despite  more  than  forty  years  of  efforts  to  ensure  communist 
control  of  the  armed  forces,  the  BPA  took  no  action  when  BCP 
General  Secretary  Todor  Zhivkov  was  ousted  by  party  officials  in 
November  1989.  According  to  many  reports,  the  conspicuous  lack 
of  military  support  for  Zhivkov  dissuaded  his  security  forces  from 
intervening  to  prevent  the  overthrow.  In  the  immediate  post- 
Zhivkov  era,  the  BPA  and  its  leadership  declared  an  intention  to 
be  an  apolitical,  stabilizing  factor  in  the  peaceful  transition  to 
democracy. 

The  shift  to  multiparty  politics  brought  opposition  pressure  to 
depoliticize  the  armed  forces,  in  part  because  all  parties  feared  the 
BPA  could  split  into  partisan  armed  factions  or  become  the  instru- 
ment of  one  party  as  it  had  been  for  the  BCP.  In  the  new  climate 
of  open  political  discourse,  national  security  and  defense  became 
frequent  topics  of  debate  among  political  parties.  The  military 
leadership,  however,  complained  that  some  parties  failed  to  show 
a  sufficiently  responsible  attitude  toward  these  issues. 

In  January  1990,  at  the  direction  of  the  reform  wing  of  the  BCP, 
the  State  Council  repealed  the  section  of  Article  1  of  the  constitu- 
tion that  had  institutionalized  the  exclusive  political  role  of  the  party 


238 


National  Security 


in  the  armed  forces.  The  decree  replaced  BCP  political  organs  in 
the  army  with  educational  work  organs.  The  State  Council  followed 
that  action  with  a  more  specific  decree  ordering  complete  depoliti- 
cization  of  the  armed  forces.  The  Military  Administration  Depart- 
ment of  the  BCP  Central  Committee  and  the  Main  Political 
Administration  of  the  BPA  were  removed  from  the  Ministry  of  Na- 
tional Defense  and  their  functions  curtailed.  The  decree  effectively 
eliminated  control  by  the  BCP  (which  in  early  1990  renamed  itself 
the  Bulgarian  Socialist  Party,  BSP)  over  the  army  by  removing 
cells  of  the  party  and  the  Komsomol  from  the  army.  In  September 
1990,  the  National  Assembly  approved  a  new  law  on  political  par- 
ties. The  law  depoliticized  several  government  institutions,  includ- 
ing the  army,  and  required  them  to  respond  to  the  state  rather  than 
the  ruling  party.  By  the  end  of  the  year,  98  percent  of  all  soldiers 
reportedly  had  relinquished  their  membership  in  political  parties 
in  accordance  with  the  law.  If  they  refused  to  do  so,  they  were  dis- 
charged from  the  service.  In  1991  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
campaigned  for  exclusion  of  active-duty  military  personnel  from 
voting  in  elections. 

Besides  changing  the  legal  framework  for  the  relationship  be- 
tween the  military  and  the  political  system,  the  new  political  course 
in  Bulgaria  brought  practical  changes  in  everyday  army  life.  The 
content  of  military  education  shifted  dramatically  from  emphasiz- 
ing the  defense  of  the  communist  system  to  the  defense  of  the 
homeland  without  regard  to  political  considerations.  Bulgarian 
sources  indicated  that  the  adjective  People's  in  Bulgarian  People's 
Army  now  was  interpreted  to  mean  "national' '  and  not '  'proletar- 
ian." Defense  of  national  independence,  sovereignty,  and  territorial 
integrity  replaced  the  defense  of  socialism  as  the  primary  mission 
of  the  military.  Professional  competence  replaced  political  alle- 
giance and  reliability  as  the  most  important  measure  of  officer 
qualifications.  The  military  post  of  political  officer  was  eliminated 
officially,  although  plans  called  for  retraining  some  political  officers 
for  new  educational  duties  within  the  armed  forces.  The  remainder 
would  have  to  qualify  as  regular  line  officers  or  leave  the  service. 
Nevertheless,  the  Union  of  Democratic  Forces  (UDF)  opposition 
coalition  accused  the  BSP  of  continued  party  recruitment  among 
cadets  and  newly  enlisted  personnel  after  the  State  Council  decree 
on  depoliticization. 

Government  Organization  for  Defense 

Prior  to  November  1989,  the  chairman  of  the  State  Defense  Com- 
mittee was  the  commander  in  chief  of  the  BPA,  and  as  such  made 
every  important  decision  about  internal  and  external  security.  The 


239 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

secretary  general  of  the  BCP  and  president  of  the  State  Council 
automatically  held  the  position  of  chairman  of  the  State  Defense 
Committee  as  well.  The  consolidation  of  these  three  positions  had 
enabled  a  single  person,  Todor  Zhivkov,  to  make  political  deci- 
sions on  security  issues  and  supervise  their  implementation  within 
the  government  apparatus,  especially  as  they  concerned  the  econ- 
omy and  defense  industries. 

In  the  post-Zhivkov  order,  the  commander  in  chief  of  the  armed 
forces  was  the  president  of  the  republic,  a  position  independent 
of  party  affiliation.  In  1990  the  National  Security  Council  was 
formed  as  a  consultative  organ  under  the  president  after  the  State 
Defense  Committee  was  abolished.  The  National  Security  Coun- 
cil advised  the  president  in  making  decisions  on  a  range  of  domes- 
tic and  foreign  policy  issues  related  to  national  security,  including 
defense  preparedness,  organization,  training,  and  deployment  of 
the  armed  forces,  public  order,  and  use  of  the  internal  security 
forces.  The  National  Security  Council  included  the  vice  president; 
the  chairman  of  the  Council  of  Ministers;  the  ministers  of  foreign 
affairs,  national  defense,  internal  affairs,  and  economy  and  plan- 
ning; and  the  chief  of  the  General  Staff.  Decisions  were  imple- 
mented through  the  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Ministry  of  National 
Defense,  and  the  General  Staff. 

The  democratization  of  1990  allowed  the  National  Assembly  to 
participate  in  making  decisions  on  security  issues  rather  than  merely 
rubber-stamping  decisions  made  elsewhere.  In  1990  the  National 
Assembly  established  a  new  legislative  body,  the  Commission  on 
National  Security,  to  provide  oversight  for  government  activities 
in  internal  and  external  security.  The  commission's  role  remained 
largely  undefined  in  1991 ,  but  its  nominal  function  was  to  enforce 
government  compliance  with  the  rule  of  law  in  security  matters 
and  to  protect  the  rights  of  citizens. 

Despite  these  organizational  changes,  the  constitutional  provi- 
sions, most  laws  and  statutes,  and  instructions  and  regulations  per- 
taining to  national  security  and  defense  adopted  by  the  government 
under  the  former  BCP  remained  in  effect.  A  complex  of  laws, 
drafted  for  inclusion  in  the  new  constitution  ratified  by  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  in  1991 ,  were  designed  to  codify  the  many  individ- 
ual changes  made  in  military  practice  and  institutions  after  1989. 

During  and  after  the  ouster  of  Zhivkov,  the  prestige  of  the  mili- 
tary among  the  people  appeared  to  remain  quite  high.  Despite  its 
association  with  the  former  BCP  regime,  the  military  was  cred- 
ited for  remaining  in  the  barracks  during  the  political  transition. 
Although  some  long-serving,  high-ranking  officers  were  removed 
later,  others  remained  and  even  advanced  as  a  result  of  the  ouster. 


240 


National  Security 


Longtime  Minister  of  National  Defense  and  BCP  Politburo  mem- 
ber Army  General  Dobri  Dzhurov  was  dismissed  in  1990  in  the 
aftermath  of  the  democratic  opening.  However,  Colonel  General 
Atanas  Semerdzhiev,  first  deputy  minister  of  defense  and  chief  of 
the  General  Staff  under  Zhivkov,  rose  to  the  post  of  minister  of 
the  interior  in  1990.  The  retention  and  promotion  of  an  officer  like 
Semerdzhiev,  formerly  decorated  and  favored  by  Zhivkov  himself, 
indicated  the  value  placed  on  the  stabilizing  role  of  the  military 
during  this  turbulent  period. 

High  Command 

The  high  command  consisted  of  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
and  the  General  Staff.  The  minister  of  national  defense  was  always 
a  professional  officer  bearing  the  rank  of  army  general  or  colonel 
general.  In  1990,  however,  reformers  called  for  a  civilian  defense 
minister  to  ensure  civilian  control  over  the  armed  forces.  The  mili- 
tary flatly  rejected  such  demands,  insisting  that  the  minister  of  na- 
tional defense  must  be  a  professional  officer  because  civilians  lacked 
the  required  expertise — despite  evidence  of  able  civilian  adminis- 
tration of  defense  ministries  in  other  countries. 

The  Ministry  of  National  Defense  was  responsible  for  implement- 
ing the  decisions  of  the  National  Security  Council  and  the  National 
Assembly  within  the  armed  forces.  The  ministry  recruited,  equipped, 
and  administered  the  armed  forces  according  to  directives  of  the 
executive  and  legislative  branches  of  government.  The  ministry 
linked  the  armed  forces  to  the  national  economy  for  the  purpose 
of  procuring  weapons  and  military  equipment.  The  Ministry  of 
National  Defense  was  organized  according  to  a  Soviet  model.  The 
first  deputy  minister  of  national  defense  was  also  the  chief  of  the 
General  Staff,  responsible  for  planning  and  directing  the  opera- 
tional deployment  of  the  armed  forces  and  coordinating  the  actions 
of  the  three  armed  services  in  peacetime  and  wartime.  The  deputy 
minister's  staff  included  a  first  deputy,  several  deputy  chiefs,  and 
a  disarmament  inspectorate.  All  military  commands  reported  to 
the  General  Staff.  The  country  was  divided  into  three  military  dis- 
tricts. Daily  military  administration,  however,  was  performed  at 
the  level  of  military  regions  corresponding  to  the  eight  provinces 
and  the  city  of  Sofia  (see  Local  Government,  ch.  4).  Besides  two 
communications  brigades  and  the  usual  service  and  support  bat- 
talions, the  General  Staff  controlled  several  other  organizations, 
including  a  military  scientific  research  institute,  military  history 
institute,  military  mapping  and  topography  institutes,  the  Georgi 
Rakovski  Military  Academy,  the  Military  Medical  Academy,  and 
the  military  medical  infrastructure  throughout  the  country.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  commanders  of  the  ground,  air,  and  naval  forces  were 
deputy  ministers  of  national  defense  controlling  separate  service 
commands  within  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense.  The  service 
commands  were  concerned  primarily  with  training  and  maintain- 
ing combat  readiness  in  their  units.  Other  deputy  ministers  of  na- 
tional defense  included  the  chief  of  weapons  and  military  equipment, 
the  chief  of  the  Material-Technical  and  Rear  Support  Command, 
and  the  chief  of  civil  defense.  Other  elements  reporting  to  the 
minister  of  national  defense  included  the  office  of  the  inspector 
general;  the  departments  of  personnel,  military  education,  medi- 
cal services,  international  relations,  military  counterintelligence, 
military  justice  and  procuracy,  cultural  institutions,  and  public  in- 
formation; and  the  radiation  and  chemical  detection  command  post. 
The  International  Relations  Department  maintained  contacts  with 
foreign  military  establishments  and  their  attaches  in  Bulgaria.  The 
Cultural  Institutions  Department  was  responsible  for  several  mili- 
tary museums,  officers'  clubs,  theaters,  cinema  and  art  studios, 
and  the  BPA  performing  ensemble.  The  Public  Information  Depart- 
ment managed  the  press  center,  military  publishing  house,  nine 
military  newspapers  and  journals,  and  television  and  radio  pro- 
grams for  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense. 

In  late  1990,  the  minister  of  national  defense  announced  that 
reductions  in  the  armed  services  would  affect  the  command  ele- 
ments and  administrative  organizations  within  the  Ministry  of  Na- 
tional Defense  in  proportion  to  reductions  in  operational  forces. 
Some  directorates  with  related  functions  reportedly  were  merged, 
but  the  full  extent  of  reductions  in  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
was  not  yet  evident  in  1991. 

Armed  Services 

In  1991  the  three  armed  services  of  the  BPA  were  the  ground, 
air  and  air  defense,  and  naval  forces.  The  ground  forces,  or  army, 
clearly  was  the  most  important  service.  In  addition,  each  service 
had  several  combat  arms  and  support  branches.  Some  support  ser- 
vices, such  as  the  construction  or  civil  defense  troops,  were  not 
subordinate  to  a  particular  armed  service.  In  1991  the  BPA  was 
reducing,  restructuring,  and  modernizing  its  forces.  The  Minis- 
try of  National  Defense  announced  that,  while  the  air  and  air 
defense  and  naval  forces  would  retain  their  basic  structure,  sub- 
stantial changes  in  the  ground  forces  were  expected. 

In  1991  the  military  had  107,000  personnel,  a  reduction  of  more 
than  45,000  since  1988  (see  Military  Personnel,  this  ch.).  More 
than  80  percent  were  conscripts.  In  late  1990,  the  minister  of  na- 
tional defense  had  announced  plans  for  further  reductions  in  1991 ,

brigade,  and  one  air  force  regiment — a  total  of  10,000  personnel, 
200  T-62  tanks,  200  artillery  pieces,  and  20  MiG-21  aircraft.  The 
minister  also  announced  that  over  500  T-34  tanks  held  in  storage 
were  to  be  destroyed.  The  navy  planned  to  decommission  five  older 
combat  ships  in  1991. 

At  the  same  time,  the  minister  of  national  defense  stressed  a  need 
to  restructure  the  BP  A  into  a  more  modern,  professional,  and  bet- 
ter trained  force.  Such  a  force  could  be  smaller  because  the  new 
defensive  doctrine  required  fewer  forces.  Tank  and  mechanized  in- 
fantry units  were  reduced  in  favor  of  more  antitank,  air  defense, 
and  other  defensive  systems.  The  major  problem  for  the  BPA's  fu- 
ture development  was  improving  the  quality  of  armaments  while 
reducing  their  quantity.  However,  the  minister  of  national  defense 
publicly  expressed  concern  that  domestic  industries  could  not  produce 
many  types  of  modern  weapons  that  used  new  technologies.  In  the 
area  of  personnel,  the  minister  announced  plans  to  modernize  mili- 
tary training  programs  by  updating  curricula  at  military  educational 
establishments  and  making  field  training  and  exercises  more  realistic. 

Ground  Forces 

Ground  forces  combat  units  included  motorized  rifle,  tank,

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


artillery  and  missile,  and  antiaircraft  troops,  as  well  as  several  com- 
bat support  branches.  The  ground  forces  numbered  over  70,000 
soldiers,  the  majority  of  whom  were  conscripts.  As  recently  as  1990, 
they  had  consisted  mainly  of  eight  motorized  rifle  divisions  and 
five  tank  brigades.  In  1991  the  active  ground  forces  deployed  four 
motorized  rifle  divisions  and  two  tank  brigades,  with  four  divisions 
and  one  brigade  in  reserve  status.  In  implementing  the  new  defen- 
sive doctrine,  the  ground  forces  further  reduced  tanks  in  the  re- 
maining motorized  rifle  divisions  by  30  percent,  converting  their 
tank  regiments  into  motorized  rifle  regiments.  Defensive  weapons 
in  divisions  were  increased  by  adding  more  antitank,  combat  en- 
gineering, reconnaissance,  and  electronic  warfare  units.  The  at- 
tachment of  several  antiaircraft  elements  to  the  ground  forces 
command  indicated  that  the  command  operated  its  own  air  defense 
network  to  protect  deployed  ground  units.  The  antiaircraft  attach- 
ments included  one  air  defense  command  post,  one  air  defense 
brigade,  several  antiaircraft  maintenance  brigades,  one  radio- 
technical  or  radar  battalion,  and  one  antiaircraft  artillery  test  range. 

In  all,  the  ground  forces  had  over  2,400  tanks,  including  more 
than  300  T-72,  1 ,300  T-55,  and  600  older  T-34  vehicles.  The  more 
than  2,000  armored  combat  vehicles  included  nearly  150  modern 
BMP  armored  fighting  vehicles  and  over  600  BTR-60  and  1,100 
MT-LB  armored  personnel  carriers.  The  ground  forces  operated 
2,500  large-caliber  artillery  systems.  These  included  450  85mm 
D-44  and  100mm  SU-100  and  T-12  antitank  guns;  200  122mm 
BM-21  multiple  rocket  launchers;  over  1,600  122mm  and  152mm 
howitzers  and  guns,  including  nearly  700  self-propelled  2S1,  500 
M-30,  and  smaller  numbers  of  D-20,  M-1937,  and  M-46  towed 
guns;  and  350  mortars,  including  the  self-propelled  120mm  Tun- 
dzha  produced  in  Bulgaria.  The  ground  forces  had  64  launchers 
for  surface-to-surface  missiles.  That  number  included  modern  SS-1 
missiles  and  older,  less  accurate  FROG- 7  missiles  with  respective 
ranges  of  300  and  75  kilometers.  Besides  these  battlefield  missiles, 
eight  longer-range  SS-23  launchers  were  available  (see  Doctrine  and 
Strategy,  this  ch.).  The  Soviet-made  AT- 3  was  the  main  antitank 
guided  missile  in  the  inventory.  Air  defense  for  the  ground  forces 
consisted  of  50  mobile  SA-4,  SA-6,  and  man-portable  SA-13  tac- 
tical surface-to-air  missiles  and  nearly  400  self-propelled  and  towed 
100mm,  85mm,  57mm,  and  23mm  air  defense  guns. 

The  bulk  of  the  ground  forces  were  deployed  along  two  primary 
operational  directions:  the  west-southwest,  opposite  Yugoslavia  and 
Greece,  and  the  southeast,  opposite  Turkey.  Stationed  in  Sofia, 
Plovdiv,  and  southern  Khaskovo  provinces,  the  First  Army  faced 
Yugoslavia  and  Greece  with  more  than  600  tanks,  700  armored 


244 


National  Security 


combat  vehicles,  and  800  large-caliber  artillery  weapons.  The  Third 
Army  was  located  primarily  in  Burgas  and  northern  Khaskovo 
provinces  facing  Turkey  and  had  over  800  tanks,  900  armored  com- 
bat vehicles,  and  700  heavy  artillery  pieces.  The  active  units  of 
the  Second  Army,  a  low-strength  formation  to  be  staffed  by  reserves 
in  wartime,  were  based  in  central  Bulgaria,  in  Plovdiv,  and  northern 
Khaskovo  provinces.  The  Second  Army  was  positioned  to  support 
either  the  First  Army  in  the  west  or  the  Third  Army  in  the  east 
when  fully  mobilized  during  wartime.  Relatively  few  ground  forces 
were  deployed  in  the  north  opposite  Romania  or  in  the  east  along 
the  Black  Sea  coast. 

At  nearly  full  strength,  the  First  and  Third  Armies  had  two  motor- 
ized rifle  divisions  each.  Strategic  reserves  consisted  of  one  indepen- 
dent tank  brigade  and  one  artillery,  antitank,  and  antiaircraft 
regiment  each.  In  1991  the  Third  Army  opposite  Turkey  had  a 
second  independent  tank  brigade  reinforced  with  two  artillery  bat- 
talions. The  tank  brigades  each  had  four  to  six  battalions  and  as 
many  as  200  tanks.  Support  units  included  supply,  maintenance, 
and  artillery-technical  brigades;  communications  and  combat  en- 
gineering regiments;  and  radio  relay  cable,  electronic  warfare, 
reconnaissance,  artillery-reconnaissance,  parachute-reconnaissance, 
radio-technical,  bridging,  and  chemical  defense  battalions.  The  ar- 
mies also  controlled  their  own  artillery,  chemical,  communications, 
vehicle  and  armor,  combat  engineering,  medical- sanitary,  fuel,  and 
food  depots,  military  hospitals,  and  maintenance  and  mobilization 
bases  to  support  their  maneuver  units.  They  had  one  or  two  ter- 
ritorial training  centers  that  functioned  as  reserve  divisions  for  their 
respective  armies.  The  centers  were  organized  into  reserve  detach- 
ments for  motorized  rifle,  tank,  artillery,  and  antiaircraft  troops, 
and  specialist  training  groups  for  artillery-technical,  antitank,  recon- 
naissance, communications,  combat  engineering,  maintenance,  and 
rear  support  troops.  Many  reserve  detachments  were  significant 
forces  in  themselves,  often  as  large  as  motorized  rifle  regiments 
but  lacking  a  full  contingent  of  personnel.  The  low-strength  Sec- 
ond Army  itself  was  similar  in  organization  and  purpose  to  a  ter- 
ritorial training  center.  It  had  one  full-strength  tank  brigade,  one 
artillery  regiment,  several  combat  support  regiments  and  battal- 
ions, several  reserve  detachments  and  groups,  depots,  one  mili- 
tary hospital,  and  one  maintenance  base. 

The  typical  motorized  rifle  division  had  four  motorized  rifle  regi- 
ments, one  artillery  regiment,  one  antiaircraft  artillery  regiment, 
one  independent  tank  battalion,  one  independent  artillery  battal- 
ion, one  antitank  battalion,  and  several  machine  gun-artillery  bat- 
talions. Reconnaissance,  communications,  combat  engineering, 


245 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

maintenance,  and  supply  battalions  provided  necessary  combat  sup- 
port to  the  division. 

A  typical  motorized  rifle  regiment  had  three  motorized  rifle  bat- 
talions with  ninety  armored  combat  vehicles  and  one  tank  battal- 
ion with  thirty  tanks.  Its  artillery  battalion  had  two  to  four  batteries 
of  nine  artillery  pieces.  It  had  one  antiaircraft  artillery  battalion, 
one  antitank  battery,  and  one  or  two  machine  gun- artillery  batteries. 

Air  and  Air  Defense  Forces 

Air  and  air  defense  force  units  were  rather  evenly  dispersed 
throughout  the  country.  They  operated  approximately  300  com- 
bat aircraft,  including  over  160  MiG-21,  70  MiG-23,  40  Su-25, 
and  20  MiG-29  fighters  and  more  than  100  L-29  and  L-39  com- 
bat trainers.  Two  MiG  fighter  and  three  MiG  interceptor  regiments 
were  operational.  The  air  forces  had  two  regiments  of  Mi-24  attack 
helicopters,  two  regiments  of  Mi-17,  Mi-8,  and  Mi-2  multipurpose 
combat  support  helicopters,  and  one  squadron  of  Mi-2  and  Mi-8 
transport  helicopters.  The  air  and  air  defense  forces  had  over  22,000 
personnel,  about  75  percent  of  whom  were  conscripts. 

The  First  Air  Defense  Division  and  Second  Air  Defense  Divi- 
sion, deployed  in  Sofia  and  Burgas  provinces,  respectively,  were 
composed  of  two  interceptor  regiments  with  eighteen  aircraft  each. 
They  operated  Soviet-made  MiG-21,  MiG-23,  and  MiG-29  fight- 
ers. A  third  air  defense  division  controlled  the  strategic  air  defense 
network  of  approximately  280  Soviet-made  SA-2,  SA-3,  SA-5, 
and  more  modern  SA-10  surface-to-air  missile  launchers  dispersed 
at  about  thirty  sites  throughout  the  country.  In  1991  the  division 
probably  had  four  regiments,  each  composed  of  several  battalions. 
Battalions  provided  central  command  and  control  for  as  many  as 
ten  launchers,  with  each  launcher  corresponding  to  a  battery. 

The  Tenth  Composite  Air  Corps  in  central  Bulgaria  was  the  larg- 
est air  formation.  It  had  more  than  225  aircraft.  Its  principal  mis- 
sion was  to  provide  air  support,  tactical  reconnaissance,  and  mobility 
for  the  ground  forces.  It  had  two  fighter-bomber  regiments,  one 
fighter  regiment,  one  reconnaissance  aircraft  regiment,  and  four 
helicopter  regiments,  as  well  as  large  numbers  of  radar,  mainte- 
nance, and  communications  support  units  under  its  command.  Its 
aircraft  included  MiG-21  and  MiG- 17  fighters  and  MiG-23  and 
Su-25  fighter-bombers,  Su-22,  MiG-21,  and  MiG-25  reconnais- 
sance variants,  and  over  forty  specialized  Mi-24  attack  helicopters 
and  forty  Mi-2,  Mi-8,  and  Mi-17  combat  and  transport  helicopters. 

The  Higher  Aviation  School  of  the  air  and  air  defense  forces  com- 
mand also  controlled  two  aviation  training  regiments  and  one  avi- 
ation training  squadron  with  over  eighty  L-29  and  L-39  primary 


246 


National  Security 


trainers  and  over  eighty  MiG-15,  MiG-17,  and  MiG-21  armed 
combat  trainers  in  northern  Bulgaria  (see  Officer  Education,  this 
ch.).  The  Higher  Aviation  School  also  had  a  large  number  of  logis- 
tics and  other  support  units  to  train  specialists  for  the  service. 

Naval  Forces 

The  navy  defended  approximately  350  kilometers  of  coastline 
along  the  Black  Sea.  Its  major  bases  were  located  at  Varna  (the 
headquarters),  Atiya,  Sozopol,  Balchik,  and  Burgas.  Naval  forces 
included  over  twenty  submarines  and  minor  surface  combatants 
that  could  be  deployed  in  coastal  defense  operations.  As  recently 
as  1989,  Bulgarian  naval  forces  defended  claims  to  their  territorial 
waters  in  incidents  with  Turkish  forces  at  sea.  As  in  the  case  of 
the  ground  forces,  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense  announced 
some  unilateral  naval  reductions  in  1990.  In  all,  five  vessels  were 
to  be  retired  or  sold  abroad:  two  submarine  chasers,  two  coastal 
patrol  boats,  and  one  submarine.  They  were  basically  obsolete  and 
had  little  residual  military  value.  This  deletion  was  more  than 
balanced  by  the  addition  of  three  Soviet  Poti-class  corvettes  to  the 
operational  inventory.  In  1990  the  navy  had  about  10,000  person- 
nel, half  of  them  conscripts. 

The  navy  had  four  components:  the  Black  Sea  Fleet,  Danube 
Flotilla,  Coastal  Defense,  and  a  shore  establishment.  The  Black 
Sea  Fleet  was  organized  into  submarine,  escort  ship,  missile  and 
torpedo  boat,  amphibious  craft,  and  minesweeping  squadrons  and 
brigades.  The  Danube  Flotilla  operated  patrol  craft  along  the  river- 
ine border  with  Romania.  Coastal  Defense  included  amphibious 
landing  and  mine  countermeasures  forces.  The  shore  establishment 
controlled  naval  bases,  training  facilities,  and  naval  aviation,  coastal 
artillery,  and  naval  infantry  units. 

Bulgaria  obtained  its  minor  surface  combatant  crafts  from  the 
Soviet  Union.  Its  main  forces  consisted  of  four  Pobeda-class  sub- 
marines, two  Druzki-class  frigates,  five  Poti-class  corvettes,  six  Osa- 
class  missile  patrol  boats,  six  Shershen-class  torpedo  boats,  and  three 
SO- 1 -class  and  seven  Zhuk-class  patrol  craft.  The  navy  received 
its  Pobeda-  (formerly  Romeo-)  class  submarines  from  the  Soviet 
Union  beginning  in  1972.  Originally  built  in  the  1950s,  they  were 
armed  with  eight  533mm  torpedo  tubes.  The  Druzki-  (formerly 
Riga-)  class  frigates  were  built  in  1957  and  1958.  They  were  modern- 
ized extensively  during  the  early  1980s.  They  had  three  100mm 
guns,  three  533mm  torpedo  tubes,  and  four  five-tube  antisubmarine 
rocket  launchers.  The  navy  acquired  its  first  three  Poti-class  cor- 
vettes from  the  Soviet  Union  in  1975  and  another  three  in  1990. 
These  were  lightly  armed  antisubmarine  warfare  platforms  carrying 


247 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

four  406mm  torpedo  tubes  and  two  antisubmarine  rocket  launch- 
ers. The  Osa-class  missile  patrol  boats  carried  four  SS-N-2  surface- 
to-surface  missile  launchers.  The  Soviet  Union  built  them  in  the 
1960s  and  first  transferred  them  to  Bulgaria  in  the  early  1970s. 
The  Shershen-class  torpedo  boats  had  four  533mm  torpedo  tubes 
and  were  built  and  acquired  at  approximately  the  same  time  as 
the  Osa-class  boats. 

The  navy  operated  more  than  thirty  mine-warfare  counter- 
measures  ships,  including  four  modern  Soviet-built  Sonya-class 
oceangoing  minesweepers  acquired  in  the  early  1980s.  The  other 
minesweepers,  including  the  Vanya-class,  Yevgenya-class,  and 
several  miscellaneous  ships,  were  restricted  to  coastal  or  inshore 
operations.  The  inventory  also  included  two  Polish-built  Polnocny- 
class  medium  landing  ships.  These  amphibious  ships  each  could 
transport  and  land  six  tanks  and  150  troops.  The  navy  had  nineteen 
additional  Vydra-class  medium  landing  craft,  each  of  which  could 
carry  100  troops  and  250  tons  of  equipment  on  their  open  tank 
decks. 

Naval  aviation,  coastal  artillery,  and  naval  infantry  were  small 
support  arms  of  the  navy.  Naval  aviation  consisted  of  one  squa- 
dron of  three  armed  and  nine  unarmed  search-and-rescue  and  anti- 
submarine warfare  helicopters.  These  Mi- 14,  Mi-8,  Mi-4,  and  Mi- 2 
naval  helicopters  were  obtained  from  the  Soviet  Union.  Coastal 
artillery  had  two  regiments  with  about  150  guns  of  100mm  or 
130mm  caliber.  They  were  organized  into  several  battalions  with 
five  batteries  each.  Coastal  artillery  units  also  operated  an  unknown 
number  of  Soviet  SS-C-1  and  more  modern  SSC-3  antiship  mis- 
sile launchers.  Their  mission  was  to  direct  fire  against  combatants 
offshore,  supporting  amphibious  assaults  on  the  Bulgarian  coast- 
line. The  naval  infantry  force  consisted  of  three  companies  of  100 
troops  each.  Their  small  size  limited  them  to  guard  duty  and  ground 
defense  of  important  coastal  installations  against  commando  raids 
and  other  assault  forces. 

Border  Troops 

The  Border  Troops  were  part  of  the  BPA.  Composed  of  13,000 
troops  in  sixteen  light  infantry  regiments,  they  resembled  military 
units  more  than  a  police  force.  The  mission  was  to  defend  the  coun- 
try's frontiers  against  illegal  crossings.  The  Border  Troops  regu- 
lated the  movement  of  people  within  a  strip  twelve  kilometers  wide 
along  the  border.  They  cooperated  with  other  authorities  to  pre- 
vent smuggling,  although  contraband  control  was  not  primarily 
their  responsibility  (see  Crime,  this  ch.).  During  wartime  the  Border 
Troops  were  to  coordinate  their  actions  with  the  ground  forces  as 


248 


National  Security 


a  first  line  of  national  defense.  The  majority  of  the  Border  Troops 
were  deployed  to  guard  frontiers  with  Greece,  Turkey,  and  Yugo- 
slavia, but  they  also  defended  the  Romanian  border.  Several  light 
patrol  boats  operated  along  the  Danube  River  where  it  separated 
Bulgaria  from  Romania  and  along  the  Black  Sea  coast. 

Construction  Troops 

Between  12,000  and  15,000  conscripts  traditionally  served  as  con- 
struction troops.  They  had  their  origin  in  the  compulsory  labor 
service  established  by  the  Bulgarian  Agrarian  National  Union 
(BANU)  government  in  1920  (see  Stamboliiski  and  Agrarian  Re- 
form, ch.  1).  Commanded  by  a  general  and  organized  into  mili- 
tary units,  this  labor  service  built  roads,  railroads,  and  entire 
industrial  enterprises.  Although  service  in  the  Construction  Troops 
satisfied  military  service  requirements,  these  units  were  controlled 
by  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  Architecture,  and  Public  Services, 
and  they  received  little  or  no  military  training.  According  to  the 
chairman  of  the  Movement  for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  these  units 
typically  drafted  Turks  and  other  ethnic  minorities  considered  un- 
suitable for  service  in  combat  units  because  of  linguistic  barriers 
or  perceived  political  unreliability  (see  Turks,  ch.  2;  The  Move- 
ment for  Rights  and  Freedoms,  ch.  4). 

After  the  fall  of  Zhivkov,  the  Construction  Troops  received  con- 
siderable attention.  It  was  alleged  that  the  Construction  Troops 
had  built  over  20,000  apartments  and  houses  for  members  of  the 
BCP  elite  during  the  last  ten  years  of  the  Zhivkov  regime.  High- 
ranking  officers  reportedly  could  requisition  labor  crews  from  the 
Construction  Troops  to  work  on  their  apartments  or  country  homes. 
The  Construction  Troops  often  were  reported  as  working  in  uran- 
ium mines,  metallurgical  industries,  and  other  unsafe  environments 
that  did  not  attract  enough  civilian  workers. 

In  1991  the  future  of  the  Construction  Troops  depended  on  the 
status  of  professionalization  in  the  armed  forces.  Opponents  ar- 
gued that  these  units  were  not  a  necessary  component  of  profes- 
sional armed  forces,  and  that  their  functions  should  devolve  to  the 
civilian  economy.  Proponents  insisted  that  the  Construction  Troops 
provided  a  low-cost  labor  force  for  important  national  projects,  in- 
cluding factories,  power  plants,  and  other  capital  investment 
projects,  as  well  as  useful  occupational  training  in  the  building  trades 
for  a  large  number  of  conscripts.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1980s,  a 
reported  1.2  billion  leva  (for  value  of  the  lev,  see  Glossary)  worth 
of  labor  came  from  this  source  for  more  than  700  projects.  Similar 
debates  surrounded  specially  designated  railroad  troops  and  trans- 
portation troops.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Civil  Defense  Troops 

A  strong  emphasis  on  civil  defense  resulted  from  Bulgaria's  par- 
ticipation in  the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  BCP's  efforts  to  mobilize 
the  population.  The  civil  defense  program  developed  in  the  1960s 
from  the  recognition  that  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  weapons 
delivered  by  long-range  missiles  and  artillery  ended  the  clear  dis- 
tinction between  the  front  lines  and  civilian  areas.  Planning  for 
civil  defense  was  intended  to  meliorate  the  worst  effects  of  weapons 
of  mass  destruction  and  to  ensure  continuity  in  communications, 
transportation,  supply,  and  power  generation  during  wartime. 

The  Ministry  of  National  Defense  operated  the  National  Radi- 
ation and  Chemical  Defense  Warning  System  and  planned  the  over- 
all direction  and  financing  of  civil  defense  activities.  Civil  defense 
committees  attached  to  people's  councils  at  the  province  or  munici- 
pality level  implemented  civil  defense  plans  for  those  jurisdictions. 
Civil  defense  organizations  in  manufacturing  plants,  enterprises, 
schools,  and  other  collectives  had  similar  responsibilities.  Staffed 
with  conscripts  and  organized  into  battalions,  the  civil  defense  troops 
trained  the  civilian  population  in  individual  and  collective  defen- 
sive measures,  including  dispersal  and  evacuation.  They  maintained 
firefighting,  decontamination,  civil  engineering,  salvage,  rescue, 
and  medical  assistance  programs  and  skills  needed  for  the  civil 
defense  program.  Despite  these  preparations  for  civil  defense,  con- 
struction of  protective  shelters  for  the  population  was  a  relatively 
low  priority,  primarily  because  of  economic  constraints.  A  network 
of  hardened  command  posts  for  the  military  and  civilian  leader- 
ship was  believed  to  exist. 

Logistics  and  Arms  Procurement 

The  Material-Technical  and  Rear  Support  Command  had  wide 
responsibility  for  logistical  support  to  the  BPA,  ranging  from  rou- 
tine supply  operations  to  maintenance  and  arms  procurement.  Its 
base  and  depot  network  included  petroleum-oil-lubricant  (POL) 
depots,  special  fuel  bases,  POL  and  special  fuel  equipment  main- 
tenance battalions,  central  supply  bases,  food  and  general  supply 
depots,  central  maintenance  bases,  central  vehicle  and  armor-tank 
depots,  vehicle  and  armor-tank  maintenance  bases,  artillery  depots, 
central  artillery  ammunition  bases,  and  central  missile  maintenance 
bases. 

One  major  directorate  of  the  Material-Technical  and  Rear  Sup- 
port Command  was  responsible  for  military  repair  bases  and 
factories.  This  directorate  controlled  general  equipment  repair 
factories,  electro-mechanical  factories,  vehicle  repair  factories,  and 


250 


National  Security 


an  institute  for  research  and  development  in  maintenance  of 
weapons  and  equipment.  In  addition  to  this  directorate,  the  com- 
mand ran  a  military  technology  research  institute,  a  laser  technol- 
ogy laboratory,  an  electro-mechanical  training  equipment  factory, 
a  central  artillery-technical  test  range,  and  a  billeting  service.  It 
also  operated  several  schools  for  maintenance  specialist  training 
(see  Military  Training,  this  ch.). 

Despite  the  range  of  these  activities,  Bulgaria  produced  relatively 
few  of  its  own  armaments  and  other  combat  equipment.  Defense 
production  plants  were  located  in  Gabrovo,  Karlovo,  Kazanluk, 
Plovdiv,  Sofia,  and  Varna,  but  the  vast  majority  of  arms  and  equip- 
ment came  from  the  Soviet  Union,  with  smaller  amounts  from 
Poland  and  Czechoslovakia.  The  Zhivkov  regime  also  occasionally 
purchased  military  equipment  from  at  least  three  NATO  mem- 
bers, including  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany). 
The  exact  nature  and  amount  of  weapons  systems  produced  for 
domestic  use  remained  largely  unknown  during  that  period, 
however.  The  Tundzha  mortar  and  a  few  types  of  armored  com- 
bat vehicles  were  produced  domestically.  Bulgarian  shipyards  did 
not  produce  surface  combat  ships  or  submarines. 

Following  the  lead  of  the  Soviet  Union,  Bulgaria  announced  a 
major  program  of  defense  industry  conversion  in  1990.  The  sec- 
tion of  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Trade,  and  Services  responsible 
for  arms  production  was  renamed  the  Special  Production  and  Con- 
version Department  to  reflect  conversion  to  civilian  manufacture. 
Bulgaria  planned  to  convert  an  unspecified  number  of  military 
plants  and  to  require  firms  producing  both  military  and  civilian 
goods  to  double  their  output  of  the  latter.  By  the  end  of  1990, 
defense  plants  were  required  to  produce  a  total  of  246  million  leva 
worth  of  nonmilitary  goods,  increasing  to  394  million  leva  in  19,91 , 
and  to  1,130  million  leva  by  1995.  In  this  period,  their  production 
mix  was  to  change  to  60  percent  civilian  and  40  percent  military 
goods.  Fully  and  partially  converted  military  enterprises  would 
manufacture  textiles,  capital  equipment  and  machine  tools,  trac- 
tors and  cultivators,  durable  consumer  appliances,  industrial  and 
medical  lasers,  and  canned  food.  The  encouragement  of  joint  ven- 
tures between  Bulgarian  and  foreign  firms  was  another  element 
of  the  conversion  program.  Despite  these  changes  in  the  defense 
industries,  the  government  planned  to  retain  complete  authority 
over  military  production. 

Military  Budget 

Bulgaria  traditionally  spent  less  on  defense  than  other  Warsaw 
Pact  countries,  but  military  spending  was  a  greater  burden  on  its 


251 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

economy  than  on  those  of  its  allies.  During  the  late  1980s,  the  mili- 
tary budget  amounted  to  more  than  10  percent  of  the  gross  na- 
tional product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  because  Bulgaria  had  the 
lowest  GNP  in  the  Warsaw  Pact.  Measured  in  terms  of  total  govern- 
ment spending,  the  military  budget  typically  accounted  for  more 
than  20  percent  of  the  national  budget.  In  contrast,  BPA  leaders 
complained  that  by  1990  defense  spending  had  dropped  to  about 
6  percent  of  state  expenditures,  a  smaller  proportion  than  that  spent 
by  the  governments  of  Greece  or  Turkey. 

Between  1986  and  1989,  the  military  budget  increased  gradually 
from  1.67  to  1.8  billion  leva.  In  January  1989,  however,  the  State 
Council  and  the  Council  of  Ministers  reduced  the  appropriated 
defense  budget  for  1989  by  12  percent  to  1.6  billion  leva.  The  an- 
nouncement cited  restructuring  in  the  armed  forces  and  economic 
considerations  as  reasons  for  the  reduction.  The  Ministry  of  Na- 
tional Defense  stated  its  intention  to  absorb  the  cut  by  reducing 
expenditures  on  operations,  maintenance,  and  procurement,  which 
were  the  largest  components  of  the  military  budget. 

Military  Personnel 

Bulgaria  traditionally  had  more  troops  in  uniform  per  capita  than 
the  other  Warsaw  Pact  countries.  At  one  time,  it  had  almost  as 
many  soldiers  as  Romania,  a  country  with  a  population  three  times 
larger  than  Bulgaria's.  Total  personnel  in  the  BPA  were  drastically 
reduced  from  152,000  to  107,000  between  1988  and  1991,  however. 
The  Ministry  of  National  Defense  cut  the  officer  corps  by  over  1 , 700 
and  general  officers  by  78.  The  military  strongly  opposed  addi- 
tional reductions  on  the  grounds  that  they  would  seriously  jeopardize 
national  security.  Military  spokesmen  pointed  to  the  300,000-  to 
350,000-soldier  Turkish  force  in  eastern  Thrace  and  western  Anato- 
lia as  the  key  factor  in  determining  the  appropriate  personnel  level 
for  the  BPA.  The  unilateral  reduction  between  1988  and  1991  oc- 
curred against  a  backdrop  of  sharp  domestic  political  debate  over 
reducing  the  basic  two-year  military  conscription  term  to  eighteen 
months. 

Recruitment  and  Service  Obligations 

The  standard  two-year  term  of  military  service  for  most  con- 
scripts was  reduced  to  eighteen  months  by  the  National  Assembly 
in  1990.  At  the  same  time,  the  three-year  term  for  sailors  and  other 
specialists  was  changed  to  two  years.  Bulgarian  males  entered  the 
armed  forces  at  the  age  of  nineteen.  Although  the  BPA  was  smaller 
than  before,  the  new  eighteen-month  service  term  caused  a  turn- 
over of  one- third  of  all  conscripts  every  six  months,  making  universal 


252 


National  Security 


conscription  of  nineteen-year-old  males  a  necessity  to  maintain  force 
levels.  A  population  growth  rate  barely  above  zero  exacerbated  the 
manpower  problem.  In  1991  the  minister  of  national  defense  noted 
an  increased  incidence  of  potential  conscripts  avoiding  military  ser- 
vice. He  stated  that  6,000  young  men  over  seventeen  years  of  age 
were  known  to  have  departed  the  country  illegally  for  this  reason, 
and  another  3,500  failed  to  appear  before  the  conscription  com- 
mission and  were  presumed  to  be  living  abroad.  The  existing  law 
on  the  armed  forces  prohibited  men  in  this  age  category  from  leaving 
Bulgaria  before  performing  their  compulsory  service.  Although 
young  men  enrolled  in  a  higher  school  or  university  could  defer 
fulfillment  of  their  military  obligation  until  they  had  completed  their 
education,  draft  deferments  for  other  reasons  were  granted  infre- 
quently and  reluctantly. 

In  1991  political  parties  debated  additional  adjustments  in  the 
conscription  system.  The  UDF  and  the  BANU  argued  for  a  fur- 
ther reduction  to  a  one-year  term  for  most  conscripts  and  six  months 
for  university  graduates.  They  also  called  for  extending  contracts 
to  some  soldiers  and  noncommissioned  officers  (NCOs)  to  shift  the 
BP  A  to  a  more  professional  force.  Other  aspects  of  military  ser- 
vice discussed  by  the  Commission  on  National  Security  of  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  in  1990  were  possible  voluntary  service  by  women 
and  service  in  the  national  police  force  as  an  alternative  to  mili- 
tary conscription. 

Supported  by  the  BSP,  the  military  argued  that  one  year  of  mili- 
tary service  was  insufficient  to  provide  required  training  for  con- 
scripts. It  maintained  that  at  any  given  time  only  50  percent  of 
the  army  would  have  completed  basic  training  and  be  in  a  state 
of  minimum  combat  readiness.  Furthermore,  shorter  service  would 
make  the  training  of  Bulgarian  troops  inferior  to  that  of  other  armies 
in  the  region.  Military  spokesmen  argued  that  the  country  could 
not  afford  the  wages  or  the  benefits  required  in  a  professional  army, 
nor  could  it  attract  enough  volunteers  under  the  austere  conditions 
of  military  service  throughout  the  country.  The  army  viewed  the 
draft  and  mobilization  as  essential  to  ensure  an  adequate  force  in 
wartime.  Some  military  leaders  charged  that  the  UDF  and  the 
BANU  sought  to  reduce  service  terms  in  order  to  gain  votes  from 
servicemen  who  would  gain  early  release.  The  military  opposed 
alternative  service  on  the  grounds  that  the  Construction  Troops 
were  the  existing  alternative  to  combat  service. 

Military  Training 

Military  training  began  with  mandatory  premilitary  training 
through  the  Organization  for  Cooperation  in  Defense,  a  mass 


253 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

organization  with  more  than  10,000  affiliates  in  schools,  coopera- 
tive farms,  and  enterprises  throughout  the  country.  Under  its 
auspices,  reserve  officers  and  active-duty  junior  officers  trained 
thousands  of  young  men  and  women  between  the  ages  of  sixteen 
and  eighteen  in  a  year-round  program.  In  classroom  and  field  ex- 
ercises, trainees  learned  marksmanship,  radio  communications, 
scuba  diving,  and  technical  military  specialties  such  as  aircraft  and 
vehicle  operations  and  maintenance.  For  the  last,  the  Organiza- 
tion for  Cooperation  in  Defense  had  an  inventory  of  more  than 
seventy  BTR-60  and  MT-LB  armored  personnel  carriers.  Al- 
though the  organization  also  sponsored  sports  competitions  and 
summer  camps  less  directly  related  to  military  service,  the  main 
goal  of  premilitary  training  was  to  reduce  the  time  required  to  adapt 
young  inductees  to  military  life. 

Military  training  followed  the  Soviet  model  because  the  Soviet- 
made  weapons  and  equipment  in  the  inventory  required  special- 
ized training  in  operation  and  maintenance.  Training,  which  also 
followed  Soviet  tactical  concepts,  moved  in  an  annual  cycle  under 
the  two-year  service  term.  Adjustments  in  the  training  cycle  were 
expected  to  compensate  for  the  shorter  eighteen-month  service  term. 
On  the  other  hand,  in  1990  elimination  of  political  indoctrination 
requirements  freed  as  much  as  25  percent  of  conscript  training  time 
for  military  and  physical  training.  Immediately  after  induction, 
conscripts  began  basic  physical  conditioning,  training  in  handling 
and  maintenance  of  small  arms,  drill,  and  general  military  indoc- 
trination. They  learned  a  range  of  individual  skills  required  in  small 
unit  combat  situations,  including  first  aid,  radiation  and  chemical 
decontamination,  and  camouflage  techniques.  After  basic  train- 
ing, soldiers  formed  crews  for  training  on  larger  weapons  and  equip- 
ment. They  participated  in  exercises  of  increasing  scale  until  the 
training  cycle  culminated  in  a  large-scale  combined  arms  maneu- 
ver held  each  year.  In  1990  the  minister  of  national  defense  called 
for  more  realistic  training,  especially  for  combat  at  night  and  in 
poor  visibility  conditions.  Conscripts  received  specialist  training 
in  a  variety  of  fields.  Separate  schools  trained  junior  specialists  in 
transport  and  rear  services,  tank  and  vehicle  maintenance,  POL 
handling,  and  military  music. 

The  majority  of  NCOs  were  new  inductees  selected  at  induc- 
tion for  special  training  at  service  schools.  NCOs  served  longer  than 
the  usual  conscription  period.  In  the  early  1970s,  special  second- 
ary schools  were  also  established  for  NCO  training.  These  schools 
were  available  to  acceptable  applicants  who  had  completed  the 
eighth  grade.  The  course  of  study  lasted  three  years  and  gradu- 
ates were  obligated  to  serve  in  the  armed  forces  for  ten  years. 


254 


National  Security 


Military  life  was  generally  austere  but  not  significantly  differ- 
ent from  conditions  throughout  the  country.  The  greatest  hard- 
ship was  the  requirement  that  conscripts  serve  outside  their  home 
provinces.  In  1991  increasing  criticism  was  leveled  at  the  negative 
aspects  of  military  service,  especially  the  hazing  of  new  conscripts. 
The  press  widely  reported  complaints  from  conscripts  and  parents 
that  hazing  often  included  intimidation  and  violence  against  young 
recruits  by  senior  soldiers.  In  response,  junior  officers  were  assigned 
barracks  duty  to  prevent  such  excesses.  A  general  decline  in  mili- 
tary discipline  also  had  become  a  problem  in  1991.  The  press  re- 
ported widespread  cases  of  soldiers  failing  to  wear  proper  uniforms 
or  to  carry  proper  identity  papers,  increased  rates  of  absence  without 
leave,  and  black  market  activities  by  soldiers.  Misappropriation 
of  money  and  property,  theft  of  weapons  and  ammunition,  and 
violent  assault  and  murder  were  cited  as  increasingly  common  oc- 
currences. The  Plovdiv  garrison  alone  reported  600  violations  of 
military  conduct  rules  during  the  last  six  months  of  1990.  Burgas, 
Stara  Zagora,  and  other  garrisons  in  southeastern  Bulgaria  were 
cited  as  particular  problem  areas.  A  spokesperson  for  the  Minis- 
try of  National  Defense  voiced  concern  that  the  process  of  demo- 
cratization had  the  unintended  side  effect  of  undermining  order 
in  the  ranks  of  the  BPA.  The  spokesperson  accused  the  media  and 
political  parties  of  encouraging  disciplinary  violations  and  disobe- 
dience among  conscripts  without  regard  to  the  need  to  maintain 
the  integrity  and  capabilities  of  the  BPA.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
military  leadership  tended  to  label  all  agitation  for  better  living  con- 
ditions as  simply  a  failure  of  discipline. 

Officer  Education 

The  level  of  education  of  Bulgarian  officers  rose  in  the  1970s 
and  1980s.  In  the  early  1970s,  only  40  percent  had  degrees  from 
higher  military  or  civilian  schools,  but  this  figure  rose  to  nearly 
two-thirds  of  the  entire  officer  corps  by  1980.  Cadet  programs  in 
several  higher  military  schools  provided  officers  for  the  armed  forces. 
These  programs  were  equivalent  to  a  civilian  university  curricu- 
lum. Applicants  were  required  to  have  a  secondary  school  educa- 
tion and  to  be  single,  in  excellent  physical  condition,  and  under 
twenty-four  years  of  age.  Many  applicants  had  completed  their  com- 
pulsory military  service  as  conscripts  and  had  decided  to  pursue 
a  professional  military  career.  The  ground  forces  had  three  higher 
military  schools  for  training  combined  arms  officers,  artillery 
officers,  and  reserve  officers.  The  air  and  air  defense  forces  had 
one  Higher  Aviation  School  that  provided  firsthand  experience  with 
aircraft  besides  its  classroom  training.  The  Higher  Aviation  School 


255 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

had  three  flight  training  regiments  with  supporting  aviation  engineer- 
ing, communications,  and  radio-technical  (radar)  support  battalions 
(see  Armed  Services,  this  ch.).  The  naval  forces  had  a  Higher  Naval 
School  to  train  officers  for  the  service.  Cadets  in  training  to  be  line 
officers  had  four-year  courses  of  study;  those  preparing  for  techni- 
cal specialties  such  as  artillery,  aviation,  and  communications  had 
five-year  courses  of  study.  Cadets  received  their  commissions  im- 
mediately after  they  graduated. 

Selected  officers  could  obtain  advanced  academic  training.  Mid- 
grade  officers  could  apply  for  acceptance  in  the  Georgi  Rakovski 
Military  Academy  in  Sofia.  Graduation  from  the  academy,  which 
was  similar  to  a  Western  war  college  or  command  and  staff  course, 
was  a  prerequisite  for  advancement  into  the  senior  officer  ranks. 
Approximately  one-third  of  all  career  officers  completed  that  course. 
Most  active-duty  officers  studied  in  one  of  several  Soviet  military 
academies.  Completion  of  a  two-year  program  in  the  Soviet  Union 
and  fluency  in  Russian  were  requirements  for  field-grade  officers. 
In  1991  the  minister  of  national  defense  raised  the  possibility  of 
sending  officers  to  study  in  Western  military  academies,  but  he 
cited  the  language  barrier  and  the  country's  financial  difficulties 
as  obstacles.  The  General  Staff  had  several  other  specialized  aca- 
demic institutes  for  the  study  of  military  science  and  history  (see 
High  Command,  this  ch.).  It  also  operated  the  Military  Medical 
Academy,  which  was  established  as  a  training  and  research  center 
in  the  military  aspects  of  the  medical  sciences,  to  upgrade  training 
of  military  physicians  and  to  provide  medical  services  for  the  armed 
forces. 

A  professional  military  career  was  considered  relatively  presti- 
gious in  Bulgaria,  although  prestige  began  to  wane  in  the  post- 
Zhivkov  era.  Depending  on  whether  nonmonetary  benefits  like 
housing  and  food  were  considered,  an  officer's  pay  was  generally 
25  to  50  percent  higher  than  that  offered  in  civilian  positions  with 
comparable  responsibilities.  Only  in  1990  did  the  defense  estab- 
lishment begin  to  address  problems  familiar  to  military  officers  in 
all  countries,  however.  For  example,  spouses  frequently  were  un- 
able to  find  work  in  the  vicinity  of  military  posts.  In  1991  a  special 
cash  allowance  to  military  families  was  being  considered  to  cover 
these  instances.  Day-care  and  school  accommodations  often  were 
scarce,  and  adequate  housing  unavailable.  The  quasi-official  Georgi 
Rakovski  Officer  Legion  was  established  in  1990  to  promote  a  broad 
range  of  professional  interests  and  address  issues  such  as  living  stan- 
dards within  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense. 

In  the  early  1990s,  tenure  became  a  vital  concern  to  officers. 
In  1991  the  minister  of  national  defense  announced  that  reductions 


256 


National  Security 


in  the  armed  forces  would  reduce  the  officer  corps  by  nearly  15 
percent.  A  military  affiliate  of  the  Podkrepa  labor  federation  was 
founded  in  1991  by  a  group  of  junior  officers  and  NCOs  (see  Trade 
Unions,  ch.  4).  As  an  independent  organization,  it  was  seen  as 
a  more  formidable  adversary  to  the  Ministry  of  National  Defense 
than  the  Georgi  Rakovski  Officer  Legion.  Some  of  the  Podkrepa 
affiliate's  founders  were  dismissed  from  the  service,  apparently  in 
retaliation  for  their  activities. 

Reserves  and  Mobilization 

In  1991  Bulgaria  had  a  force  of  approximately  500,000  in  reserve 
for  service  in  the  event  of  mobilization.  This  figure  included  over 
400,000  in  the  ground  forces,  nearly  50,000  in  the  air  and  air 
defense  forces,  and  smaller  numbers  in  the  naval  forces.  Individu- 
als were  counted  in  the  active  reserves  for  the  first  five  years  after 
their  release  from  military  service.  Their  reserve  obligation  con- 
tinued until  age  fifty  for  former  conscripts  and  until  age  sixty  for 
officers.  The  demand  for  labor  in  the  civilian  economy  and  a  lack 
of  training  put  a  practical  limit  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  reserves. 
Soldiers  discharged  in  the  latest  five-year  period  represented  the 
largest  contingent  in  the  reserves,  and  they  could  be  mobilized  after 
a  short  period  of  refresher  training  and  physical  conditioning.  The 
deactivation  of  four  motorized  rifle  divisions  and  increased  emphasis 
on  territorial  training  centers  indicated  that  reserves  could  become 
a  more  important  part  of  the  force  structure. 

Ranks,  Uniforms,  and  Insignia 

The  ground  forces  and  air  and  air  defense  forces  used  the  same 
system  of  ranks.  The  air  and  air  defense  forces  and  naval  forces 
lacked  an  equivalent  to  the  four-star  army  general  rank  in  the 
ground  forces.  Below  army  general,  there  were  three  general- grade, 
three  field- grade,  and  four  company- grade  officer  ranks.  In  descend- 
ing order,  the  ranks  were  colonel  general,  lieutenant  general,  major 
general,  colonel,  lieutenant  colonel,  major,  captain,  senior  lieu- 
tenant, lieutenant,  and  junior  lieutenant.  Naval  officer  ranks  in- 
cluded three  admiral,  four  captain,  and  three  lieutenant  ranks.  The 
ground  forces  and  air  and  air  defense  forces  had  six  enlisted  grades, 
four  sergeant  and  two  private.  The  naval  forces  had  equivalent  petty 
officer  and  seaman  grades. 

Officers  wore  a  service  uniform  consisting  of  a  tailored  blouse 
with  patch  pockets  and  trousers  that  tucked  into  high  boots.  A  Sam 
Browne  belt  and  sidearms  were  optional.  The  ground  forces  wore 
stripes  and  piping  on  caps  and  rank  insignia  that  varied  in  color 
according  to  the  branch  of  service  (motorized  rifle,  tank,  artillery, 


257 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


and  others).  Enlisted  uniforms  were  similar  in  design  but  had  less 
ornate  trim.  The  air  and  air  defense  forces  and  naval  forces  had 
the  same  uniforms  but  could  be  distinguished  by  blue  stripes  and 
piping  for  the  former  and  traditional  naval  blues  and  whites  for 
the  latter. 

Rank  insignia  on  uniforms  consisted  of  stars  or  stripes  on  shoulder 
boards.  Officer  ranks  were  identified  by  varying  numbers  of  stars 
and  increasingly  ornate  shoulder  boards  with  higher  ranks.  Those 
of  company-grade  officers  were  relatively  plain:  those  of  general 
officers  were  very  ornate.  Enlisted  grades  were  denoted  by  increas- 
ing numbers  of  stripes.  Privates  and  seamen  wore  no  stripes  and 
plain  shoulder  boards.  The  number  and  width  of  stripes  increased 
with  promotion  to  higher  grades  (see  fig.  13:  fig.  14:  fig.  15). 

Foreign  Military  Relations 

For  most  of  the  postwar  era.  Bulgaria's  strictly  defined  relations 
with  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  Warsaw  Pact  limited  its  relations 
with  the  military  establishments  of  other  countries.  In  the  1970s 
and  1980s.  Bulgaria  established  military  contacts  with  a  few  de- 
veloping countries  in  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  because  of  their 
relations  with  the  Soviet  Union.  The  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact 
raised  a  question  about  Bulgaria's  future  external  military  ties.  Op- 
tions included  continuing  a  bilateral  relationship  with  the  Soviet 
Union,  establishing  a  multilateral  security  arrangement  with  neigh- 
boring Balkan  countries  or  former  Warsaw  Pact  allies  in  Eastern 
Europe,  mounting  an  effort  to  join  NATO,  or  withholding  mili- 
tary commitments  to  other  countries. 

The  Warsaw  Pact 

Geographically  isolated  from  the  strategically  more  important 
northern-tier  countries  of  the  alliance.  Bulgaria  participated  in  a 
few  joint  exercises  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  along  the  central  front  op- 
posite NATO  in  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (East  Germa- 
nv)  and  Czechoslovakia.  Participation  in  that  front  usually  was 
limited  to  small  contingents.  Small-scale  maneuvers  or  command 
and  staff  exercises  were  held  in  Bulgaria  in  1964  and  1972.  Shield-82 
was  the  first  major  Warsaw  Pact  exercise  m  Bulgaria.  That  exer- 
cise involved  60.000  allied  troops  and  included  units  from  the 
northern-tier  Warsaw  Pact  countries  for  the  first  time.  The  major- 
ity  of  participants  were  Soviet  soldiers,  however.  The  use  of  air  or 
sea  transportation  instead  of  ground  transportation  across  Roma- 
ma.  which  allowed  no  foreign  troops  on  its  territory,  restricted  par- 
ticipation by  the  northern-tier  Warsaw  Pact  countries.  Part  of  the 
rationale  for  the  Yarna-Odessa  ferry  completed  in  the  late  1970s 


258 


National  Security 


was  to  bypass  this  obstacle  and  provide  direct  Soviet-Bulgarian 
transport  of  equipment  and  troops.  The  Warsaw  Pact  conducted 
a  major  command  and  staff  exercise  for  its  Southwestern  Theater 
of  Military  Operations  in  Bulgaria  in  March  1984.  Union-84  in- 
cluded general  staff  elements  from  the  Soviet  Union,  Hungary, 
Romania,  and  Bulgaria  in  simulated  coordination  of  their  respec- 
tive ground  and  naval  forces. 

Military  Cooperation  and  Exchanges 

Bulgaria  had  fewer  military  contacts  with  developing  countries 
than  did  its  Warsaw  Pact  allies,  instead  stressing  economic,  agricul- 
tural, and  technological  exchanges.  Military  cooperation  with  de- 
veloping countries  occurred  primarily  as  part  of  assistance  programs 
to  Soviet  allies  rather  than  as  an  independent  policy. 

Beginning  in  the  late  1970s,  Bulgaria  developed  military  rela- 
tions with  several  key  countries  in  the  Middle  East  and  Africa.  By 
the  mid-1980s,  friendship  treaties  were  in  effect  with  Angola,  Ethio- 
pia, Libya,  Mozambique,  and  Syria — all  of  which  were  receiving 
substantial  military  aid  from  the  Soviet  Union.  These  treaties  men- 
tioned unspecified  military  cooperation  between  the  two  signato- 
ries. In  the  1980s,  the  Bulgarian  minister  of  national  defense  paid 
official  visits  and  received  military  delegations  of  developing  coun- 
tries without  further  elaboration  of  those  terms.  During  this  pe- 
riod, Bulgaria  also  had  limited  military  relations  with  several 
developing  countries  that  were  not  Soviet  client  states,  including 
India,  Nigeria,  and  Zambia. 

More  recently,  Bulgaria  extended  its  policy  of  military  cooper- 
ation to  immediate  neighbors.  In  1987  and  1988,  Bulgaria  and 
Greece  exchanged  visits  by  the  chiefs  of  their  respective  general 
staffs.  In  1990  the  National  Assembly  ordered  several  units  of  special 
troops  deployed  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  Over  270  troops,  consisting 
of  a  medical  team,  chemical  defense  company,  and  rear  services 
unit,  supported  the  United  States-led  coalition  that  forced  the  Iraqi 
army  to  withdraw  from  Kuwait  in  February  1991.  In  November 
1990,  the  Bulgarian  General  Staff  sent  a  delegation  to  Turkey,  sig- 
naling a  decisive  warming  of  relations  with  that  traditional  enemy. 
In  1991  a  Bulgarian-Turkish  nonaggression  pact  was  discussed, 
but  Bulgaria  feared  that  a  bilateral  treaty  would  damage  its  close 
relations  with  Greece. 

Arms  Sales 

During  the  1980s,  Bulgaria  annually  exported  an  estimated 
US$250  to  US$500  million  worth  of  arms  and  military  equipment. 
On  one  occasion,  Zhivkov  personally  boasted  of  having  arms  supply

relationships  with  thirty-six  different  countries.  The  Kintex  for- 
eign trade  organization  had  responsibility  for  managing  arms  sales 
abroad.  Beginning  in  the  early  1960s,  Bulgaria  reportedly  used  its 
merchant  ship  fleet  to  deliver  arms  to  socialist-oriented  forces  fight- 
ing civil  wars  in  Algeria,  Angola,  Guinea-Bissau,  and  Mozambique 
and  to  leftist  terrorist  groups  in  Italy,  Turkey,  and  the  Middle  East. 
Kintex  allegedly  was  willing  to  accept  narcotics  from  Turkish  ter- 
rorists and  other  insurgent  groups  as  payment  for  arms,  a  charge 
Bulgarian  officials  denied.  A  captured  leader  of  the  Italian  Red 
Brigades  asserted  that  Bulgaria  was  willing  to  provide  weapons  to 
his  group  during  the  early  1980s.  One  of  Bulgaria's  more  infamous 
sales  transferred  sixty  Soviet  tanks  to  Nicaragua  and  trained  seventy 
Nicaraguan  pilots  in  1983  and  1984,  at  the  height  of  the  Sandinista 
government's  war  against  anticommunist  rebels  in  that  country. 

Political  change  removed  Kintex  and  its  activities  from  the 
category  of  state  secrets.  In  1990  the  trade  organization  revealed 
that  it  maintained  contacts  in  fifty  countries  and  sold  them  mainly 
small  arms,  ammunition,  and  tanks  and  combat  aircraft  retired 
from  service  with  the  BP  A.  The  democratization  of  post-Zhivkov 
Bulgaria  reportedly  had  the  same  downsizing  effect  on  Kintex  as 
it  had  on  other  defense-related  enterprises  (see  Logistics  and  Arms 
Procurement,  this  ch.).  According  to  one  source,  arms  exports  to 
the  Soviet  Union  declined  from  billions  to  several  hundred  mil- 
lion leva  between  the  late  1980s  and  the  early  1990s.  Plans  were 
announced  to  continue  Bulgaria's  arms  sales  under  stricter  legis- 
lative scrutiny  and  government  control  in  the  1990s. 

Law  and  Order 

The  BCP  gained  control  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Minis- 
try of  Internal  Affairs  in  the  Fatherland  Front  coalition  after  the 
overthrow  of  the  wartime  government  on  September  9,  1944.  The 
party  used  these  posts  to  increase  its  political  power  and  ultimately 
to  push  all  noncommunists  out  of  the  cabinet.  In  the  subsequent 
reorganization  of  the  national  police  force,  party  loyalists  replaced 
officers  suspected  of  having  cooperated  with  the  Gestapo.  BCP 
cadres  held  every  important  national,  regional,  and  municipal  po- 
sition in  the  new  People's  Militia  that  replaced  the  prewar  local 
police  force.  The  BCP  also  replaced  the  prewar  court  system  with 
People's  Courts,  in  which  party  members  served  as  judges  and 
jurors.  With  some  modifications,  the  internal  security  and  justice 
systems  established  in  the  mid- 1940s  remained  in  place  for  the  next 
forty  years,  bolstering  one-party  rule. 

The  fall  of  Zhivkov  in  November  1989  and  the  end  of  the  com- 
munist monopoly  on  political  power  brought  overt  pressure  for 


262 


National  Security 


democratic  reform  of  the  justice  system.  In  1991  some  improve- 
ments were  evident,  but  other  problems  persisted.  The  Ministry 
of  Internal  Affairs  retained  its  broad  responsibility  for  maintain- 
ing law  and  order,  law  enforcement,  internal  security,  and  foreign 
intelligence  activities.  Before  1989  it  had  been  more  powerful  and 
important  than  the  judicial  system  it  was  supposed  to  serve;  in  1991 
many  still  considered  the  ministry  a  reactionary  and  sinister  force 
because  of  past  involvement  in  repressive  activities  and  indications 
of  continued  party  influence  within  its  ranks.  However,  a  new  union 
of  its  employees  called  for  significant  reforms,  including  the 
depoliticization  and  professionalization  of  its  work  force.  Immedi- 
ately after  the  Zhivkov  ouster,  substantial  public  pressure  called 
for  depoliticizing  the  ministry,  which  one  high  official  described 
as  the  "armed  detachment  of  the  party."  Early  in  1990,  a  reor- 
ganization plan  proposed  drastic  cuts  in  budgeting  and  personnel 
and  a  complete  revision  of  the  ministry's  functions. 

Bulgaria  lost  social  stability  between  1989  and  1991.  Increased 
social  tension,  crime,  violence,  and  civil  disorder  were  the  unintended 
consequences  of  greater  freedom.  A  crisis  of  law  enforcement  fol- 
lowed in  the  wake  of  political  relaxation  and  democratization.  The 
police  seemed  unsure  whether  to  enforce  the  laws  of  the  legal  sys- 
tem of  the  discredited  Zhivkov  regime.  This  uncertainty  was  reflected 
when  the  People's  Militia,  formerly  an  efficient  and  feared  instru- 
ment of  the  communist  regime,  took  no  action  to  stop  vandals  and 
arsonists  who  attacked  and  burned  the  BSP  headquarters  in  Au- 
gust 1990. 

Crime 

More  than  700,000  crimes  were  reported  in  Bulgaria  between  1970 
and  1990.  The  People's  Militia  reported  an  annual  rate  of  570  crimes 
per  100,000  people  in  1989.  By  1989,  homicides  had  increased  by 
30  percent,  burglaries  by  nearly  40  percent,  and  rapes  by  45  per- 
cent over  the  rates  in  the  mid-1980s.  In  1990,  the  incidence  of  crime 
again  increased  sharply.  Compared  with  the  15,000  crimes  com- 
mitted during  1989,  the  People's  Militia  received  reports  of  more 
than  4,600  crimes  in  Sofia  alone  during  the  first  six  months  of  1990. 
Approximately  70  percent  of  these  crimes  were  committed  by  repeat 
offenders,  and  a  very  high  percentage  were  petty  crimes  against 
property.  Organized  crime  was  increasingly  evident;  more  than  ten 
criminal  organizations  reportedly  operated  in  Sofia.  They  were  in- 
volved in  black-market  activities  and  were  reputed  to  have  connec- 
tions to  organized  crime  in  other  countries. 

In  an  effort  to  curb  another  aspect  of  the  crime  problem,  the  Na- 
tional Assembly  appealed  in  1990  for  citizens  to  surrender  their 


263

unregistered  firearms  and  ammunition.  The  People's  Militia  re- 
ported that  145  crimes  were  committed  with  firearms  between  1985 
and  1989  and  that  in  that  period  60  people  were  killed  and  more 
than  120  people  were  wounded  by  illegal  firearms.  In  1989  authori- 
ties seized  nearly  800  illegal  firearms,  and  2,500  firearms  were  sur- 
rendered voluntarily.  That  year  approximately  85,000  firearms  had 
been  registered  in  the  country.  In  1990  the  government  revoked 
a  law  allowing  party  members  and  government  officials  to  carry 
weapons. 

Smuggling  of  drugs,  arms,  and  other  contraband  was  a  persis- 
tent problem  during  and  after  the  Zhivkov  regime.  Allegations  of 
official  involvement  in  smuggling  appeared  frequently  in  the  for- 
eign press  (see  Arms  Sales,  this  ch.).  Government  spokespersons 
denied  these  charges  and  routinely  asserted  that  the  geographical 
situation  of  Bulgaria  at  the  crossroads  of  Europe  and  Asia  made 
it  a  natural  route  for  illegal  trade.  They  pointed  out  instances  in 
which  customs  officials  arrested  foreigners,  particularly  Turks  and 
Yugoslavs,  passing  through  Bulgaria  with  illegal  narcotics  bound 
for  Europe.  The  press  noted  cooperation  between  customs  authori- 
ties and  the  UN  Commission  for  Narcotics  Control  in  efforts  to 
curtail  international  drug  trafficking.  The  UN  supported  these  ef- 
forts by  funding  construction  of  modern  border  checkpoints  in  Bul- 
garia. The  International  Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol) 
also  certified  that  Bulgaria  had  a  good  record  in  international  law 
enforcement.  In  Bulgaria  the  Directorate  of  Customs  and  Customs 
Control  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  was  responsible  for  preventing 
drug  trafficking;  however,  the  People's  Militia  and  Border  Troops 
also  were  active  in  the  counternarcotics  effort. 

The  Judicial  System 

In  1991  the  court  system  operated  basically  as  it  had  before  1989. 
The  administration  of  justice  was  based  on  the  penal  code  of  1968 
and  several  subsequent  amendments  to  it,  and  on  the  constitution 
of  1971.  In  general,  the  courts  had  little  independence  and  the 
Ministry  of  Justice  had  few  powers  under  the  former  regime.  In 
1991 ,  however,  the  National  Assembly  was  considering  draft  laws 
on  penal  procedure,  punishment,  courts,  amnesty,  state  secrets, 
and  travel  abroad.  It  sought  to  guarantee  accused  persons  access 
to  defense  counsel  during  each  phase  of  the  legal  process,  to  elimi- 
nate detention  on  suspicion,  and  to  ensure  that  three  judges  and 
four  lay  jurors,  called  assessors,  would  preside  over  trials  involv- 
ing particularly  grievous  crimes  in  which  the  death  penalty  would 
be  a  possible  sentence. 


265 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

The  court  system  consisted  of  municipal,  provincial,  and  mili- 
tary courts;  the  Supreme  Court;  and  public  prosecutors  at  cor- 
responding levels.  The  National  Assembly  elected  the  judges  of  the 
Supreme  Court,  its  president,  and  the  chief  prosecutor  to  five-year 
terms.  The  chief  prosecutor  selected  and  supervised  prosecutors 
to  serve  at  the  municipal  and  province  levels  and  enforced  compli- 
ance with  legal  standards  by  the  government,  its  officials,  and  all 
citizens,  prosecuting  cases  involving  major  crimes  detrimental  to 
the  national  interests  or  economy  of  Bulgaria.  Judges  at  lower  lev- 
els were  elected  to  five-year  terms  by  their  respective  constituen- 
cies. Conciliation  committees  in  enterprises  or  municipal  courts 
ruled  on  labor  disputes.  The  arbitration  court  adjudicated  civil  cases 
and  disputes  between  enterprises. 

Under  the  penal  code  inherited  from  the  Zhivkov  era,  crimes 
against  the  socialist  economy  or  socialist  property  generally  were 
punished  more  severely  than  crimes  against  persons.  Major  economic 
crimes,  misappropriation,  and  serious  malfeasance  were  punished 
rigorously.  Directors  and  managers  could  be  held  criminally  liable 
for  the  shortcomings  of  their  enterprises.  Six-year  prison  terms  were 
levied  for  crimes  such  as  conducting  private  economic  activity  while 
representing  a  state  enterprise  and  receiving  economic  benefits  for 
work  or  services  not  rendered.  Illegally  crossing  national  borders 
was  punishable  by  a  fine  of  3,000  leva  and  a  five-year  prison  term, 
with  heavier  penalties  for  recidivists.  In  the  reform  period,  an  in- 
creasing number  of  minor  offenses  were  changed  to  receive  adminis- 
trative punishments  such  as  fines  up  to  300  leva.  These  administrative 
proceedings  represented  rather  arbitrary  justice  because  the  accused 
did  not  have  the  right  to  trial  or  legal  counsel.  The  administrative 
proceedings  were  an  expedient  designed  to  alleviate  a  tremendous 
backlog  of  minor  cases.  Beginning  in  1990,  the  dismantling  of  the 
state  enterprise  system  called  for  shifting  the  emphasis  of  the  crimi- 
nal code  from  protection  of  state  property  to  protection  of  the  in- 
dividual. This  shift  was  attempted  in  the  new  constitution  ratified 
by  the  National  Assembly  in  July  1991.  Independence  of  the  judi- 
cial system,  needed  to  standardize  and  clarify  the  administration 
of  justice,  received  little  attention  in  initial  rounds  of  reform,  however 
(see  The  Judiciary,  ch.  4). 

The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs 

Under  Zhivkov  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  had  been  charged 
with  all  aspects  of  internal  and  external  security  in  peacetime.  Given 
this  assignment,  the  forces  under  the  ministry  had  vast  jurisdic- 
tion over  society  and  were  a  feared  and  hated  part  of  the  communist 
government.  For  that  reason,  reorganization  of  internal  security  and 
intelligence  operations  was  one  of  the  first  goals  of  the  post-Zhivkov 


266

regimes.  The  overthrow  of  Zhivkov  revealed  the  activities  of  Depart- 
ment Six,  the  "thought  police"  division  of  State  Security  that  had 
been  in  charge  of  monitoring  the  activity  of  dissidents.  Liquida- 
tion of  that  department  was  announced  within  a  month  of  Zhiv- 
kov's  ouster;  it  also  was  blamed  for  the  assaults  on  demonstrators 
that  had  received  world  publicity  at  the  time  of  the  1989  ecological 
conference  in  Sofia  (see  The  Ferment  of  1988-90,  ch.  4).  The  UDF 
and  other  political  organizations  called  for  a  complete  review  of 
past  investigations  to  identify  violations  of  civil  rights  by  the  minis- 
try, review  accusations  of  physical  abuse  during  detention,  improve 
prison  conditions,  and  overturn  sentences  applied  after  improper 
investigation.  The  remaining  prestige  of  the  ministry  was  demon- 
strated in  December  1990,  however,  when  it  and  the  defense  minis- 
try were  the  posts  most  hotly  contested  between  the  BSP  and  the 
UDF  in  formation  of  the  first  multiparty  cabinet.  At  that  time, 
a  civilian  became  head  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  for  the 
first  time  since  1944. 

The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  controlled  the  People's  Militia 
(police)  and  the  special  militarized  Internal  Security  Troops  known 
as  the  Red  Berets.  In  response  to  public  demands  for  reform,  a 
new  Independent  Trade  Union  Organization  of  Militia  Employees 


267 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

set  forth  reforms  to  improve  the  organization's  public  relations, 
which  remained  very  poor  in  1990.  Declaring  that  membership  in 
a  party  was  incompatible  with  nonpartisan  law  enforcement,  the 
union  called  for  the  depoliticization  and  professionalization  of  the 
militia  through  training  programs,  legal  definition  of  its  author- 
ity, and  visible  separation  from  influence  by  the  BSP,  with  which 
the  public  still  linked  the  militia.  The  force  also  sought  to  change 
its  name  from  "militia"  to  "police."  The  Commission  on  National 
Security  of  the  National  Assembly  supported  this  proposal,  and 
the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  itself  drafted  a  new  law  on  the  Peo- 
ple's Militia  for  consideration  by  the  National  Assembly. 

The  People's  Militia  controlled  several  subordinate  organizations, 
including  the  Territorial  Militia,  Road  Militia,  Commercial  Militia, 
Central  Investigations  Department,  Training  Department,  and  Ad- 
ministration Department.  The  Territorial  Militia  provided  law  en- 
forcement at  the  local  level.  Directorates  for  the  Territorial  Militia 
in  each  province  of  the  country  reported  to  the  People's  Militia 
at  the  national  level.  The  Road  Militia  acted  as  a  traffic  enforce- 
ment authority  similar  to  a  highway  patrol  or  state  police  force. 
The  Commercial  Militia  investigated  economic  crimes,  fraud,  and 
thefts.  The  Training  Department  supervised  the  training  of  per- 
sonnel for  the  People's  Militia.  It  operated  a  special  secondary  school 
to  train  sergeants  and  a  national  academy  to  train  officers.  Candi- 
dates studied  law  codes,  criminology,  criminal  procedure,  and  for- 
eign languages. 

The  Red  Berets  were  also  part  of  the  Ministry  for  Internal  Secu- 
rity. They  were  a  militarized,  light  infantry  force  responsible  for 
preventing  riots  and  other  civil  disturbances.  Their  15,000  per- 
sonnel were  organized  into  fifteen  regiments;  they  operated  over 
100  BTR-60  armored  personnel  carriers  equipped  for  riot  control. 
Together  with  the  People's  Militia  and  the  secret  police,  the  Red 
Berets  were  involved  in  the  infamous  Bulgarization  campaign  dur- 
ing 1984  and  1985  (see  Bulgaria  in  the  1980s,  ch.  1;  The  Turkish 
Problem,  ch.  4).  They  were  deployed  in  November  1990  to  main- 
tain order  in  Sofia  during  the  general  strike  that  toppled  the  BSP 
government. 

The  Penal  System 

Until  1990  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  operated  the  penal 
system  through  its  Central  Prison  Institutions  Department  and  its 
Prison  Service.  The  latter  organization  trained  and  administered 
prison  guards.  In  1990  the  system  included  thirteen  prisons  and 
twenty-six  minimum-security  facilities  housing  6,600  prisoners. 


268

Major  prisons  were  located  in  Bobov  Dol,  Pazardzhik,  Plovdiv, 
Sofia,  Stara  Zagora,  Varna,  and  Vratsa.  In  1990  authorities  re- 
ported that  the  total  prison  population  had  declined  by  10,000  as 
a  result  of  amnesties  granted  to  political  prisoners  during  the  previ- 
ous three  years.  The  remaining  prison  population  included  a  high 
percentage  of  repeat  offenders  and  prisoners  convicted  of  serious 
crimes.  The  institution  at  Pazardzhik  reported  more  than  560  in- 
mates, including  more  than  50  imprisoned  for  murder,  60  for  rape, 
140  for  other  crimes  against  persons,  and  the  balance  for  crimes 
against  property.  Offenders  guilty  of  less  serious  crimes  served  time 
in  minimum-security  facilities,  including  open  and  semi-open  labor 
camps.  Prison  strikes  and  demonstrations  began  with  the  Zhivkov 
ouster,  continuing  and  escalating  through  the  first  half  of  1990. 
Sparked  by  the  release  of  large  numbers  of  political  prisoners,  mas- 
sive strikes  elsewhere,  and  the  suddenly  volatile  sociopolitical  cli- 
mate, the  strikes  became  violent,  and  several  inmates  reportedly 
immolated  themselves  to  protest  prison  conditions.  Red  Berets  were 
called  upon  to  reinforce  Prison  Service  guards.  By  1991  Bulgaria 
had  already  implemented  one  stage  of  prison  reform  to  improve 
its  international  human  rights  image:  prisons  were  put  under  the 
Ministry  of  Justice  instead  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Security.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 


Security  and  Intelligence  Services 

In  1990  the  Bulgarian  state  security  system  was  substantially 
revamped  in  response  to  opposition  pressure  to  improve  the  sinister, 
oppressive  reputation  gained  by  agencies  of  the  Ministry  of  Inter- 
nal Affairs  during  the  Zhivkov  era.  After  encountering  strong 
resistance  from  party  functionaries  accustomed  to  using  their  po- 
sitions for  personal  gain,  the  realignment  used  the  American  security 
system  as  a  model  to  create  three  services  under  a  streamlined 
Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs.  The  National  Security  Service  (be- 
fore mid- 1991  called  the  National  Service  for  Defense  of  the  Con- 
stitution) was  given  responsibility  for  identifying  and  countering 
foreign  intelligence,  subversive,  or  terrorist  activities  affecting  the 
security,  territorial  integrity,  or  sovereignty  of  the  country.  It  had 
authority  for  domestic  law  enforcement  in  cases  involving  inter- 
national criminal  activity,  organized  crime,  smuggling,  political 
corruption,  and  illegal  fascist  or  nationalist  organizations.  The  new 
philosophy  announced  for  conduct  of  these  activities  included  inde- 
pendence from  all  political  parties,  oversight  by  the  Commission 
on  National  Security  of  the  National  Assembly,  and  recruitment 
according  to  professional  rather  than  political  qualification.  In  1990 
the  service  was  given  the  important  new  role  of  preventing  vio- 
lence during  elections. 

Unlike  the  catchall  National  Security  Service,  the  other  two  in- 
telligence agencies  had  very  specific  roles.  The  National  Protec- 
tion Service  was  formed  from  the  Department  of  Security  and 
Protection,  which  Zhivkov  had  turned  into  a  massive  organization 
with  unspecified  functions  ranging  from  personal  protection  to  sup- 
plying imported  cars  to  high  party  officials.  The  new  protection 
service  was  much  smaller  and  was  confined  to  physical  protection 
of  government  officials  and  foreign  dignitaries. 

The  third  security  agency,  the  National  Intelligence  Service,  was 
responsible  for  counterespionage  and  monitoring  activities  in  neigh- 
boring countries,  roles  filled  by  the  State  Security  (Durzhavna 
sigurnost,  DS)  prior  to  1990.  The  National  Intelligence  Service 
announced  a  personnel  cut  of  20  percent  in  1991,  but  even  in  the 
new  atmosphere  of  disclosure  little  else  was  reported  about  its  ac- 
tivity or  staffing.  After  the  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  the  Bul- 
garian counterintelligence  effort  continued  to  be  directed  against 
the  NATO  countries  adjacent  to  Bulgaria;  counterintelligence 
against  former  Warsaw  Pact  allies  remained  forbidden  under  a  mu- 
tual cooperation  agreement.  The  work  of  the  National  Intelligence 
Service  was  supplemented  by  the  Military  Counterintelligence 
Service,  which  was  moved  from  DS  jurisdiction  to  the  Ministry 


270 


National  Security 


of  National  Defense  in  1990.  The  military  service  reported  to  the 
General  Staff.  According  to  its  chief,  military  intelligence  was 
responsible  for  identifying  and  countering  subversive  actions,  in- 
cluding terrorism,  sabotage,  and  espionage.  Besides  foreign  intel- 
ligence services,  the  activities  of  military  intelligence  were  directed 
against  domestic  political  extremism  and  crime. 

After  reorganization  of  the  DS  agencies,  substantial  public  skep- 
ticism remained  about  the  role  of  the  secret  services  in  monitoring 
Bulgarian  society.  Some  Department  Six  agents  remained  active, 
and  in  1991  the  existence  of  still  undisclosed  Department  Six  files 
fueled  much  media  speculation.  Revelations  that  the  KGB  had  over- 
seen DS  activity  under  Zhivkov  brought  speculation  that  KGB 
agents  might  still  be  active  in  Bulgaria  after  the  Warsaw  Pact  ended. 
The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  claimed  that  only  two  agents  re- 
mained in  1991,  attached  to  the  Soviet  Embassy. 

Terrorist  and  Espionage  Activities 

Bulgaria's  involvement  in  international  terrorism  began  in  the 
early  twentieth  century  when  it  provided  sanctuary  and  a  base  of 
operations  to  the  Internal  Macedonian  Revolutionary  Organiza- 
tion (IMRO)  for  terrorist  activities  against  Yugoslavia  and  Greece. 
In  the  1920s  and  1930s,  IMRO  became  a  virtual  state  within  a 
state  in  southwestern  Bulgaria,  also  known  as  Pirin  Macedonia. 

From  the  beginning  of  the  first  communist  regime,  the  State  Secu- 
rity service  was  involved  in  conventional  intelligence  collection,  ille- 
gal technology  transfer,  and  covert  actions  abroad.  The  more  recent 
notoriety  of  the  State  Security  began  in  1978  when  it  was  accused 
of  murdering  prominent  emigre  Georgi  Markov  in  London.  Once 
a  protege  of  Zhivkov,  Markov  had  fled  Bulgaria  in  1969  and  was 
frequently  critical  of  his  former  mentor  in  Bulgarian  language 
broadcasts  for  the  British  Broadcasting  Corporation.  He  was 
stabbed  with  a  poison-tipped  umbrella  in  London,  assumedly  by 
a  Bulgarian  agent.  During  the  same  period,  at  least  two  similar 
assassination  attempts  were  made  on  emigres,  and  a  number  of 
Bulgarian  dissidents  received  threatening  letters.  In  1991  President 
Zheliu  Zhelev  agreed  to  open  a  full  investigation  of  the  Markov 
murder,  using  State  Security  files. 

Other  incidents  of  State  Security  activity  abroad  received  inter- 
national attention.  The  Bulgarian  Embassy  in  Egypt  was  closed 
in  1978  after  authorities  found  evidence  of  a  plot  to  incite  the  Egyp- 
tian population  to  overthrow  President  Anwar  al  Sadat.  In  the 
1980s,  Bulgaria  engaged  in  retaliatory  expulsions  of  Italian  and 
Turkish  diplomats  on  charges  of  espionage  at  a  time  when  rela- 
tions with  both  countries  were  strained.  The  most  infamous  incident 


271 


Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

was  the  State  Security's  alleged  involvement  in  the  attempted  as- 
sassination of  Pope  John  Paul  II  in  1981 .  In  that  case,  the  attacker, 
a  Turkish  radical,  claimed  that  the  Bulgarian  and  Soviet  intelligence 
agencies  had  masterminded  his  plan  in  order  to  eliminate  the  Pol- 
ish pope's  political  influence  in  Eastern  Europe.  Three  Bulgarians 
identified  as  coconspirators  were  acquitted  in  1986,  but  the  inci- 
dent caused  the  United  States  Department  of  State  to  place  Bul- 
garia on  its  list  of  countries  sponsoring  terrorism. 

A  leader  of  the  Red  Brigades,  an  Italian  terrorist  group  that  kid- 
napped a  U.S.  Army  general  in  1981,  later  implicated  Bulgaria  in 
the  kidnap  plot.  The  terrorist  asserted  that  the  aim  of  Bulgarian  in- 
telligence was  to  destabilize  Italy  and  gain  information  about  NATO. 
The  terrorists  were  ostensibly  offered  training,  arms,  and  logistical 
assistance  in  this  operation.  A  Bulgarian  diplomat  was  expelled  from 
Japan  for  spying  on  the  Japanese  biotechnology  and  genetic  engineer- 
ing industry  in  1983.  In  1990  the  UDF  asserted  that  it  possessed 
documents  detailing  the  connections  between  the  ousted  Zhivkov 
regime  and  international  terrorists  as  well  as  the  operation  of  ter- 
rorist training  centers  in  Bulgaria.  In  1991  the  government  of  Prime 
Minister  Dimitur  Popov  pledged  to  disclose  additional  information 
on  intelligence  activities  under  Zhivkov. 

During  the  Turkish  assimilation  campaign  of  1984-85,  the  DS, 
People's  Militia,  Red  Berets,  and  the  army  were  reported  as  using 
violence  against  ethnic  Turks  who  resisted  adopting  Bulgarian  names 
in  place  of  their  Turkish  ones.  As  many  as  several  hundred  ethnic 
Turks  may  have  been  killed  by  secret  police  during  this  campaign. 
Additional  hundreds  of  Turks  were  forcibly  resettled,  arrested,  or 
imprisoned  for  refusing  to  cooperate  with  the  assimilation  measures. 
Bulgarian  authorities  blamed  ethnic  Turks  for  a  bombing  campaign 
in  which  thirty  Bulgarians  were  killed  in  public  places  in  1984  and 
1985.  Although  guilt  was  never  established,  the  terrorist  acts  aroused 
ethnic  feeling  that  supported  the  Bulgarization  campaign.  As  the 
1990s  began,  the  Bulgarian  civilian  government  had  asserted  con- 
trol over  all  internal  security  agencies,  inspiring  the  hope  that  a  more 
open  society  would  result.

English-language  sources  on  Bulgarian  national  security,  the 
armed  forces,  and  law  and  order  are  relatively  few.  Stephen  Ashley's 
1 989  article  in  The  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  Balkans,  edited  by  Jonathan 
Eyal,  is  the  best  treatment  of  the  BP  A  and  Bulgarian  security.  F. 
Stephen  Larrabee's  article  "Long  Memories  and  Short  Fuses"  sets 
a  context  for  understanding  the  security  environment  in  which  the 


272 


National  Security 


country  found  itself  as  the  Warsaw  Pact  disbanded  and  traditional 
conflicts  reemerged  in  the  Balkans.  A  1982  book  by  Ivan  Volgyes, 
The  Political  Reliability  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  Armies,  remains  a  good  over- 
view of  BPA  force  structure  and  personnel.  Michael  M.  Boll's  The 
Soviet- Bulgarian  Alliance  on  Bulgarian  security  policies  is  useful  but 
dated.  Official  Bulgarian  data  supplied  for  the  Treaty  on  Conven- 
tional Armed  Forces  in  Europe  and  The  Military  Balance  provide 
detail  on  the  organization,  structure,  strength,  and  disposition  of 
ground  forces  and  air  and  air  defense  forces.  Milan  Vego  covers 
the  naval  forces  in  "Special  Focus:  The  Bulgarian  Navy"  in  the 
U.  S.  Naval  Institute  Proceedings.  Given  increasingly  open  coverage 
of  national  security  issues  in  primary  sources,  translations  of  the 
Bulgarian  press  by  the  Foreign  Broadcast  Information  Service  and 
Joint  Publications  Research  Service  provide  information  on  cur- 
rent developments.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,

late  1980s  to  official  Soviet  program  of  revitalization  of  the  com- 
munist party,  economy,  and  society  by  adjusting  economic, 
social,  and  political  mechanisms.  Identified  with  the  tenure  of 
Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev  as  leader  of  the  Soviet  Union  (1985-91). 

Shia — A  member  of  the  smaller  of  the  two  divisions  of  Islam,  sup- 
porting the  claims  of  Ali  to  leadership  of  the  Muslim  commu- 
nity, in  opposition  to  the  Sunni  (q.v.)  view  of  succession  to 
Muslim  leadership — the  issue  causing  the  central  schism  within 
Islam. 

Solidarity — An  independent  trade  union  founded  in  1980  in  com- 
munist Poland.  For  its  defiance  of  the  communist  system,  the 
union  attained  great  political  power  through  the  loyalty  of  a 
large  part  of  the  Polish  population.  Under  the  leadership  of 
Lech  Walesa,  it  eventually  formed  the  basis  of  the  first  post- 
war noncommunist  Polish  government.

Bulgaria:  A  Country  Study 

Sunni — A  member  of  the  larger  of  the  two  fundamental  divisions 
of  Islam,  opposed  to  the  Shia  (q.  v.)  on  the  issue  of  succession 
to  Muslim  leadership. 

ton  kilometers — The  total  number  of  tons  of  cargo  conveyed  via 
a  given  mode  of  transportation  in  a  specified  period  of  time. 

Warsaw  Pact — In  full,  Warsaw  Treaty  Organization,  a  mutual 
defense  organization  including  the  Soviet  Union,  Albania 
(which  withdrew  in  1961),  Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  the  Ger- 
man Democratic  Republic  (East  Germany),  Hungary,  Poland, 
and  Romania.  Founded  in  1955,  it  enabled  the  Soviet  Union 
to  station  troops  in  most  of  the  other  countries  to  oppose  the 
forces  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO,  q.  v. ) 
and  was  the  basis  of  invasions  of  Hungary  (1956)  and  Czecho- 
slovakia (1968).  Disbanded  in  1991. 

World  Bank — Informal  name  used  to  designate  a  group  of  four 
affiliated  international  institutions:  the  International  Bank  for 
Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),  the  International 
Development  Association  (IDA),  the  International  Finance  Cor- 
poration (IFC),  and  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee 
Agency  (MIGA).  The  IBRD,  established  in  1945,  has  as  its 
primary  purpose  the  provision  of  loans  to  developing  countries 
for  productive  projects.  The  IDA,  a  legally  separate  loan  fund 
but  administered  by  the  staff  of  the  IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960 
to  furnish  credits  to  the  poorest  developing  countries  on  much 
easier  terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC, 
founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD 
through  loans  and  assistance  designed  specifically  to  encourage 
the  growth  of  productive  private  enterprises  in  the  less- 
developed  countries.  The  MIGA,  founded  in  1988,  insures  pri- 
vate foreign  investment  in  developing  countries  against  vari- 
ous non-commercial  risks.  The  president  and  certain  senior 
officers  of  the  IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the  IFC.  The 
four  institutions  are  owned  by  the  governments  of  the  coun- 
tries that  subscribe  their  capital.  To  participate  in  the  World 
Bank  group,  member  states  must  first  belong  to  the  Interna- 
tional Monetary  Fund  (IMF — q.v.).
