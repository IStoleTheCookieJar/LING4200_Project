Notebook 


Fbr  everyone  who  works  inside  the 
Southern  Baptist  Convention  (SBC) 
Building  in  aowntown  Nashville,  the 
world  stood  still  on  March  5.  A  deadly 
threat  was  made,  people  were  frightened, 
and  Kingdom  work  was  hampered  while 
the  emergency'  was  addressed  (see  article  on 
opposite  page). 

To  untold  relief,  the  danger  of  anthrax 
contamination  from  a  letter  delivered  to 
the  building  was  determined  to  be  a  hoax, 
but  not  before  four  people  underwent  an 
uncomfortable  and  inconvenient  hosing 
with  bleach  and  water. 

Many  other  building  employees 
were  ordered  to  stay  at  their  desks,  in 
some  cases  not  being  allowed  a  lunch 
hour  or  bathroom  break  until  the  “all- 
dear"  was  sounded  several  hours 
later  by  local  emergency  response 
officials  and  building  administrators. 

There  was  good  reason  for  all  the 
draconian  precautions.  Bacilllts 
anthracis  in  its  airborne  state  can  be 
inhaled  into  the  lungs,  where  it 
quickiv  takes  hold  and  rapidly 
overwhelms  the  bodv  with  chills, 
fever,  dysentery',  ana  convulsions. 
H.  Death  comes  swiftly, 

ij.  If  you  haven't  yet  stopped  and 

*  '  offered  your  personal  prayer  of 
thankfulness  for  the  safety  of  our 
Christian  brothers  and  sisters 
caught  up  in  this  scare,  do  it  now.  This 
could  have  been  a  very  serious  situation. 

While  you're  at  it,  pray  also  for  the 
warped  person  or  group  who  for  some 
unknown  reason  decided  to  use  terrorism 
against  an  innocent  group  of  people 
they've  likely  never  met.  Pray  that  they 
will  find  the  peace  of  Jesus  and  forsake  the 
worldly  anger  that  consumes  them. 

Lastly,  ask  God  to  empower  you  —  to 
empower  all  of  us  —  to  continue  our  work  to 
reach  every  single  person  on  Earth  with  the

Good  News  that  Jesus  saves, 
even  in  the  face  of  such  dangers 
and  threats  to  our  well-being. 

That's  really  been  a  part  of 
the  Christian  faith  all  along. 

Substitute  swords,  guns,  and 
hungry  lions  for  anthrax,  and 
one  can  draw  a  pretty  accu¬ 
rate  picture  of  Christianity  for 
the  past  two  millennia. 

We  Americans,  comfort¬ 
able  behind  our  insulating 
shores  and  powerful  military 
system  in  the  most  Christian- 
-■populated  nation  on  the  plan¬ 
et,  tend  to  forget  that  we  are 
an  historical  exception. 

From  the  earliest  days 
through  our  modern  day, 

Christians  around  the  world 
have  been  persecuted,  tor¬ 
tured,  slaughtered,  enslaved, 
and  otherwise  mistreated  in 
wavs  that  defy  imagination. 

We  don't  know  what  that's 
like,  but  we're  beginning  to  get 
a  little  taste  of  it.  As  we  contest 
to  be  heard  in  the  public  con¬ 
versation  of  this  country,  we 
can  expect  more  threats. 

As  we  speak  boldly  against 
the  sin  raging  through  our  land, 
we  should  anticipate  the  vilifi¬ 
cations  and  demonizations  that 
inevitably  follow  politically-incorrect  behav¬ 
ior.  Such  is  the  state  of  American  society. 

We  must  not  be  caught  unprepared. 
First,  pray  without  ceasing  for  the  faith  and 
strength  to  stay  the  course. 

Secondly,  don't  fail  to  prepare  yourself 
and  your  church  for  the  possibility  of  such 
danger.  How  would  you  react  if  you  found 
an  “anthrax  letter"  hidden  behind  a  baby 
bed  in  your  church  nursery?  Would  you 
know  what  to  do  to  protect  yourself  and 


others?  Would  the  church  leadership  know 
how  to  respond? 

For  that  matter,  does  your  church  have 
an  emergency  plan  for  tornadoes  and  fire? 

If  you  can't  answer  all  those  questions 
affirmatively,  it's  time  to  contact  tne  emer¬ 
gency  response  agencies  in  your  area. 

Someone  in  the  SBC  Building  in 
Nashville  knew  what  to  do.  You  and  your 
church  should  know,  too.  In  our  crazy 
World,  to  do  otherwise  is  to  court  tragedy. 


What  does  the  addict 
look  like?  Is  he  old  or 
voung?  Is  he  black  or  white?  Is 
he  even  a  he?  Can  an  addict  be 
a  young  girl,  a  grown  woman, 
or  an  elderly  lady?  Is  the  addict 
rich  or  poor?  Is  the  addict  edu¬ 
cated  or  uneducated? 

The  answer  to  these  ques¬ 
tions  is,  "all  of  the  above.  The 
addict  can  be  —  and  is  —  every 
man.  He  looks  like  your  next- 
door  neighbor,  your  minister, 
or  your  lawyer. 

In  my  work  in  the  field  of 
alcoholism  and  drug  addiction, 
I  have  found  common  miscon¬ 
ceptions  of  who  the  addict  is,  or 
what  the  addict  does. 

We  hear  statements  such  as: 
"I  can't  be  an  alcoholic,  I  only 
drink  beer,"  or  "I  only  drink 
wine."  Addicts  tell  us  tnat  they 
are  still  working,  so  they  can't 
be  addicted. 

Other  statements  we  hear 
are:  "She  only  drinks  at  bed¬ 
time  to  get  some  rest,"  or  "I 
only  take  the  drugs  the  doctor 
gives  me." 

What  we  don't  hear  is  that 
the  person  is  going  to  three  or 
four  doctors  getting  many  pre¬ 
scriptions  for  their  drug  of 
choice. 

One  of  the  most  common 
misconceptions  is  that  you  can¬ 
not  help  an  addict  until  he 
wants  help.  This  is  not  true. 

Most  addicts  don't  know 
they  need  help.  Their  drug  of

choice  tells 
them  that  it  is 
their  best 
friend.  It  tells 
them  that  life 
would  not  be 
life  without 
their  use. 

Alcoholism 
and  other 
drug  addic¬ 
tions  will 
erode  the 
vitality  of  our 
state  and 
nation. 

We  read  in 
the  newspa¬ 
pers  about 
drug  traffick¬ 
ing  and  crack 
houses,  but 
we  don't  hear 
about  the 
other  major 
problems  that 
alcoholism 
and  other 


s4tco6ot  and

drug  addic¬ 
tions  cause. 

One  of  the 
other  prob¬ 
lems  is  rising 
health  care 
costs. 

The 
untreated 
addict  is  esti¬ 
mated  to  use 
ten  times  the 
medical  ser¬ 
vices  of  a 
non-addict. 

Another 
related  prob¬ 
lem  is  crime 
and  prison 
overcrowd¬ 
ing.  Eighty 
percent  of 
criminal 
defendants 
are  addicted. 

Workplace 
productivity 
is  affected. 


Untreated  addicts  cost 
American  businesses  $100  bil¬ 
lion  each  year. 

Families  suffer.  Millions  of 
babies  are  bom  into  families 
scarred  by  addiction. 

We  in  Mississippi  sometimes 
think  wy  do  not  nave  the  same 
problems  as  other  areas  of  the 
country.  In  some  ways  we  are 
correct,  but  not  in  talking  about 
addiction. 

In  my  work  I  have  seen  all  of 
these  things  happen  here  in 
Mississippi. 

I  have  seen  13-year-old  chil¬ 
dren  with  advanced  alcohol- 
induced  liver  disease. 

I  have  seen  an  80-year-old 
retired  man  addicted  to  crack. 

I  have  seen  Mississippi  fami¬ 
lies  devastated  by  addiction. 

I  have  had  grammar  school 
children  ask  me  how  they  can 
get  home  without  being 
harassed  by  drug  dealers. 

It  is  most  important  that  on 
March  21  —  Alcohol  and  Drug 
Abuse  Awareness  Sunday 
acrqss  the  Southern  Baptist 
Convention  —  we  raise  our 
voices  from  our  pulpits  and 
pews  about  this  killer  who  lives 
in  our  midst. 

If  the  church  fails  to  address 
this  ever-pressing  and  growing 
problem,  then  God  help  us.

Staying  Well 


New  Technology  Helping  Diagnose  Breast  Cancer 


Linda  Brown  of  Jackson  was  shocked  early  this  year  to  learn  she  had  breast 
cancer.  The  wife  and  mother  of  two  took  the  news  hard,  but  with  resolve  to 
fight.  After  her  initial  diagnosis,  she  was  referred  to  Dr.  Phillip  Ley,  a  surgeon 
at  Baptist  who  specializes  in  breast  cancer  cases. 

Mrs.  Brown's  treatment  required  the  immediate  steps  of  surgery  and 
chemotherapy.  But  she  also  agreed  to  join  others  who  were  researching  a 
new  treatment  technique:  intraoperative  lymphatic  mapping.  "My  dad  died 
of  cancer  19  years  ago,  and  I  know  the  importance  of  research,"  she  explains 
"The  progress  made  in  cancer  treatment  has  been  because  of  research. 
When  (Dr.  Ley)  told  me  this  treatment  was  research,  I  jumped  on  board." 

This  new  procedure,  performed  for  the  first  time  in  Mississippi  by  Dr.  Ley 
and  later  by  Dr.  Alexander  Haick,  involves  checking  for  the  presence  of 
microscopic  cancer  cells  in  the  lymph  nodes.  Examination  of  the  lymph 
nodes  can  determine  if  cancer  has  spread  to  the  lymphatic  system,  and  can 
affect  the  type  and  amount  of  treatment.  With  traditional  methods,  it  is  often 
necessary  to  remove  most  of  the  lymph  nodes,  but  the  new  technology  allows 
the  surgeon  to  examine  a  small  lymphatic  portion  called  the  sentinel  node. 

If  the  sentinel  node  biopsy  determines  that  there  is  no  cancer  (as  in  about 
two-thirds  of  patients),  the  patient  may  ultimately  be  spared  the  added 
stress  of  more  surgery.  Sentinel  node  procedures  have  also  been  shown  to 
leave  the  patient  with  fewer  side  effects  and  shorter  recovery  times,  but  are 
not  yet  the  standard  of  care  Lymphatic  mapping  and  sentinel  node  biopsy 
may  eventually  replace  routine  lymph  node  dissection. 

Mrs  Brown  is  now  undergoing  chemotherapy.  Despite  her  ordeal,  she 
remains  optimistic  and  grateful  for  the  support  she's  received,  and 
determined  to  use  her  experience  to  help  others  realize  the  importance  of 
regular  breast  exams.  "Over  the  last  few  weeks,  I've  had  numerous  friends 
and  acquaintances  tell  me  they're  going  to  get  checked,"  she  says. 

Understanding  the  Benefits  of  Sentinel  Node  lymphatic  Mapping

Life  vs.  destruction 


Psalm  1:1-6 


By  Ken  Hester 


Johnny  Carson  once  said 
that  if  you're  trilingual,  you're 
a  genius;  if  you're  bilingual, 
you're  above  average  intelli¬ 
gence;  and  if  you  speak  only 
one  language,  you're 
American.  Even  though  most 
of  us  speak  only  one  language, 
I  am  thankful  that  our  God 
communicates  his  character  to 
us  in  many  different  ways. 

In  Psalm  19,  God  announces 
his  glory,  his  morality,  and  his 
authority  using  three  different 
methods  of  communication. 

The  skies  declare  God's 
glory.  The  heavens'  sermon  is 
full  of  variety  (19:1-4).  In  verse 
one  in  the  original  Hebrew,  the 
words  "heavens"  and  "declare" 
are  plural,  and  yet,  the  "glory 


of  God"  is  singular. 

This  word  construc¬ 
tion  implies  that  it 
takes  the  variety  of  Hester 
cloud  shapes,  the  myr¬ 
iad  of  colors  in  sunsets,  the  t< 
inspiring  positions  of  rainbows,  t' 
the  power  of  storms,  along  with  v 
the  diverse  awe  of  the  nignt  sky  t< 
to  begin  to  speak  to  the  single 
subject  of  God's  glory.  Their  L 
sermon  is  constant  (v.  2)  and  s 
comprehensive  to  the  various  tl 
peoples  of  this  earth  (v.s  3-4).  o 
Tne  heavens'  sermon  is  also 
full  of  vibrancy.  In  verse  five,  v 
David  compares  the  passion  of  1 
the  heavens'  sermon  to  the  thrill  f 
of  a  groom  after  the  honeymoon  1 
and  a  champion  runner  before  t 
running  his  favorite  run.  h 

In  verse  six,  David  describes  tl 
their  sermon  as  probing.  As  the  f 


sun  covers  the  entire  con¬ 
gregation  of  the  earth,  the 
neat  of  the  sermon 
warms  those  chilled  by 
loneliness,  melting  cold 
hearts,  and  causing  those 
who  commit  evil  acts  to 
sweat.  God's  glory,  how¬ 
ever,  is  just  the  beginning 
of -his  character, 
r  'The  Scripture  declares 

God's  morality.  While 
today's  society  regards  morali¬ 
ty's  lines  as  limitations,  God 
views  his  morality  lines  as  pro¬ 
tection. 

In  verses  seven  through  11, 
Dav  id  makes  a  case  for  wny  we 
should  trust  God's  morality.  In 
these  verses,  he  gives  six  names 
of  God's  Word. 

He  first  mentions  the  law, 
which  the  Jews  called  the 
Torah  and  we  know  as  the  first 
five  books  of  the  Old 
Testament.  Second,  he  men¬ 
tions  God's  testimony  about 
himself.  Third,  he  wrote  about 
the  statutes,  or  precepts.  When 
David  wrote  of  "commands," 


he  was  referring  to  doctrine. 

David's  use  of  "fear"  refers 
to  God's  judgement.  The  "ordi¬ 
nances,"  or  "judgements"  of 
God  direct  the  reader  to  Israel's 
legal  law.  This  group  of  verses 
correspondingly  describes 
those  aspects  of  God's  Word  as 
perfect,  sure,  right,  pure,  clean,, 
true  and  righteous,  as  well  as 
precious  and  sweet. 

These  verses  also  indicate 
corresponding  effects  upon 
embracing  God's  Word  as 
reviving  tne  soul,  making  the 
simple  vv'ise,  giving  joy  to  the 
heart,  giving  light  to  the  eyes, 
satisfying  one's  spiritual  palate, 
w'arning  God's  servant  as  well 
as  giving  him/her  reward. 

Although  the  Scriptures 
reveal  the  morality  of  God's 
character,  the  final  word  about 
God's  character  is  addressed  in 
the  next  v  erses. 

The  servants  declare  God's 
authority.  The  servant  gives 
God  authority  ‘even  in  seclu¬ 
sion  (v.12).  Obadiah  Sedgwick 
wrote,  "It  is  the  desire  of  a  holy 


fierson  to  be  cleansed,  not  only 
rom  public,  but  also  from  pri¬ 
vate  and  secret  sins." 

The  servant  also  gives  God 
authority  in  decisions  (v.  13). 
Rabbis  distinguish  all  sins  as 
those  committed  ignorantly  or 
presumptuously.  Victory  over 
sin  begins  with  submitting  our 
will  to  God  in  prayer.. 

The  servant  also  gives  God 
authority  in  actions  (v.  14).  No 
pulpit  can  equal  the  effective¬ 
ness  of  one's  daily  lifestyle. 

Many  people  recognize  the 
God  of  creation.  Many  still 
appreciate  the  morality  of 
Scripture.  Few,  however,  take 
the  road  of  living  under  GodS 
authority. 

Questions  for  class  discus¬ 
sion:  Who  speaks  in  verses  1-4? 
Is  the  truth  of  God  revealed  in 
nature  obvious  to  everyone? 
Why  or  why  not?  Which  of 
David's  "one-liners"  about 
God's  law'  best  matches  your 
experience  with  Scripture?

John  3:1-17 


Bv  Beth  W .  Cape 


Whenever  I  hear  the  story  of 
Nicodemus  I  can't  help  but 
remember  a  song  we  often  sang 
in  our  country  church  in 
Moselle,  Mississippi.  It  goes 
like  this: 

"Old  Nicodemus  went  call¬ 
in'  to  see  the  Lord  one  night. 
Said  'Master,  somethin's 
wrong  with  me.  My  heart's  not 
feelin'  right.'  'You'll  never 
change  that  feelin',  son,'  my 
Master  did  reply.  'You'll  only 
know  the  answ'er  when  you've 
been  born  again.' 

Thank  God  for  the  song 
directors  (that's  what  we  called 
them  back  then),  the  preachers, 
and  the  many  teachers  who 


taught  me  about  being 
born  again  in  my 
twenty-  two  years  at 
that  church.  Cape 

Like  Nicodemus, 
people  all  over  the  w'orld  1 
search  for  a  deeper  meaning  to 
life.  They  search  for  answers  to  1 
the  spiritual  questions  of  life.  I 
In  Japan  people  visit  | 
Buddhist  and  Sninto  temples  : 
that  are  found  throughout  that  1 
country.  They  go  before  the 
altar  and  ring  a  bell  or  clap  their  ] 
hands  to  w'ake  up  their  gods,  i 
Many  Japanese  people  nave  i 
altars  in  their  homes  where  they  j 
place  food  and  water  for  their  1 
gods.  Thev  don't  know  about  < 
the  God  who  never  sleeps  and 
doesn't  need  their  food  offer-  l 


ings  —  the  Savior  who 
died  because*  of  his  love 
for  them! 

Manv  people  in  our 
country  try  to  hide  their 
need  for  God.  They 
search  for  fulfillment 
through  work,  or  money, 
or  material  things.  Even 
people  who  have  been 
born  again  find  it  so  easy 
to  forget  the  most  impor¬ 
tant  things  in  life. 

Nicodemus  w*as  searching 
for  answers,  and  he  went  to 
the  right  place.  Jesus  didn't 
give  him  easy  answers  but 
said  things  that  would  make 
him  think. 

The  conversation  between 
Jesus  and  Nicodemus  can  help 
us  understand  that  our  jour¬ 
ney  of  faith  is  a  continuous 
journey.  Just  like  our  physical 
birth,  our  spiritual  nirth  is 
only  the  beginning. 

As  we  search  for  answers 
to  our  many  questions  in  life. 


we  have  to  go  to  the  right 
place.  Hebrews  4:15-16  says, 
5'But  we  do  not  have  a  high 
priest  who  cannot  sympathize 
with  our  weaknesses  but  one 
who  has  been  tempted  in  all 
ways  as  we  are,  yet  without 
sin.  Let  us  therefore  draw 
near  with  confidence  to  the 
throne  of  grace  that  we  may 
receive  mercy  and  find  grace 
to  help  in  time  of  need." 

We  are  to  go  boldly  to  that 
throne  of  grace  with  our  ques¬ 
tions,  with  our  needs.  We  will 
find  him  there.  He  expects  us  to 
fail.  He  knows  we  are  but 
babes,  and  what  can  one  expect 
from  a  baby? 

In  his  book  Gentle  Thunder, 
Max  Lucado  says  it  like  this: 
"Look  at  the  newborn  baby. 
What  can  he  do?  Can  he  walk? 
Can  he  feed  himself?  No,  not 
yet.  But  someday  he  will.  It 
takes  time  to  grow.  But  is  the 
parent  ashamed  of  the  baby?  Of 
course  not.  They-  are  proud. 


They  know  that  growth  will 
come  with  time.  So  does  God. 
God  is  often  more  patient  with 
us  than  we  are  with  ourselves. 
We  assume  that  if  we  fail,  we 
aren't  bom  again.  If  we  stum¬ 
ble,  then  we  aren't  truly  con¬ 
verted.  If  we  have  the  old 
desires,  then  we  must  not  be  a 
new  creation. 

"In  many  ways  your  new 
birth  is  like  your  first:  In  your 
new  birth  God  provides  what 
you  need;  someone  else  feels 
the  pain,  and  someone  else 
does  the  work.  And  just  as 
parents  are  patient  with  their 
newborn,  so  God  is  patient 
with  you.  But  there  is  one  dif¬ 
ference.  The  first  time  you 
had  no  choice  about  being 
born;  this  time  you  do.  The 
power  is  God's.  The  effort  is 
God's.  The  pain  is  God's.  But 
the  choice  is  yours."

family  ministry  at  First  Church,

Life  and  Work 

Staying  focused 


Mark  13:5-13,  35-37 


By  Doug  Bain 


How  are  we  as  believers  to 
live  out  our  faith  in  today's 
unsettled  world?  How  are  we 
to  demonstrate  bold  disciple- 
ship  in  an  uncertain  context  of 
"wnat  if?" 

Mark  13,  "the  Little 
Apocalypse,"  may  seem  an 
unlikely  source  for  guidance  in 
times  of  distress  and  upheaval. 
It  is  a  passage  in  which  lesus 
addressed  both  the  destruction 
of  Jerusalem  and  the  return  of 
the  Son  of  Man.  The  apocalyptic 
form  of  thought,  whicn  surfaces 
in  times  of  impending  crisis, 
directs  attention  to  absolute  con¬ 
fidence  in  God  and  faithfulness 
during  the  present  crisis.  Rather 
than  searching  for  esoteric  infor¬ 


mation  about  end 
times,  we  need  to 
stav  focused  on 
issues  of  faithful  obe-  Bair 

dience.  That  focus  ' 
will  orient  us  toward  disciple- 
ship  that  is  courageous  indeed. 

Not  fooled  by  unsettling 
events  (vv.  5-8).  False  claims 
about  a  messiah  or  frightening 
reports  of  an  impending  disas¬ 
ter  were  not  to  deceive  the  dis¬ 
ciples  nor  to  divert  their  atten¬ 
tion.  Such  e\  ents  are  part  of  the 
fabric  of  history  but  do  not  sig¬ 
nal  the  ultimate  end. 

Believers  are  to  keep  alert 
and  watch  and  not  be  caught 
unaware.  Our  lives  and  our 
Christian  service  cannot  be  dis¬ 
rupted  b}  panic  and  fear  of 
unsettling  events,  limes  of  dis¬ 


aster  and  crisis  have  his¬ 
torically  brought  believers 
together.  We  are  to  share 
and  rebuild  rather  than 
have  a  bunker  mentality 
and  hole  up  in  isolation. 

God  is  God  even  in 
disturbing  times,  as 
when  Jerusalem  was  fac¬ 
ing  the  Y70  crisis  and  cer¬ 
tain  destruction  because 
of  rising  Zealot  terrorism. 
A  flood  of  data  about  disrup¬ 
tion  of  supplies  and  services 
should  not  obscure  our  faith 
that  God  alone  is  still  in  con¬ 
trol  of  history  and  will  bring 
his  purposes  to  pass 

Dependence  on  the  Holy 
Spirit  (v\.  9-11).  In  Palestine 
under  Roman  rule,  the  disci¬ 
ples  expected  to  suffer  arrests 
and  beatings  because  of  their 
Christian  faith.  Their  sufferings 
were  opportunities'*^  signifi¬ 
cant  witness  as  the  Holy  Spirit 
empowered  them. 

Disorienting  e\  ents  are  occa- 
sions  tor  reorientation.  .  The 


Holy  Spirit  works  within 
believers  to  use  distressing  sit¬ 
uations  as  times  for  dynamic 
caring  and  sharing. 

Living  in  light  his 
promise  (vv.  12-13).  Jesus 
taught  his  disciples  that  they 
would  experience  betrayal, 
hatred,  and  even  death  on 
account  of  him,  but  they  were 
to  be  steadfast,  unmovable, 
standing  firm  to  the  last.  It  was 
in  those  times  of  upheaval  that 
their  faith  would  stand  them 
in  good  stead." 

When  under  hostile  attacks 
because  of  Christian  belief,  we 
are  to  live  in  light  of  God's 
promises.  Standing  firm  to  the 
end  shows  a  faith  grounded  in 
the  absolute  certainty  of  God's 
promise. 

Staying  alert  (vv.  35-37). 
Rather  than  being  paralyzed  by 
fear  of  "what  if,  or  consumed 
bv  worry  over  potential  disaster, 
believers  are  to  stay  alert  —  liv¬ 
ing  yvith  the  certainty  of  Christ's 
return.  His  return  is  always 


imminent.  It  refers  not  so  much 
to  a  certain  point  in  time,  but 
that  ultimate  kind  of  time  which 
is  always  impinging  on  history, 
hovering  over  history.  This  ulti¬ 
mate  time  which  is  alw-ays  on 
the  horizon,  is  like  an  alternate 
time  zone,  parallel  to  and  even 
breaking  into  history,  giving  our 
time  urgency! 

Alert,  focused,  and  always 
ready;  not  overwhelmed  by 
unsettling  events  or  reports; 
not  complacent  in  faith;  not  dis¬ 
tracted  from  the  assignment; 
not  distracted  by  speculation 
about  the  end;  not  distracted  by 
fear  or  frenzied  activity  to 
endure  security;  but  focused  on 
significant  discipleship  and  on 
absolute  confidence  in  God. 
This  is  the  challenge  for  the 
believer  in  times  of  impending 
upheaval:  to  be  focused  on 
faithful  discipleship  and  on  the 
faithfulness  of  God!

A  portion  of  The  Village  View  is  allocated  each 
month  to  a  list  of  Gifts  of  Honor  and  Memory. 
Many  groups  and  individuals  elect  to  pay  tribute  to 
others  through  this  sensitive,  meaningful  and  help¬ 
ful  medium.  This  feature  is  hopefully  designed  to 
further  honor,  with  taste  and  respect,  those  who  are 
and  have  been  special  to  our  special  friends.

Group  sets  out  to  change  face  of  Ohio  city 


REVIEWING  PLANS  — 
Three  members  of  the  Greater 
Youngstown  Coalition  of 
Christians  (GYCC)  board  of 
spiritual  overseers  review  plans 
for  a  regional  leadership  con¬ 
ference,  held  bach  fall  in  the 
Ohio  city:  (from  left)  Jim  Cook,

YOUNGSTOWN,  Ohio  (BP) 
—  Finding  the  key  to  urban 
renewal  and  social  reform  in 
America  is  as  easy  as  checking 
a  Bible's  table  of  contents,  said 
Dwight  Dumas. 

"Many  letters  which  vPaul 
wrote  were  directed  to  believ¬ 
ers  in  specific  geographic 
regions  —  Corinth,  Ephesus, 
Philippi  — ,not  to  one  denomi¬ 
nation  or  one  church,"  said 
Dumas,  executive  director  of 
the  Greater  Youngstown 
Coalition  of  Christians  (GYCC). 

"The  believers  worked  as

one  body  to  reach  their  area  for 
Christ.  That's  our  model.  We 
will  no  longer  be  separated  by 
our  racial,  denominational  or 
socio-economic  differences.  We 
are  the  church  of  Youngstown." 

Since  1994,  dozens  of 
churches  among  the 
Youngstown  area's  225,000 
population  have  joined  togeth¬ 
er  to  form  the  Greater 
Youngstown  Coalition  of 
Christians.  Today,  with  more 
than  25,000  Christians  in  60 
churches  involved  in  educa¬ 
tional,  social,  economic,  urban 
renewal,  and  health¬ 
care  programs,  the 
GYCC  has  kindled  a 
revitalization  in  town. 

Like  nearby  Cleve¬ 
land  and  Pittsburgh, 
Youngstown  became 
heavily  invested  in  the 
steel  industry  after 
World  War  II. 

Unlike  its  neighbors, 
in  the  late  1970s  when 
the  steel  business 
declined, 
Youngstown's  lack  of 
economic  diversity  led 
to  a  severe  recession. 

As  people  left  the 
city,  so  did  churches, 
and  the  Christians  in 
Youngstown  lost  their 
effectiveness  and  influ¬ 
ence  in  the  urban  set¬ 
ting. 

In  the  early  1990s, 


several  local  pastors  realized 
that  reconciliation  between  the 
diverse  groups  of  Youngstown 
Christians  was  the  only  solu¬ 
tion  to  the  town's  troubles. 

"A  small  group  of  us  would 
meet  every  Friday  morning  to 
pray  for  renewal  together,"  said 
Gary  Frost,  pastor  of  Rising  Star 
Church  in  Youngstown  ana  for¬ 
mer  second  vice-president  of  the 
Southern  Baptist  Convention. 

"We  had  a  real  burden  for 
Youngstown  and  knew  that 
Christian  unity  was  the  only 
answer." 

In  four  short  years,  led  by 
nine  pastors  who  form  a  board 
of  spiritual  overseers  and  nine 
laypeople  who  serve  as  the 
board  of  directors,  the  GYCC 
already  has  taken  major  steps 
toward  fulfilling  its  mission. 

This  diverse  group  of 
Christians  —  black  and  white, 
urban  and  suburban,  encom¬ 
passing  25  denominations  — 
nas  established  a  school,  devel¬ 
oped  plans  for  job  training  and 
a  Christian  health  clinic,  and 
provided  social  service  infor¬ 
mation  for  families. 

Working  side  by  side  for 
urban  renewal  strengthens 
churches'  Christian  unity, 
which  in  turn  increases  their 
ministry's  power,  Dumas  said. 

"Our  churches  are  beginning 
to  understand  that  we  need  one 
another  regardless  of  denomi¬ 
national  and  socio-economic 


differences,"  he  said.  "Because 
of  our  inward  oneness  in 
Christ,  we  are  more  effective  in 
reaching  outward. 

"Some  people  here  don't 
trust  Christians.  They  see  you 
as  just  a  'do-gooder,'  so  we 
have  to  overcome  that  barrier. 
Plus,  there  have  been  so  many 
swindlers  who  have  come 
through  Youngstown,  so  many 
housing  initiatives  in  the  1970s 
and  1980s  which  were  started 
but  never  finished." 

American  Christians  are 
hungry  for  these  success  sto¬ 
ries.  Dumas  regularly  travels 
the  nation  sharing 

Youngstown's  vision  with 
other  communities. 

He  recently  spoke  at  a  Tony 
Evans  Urban  Alternative  con¬ 
ference  in  Dallas  and  a  commu¬ 
nity  mobilization  conference 
for  pastors  in  Toledo,  Ohio. 

'Tor  too  long,  division  has 
kept  Christians  from  having 
the  influence  we  could  have 
had,"  Frost  said. 

"Now,  through  prayer  and 
working  together  as  churches 
and  communities  across  racial, 
denominational,  and  socio-eco¬ 
nomic  lines,  we've  seen  God  do 
larger  things  in  our  city,  super¬ 
natural  things. 

"Christians  are  supposed  to 
be  the  salt  and  light  to  our 
world.  In  Youngstown,  we've 
found  that  we're  saltier  and 
brighter  together,"  Frost  said. 


Youngstown  school  offering  kids  'another  choice' 


YOUNGSTOWN,  Ohio  (BP) 
—  Poorly  funded  public 
schools,  expensive  private 
schools,  or  the  challenge  of 
homeschooling.  Parents  in 
inner-city  Youngstown,  Ohio, 
had  few  options  for  their  chil¬ 
dren's  education  —  until  now. 

This  year,  624  students  in 
urban  Youngstown  are  attending 
their  first  year  at  Eagle  Heights 
Academy,  a  public  charter  school 
privately  run  by  Christians. 

"We  just  wanted  to  give  par¬ 
ents  another  choice  for  their  chil¬ 
dren,"  said  Gary  Frost,  pastor  of 
Rising  Star  Church  and  member 
of  the  Greater  Youngstown 
Coalition  of  Christians  (GYCC), 
a  group  of  area  churches  which 
have  united  to  provide  educa¬ 
tional,  social,  economic,  and 
urban  renewal  programs  to  the 
community. 

The  Greater  Youngstown 
Coalition  of  Christians  received 
its  school  charter  in  early  1998 
and  currently,  with  classes  in 
kindergarten  through  sixth 

f;rade,  Eagle  Heights  is  the 
argest  charter  school  in  Ohio. 

Four  pastors  and  a  Christian, 
attorney  form  the  school's 
board  of  education. 

After  only  a  few  months  in 
operation.  Eagle  Heights 
Academy  already  has  begun  to' 
positively  affect  the  lives  of  stu¬ 
dents,  parents,  and  staff. 

"I'Ve  been  in  education  for- 
20  years,  and  there  are  few  pub¬ 
lic  schools  which  compare  with 


what  we  have  here,"  said  Jim 
LaRiccia,  principal  of  Eagle 
Heights,  "but  it's  not  what  P m 
doing  or  what  any  other  person 
is  doing,  it's  what  God  is  doing 
througn  all  of  us." 

More  than  1,000  volunteers 
have  helped  renovate  the  facili¬ 
ty  —  a  school  building  erected 
in  1907  and  abandoned  six  years 
ago  —  along  with  tutoring  the 
children,  working  in  the  office, 
and  serving  in  the  cafeteria. 

"There's  constantly  someone 
who  is  being  called  by  the  Lord 
to  work  with  us,"  LaRiccia  said. 

Many  gifted  educators  also 
have  accepted  the  challenge  of 
working  at  Eagle  Heights 
Academy,  even  though  the 
starting  salary  range  is  nearly 
$4,000  less  than  other 
Youngstown  public  school 
teaching  positions. 

Eveiy  classroom  at  the  char¬ 
ter  scnool  has  a  certified 
teacher  as  well  as  an  education¬ 
al  assistant,  so  children  receive 
more  one-on-one  attention. 

"When  I  accepted  the  posi¬ 
tion  of  principal  in  July  1998,  I 
told  the  board  there  weren't 
going  to  be  any  good  teachers 
out  tnere  who  would  want  to 
work  for  such  a  low  salary," 
LaRiccia  said. 

"I  was  wrong.  Our  teachers 
are  phenomenal.  They're 
enthusiastic  and  have  amazing 
talent. 

"Even  on  their  small  salaries 
they're  buying  things  for  their 


classrooms.  Some  have  volun¬ 
teered  to  coach  sports. 

"When  you  go  into  the  class¬ 
rooms,  you  just  sense  the  love. 
Many  teachers  have  felt  called 
by  God  to  our  school,"  LaRiccia 
said. 

In  response  to  the  school 
leaders'  commitment,  the 
Youngstown  community  has 
poured  out  support  and 
encouragement. 

Many  parents  have  sent 
thank  you  notes,  expressing 

{;ratituae  for*  the  hard  work  in 
aunching  the  school. 

One  mother  sent  a  letter  to  a 
local  TV  station  praising  her 
child's  teacher  and  educational 
assistant. 

Her  child  had  been  suspend¬ 
ed  six  times  the  previous  school 
year,  but  had  made  a  complete 
turnaround  within  a  few  weeks 
at  Eagle  Heights. 

The  educators  received  an 
award  from  the  station. 

Other  area  schools,  mean¬ 
while,  are  taking  notice. 

"The  Youngstown  public 
schools  are  working  harder  to 
have  a  better  product,  because 
now  parents  have  another 
option,"  Frost  said. 

"Before,  they  didn't  have  a 
choice.  If*they  couldn't  afford  a 
private  or  Christian  school, 
then  their  children  had  to 
attend  whichever  public  school 
was  in  their  district. 

"Now,  we're  here.  Any  child 
anywhere  in  the  city  can  attend 


Eagle  Heights.  That  has 
spawned  a  competition, 
because  parents  are  going  to 
choose  the  school  which  nest 
equips  their  child. 

"Public  schools  now  have  to 
shape  up." 

In  the  future.  Eagle  Heights 
plans  to  add  one  grade  a  year 
up  to  the  12th  grade,  as  well  as 
continue  to  develop  its  before- 
and  after-school  latchkey  pro¬ 
gram  for  children  whose  par¬ 
ents  have  to  work. 

Set  apart  from  the  regular 
school  aay,  the  latchkey  pro¬ 
gram  has  complete  freedom  for 
Christian  teaching. 

Children  can  attend  Bible 
studies  and  activities,  plus  have 
prayer  together. 

The  Eagle  Heights  Academy 
board  of  education  hopes  that 
combining  a  solid  educational 
foundation  with  optional 
Christian  programs  will  help 
revitalize  the  Youngstown  com¬ 
munity  through  the  minds  of 
its  youngest  citizens. 

''One  of  our  big  prayers  is 
that  not  only  will  the  communi¬ 
ty  help  us,  but  we'll  be  able  to 
help  the  community,"  LaRiccia 
said. 

"Through  this  cycle,  every¬ 
thing  around  us  will  start  to 
flourish. 

"We're  beginning  to  see  it, 
but  there's  no  pressure,  because 
it's  in  the  Lord's  hands,  and 
that  makes  life  a  whole  lot  easi¬ 
er,"  he  said.
