PRODUCTION  HIGHLIGHTS  FOR  1990/91 


February  1991 

WHEAT;  World  production  for  1990/91  is  estimated  at  a  record  589.0  million 
metric  tons,  down  4.2  million  or  less  than  1  percent  from  last  month,  but  up 
10  percent  from  last  year's  harvest.  Country  highlights  are  as  follows; 


o  United  States 

Production  is  estimated  at  74.5  million  tons,  up 
34  percent  from  last  year.  There  was  no  change 
this  month. 

o  India 

Production  is  estimated  at  49.7  million  tons, 
down  4.3  million  or  8  percent  from  last  month, 
and  down  8  percent  from  last  year's  record 
harvest.  Harvested  area  and  yield  are  estimated 
lower. 

o  Australia 

Production  is  estimated  at  15.7  million  tons,  up 
0.2  million  or  1  percent  from  last  month  and  up 

11  percent  from  last  year.  Excellent  finishing 
conditions  in  the  western  growing  region  boosted 
estimated  crop  yields. 

COARSE  GRAINS;  World  production  for  1990/91  is  estimated  at  825.8  million  tons, 
up  1.9  million  or  less  than  1  percent  from  last  month  and  up  3  percent  from  last 
year.  Country  highlights  are  as  follows; 


o  United  States 

Production  is  estimated  at  230.6  million  tons, 
up  4  percent  from  last  year.  There  were  no 
changes  this  month. 

o  Brazil 

Production  is  estimated  at  24.9  million  tons, 
down  1.0  million  or  4  percent  from  last  month, 
but  up  10  percent  from  last  year.  Corn  yield 
is  estimated  lower  due  to  insufficient  rains 
during  the  critical  silk-tassel  growth  stage. 

o  Australia 

Production  is  estimated  at  6.8  million  tons, 
down  0.2  million  or  2  percent  from  last  month 
and  down  2  percent  from  last  year.  Sorghum 
and  corn  area  are  estimated  lower  owing  to 
drought  and  diversion  to  alternative  crops, 
while  barley  and  oat  yields  are  estimated 
higher. 

o  India 

Production  is  estimated  at  a  record  35.0 
million  tons,  up  2.7  million  or  8  percent  from 
last  month  and  up  1  percent  from  last  year's 
record  harvest.  Based  on  official  Indian 
statistics,  crop  yields  for  sorghum,  corn,  and 
millet  are  estimated  higher  while  barley  is 
estimated  lower. 

5 


o  Nepal 


Production  is  estimated  at  a  record  1.4 
million  tons,  up  0.3  million  or  27  percent 
from  last  month  and  up  27  percent  from  last 
year.  Record  estimated  summer  corn  production 
contributed  to  the  upward  revision. 

RICE  (MILLED-BASIS) :  World  production  for  1990/91  is  estimated  at  a  record 
349.9  million  tons,  up  1.7  million  or  less  than  1  percent  from  last  month  and  up 
2  percent  from  the  1989/90  crop.  Foreign  production  in  1990/91  is  projected  at 
a  record  345.0  million  tons.  U.S.  output  is  projected  at  4.9  million  tons, 
unchanged  from  last  month,  but  down  4  percent  from  last  year.  Country 
highlights  are  as  follows: 


o  India 


o  Nepal 


o  Laos 


o  Thailand 


Production  is  estimated  at  a  record  75.0 
million  tons,  up  2.0  million  or  3  percent  from 
last  month  and  up  1  percent  from  last  year's 
crop.  Harvested  area  and  yield  are  estimated 
at  record  levels,  reflecting  excellent 
monsoonal  weather. 

Production  is  estimated  at  a  record  2.3 
million  tons,  up  0.3  million  or  15  percent 
from  last  month  and  up  21  percent  from  last 
year.  Above  average  rice  plantings,  along 
with  higher  yield  from  favorable  monsoonal 
weather,  contributed  to  the  estimated  record 
crop. 

Production  is  estimated  at  1.1  million  tons, 
up  0.2  million  or  20  percent  from  last  month 
and  up  27  percent  from  last  year.  The 
increase  is  attributed  to  higher  estimated 
area  and  yield. 

Production  is  estimated  at  12.0  million  tons, 
down  0.9  million  or  7  percent  from  last  month 
and  down  12  percent  from  last  year.  The 
reduction  in  yield  and  area  is  primarily  based 
on  heavier-than-expected  insect  damage  on  the 
main  season  crop  and  a  reduction  in  plantings 
of  the  second  crop. 


OILSEEDS;  Total  world  oilseeds  production  during  1990/91  is  forecast  at  a 
record  216.9  million  tons,  down  0.2  million  from  last  month,  but  up  3.0  million 
or  1  percent  from  1989/90.  Foreign  production  during  1990/91  is  projected  to  be 
a  record  156.4  million  tons,  down  0.2  million  from  last  month,  but  up  1.7 
million  or  1  percent  from  last  year.  U.S.  total  oilseed  production  is  estimated 
at  60.6  million  tons,  unchanged  from  last  month,  up  1.3  million  or  2  percent 
from  last  year. 


6 


*  Soybeans ;  World  production  for  1990/91  is  estimated  at  105.1  million 
tons,  down  0.4  million  from  last  month  and  down  1.7  million  or  2 
percent  from  last  year.  Total  foreign  soybean  output  is  estimated  at 
52.8  million  tons,  down  0.4  million  or  1  percent  from  last  month  and 
down  1.7  million  or  3  percent  from  1989/90.  Country  highlights  are  as 
follows: 

o  United  States  There  was  no  change  in  the  USDA  official 

estimate  by  the  National  Agricultural  Statistics 
Service  this  month.  Production  is  estimated  at 
52.3  million  tons,  unchanged  from  last  month, 
but  down  marginally  from  last  year. 

o  Brazil  Production  is  estimated  at  17.5  million  tons, 

down  0.5  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month 
and  down  2.5  million  or  13  percent  from  last 
year.  As  a  result  of  field  travel  by  the 
agricultural  attache,  Sao  Paulo,  and  FAS  staff 
in  January,  planted  area  has  been  adjusted 
downward.  Harvested  area  is  now  expected  to 
fall  by  1.5  million  hectares  or  13  percent  from 
last  year. 

o  India  Production  is  estimated  at  a  record  2.1  million 

tons,  up  0.1  million  or  5  percent  from  last 
month  and  up  23  percent  from  last  year's  record 
output.  Harvested  area  is  estimated  to  reach  a 
record  2.2  million  hectares. 

*  Cottonseed:  World  production  for  1990/91  is  forecast  at  33.7  million 
tons,  down  0.3  million  or  1  percent  from  last  month,  but  up  2.3 
million  or  7  percent  from  last  year.  Total  foreign  production  is 
estimated  at  28.1  million  tons,  down  0.3  million  or  1  percent  from 
last  month,  but  up  1.0  million  or  4  percent  above  last  year.  Country 
highlights  are  as  follows: 

o  United  States  There  was  no  change  in  the  USDA  official  estimate 

by  the  National  Agricultural  Statistics  Service 
this  month.  Production  is  estimated  at  5.5 
million  tons,  up  1.3  million  or  30  percent  from 
last  year. 

o  India  Production  is  estimated  at, 4. 3  million  tons,  down 

0.2  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month  and  down 
0.3  million  or  6  percent  from  last  year's  record 
crop.  Unfavorable  harvest  conditions,  reduced 
crop  area,  and  pest  losses  have  affected  the 
production  outlook. 


7 


o  Soviet  Union 


Production  is  estimated  at  5.3  million  tons,  down 
0.2  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month  and  down 

0.1  million  or  1  percent  from  last  year.  The 

U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in  Moscow  reported  a 
reduction  in  raw  cotton  output  based  on  official 
statistics . 

*  Peanuts:  World  production  for  1990/91  is  forecast  at  21.4  million 

tons,  down  marginally  from  last  month  and  down  0.5  million  or  2 

percent  from  1989/90.  Total  foreign  production  is  estimated  at  19.8 
million  tons,  down  marginally  from  last  month  and  down  0.3  million  or 
1  percent  from  1989/90.  U.S.  peanut  production  was  unchanged  this 
month,  remaining  at  1.6  million  tons,  down  0.2  million  or  10  percent

from  last  year. 

o  Soviet  Union  Production  is  estimated  at  6.5  million  tons,  down 

0.3  million  or  4  percent  from  last  month  and  down 
0.6  million  or  8  percent  from  last  year. 

Official  reports  confirm  that  yields  were 
adversely  affected  by  the  poor  harvesting 
conditions  in  November. 

*  Rapeseed :  World  production  for  1990/91  is  forecast  at  a  record  24.6 
million  tons,  up  0.8  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month  and  up  2.7

There  were  no  significant  country  changes  this  month. 

*  Palm  Kernels;  World  production  for  1990/91  is  forecast  at  a  record 
3.4  million  tons,  unchanged  from  last  month,  but  up  nearly  2  percent 
from  last  year.  There  were  no  country  changes  this  month. 

*  Palm  Oil;  World  production  for  1990/91  is  forecast  at  a  record  11.0 
million  tons,  down  0.2  million  from  last  month,  but  up  71,000  tons 
from  last  year.  Country  highlights  are  as  follows: 

o  Malaysia  Production  is  estimated  at  6.2  million  tons, 

down  0.2  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month 
and  down  3  percent  from  last  year.  Tree-stress 
from  an  earlier  dry  period  is  expected  to  reduce 
production,  particularly  during  the  first  half 
of  the  October-September  marketing  year. 


COTTON;  World  cotton  production  in  1990/91  is  estimated  at  86.1  million  bales, 
down  0.8  million  or  1  percent  from  last  month  but  up  6.1  million  or  8  percent

o  India 


o  USSR 


o  Peru 


Production  is  estimated  at  9.8  million  bales, 
down  0.3  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month, 
and  down  6  percent  from  last  year's  record  crop. 
Cotton  yields  are  forecast  slightly  lower  due  to 
pest  and  weather  related  damage. 

Production  is  estimated  at  12.0  million  bales, 
down  0.4  million  or  3  percent  from  last  month, 
and  down  3  percent  from  last  year.  The 
reduction  is  attributed  to  recently  released 
Soviet  statistics. 

Production  is  estimated  at  0.3  million  bales, 
down  0.1  million  from  last  month  or  27  percent 
from  last  month.  Area  planted  of  both  Tanguis 
and  extra-long-staple  cotton  is  forecast  lower. 
This  is  a  result  of  a  sharp  drop  in  available 
credit  this  season  and  the  low  prices  paid  for 
last  season.

WEATHER  BRIEFS 


BRAZIL:  TIMELY  RAINS  BENEFIT  SUMMER  CROP 


Dec.  20,  1990  -  Jan.  19,  1991  was  unseasonably  dry  across  Southern  Brazil  and 
temperatures  were  sometimes  above  normal.  These  conditions  severely  stressed 
flowering  soybean  and  reproductive  corn  crops.  Rains  returned  to  southern 
Brazil  during  late  January  improving  soil  moisture  levels  and  halting  further 
deterioration  of  the  crop.  The  heaviest  and  most  widespread  rains  fell  during 
the  week,  of  Jan.  27  -  Feb.  2,  1991,  with  amounts  averaging  60-109  millimeters 
(mm)  in  Parana,  57-81  mm  in  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul  and  25-96  mm  in  Rio  Grande  Do 
Sul.  Dry  weather  returned  to  Rio  Grande  Do  Sul  after  Feb.  3,  1991,  causing 
some  concern.  Further  to  the  north  rains  were  locally  heavy  (100-250  mm)  in 
northern  Sao  Paulo  and  southwestern  Minas  Gerais.  Since  Jan.  20,  1991 
temperatures  have  been  normal  to  slightly  below  normal  due  to  the  rains. 

NORTHWEST  AFRICA:  MOSTLY  BETTER  THAN  LAST  YEAR 


Most  of  Northwest  Africa's  winter  grain  areas  received  normal  to  above  normal 
precipitation  in  December  1990,  giving  the  1991  winter  grain  crop  a  much  better 
start  than  the  1990  winter  grain  crop.  Last  year  winter  grains  were  hurt  by 
persistent  dryness  across  Morocco  and  inland  Algeria.  Only  Tunisia  received 
widespread  precipitation  in  January  -  February  1990.  Precipitation  has  been 
rather  widespread  and  beneficial  during  Jan.  13  -  Feb.  10,  1991  for  most  of 
Northwest  African  vegetative  winter  grain  crop.  The  notable  exception  is 
southern  Morocco  which  has  been  dry  since  early  January  1991. 

SOUTH  AFRICA:  RAINS  IMPROVE  OUTLOOK  IN  MAIZE  TRIANGLE 


Heavy  rains  fell  across  the  Maize  Triangle  for  the  period  of  Jan.  11  -  Feb.  10, 
1991.  Precipitation  for  this  period  was  heaviest  in  the  western  two-thirds  of 
the  Maize  Triangle,  unlike  December  and  early  January  when  rain  was  heaviest  in 
the  east  and  the  west  was  mostly  dry.  The  frequent,  soaking  rains  have  greatly 
improved  conditions  for  vegetative  to  filling  corn  across  the  region, 
especially  in  the  west  where  planting  took  place  past  the  optimal  period. 
Temperatures  have  been  normal  to  slightly  above  normal.

PRODUCTION  BRIEFS 


TURKEY:  TREE  NUT  PRODUCTION  UPDATE 


Current  assessments  indicate  that  Turkey's  1990/91  pistachio  crop  totaled  only 
5,000  tons  (inshell  basis),  unchanged  from  the  preliminary  estimate  last 
September,  but  down  sharply  from  the  25,000  ton  1989/90  harvest.  The  drop  from 
the  previous  year  is  attributed  to  dry  weather  during  the  growing  season 
compounding  yield  losses  caused  by  the  alternate-year  bearing  tendency  of  the 
crop.  Estimated  1990/91  filbert  production â at  380,000  tons  (inshell 
basis) â is  also  unchanged  since  September.  Filbert  (hazelnut)  yields  also 
suffered  from  the  biennial  cycle  following  a  520,000-ton  1989/90  harvest. 
Production  might  have  been  even  lower  if  the  crop  had  not  enjoyed  favorable 
growing  conditions. 


FRANCE:  WALNUT  PRODUCTION  UPDATE 


The  U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in  Paris  reports  that  French  1990/91  walnut 
production  is  estimated  at  26,000  tons  (inshell  basis) â unchanged  from  the 
September  forecast,  but  slightly  below  the  revised  1989/90  crop  of  27,500  tons 
mostly  due  to  a  decline  in  harvested  area.  Estimated  production  for  1988/89 
has  also  been  revised  and  is  now  placed  at  22,800  tons. 

SPAIN:  TREE  NUT  PRODUCTION  UPDATE 


Spain's  1990/91  almond  production  is  estimated  at  55,000  tons  (shelled  basis) 
5,000  tons  below  the  September  estimate  and  35,000  less  than  the  bumper  1989/90 
harvest.  The  reduction  since  September  is  attributed  to  a  lower- than-usual 
kernel  yield  per  ton  of  nuts  cracked.  The  difference  from  a  year  ago  was 
caused  by  both  the  biennial  yield  cycle  and  by  an  irregular  blossom  set  and 
March-April  frosts.  Filbert  production  is  estimated  at  21,000  tons  (inshell 
basis),  4,000  tons  below  both  the  September  estimate  and  the  revised  1989/90 
harvest  estimate.  Poor  nut  fill  and  rain  damage  during  harvesting  are  blamed 
for  the  reduction  since  September. 

ITALY:  TREE  NUT  PRODUCTION  UPDATE 


Late  season  assessments  indicate  that  Italy's  1990/91  almond  crop  totaled 
21,000  tons  (shelled  basis),  1,000  tons  less  than  estimated  in  September,  but 
still  the  largest  crop  since  1986/87.  Crop  quality  is  reportedly  below  average 
due  to  small  kernel  size.  Filbert  production  is  estimated  at  80,000  tons 
(inshell  basis),  20,000  tons  or  20  percent  below  the  September  estimate  and  43 
percent  less  than  the  1989/90  harvest.  A  cyclical  yield  fluctuation  is  blamed 
for  the  small  crop.  Production  estimates  for  both  walnuts  (18,000  tons  inshell 
basis)  and  pistachios  (300  tons  inshell  basis)  are  unchanged  since  September.

BRAZIL:  1991/92  COFFEE  PRODUCTION  FORECAST  DOWN 


Brazil's  1991/92  coffee  crop  is  forecast  at  25  million  60~k.ilogram  bags,  19 
percent  (6  million  bags)  less  than  last  year's  31  million  bag  harvest,  based  on 
a  report  by  the  U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in  Brasilia.  The  report  was 
prepared  following  January  8-24  field  travel  taken  in  the  major  producing 
states.  No  new  plantings  of  coffee  seedlings  or  deep  pruning  was  observed  in 
Parana  or  Sao  Paulo.  In  Parana,  the  majority  of  coffee  trees  are  in  their 
off-year  production  cycle.  Below  normal  rainfall  and  longer  than  normal 
periods  between  showers  have  significantly  reduced  cherry  development  in  that 
state.  In  western  and  northern  areas  of  Sao  Paulo,  most  coffee  trees  have  had 
no  flowerings  while  elsewhere  in  the  state  most  trees  have  had  two  major  and 
one  minor  flowering  followed  by  satisfactory  cherry  setting.  Moderate  weevil 
infestations  were  noted  on  central  and  eastern  Sao  Paulo  trees. 

The  state  of  Minas  Gerais  is  the  country's  largest  producing  state.  In  the 
southwest  area,  where  most  of  the  coffee  is  grown,  coffee  trees  show  good 
vegetative  growth  reflecting  adequate  rainfall  with  no  evidence  of  rust  or 
insect  infestations.  Most  trees  have  had  at  least  one  major  flowering  and  a 
second  flowering  is  expected  through  mid-February.  In  this  region  an  on-year 
production  cycle  will  occur  in  the  1991/92  season.  The  remaining  fourth  of 
Minas  Gerais'  coffee  is  produced  in  the  southeast.  The  state  of  Espirito  Santo 
was  not  included  in  the  field  trip  but  is  reported  to  have  had  adequate 
rainfall  during  and  following  coffee  flowering  and  cherry  set. 

SOVIET  UNION:  SUGAR  ESTIMATES  REVISED  DOWN 


Sugar  production  in  the  Soviet  Union  for  1990/91  has  been  lowered  to  9.15 
million  tons  (raw  value),  4  percent  less  than  last  year,  according  to 
information  from  the  U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in  Moscow.  Reported  harvest 
of  sugarbeets  amounted  to  81.2  million  tons  compared  with  97.4  million  tons 
last  year.  The  beet  yield  per  hectare,  at  24.7  metric  tons,  was  down  from  the 
29.1  tons  per  hectare  obtained  in  the  1989/90  harvest. 

CANADA:  NEW  FARM  ââSAFETY  NETâ  PROGRAMS  ANNOUNCED 

The  Canadian  agriculture  minister  announced  two  new  voluntary  farm  subsidy 
programs  that  would  provide  price  protection  for  grain  and  oilseed  farmers  and 
help  stabilize  farm  incomes.  Although  these  new  farm  income  stabilization 
schemes  have  been  announced  for  the  1991  crop  year,  the  implementing 
legislation  has  not  yet  been  tabled  in  Parliament.  The  Gross  Revenue  Insurance 
Plan  will  be  delivered  through  crop  insurance  agencies  with  premiums  being 
shared  by  the  federal  Government  (42  percent  anticipated),  farmers  (33  percent 
anticipated),  and  provincial  Governments  (25  percent  anticipated).  This 
program  would  guarantee  the  farmer  a  target  revenue  on  a  dollar  per  acre  level, 
based  on  long-term  average  yields  of  the  participating  crop.  The  Net  Income 
Stabilization  Account  will  enable  farmers  to  set  aside  money  in  individual 
accounts,  with  both  the  federal  and  (some)  provincial  Governments  also 
contributing  to  the  account.  Farmers  could  contribute  up  to  2  percent  of  their 
net  sales,  matched  by  the  Government.  Farmers  would  make  withdrawals  from  the 
account  once  net  income  falls  below  their  5  year  average  return,  or  when  their 
taxable  income  falls  below  a  pre-determined  level  (expected  to  be  about 
Can$10,000).  The  programs  are  similar  in  that  premiums  are  paid  into  the 
programs  and  benefits  are  paid  back  to  the  participant  when  prices  or  incomes 
drop  below  a  certain  level.

BRAZIL;  1989/90  SOYBEAN  PRODUCTION  ESTIMATE  INCREASED 


The  estimate  of  last  year's  (1989/90)  Brazilian  soybean  production  has  been 
raised  from  19.3  to  20.0  million  tons,  according  to  the  U.S.  agricultural 
officer  in  Sao  Paulo,  Brazil.  Industry  and  government  estimates  for  the  crop 
currently  fall  within  the  19.7  to  20.4  million  ton  range,  indicating  higher 
yields  were  achieved  by  the  dry  weather-stressed  1989/90  crop  than  earlier 
calculated.  The  revised  production  estimate  is  more  consistent  with  crush  and 
export  data  (including  export  registrations).  Low  producer  prices,  an 
over-valued  cruzeiro,  and  high  transportation  costs  led  farmers  to  delay  moving 
last  year's  crop  to  market,  resulting  in  the  under-estimation  of  total  crop 
size.  The  recent  devaluation  of  the  cruzeiro  improved  producer  prices  and  led 
to  the  emergence  of  soybeans  previously  not  counted  by  production  estimators. 

CHINA:  WARM  WINTER  THREATENS  WHEAT  CROP 


The  China  Daily  newspaper  reported  that  a  dry,  warm  winter  is  threatening  the 
growth  of  the  winter  wheat  crop  in  the  northern  China  provinces  of  Hebei, 
Shanxi,  Gansu,  and  Shaanxi.  According  to  a  Ministry  of  Agriculture  official, 
the  warm  winter  caused  the  wheat  crop  to  grow  faster  than  usual  and  have  a 
shorter  than  normal  'hibernation',  resulting  in  a  weaker  crop.  Officials  also 
fear  that  the  warm  winter  might  allow  more  pests  to  survive  the  winter  and  rust 
diseases  to  spread  this  spring.  Information  from  the  World  Meteorological 
Organization  and  the  NOAA/USDA  Joint  Agricultural  Weather  Facility  confirm  the 
Chinese  report  of  a  warm  winter  in  northern  China  this  year.  Average 
temperatures  were  1-3  degrees  C.  above  normal  in  October  and  2-4  degrees  C. 
above  normal  in  November,  with  the  warmest  readings  in  Shandong,  Hebei,  and 
Shaanxi  provinces.  The  temperatures  fell  in  December  and  dropped  to 
below-normal  levels  in  early  January,  but  for  the  past  30  days  temperatures  in 
northern  China  have  again  averaged  1-4  degrees  C.  above  normal  and  the  trend 
seems  likely  to  continue  throughout  February. 


CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  MILK  PRODUCTION  DOWN  SLIGHTLY 


Czechoslovakia's  1990  milk  production  totaled  7.044  million  tons,  down  1 
percent  from  the  1989  level,  according  to  the  U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in 
Vienna,  Austria.  Cow  numbers  were  down  about  1  percent,  continuing  a  long  term 
downtrend.  Despite  reduced  milk  production,  a  decline  in  fresh  consumption 
allowed  a  small  increase  in  the  quantity  of  milk  used  for  processing.  Output 
of  butter  for  1990  is  estimated  at  157,000  tons,  up  from  156,000  a  year 
earlier,  while  cheese  production  is  estimated  at  150,000  tons,  down  2,000  from 
1989. 

SOVIET  UNION:  LIVESTOCK  PRODUCTION  RESULTS  REPORTED 


Total  1990  Soviet  meat  production  was  19.9  million  tons,  down  1  percent  from 
the  1989  output  of  20.1,  according  to  recently  released  Soviet  statistics 
reported  by  the  U.S.  agricultural  counselor  in  Moscow.  Milk  output  was 
reported  at  108.7  million  tons,  up  slightly  from  1989  output  of  108.5  million 
tons,  and  egg  production,  at  82  billion  eggs  was  down  3  percent  from  the 
84.9-billion-1989  lay.  Wool  output  was  down  8,000  tons  to  479,000  in  1990. 
Production  of  meat  by  private  producers  declined  even  more  than  the  national 
average.  Privately  produced  milk  was  up  2  percent  while  output  of  eggs  was 
down  1  percent.  Governmental  procurements  were  reported  to  have  declined  even 
more  than  production.

SOVIET  UNION:  1990  GRAIN  PRODUCTION  REPORTED 


The  USSR  economic  results  for  1990  were  published  by  the  State  Committee  for 
Statistics  (GOSKOMSTAT)  in  January  1991  according  to  the  U.S.  agricultural 
counselor  in  Moscow.  The  published  figures  include  total  grain  production  of 
218  million  tons  and  total  grain  yield  of  1.99  tons  per  hectare,  on  a 
net-weight  basis  (the  weight  of  the  grain  after  cleaning  and  drying).  Soviet 
grain  production  numbers  usually  are  reported  in  terms  of  "bunker"  weight  (the 
weight  of  the  grain  before  adjustment  for  moisture  and  trash),  which 
complicates  the  comparison  between  this  year's  results  and  previous  years' 
results.  For  the  10  observations  for  which  data  are  available  for  previous 
years,  net  weight  ranges  from  91.7  to  93.7  percent  of  bunker  weight.  The 
announced  1990  grain  harvest  of  218  million  tons  is  close  to  the  record  222.5 
million  tons  (net  weight)  produced  in  1978,  and  the  yield  of  1.99  tons  per 
hectare  surpasses  the  1.73  tons  per  hectare  level  of  1978.  USDA  grain 
estimates  are  in  the  traditional  bunker  weight  and  remain  unchanged  pending 
receipt  of  additional  sufficient  information  to  provide  estimates  by  grain 
type.

SOVIET  REGIONAL  GRAIN  PRODUCTION 


The  1990  USSR  total  grain  crop  estimate  of  235  million  tons  includes  108.0 
million  of  wheat,  114.0  million  of  coarse  grains,  and  1.7  million  of  milled 
rice.  This  year's  record  grain  yields  have  moved  the  Soviet  Union  into  third 
plac^  among  world  grain  producers,  behind  China  and  the  United  States.  The 
Soviet  Union's  position  as  the  world's  largest  producer  of  wheat,  barley,  oats, 
and  rye,  is  based  on  diverse  agroclimatic  zones  and  extensive  agricultural  land 
resources. 

Laws  passed  in  the  last  2  years  have  altered  the  structure  of  Soviet 
agriculture  and  have  dramatically  increased  the  scope  of  local  authority. 
Because  of  this,  there  is  greater  interest  by  grain  analysts  in  studying  grain 
production  at  republic/regional  levels.  This  report  is  based  primarily  on 
official  Soviet  data  averaged  for  the  late  1980' s.  Regional  grain  crop 
geography  is  presented,  and  grain  production  in  the  "heartlandâ,  herein  defined 
as  the  RSFSR  (Russian  Soviet  Federated  Socialist  Republic),  Ukraine, 

Belorussia,  and  Kazakhstan  republics,  is  compared  with  that  in  several  other 
regions  â  the  Baltics,  Transcaucasus,  Central  Asia,  and  Moldavia. 

The  heartland  republics  dominate  grain  production,  accounting  for  95  percent  of 
total  grain  area  and  93  percent  of  total  output.  The  RSFSR  alone  produces 
slightly  over  half  of  all  Soviet  grain,  while  the  Ukraine,  Kazakhstan,  and 
Belorussia  contribute  24,  13,  and  4  percent,  respectively. 

Wheat 

The  USSR  is  a  major  producer  of  both  winter  and  spring  wheat,  with  the  latter 
accounting  for  a  third  to  half  of  total  wheat  output,  depending  on  weather. 
Spring  wheat  yields  are  often  less  than  half  that  of  winter  wheat  although 
spring  wheat  normally  comprises  60-65  percent  of  total  Soviet  harvested  wheat 
area. 

Virtually  all  spring  wheat  is  grown  in  two  republics  of  the  heartland.  The 
RSFSR  grows  about  60  percent  of  Soviet  spring  wheat  and  Kazakhstan  harvests 
most  of  the  remainder.  In  the  RSFSR,  the  regions  of  West  Siberia  and  Urals  are 
the  dominant  production  regions,  each  producing  about  18  percent  of  the 
National  total  in  an  average  year.  In  West  Siberia,  Altai  Krai,  Novosibirsk, 
and  Omsk  Oblasts  are  the  primary  growing  areas.  In  the  Ural  region,  production 
centers  in  Orenburg,  Bashkir,  and  Kurgan  oblasts.  Other  important  RSFSR  spring 
wheat  areas  are  Saratov  oblast  and  the  Tatar  autonomous  republic  in  the  Volga 
Valley  and  Krasnoyarsk  oblast  in  East  Siberia. 

The  heartland  produces  over  90  percent  of  Soviet  winter  wheat.  The  RSFSR  and 
the  Ukraine  each  contributes  roughly  40  percent  of  total  winter  wheat  output, 
with  the  latter  normally  ranking  first  in  production;  Kazakhstan  and  Belorussia 
harvest  about  5  and  1  percent,  respectively.  In  other  republics,  Moldavia, 
Azerbaidzhan  (Transcaucasus),  Kirghiz  Soviet  Socialist  Republic  (SSR),  Uzbek 
SSR  (Central  Asia),  and  Lithuania  SSR  (Baltics)  each  produce  roughly  0. 2-1.0 
million  tons  of  winter  wheat  annually. 


27 


In  years  of  average  weather,  the  Ukraine  grows  roughly  20  million  tons  of 
winter  wheat  -  together  with  50,000  tons  of  spring  wheat.  Every  oblast,  with 
the  exception  of  Zakarpatsk,  Ivano-Frankov,  and  Chernovtsy,  crops 
150,000-375,000  hectares  of  winter  wheat.  Greatest  winter  wheat  production  is 
in  the  following  oblasts,  each  producing  roughly  1.0  million  tons:  Odessa, 
Vinitsa,  Kharkov,  Poltava,  Kiev,  Khmelinitsa,  Kherson,  and  Crimea. 

In  the  RSFSR,  most  winter  wheat  is  grown  in  the  North  Caucasus  region  which 
produces  about  20  percent  of  the  total  Soviet  harvest.  Production  centers  in 
the  oblasts  of  Krasnodar,  Stavropol,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  â  Rostov.  The 
Central  Black  Soil  region  of  the  RSFSR  commonly  harvests  about  9-10  percent  of 
Soviet  winter  wheat;  important  oblasts  are  Voronezh,  Kursk,  and  Byelgorod. 

Other  primary  winter  wheat  oblasts  in  the  RSFSR  include:  Volgograd,  Kuibishev, 
Penza,  and  Saratov  (Volga  Valley);  Gorkii  (Volga  Vyatsk);  and  Orlov,  Ryazan, 
Moscow,  and  Tula  (Center).  Kazakhstan  will  harvest  1. 5-2.0  million  tons  of 
winter  wheat  in  average  years  with  production  mainly  in  Dzhambul  and  Chimkent 
oblasts. 

Coarse  Grains 


Soviet  heartland  republics  grow  about  94  percent  of  the  nation's  coarse  grains, 
with  the  RSFSR,  Ukraine,  and  Kazakhstan  contributing  roughly  60,  15,  and  15 
percent,  respectively.  Significant  coarse  grains  production  outside  the 
heartland  includes  barley  in  the  Baltics  (spring),  Azerbaidzhan  (winter), 
Kirghiz  (spring),  and  Uzbek  (winter)  and  corn  in  Moldavia. 

Barley 

Roughly  90  percent  of  all  barley  grown  in  the  USSR  is  produced  in  the 
heartland.  The  RSFSR,  Ukraine,  Kazakhstan,  and  Belorussia  harvest  about  49, 

22,  13,  and  7  percent  of  total  barley  output,  respectively.  Soviet  barley  is 
predominantly  (92-94  percent)  spring  barley. 

The  RSFSR  grows  about  half  of  Soviet  spring  barley  with  the  Volga  Valley  being 
the  central  production  area  -  often  harvesting  an  area  of  more  than  4.0  million 
hectares.  Primary  Volga  Valley  oblasts  for  spring  barley  are  Saratov  and 
Volgograd.  The  Ural  region,  with  about  3.0  million  hectares  of  spring  barley, 
centers  production  in  the  oblasts  of  Orenburg  and  Bashkir.  Other  important 
RSFSR  spring  barley  regions  (oblasts)  include:  North  Caucasus/2.1  million 
hectares  (Rostov);  Central  Black  Soil/1.9  million  hectares  (Tambov);  and 
Central/1.8  million  hectares  (Tula,  Ryazan,  Orlov). 

The  Ukraine  annually  produces  7-12  million  tons  of  spring  barley  with  yields 
fluctuating  between  2.0  and  3.0  tons  per  hectare.  Most  area  is  harvested  in 
Donetsk,  Kirovograd,  Zaporozhe,  Dnepropetrovsk,  and  Nikolayev  oblasts. 
Kazakhstan  harvests  about  6.5  million  hectares  of  spring  barley  with  yields 
averaging  only  1.0  ton  per  hectare.  The  oblasts  of  Aktyubinsk,  Kustanai, 
Uralsk,  and  Tselinograd  each  crop  0.5-0. 9  million  hectares  of  spring  barley. 

Soviet  winter  barley  amounts  to  roughly  3.0  million  tons  grown  on  1.5  million 
hectares.  Important  winter  barley  regions  (oblasts)  include:  RSFSR/North 
Caucasus  (Krasnodar,  Stavropol);  Ukraine  (Crimea,  Odessa);  Kazakhstan 
(Chimkent);  and  Central  Asia/Uzbek  SSR. 


28 


Rye 


The  heartland  republics  produce  95  percent  of  the  total  Soviet  rye  crop.  The 
Baltic  republics  contribute  virtually  all  the  remainder  with  Lithuania  being 
the  largest  producer.  Spring  rye  is  harvested  on  less  than  50,000  hectares  out 
of  a  total  rye  area  of  10.0-10.5  million  hectares. 

The  RSFSR  accounts  for  about  70  percent  of  all  Soviet  rye  with  an  area  of 
roughly  7.3  million  hectares.  The  Volga  Valley  harvests  the  greatest  rye  area 
among  the  regions  of  the  RSFSR  -  about  1.8  million  hectares.  The  Tatar  ASSR 
(Autonomous  Soviet  Socialist  Republic)  and  Penza,  Saratov,  and  Ulyanovsk 
oblasts  are  major  Volga  rye  producers.  Orenburg  and  Bashkir  oblasts  in  the 
Ural  region  each  harvest  roughly  0.4  million  hectares  of  winter  rye  as  does 
Kirov  oblast  in  the  Volga  Vyatsk  region.  The  Central  region  of  the  RSFSR  grows 
rye  on  about  1.3  million  hectares;  Ryazan  and  Bryansk  are  important  rye 
producing  oblasts. 

Rye  and  barley  are  the  dominant  grains  in  Belorussia,  each  grown  on 
approximately  1.0  million  hectares.  With  16-18  percent  of  total  Soviet 
production,  Belorussian  rye  cultivation  is  rather  evenly  spread  throughout  the 
region  with  roughly  150,000  hectares  in  each  of  the  6  oblasts. 

The  oblasts  of  Chernigov,  Zhitomir,  and  Volyn  grow  almost  half  of  the  Ukraine's 
0.6  million  hectares  of  rye.  Yields  in  the  Ukraine  average  about  2.0  tons  per 
hectare,  intermediate  between  those  near  1.0  (Central  Asia  and  Azerbaidzhan) 
and  those  near  3.0  (Belorussia  and  the  Baltics). 

Oats 


The  Soviet  heartland  produces  97  percent  of  the  total  oats  output;  the  Baltic 
republics  produce  the  remainder.  The  RSFSR  grows  about  80  percent  of  Soviet 
oats  production  on  approximately  10.0  million  hectares.  Oats  yields  are 
somewhat  lower  than  rye  in  the  USSR  but  tend  to  follow  the  same  pattern 
regionally  -  lowest  in  Central  Asia  and  Kazakhstan  and  highest  in  Belorussia 
and  the  Baltics.  West  and  East  Siberia  together  harvest  roughly  4.0  million 
hectares  of  oats  with  greatest  concentration  in  the  following  oblasts:  Altai 
and  Novosibirsk  (West)  and  Krasnoyarsk  and  Chitinsk  (East).  Oats  is  a  common 
crop  in  Ural  region  crop  rotations  and  occupies  about  1.7  million  hectares. 

Perm  and  Chelyabinsk  oblasts  each  crop  about  0.3  million  hectares  of  oats.  The 
RSFSR's  Central  region  also  grows  oats  on  roughly  1.7  million  hectares  and  this 
grain  is  most  significant  in  Kalinin  and  Smolensk  oblasts. 

The  Ukraine  produces  about  1.5  million  tons  of  oats  on  0.65  million  hectares, 

10  percent  of  total  Soviet  output.  Almost  all  of  the  25  Ukrainian  oblasts 
harvest  50,000-75,000  tons  of  oats  annually  although  Chernigov,  Sumy, 
Voroshilovgrad,  and  Nikolayev  take  in  125,000-150,000  tons  each.  Other 
important  regions  (oblasts)  include:  Kazakhstan  (Kustanai  and  North  Kazakh), 
Volga  Vyatsk  (Kirov),  Belorussia  (Mogilev),  and  Baltics  (Lithuania  SSR). 

Corn 


Although  the  USSR  harvests  as  much  as  375  million  tons  of  corn-for-silage  and 
green  feed,  on  roughly  20  million  hectares,  corn-for-grain  output  normally 
varies  from  12-16  million  tons  from  4. 0-5.0  million  hectares.  The  Soviet 
heartland  accounts  for  roughly  87  percent  of  total  grain  corn  production 
(versus  94  percent  of  fodder  corn). 


29 


The  Ukraine  produces  about  56  percent  of  Soviet  grain  corn  on  an  area  of 
approximately  2.4  million  hectares,  with  yield  averaging  slightly  more  than  3.0 
tons  per  hectare.  Dnepropetrovsk  oblast  is  the  main  producer  with  a  harvested 
area  of  350,000-400,000  hectares;  Zaporozhe,  Kirovograd,  and  Donetsk  oblasts 
each  crop  200,000-250,000  hectares. 

The  RSFSR  harvests  about  a  quarter  of  Soviet  grain  corn,  with  area  and  yield  of 
approximately  1.4  million  hectares  and  2.5  tons  per  hectare,  respectively. 
Almost  75  percent  of  the  RSFSR's  grain  corn  area  is  cultivated  in  the  North 
Caucasus  oblasts  of  Rostov  (0.4  million  hectares),  Krasnodar,  and  Stavropol. 
Other  important  oblasts  include  Volgograd  (Volga  Valley)  and  Voronezh  (Black 
Soil) . 

In  areas  outside  the  heartland.  Central  Asia  grows  about  6  percent  of  Soviet 
grain  corn,  followed  by  Moldavia  (4  percent)  and  Transcaucasus  (2  percent). 
Yields  in  these  areas  tend  to  be  higher  than  the  national  average,  particularly 
in  the  Central  Asian  republics  of  Kirghiz  (6.5  tons  per  hectare)  and  Tajik 
(5. 0-5. 5). 


Millet 

Soviet  millet  production  averages  3.3  million  tons  annually  from  2.7  million 
hectares.  All  millet  is  grown  in  the  heartland  regions;  the  RSFSR,  Ukraine, 
and  Kazakhstan  contribute  66,  19,  and  15  percent  of  total  production, 
respectively.  Yields  vary  from  0.7  tons  per  hectare  in  Kazakhstan  to  1.2  in 
the  RSFSR  and  1.8  in  the  Ukraine. 

In  the  RSFSR,  millet  is  cultivated  on  roughly  1.7  million  hectares,  mostly  in 
the  Volga  Valley  oblasts  of  Saratov  (0.4  million  hectares),  Volgograd,  and 
Kuibishev.  Other  important  millet-producing  oblasts  include:  Stavropol  and 
Rostov  (North  Caucasus);  Orenburg  (Ural);  and  Voronezh  (Black  Soil). 

Millet  in  the  Ukraine  is  grown  primarily  in  the  center-west,  with  11  of  the  25 
oblasts  cropping  more  than  20,000  hectares;  none,  however,  normally  harvests 
more  than  40,000  hectares.  Kazakhstan's  650,000  hectares  of  millet  is  centered 
in  the  oblasts  of  Pavlodar,  Kustanai,  and  Aktyubinsk. 

Buckwheat 


All  buckwheat  production  (roughly  1.5  million  tons  on  1.1  million  hectares)  is 
in  the  heartland  with  the  RSFSR  and  the  Ukraine  accounting  for  60  and  35 
percent  of  total  output,  respectively.  Important  oblasts  include:  Orlov, 
Tula,  and  Ryazan  (Central);  Kursk  (Black  Earth);  Tatar  ASSR  (Volga  Valley); 
Bashkir  (Ural);  Altai  (West  Siberia);  Amur  (East  Siberia);  Sumy  (Ukraine);  and 
Pavlodar  (Kazakhstan). 

Pulses 


Pulses,  overwhelmingly  dry  peas,  are  virtually  all  grown  in  the  homeland 
regions.  Average  Soviet  annual  pulse  output  approximates  8.0  million  tons  on 
6. 0-6. 5  million  hectares.  The  RSFSR  crops  about  62  percent  of  the  total  area 
with  greatest  concentration  in  the  following  oblasts/republics:  Voronezh 
(Black  Soil);  Tatar  ASSR  (Volga  Valley);  Bashkir  (Ural);  and  Altai  (West 
Siberia) . 

\ 


30 


The  Ukraine  cultivates  roughly  1.6  million  hectares  of  pulses  annually;  oblasts 
harvesting  more  than  100,000  hectares  are  Poltava,  Vinitsa,  Kiev,  khmelinitsa, 
Cherkassk,  and  Odessa. 

Rice 


The  Soviet  Union  is  a  minor  rice  producer  with  an  annual  late  1980' s  output, 
milled-basis,  of  1.7  million  tons  from  0.65  million  hectares.  The  heartland 
republics  harvest  slightly  more  than  three-quarters  of  total  production. 
Average  yields  are  highest  in  the  Ukraine  and  Kazakhstan,  roughly  3.3  tons  per 
hectare. 

Krasnodar  oblast  in  the  North  Caucasus  region  of  the  RSFSR  crops  almost  a 
quarter  of  Soviet  rice  hectarage;  Rostov  oblast  and  Dagestan  ASSR  each  harvest 
roughly  25,000  hectares  of  rice.  The  only  other  RSFSR  oblast  with  significant 
rice  production  is  Astrakhan,  in  the  Volga  Valley  economic  region.  Other 
heartland  oblasts  emphasizing  rice  are  Primorsk  (Far  East),  and  Kzyl-orda  and 
Chimkent  (Kazakhstan).  In  areas  outside  the  Soviet  heartland,  Uzbek  SSR  in 
Central  Asia  produces  about  0.5  million  tons  annually  on  150,000  hectares.

CORN  PRODUCTION  IN  SOUTH  AFRICA 


South  Africa  is  the  largest  producer  of  corn  in  Africa.  It  is  normally  a  major 
competitor  for  corn  exports.  This  year's  crop  area  is  estimated  to  follow  a 
declining  trend  of  over  half  of  the  total  grains  planted  to  corn  (52  percent), 
while  nearly  30  percent  of  the  total  estimated  harvested  area  is  devoted  to 
wheat.  Harvested  corn  area  for  1990/91  is  estimated  at  2.8  million  hectares, 
down  0.8  million  hectares  or  22  percent  from  1989/90.  Corn  production  for 
1990/91  is  estimated  at  6.0  million  tons,  down  3.2  million  or  35  percent  from 
last  year. 

Summer  rainfall  in  the  east  started  on  time,  but  was  below  normal.  Rainfall 
for  the  rest  of  the  country  was  well-below  normal  until  January.  As  a  result, 
the  crop  area  has  been  drastically  reduced  and  production  is  estimated  to  be 
cut  by  one- third.  As  seen  in  the  accompanying  weather  charts,  only  a  few 
pockets  of  near  normal  precipitation  fell  during  the  normal  planting  period  in 
the  corn  production  regions  of  Transvaal  and  Natal  from  October  to  December. 

In  addition,  the  temperature  was  above  normal,  causing  additional  stress  to  the 
crop. 

Production  is  concentrated  in  the  "maize  triangle"  of  northwest  and  northeast 
Orange  Free  State  (32  percent  of  total  production),  western  Transvaal  (29 
percent),  and  the  Transvaal  regions  referred  to  as  the  Eastern  Transvaal 
Highveld  (9  percent),  and  Rand  (3  percent).  White  corn,  which  is  used  largely 
for  human  consumption,  is  planted  in  the  eastern  triangle.  Yellow  corn,  used 
mainly  for  animal  feed,  is  grown  in  the  western  triangle.  This  year,  the 
Government  announced  that  yellow  corn  would  be  mixed  with  white  corn  (at  a 
ratio  of  15  percent  yellow  to  85  percent  white)  in  order  to  stretch  supplies 
for  human  consumption.  This  has  been  done  during  previous  crop  shortfalls  and 
although  not  popular  with  consumers,  it  is  considered  to  be  the  only 
alternative. 

Historically,  yields  have  been  widely  variable.  In  1982/83,  the  average  corn 
yield  was  1.0  ton  per  hectare,  while  in  1988/89,  the  yield  was  estimated  at 
3.28.  The  main  factor  affecting  yields  in  the  past  has  been  weather  during  the 
silk/tassel  period  of  January/February;  however,  this  year  the  farmer  had  to 
contend  with  a  drier-than-normal  period  during  the  planting  season.  In 
addition,  the  late  planting  means  that  much  of  the  crop  has  yet  to  go  through 
the  critical  silk/tassel  stage. 

Corn  is  normally  sown  from  October  to  mid-December,  reaches  the  silk/ tassel 
stage  in  January/February,  and  matures  in  April/June.  The  crop  is  allowed  to 
dry  in  the  field  since  little  drying  equipment  is  available.  This  year, 
plantings  were  reported  to  be  as  late  as  the  middle  of  January,  due  to 
insufficient  rainfall.  The  crops  that  were  planted  in  January  are  estimated  to 
have  a  low  yield  potential  and  much  of  the  late  plantings  may  not  be  harvested 
as  grain,  but  used  as  fodder.  Weather  in  the  coming  weeks  will  determine  how 
the  corn  will  be  utilized.  In  the  western  areas,  a  record  (for  late  plantings) 
480,000  hectares  were  reported  planted  between  December  31  and  January  15.  In 
addition,  a  large  portion  of  the  corn  crop  was  planted  about  2  to  6  weeks  late. 
Rather  than  having  corn  mature  and  dry  in  the  fields  in  March/April,  as  it 
normally  would,  the  late  planted  corn  will  still  be  in  the  grain  filling  stage 
during  this  period,  and  subject  to  risks  from  frost,  cold  weather,  and 
diminishing  rains. 


34 


Area  has  been  steadily  declining  as  South  Africa  attempts  to  stabilize  grain 
production,  particularly  corn.  The  Government  started  a  land  diversification 
program  in  1988,  but  only  568,000  hectares  have  been  pulled  into  the  program  up 
to  January  1991.  Farmers  are  reacting  rather  coolly  toward  this  program  since 
many  farmers  are  experiencing  debt  problems  which  make  it  difficult  to  move 
into  livestock.  Another  facet  of  the  program  is  that  production  is  more  a 
function  of  erratic  yields  rather  than  area.  Therefore,  reducing  area  will  not 
affect  production  as  much  as  the  yearly  fluctuations  in  yields  as  evidenced  by 
the  4  million  ton  and  12  million  ton  corn  crops  in  1983/84  and  1988/89, 
respectively.

DECIDUOUS  FRUIT  AND  TABLE  GRAPE  SITUATION 


World  commercial  apple  production  for  the  1990/91  season  is  expected  to  total 
21.2  million  tons,  down  2  percent  from  the  year  earlier  level.  Apple  crops  in 
the  United  States  and  Canada  were  hurt  by  unfavorable  weather  conditions  during 
the  pollination  and  bloom  stages.  Current  estimates  show  EC  output  down  4 
percent  from  1989/90  and  1  percent  from  the  October  USDA  estimates.  Output  in 
Germany  and  France,  two  of  the  larger  producers,  is  above  last  year's  level  as 
bumper  late  season  crops  helped  offset  part  of  the  early  season  losses  from  an 
April  freeze.  Production  in  Italy  is  estimated  down  about  7  percent  from  last 
year's  revised  figure.  The  preliminary  estimate  for  Southern  Hemisphere  apple 
production  is  3.1  million  tons,  up  2  percent  from  last  year.  Australia  and 
Chile  are  estimated  to  show  the  largest  volume  increases.  Australia  is 
benefiting  from  an  "on  year"  in  the  production  cycle.  Increased  bearing  area 
and  the  maturation  of  recent  plantings  are  boosting  Chilean  production. 

Commercial  pear  production  at  the  world  level  is  estimated  at  5.2  million  tons 
for  1990/91,  almost  unchanged  from  last  year.  North  American  output  is  up  4 
percent  because  of  a  larger  crop  in  the  United  States.  Production  in  the  EC  is 
estimated  down  2  percent  as  a  sharp  increase  in  Italy  was  more  than  offset  by 
declines  elsewhere.  The  large  Italian  crop  resulted  from  favorable  weather  and 
an  increase  in  harvested  area.  The  northern  EC  countries  were  hurt  by  a  spring 
freeze  and  excessively  dry  weather  in  many  producing  regions.  Pear  production 
in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  is  expected  to  total  770,300  tons,  about  1  percent 
above  the  1989/90  level.  Output  in  Chile  is  expected  to  increase  12  percent  as 
area  continues  to  increase  and  recently  planted  trees  mature.  However, 
forecast  declines  in  Argentina  and  New  Zealand  nearly  offset  the  increase  in 
Chile.

39 


Apricot  production  for  1991  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  is  now  forecast  at 
129,200  tons,  down  4  percent  from  1990.  Most  of  the  downturn  is  expected  to 
occur  in  South  Africa,  where  output  was  up  sharply  in  1990.  World  1990  apricot 
production  is  currently  estimated  at  1.2  million  tons,  down  5  percent  from 
1989,  but  up  2  percent  from  the  October  estimate.  Upward  revisions  in  the 
estimates  for  most  Southern  Hemisphere  countries  primarily  accounted  for  the 
change  since  October. 

The  Southern  Hemisphere's  1991  peach  and  nectarine  crop  is  forecast  at  628,000 
tons,  down  4  percent  from  1990.  Argentina's  crop  is  forecast  at  200,000  tons, 
down  20  percent,  largely  due  to  wind  and  hail  damage  early  in  the  growing 
season.  Australia,  Chile,  and  South  Africa  are  each  forecast  to  show  a  modest 
production  increase  but  not  enough,  in  aggregate,  to  offset  the  Argentine 
decline.  For  1990,  world  production  is  estimated  at  6.24  million  tons,  up 
somewhat  from  the  October  estimate  of  6.14  million  tons.  Better  than  expected 
harvests  in  the  United  States,  Italy,  and  Chile  accounted  for  most  of  the 
increase. 

Early  prospects  for  1991  table  grape  production  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  are 
very  favorable.  Preliminary  country  forecasts  aggregate  to  985,000  tons,  up  11 
percent  from  1990.  Chilean  production  is  forecast  at  720,000  tons,  up  90,000 
tons.  Area  was  up  again  in  1990  and  maturing  vineyards  are  pushing  up  the 
national  average  yield.  An  estimated  30  percent  of  Chile's  vineyards  are  still 
not  mature  from  the  standpoint  of  maximum  yields.  World  table  grape  production 
for  1990  is  estimated  at  4.6  million  tons,  1  percent  above  1989.  Aggregate 
forecasts  were  not  available  in  October,  but  among  the  individual  countries, 
Italy's  1990  output  is  down  3  percent  reflecting  crop  damage  caused  by  a 
prolonged  dry  spell.  Estimates  for  Argentina  and  Chile  have  been  revised 
upward.

FOREIGN  COTTON  AREA  INDICATIONS  FOR  1991/92 


Important  factors  that  influence  foreign  cotton  area  include  the  current  cotton 
market  situation,  domestic  and  world  economic  conditions,  government  policies, 
and  weather.  Of  these  factors,  this  season's  higher  cotton  prices  which  are 
associated  with  low  stock/use  ratios  are  providing  the  biggest  stimulus  for 
influencing  next  season's  cotton  area. 

Preliminary  indications  are  that  foreign  harvested  cotton  area  in  1991/92  could 
range  from  28.5  to  a  record  30.5  million  hectares.  The  high  end  of  the 
forecast  range  suggests  a  possible  increase  from  the  estimated  29  million 
hectares  harvested  in  1990/91  and  is  supported  by  current  higher  cotton  prices 
relative  to  last  season  and  continued  strong  demand.  The  low  end  of  the 
forecast  range  considers  the  possibility  of  weather-related  losses  and 
financial  problems. 

In  China,  as  in  the  past,  production  increases  are  needed  so  that  it  can 
maintain  its  role  as  a  major  exporter  of  both  raw  cotton  and  textiles  while 
meeting  its  rapidly  rising  domestic  consumption  requirements.  The  Government 
has  indicated  that  the  goal  for  the  eighth  5  year-plan  (1991-95)  is  to  produce 
21  to  23  million  480-pound  bales  per  year.  China  is  expected  to  continue  its 
push  to  increase  cotton  production  in  1991/92.  China's  27-percent  boost  in  the 
cotton  procurement  price  and  subsidization  of  cotton  production  inputs  prompted 
larger  plantings  for  1990.  While  there  are  no  signs  of  price  increases  for  the 
1991  season,  maintenance  of  cotton  prices  at  the  1990  level  combined  with 
depressed  grain  market  prices  should  help  ensure  a  slight  expansion  of  area 
planted  for  1991. 

Cotton  area  in  the  Soviet  Union  for  1991/92  is  affected  by  two  opposing  forces; 
the  need  to  earn  hard  currency  versus  the  need  to  provide  more  food  production 
for  the  cotton  producing  region  of  Soviet  Central  Asian  republics.  The 
strongest  argument  for  area  expansion  revolves  around  current  relatively  high 
world  cotton  prices  and  the  pressure  to  earn  hard  currency  by  means  of  cotton 
exports.  The  pressure  to  reduce  cotton  plantings  and  increase  the  area 
dedicated  to  food  and  forage  crop  production  comes  from  the  Asian  Republics. 

In  addition  to  their  food  concerns,  the  republics  have  experienced  an  increase 
in  land  salinity  from  cotton  irrigation.  On  balance,  cotton  area  is  expected 
to  decline  slightly  next  season  as  it  has  done  for  the  the  past  3  years. 

In  Mexico,  indications  are  that,  due  to  large  farmer  owned  stocks  of  poor 
quality  cotton,  area  planted  to  cotton  is  expected  to  be  down  from  the  1990/91 
level.  However,  the  exact  level  will  depend  primarily  on  financing  available 
to  producers.  Cotton  producers  have  had  2  consecutive  years  of  poor  cotton 
crops,  complete  with  high  levels  of  pre-  and  post-harvest  crop  losses.  This 
year,  producers  could  find  themselves  in  a  financial  crunch  with  their  amount 
of  private  saving  low  and  production  loans  hard  to  get.  In  most  Central 
American  countries,  planting  decisions  remain  uncertain.  Political  and  labor 
unrest,  foreign  exchange  needs,  and  input  costs  will  largely  determine  cotton 
production  levels  in  most  of  these  countries. 


45 


South  America  cotton  planting  for  1991/92,  which  will  begin  in  about  7  months, 
remain  uncertain.  If  production  financing  prospects  do  not  improve  from  the 
current  season,  plantings  are  likely  to  be  down  from  1990/91.  Lower  plantings 
are  most  probable  in  the  three  largest  producing  countries  of  Brazil, 

Argentina,  and  Paraguay.  In  Brazil,  the  largest  of  the  three,  sowing  will  be 
influenced  directly  by  the  level  of  rural  credit  availability,  minimum  support 
prices,  and  food  crop  prices  at  planting  time. 

In  South  Asia,  cotton  plantings  should  push  moderately  above  last  year. 

Although  plantings  in  Pakistan  will  not  begin  until  the  April-May  period, 
cotton  area  intentions  for  the  1991/92  season  are  being  influenced  by  this 
year's  higher  cotton  prices  along  with  a  continued  strong  domestic  demand  from 
the  expanding  textile  industry.  Area  expansion  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of 
available  land  in  the  major  cotton  producing  region.  In  India,  area  planted 
next  season  will  be  influenced  by  the  outcome  of  the  debate  between  textile 
mills  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  over  the  amount  of  cotton  to  be  exported 
out  of  the  1990/91  crop.  A  pro-export  decision  from  the  Indian  Government  is 
likely  to  push  cotton  prices  up  and  encourage  larger  plantings.  In  Australia, 
sowing  is  expected  to  increase  if  higher  cotton  prices  prevail  when  planting 
time  nears  in  September-October  and  sufficient  soil  moisture  is  available  to 
maintain  this  year's  level  of  dryland  seeding. 

In  Turkey,  cotton  sowing  in  May  of  this  year  is  expected  to  be  down  from  last 
season  as  farmers  switch  from  cotton  to  other  crops.  This  change  is  reflected 
in  the  shift  in  government  policy  not  to  include  cotton  in  the  Government's 
support  program.  Currently,  domestic  lint  prices  are  lower  than  last  year  as 
imports  of  raw  cotton,  cotton  yarn,  and  fabric  at  competitive  prices  have 
depressed  domestic  prices.  This  has  forced  the  agricultural  marketing 
cooperatives,  which  had  purchased  cotton  from  member  farmers  at  approved 
government  prices,  to  miss  timely  payments  to  cotton  farmers.  This  condition 
is  expected  to  continue  into  next  season.  The  planting  of  cotton  takes  place 
following  the  harvest  of  wheat  in  the  early  spring.  Since  cotton  is  excluded 
from  Government  support  and  production  costs  are  higher  for  cotton  compared 
with  other  crops,  the  planting  of  soybeans  and/or  corn  after  the  wheat  harvest 
is  drawing  farmers  away  from  cotton  in  the  Adana,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  in 
the  Aegean  regions.  Syria  plans  to  increase  the  area  planted  to  cotton.  The 
area  actually  sown  will  depend  upon  the  severity  of  the  current  drought  and  its 
impact  on  the  availability  of  irrigation  water.  If  the  rainfall  continues  to 
be  below  average,  irrigation  for  cotton  and  other  summer  crops  will  be  limited. 

A  moderate  increase  is  forecast  for  cotton  planting  in  Africa.  Many  of  these 
countries  depend  very  heavily  on  cotton  exports  for  sorely  needed  foreign 
exchange  earnings.  Because  of  this  need,  there  is  strong  support  for  the 
cotton  sector.  In  West  Africa,  this  is  particularly  true  for  Cote  d'Ivoire, 
Mali,  Benin,  Cameroon,  and  Burkina.  The  Egyptian  Government  would  like  to 
expand  cotton  area.  However,  the  major  constraint  to  production  continues  to 
be  the  lack  of  incentive  due  to  the  low  procurement  price.  Thus  far  the 
Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Reclamation  and  other  concerned  Ministries  do 
not  appear  inclined  to  liberalize  controls  on  cotton  production  or  marketing  or 
to  increase  the  procurement  price  next  season.  In  Sudan,  it  appears  that  area 
will  increase  to  provide  much  needed  foreign  exchange  from  cotton  exports.  The 
cotton  area  in  Zimbabwe  also  is  anticipated  to  increase  as  the  Government  has 
raised  producer  prices  to  encourage  farmers  to  plant  more  cotton.  South 
African  area  is  expected  to  rebound  from  the  1990  drought  reduced  area. 


46 


Cotton  area  in  the  European  Community  (EC)  is  likely  be  slightly  below  last 
year's  level  as  alternative  crops,  such  as  corn,  are  currently  at  very 
attractive  price  levels.  However,  planting  decisions  are  especially  difficult 
to  forecast  at  this  time  since  the  EC  is  delaying  the  1991/92  price  package  as 
they  reform  the  Common  Agricultural  Policy.  Greece,  the  largest  EC  producer, 
is  expected  to  shift  at  least  10  percent  of  its  area  to  corn. 

NOTE:  Information  in  this  article  is  based  on  field  reports  received  in  early 
January  1991  from  U.S.  agricultural  counselors  and  attaches.  Actual  area  could 
vary  from  these  estimates  for  a  number  of  reasons,  including  government  policy 
changes,  weather  during  the  crop  season,  and  price  changes  for  cotton  and 
competing  crops.  The  first  official  USDA  forecast  of  total  1991/92  foreign 
harvested  area  will  be  issued  in  May.  Individual  country  estimates  for  area, 
yield,  and  production  will  be  released  in  July.

DAIRYING  IN  GERMANY 


Reunification  of  East  and  West  Germany  became  a  fact  on  Oct.  3rd  1990,  but  even 
before  that  the  reunification  process  was  having  an  important  impact  on  the 
agricultural  sector  and  on  dairying  in  particular.  Available  information 
indicates  dairying,  particularly  in  the  eastern  region  (the  former  East 
Germany),  has  been  impacted  significantly.  This  article  presents  some  of  the 
characteristics  of  the  dairy  sector  in  both  regions  of  Germany  and  discusses 
some  of  the  adjustments  that  are  being  made  in  the  dairy  sector  in  eastern 
Germany  as  it  integrates  with  western  Germany  (the  former  West  Germany)  and  the 
European  Community  (EC). 

A  comparison  of  the  structure  of  dairying  in  the  two  regions  gives  some 
indication  of  the  potential  problems.  Dairying  in  western  Germany  is 
characterized  by  many  small  to  moderately  sized  operations.  Statistics  for 
1987  indicated  that  it  had  330,000  dairy  herds  with  an  average  size  of  16  cows. 
This  is  the  lowest  average  in  the  northern  EC  countries.  France,  with  the  next 
lowest  average,  reported  a  20  head  average  while  neighboring  Belgium  and  The 
Netherlands  had  averages  of  24  and  40  head,  respectively.  Half  the  national 
herd  is  reported  to  be  held  by  farms  milking  20  to  50  cows.  German  Fresian,  a 
dual  purpose  breed,  is  the  most  popular,  accounting  for  about  half  the  herd. 
Simmental,  also  dual  purpose,  accounts  for  one-fourth  the  herd. 

In  contrast  to  the  relatively  small  units  in  western  Germany,  milk  production 
in  eastern  Germany  is  characterized  by  a  small  number  of  large  units.  Prior  to 
reunification,  the  national  average  was  reported  to  be  above  500  milk  cows  per 
farm  with  some  units  as  large  as  2,000  cows.  The  dual  purpose,  black  and  white 
breed  (Fresian)  predominates.  During  the  past  decade.  East  German  planners 
thought  that  more  beef  rather  than  more  milk  was  needed  with  the  result  that 
beef  production,  was  emphasized.  A  result  of  that  emphasis  has  probably  been  a 
reduction  in  the  genetic  potential  of  the  herd  to  produce  milk. 

Despite  the  large  differences  in  the  structure  of  milk  production,  differences 
in  the  milk  processing  industry  are  probably  of  even  more  importance.  The  milk 
processing  industry  of  western  Germany  is  generally  in  the  hands  of  producer 
owned  cooperatives  and  is  modern  and  up  to  date  in  terms  of  both  product 
quality  and  variety  of  products  and  packaging.  The  state  owned  processing 
sector  in  the  former  East  Germany,  while  producing  a  safe  product  health  wise, 
generally  had  not  kept  up  with  modern  methods,  with  the  result  that  quality, 
variety,  and  packaging  are  not  up  to  international  standards.  Thus  as  soon  as 
trade  within  the  country  was  freed,  consumers  in  the  eastern  regions  tended  to 
strongly  favor  products  from  western  Germany.

With  its  reunification  with  western  Germany,  the  dairy  industry  in  eastern 
Germany  also  became  subject  to  EC  rules  and  benefits.  Some  of  the  changes  that 
will  bring  include  changes  in  the  number  of  cows  being  milked,  feed  usage,  milk 
production  and  utilization,  prices,  and  the  structure  of  the  processing 
industry. 


50 


MILK 


Under  the  Common  Agricultural  Policy  of  the  EC  (CAP),  milk  deliveries  to 
dairies  in  eastern  Germany  must  fall  by  at  least  20  percent,  from  the  7.8 
million  tons  bought  by  the  state  in  1989  to  6.3  million  tons  in  1991/92.  The 
temporary  quota  for  eastern  Germany  was  set  at  5.37  million  tons  for  the  period 
July  1,  1990  to  March  31,  1991.  As  private  farmers  break  away  from  the 
collective  farms,  they  are  given  a  part  of  the  quota  from  their  parent  farm. 
Farmers  are  adjusting  dairy  herds  in  response  to  the  signals  of  the  market. 
Official  statistics  show  that  the  number  of  milk  cows  declined  from  a  high  of 
2.0  million  in  1988,  to  1.9  million  by  August  1,  1990.  During  1990,  many  dairy 
cows  were  sold  for  slaughter  and  the  meat  exported,  in  large  part  to  the  USSR 
and  other  EC  countries. 

Along  with  declining  cow  numbers  in  eastern  Germany,  feeding  regimes  are 
changing  as  well.  In  the  past,  mixed  feeds  were  formulated  from  whatever 
grains  and  feeds tuffs  were  available  as  long  as  they  met  minimum  standards. 

Now,  farmers  can  freely  purchase  feeds  to  maximize  output,  so  the  productivity 
per  cow  is  increasing. 

In  contrast  to  the  problems  of  most  of  the  dairy  sector  in  eastern  Germany, 
reunification  has  permitted  the  reconstruction  of  natural  trade  ties  between 
the  city  of  Berlin  and  the  surrounding  countryside  for  the  supply  of  milk.  The 
city  dairy  of  West  Berlin,  which  in  the  past  trucked  milk  to  Berlin  from  as  far 
away  as  Bavaria,  plans  to  buy  most  of  its  raw  milk  from  local  (eastern  region) 
farmers. 

The  average  price  paid  to  East  German  farmers  for  milk  in  1989  was  1,700  East 
German  marks  per  ton.  The  current  guaranteed  producer  price  for  raw  milk  is 
DM628  per  ton.  Under  the  CAP,  farmers  are  guaranteed  a  minimum  price  for  milk 
up  to  the  farm  quota  level,  so  the  efficient  milk  producers  in  the  East  should 
be  able  to  prosper.  However,  despite  the  price  protection  offered  by  the  CAP, 
many  farms  are  facing  an  uncertain  financial  and  legal  future  as  the  region 
tries  to  adjust  to  market  relationships. 

DAIRY  PROCESSING 


The  major  problems  facing  the  milk  industry  stem  from  an  outdated  and 
under-capitalized  processing  industry  and,  as  a  result,  the  milk  processing 
sector  of  Eastern  Germany  is  undergoing  a  major  restructuring.  Of  155  milk 
processing  plants  in  operation  at  the  end  of  1989,  only  118  were  operating  in 
late  1990,  and  some  trade  sources  were  forecasting  that  only  half  of  those 
plants  would  survive.  Of  the  155  facilities,  76  belonged  to  cooperatives,  59 
were  state  factories  and  20  were  small  private  processors.  Many  factories, 
including  half  of  the  cheese  facilities,  closed  because  farmers  sold  their  milk 
to  processors  in  western  Germany  that  could  pay  an  acceptable  cash  price  upon 
delivery.  Meanwhile,  processors  in  eastern  Germany  faced  severe  cash  flow 
problems  because  the  generous  subsidies  of  the  previous  regime  were  abolished 
in  July  1990. 


51 


BUTTER 


The  former  East  Germany  produced  two  grades  of  butter.  The  lower  grade,  used 
for  domestic  consumption,  contained  70  percent  fat  and  accounted  for  18  percent 
of  production.  The  other  grade,  with  82  percent  fat  content,  was  exported 
where  possible,  or  sold  domestically.  In  1990,  almost  all  of  the  butter 
produced  in  eastern  Germany  was  of  the  higher  fat  content.  The  quality  of  the 
butter  produced  in  eastern  Germany  differs  somewhat  from  the  EC  norms. 

The  policy  of  the  previous  regime  was  to  maximize  butter  production  in  order  to 
sell  it  on  the  world  market  for  hard  currency.  Butter  production  reached 
313,000  tons  in  1989  and  has  continued  strong  in  1990.  Strong  performance 
occurred  in  1990  despite  the  introduction  of  the  free  market  system  and  the 
loss  of  domestic  consumption  because  it  was  supported  by  an  intervention  buying 
system  introduced  on  July  16,  1990. 

The  continued  high  production  of  butter  in  1990  is  not  due  to  buoyant  consumer 
demand  but  to  intervention  buying.  Some  officials  estimate  that,  since  July  1, 
1990,  only  one-third  of  the  butter  produced  in  eastern  Germany  was  consumed 
there.  Total  butter  consumption  has  fallen  sharply  due  to  declining 
consumption  of  bread  and  the  availability  of  many  tasteful  low-priced  margarine 
products  and  vegetable  oils  for  cooking. 

CHEESE 


Increased  cheese  production  was  another  of  the  priorities  of  the 
previous  regime.  Cheese  production  in  the  former  East  Germany  had  increased  30 
percent  during  the  last  5  years  of  the  1980's.  However,  the  long  awaited 
investment  program  for  the  cheese  processing  industry  did  not  materialize,  and 
as  a  result,  the  cheese  sector  met  the  market  economy  with  outdated  equipment 
and  a  poor  market  image.  In  1989,  hard  cheese  accounted  for  half  of  total 
cheese  production,  soft  cheese  for  15  percent,  and  the  rest  was  a  variety  of 
fresh  cheeses.  The  sharp  reduction  in  cheese  production  was  comparable  for  all 
types. 

East  German  citizens  previously  consumed  record  amounts  of  cheese,  due  to  ample 
availability,  a  relatively  wide  range  of  fairly  consistent  products,  and 
subsidized  prices.  In  1988,  per  capita  consumption  of  all  cheeses  was  15.8 
kilograms  compared  to  9.7  in  western  Germany.  This  consumption  pattern  was 
broken  with  the  introduction  of  a  vast  array  of  new  foods  which  became 
available  in  eastern  Germany  in  1990.  By  April  consumers  had  more  choice  of 
vegetables,  fruits,  and  sausages  than  before.  With  the  currency  union  on  July 
1,  1990,  cheese  products  from  western  Germany  tended  to  dominate  the  market  as 
consumer  demand  for  products  from  eastern  Germany  declined  and  as  many  eastern 
Germany  based  wholesale  networks  were  replaced  by  western  wholesalers  who 
brought  in  western  products. 

NONFAT-DRY  MILK  (NDM) 

Dry  milk  is  produced  by  2  methods  in  eastern  Germany.  Roughly  half  the  total 
output  is  produced  by  13  plants  using  the  spray-dry  method  while  the  other  half 
is  produced  by  24  plants  using  the  roll-dry  method.  The  average  composition  of 
NDM  is  reported  to  be  1.5  percent  or  less  butterfat  and  94  percent  dry  matter. 


52 


Preliminary  information  indicated  output  of  NDM  has  been  less  affected  by 
reunification  than  other  dairy  products  largely  due  to  price  support  by  the 
intervention  system.  The  Government  of  East  Germany,  in  coordination  with  and 
funded  by  the  Government  of  West  Germany,  initiated  an  intervention  program  for 
NDM  produced  in  eastern  Germany  in  mid-July.  This  intervention  system  for 
eastern  Germany  ended  on  September  30  when  the  EC  system  was  applied.  The 
intervention  price  for  NDM  in  eastern  Germany  is  over  DM6,400  per  ton.  Even  at 
this  price,  some  plants  claim  losses  of  up  to  DM1,000  per  ton  because  their 
cost  of  production  is  too  high  due  to  out-of-date  technology. 

SUMMARY 


During  the  next  2  or  3  years,  the  diary  sector  in  the  former  East  Germany  is 
expected  to  continue  to  go  through  major  restructuring  as  it  attempts  to 
harmonize  with  EC  rules  and  markets.  This  restructuring  will  continue  to  put 
major  financial  pressure  on  inefficient  producers  and  processors.  After  the 
restructuring  is  complete  it  is  likely  that  with  its  larger  herds,  milk 
production  in  eastern  Germany  will  have  some  economic  advantages  over 
production  in  the  western  region.

EC-12  RAPESEED  PLANTING  INTENTIONS 


The  European  Community  (EC-12)  rapeseed  area  is  estimated  to  increase  7  percent 
from  an  estimated  1.97  million  hectares  to  a  record  estimated  2.11  million 
hectares  (excluding  eastern  Germany)  in  1991/92.  The  unification  of  eastern 
and  western  Germany  will  boost  that  country's  rapeseed  area  to  40  percent  of 
total  EC-12  area.  France  will  drop  to  second  place  with  29  percent  of  the 
total.  Although  most  of  the  rapeseed  has  already  been  planted,  the  oilseed 
scheme  is  expected  to  change  as  the  European  Commission  is  currently  reforming 
their  Common  Agricultural  Policy.  The  following  is  an  unofficial  USDA  country 
by  country  estimate  of  planted  rapeseed  area  for  1991/92  obtained  from  U.S. 
agricultural  counsleors  and  attaches  stationed  in  western  Europe. 

GERMANY :  Rapeseed  area  for  a  united  Germany  is  forecast  to  increase  30  percent 
to  940,000  hectares  in  1991/92.  Similar  to  last  year,  this  winter  has  been 
mild.  Due  to  improved  winter-hardy  varieties  very  little  winter  kill  is 
expected.  The  former  West  Germany  is  expected  to  plant  677,000  hectares  in 
winter  rapeseed  and  13,000  hectares  in  spring,  while  the  former  East  Germany  is 
expected  to  plant  236,000  hectares  in  winter  rapeseed  and  14,000  hectares  in 
spring.  In  the  West,  farmers  have  shifted  almost  completely  to  double  low 
varieties.  The  situation  in  the  East  is  less  certain,  but  reports  indicate 
that  most  farmers  purchased  double  low  varieties. 

FRANCE:  Rapeseed  area  is  forecast  unchanged  at  680,000  hectares  in  1991/92  due 
to  less  favorable  rapeseed  prices  compared  to  grain  returns.  The  winter 
rapeseed  crop,  which  accounts  for  nearly  all  the  rapeseed,  was  sown  with 
little  delay  and  is  benefiting  from  the  average  winter  conditions. 

UNITED  KINGDOM:  Rapeseed  area  is  forecast  to  increase  5  percent  to  410,000 
hectares  in  1991/92.  The  winter  rapeseed  crop  condition  is  variable  this  year. 
New  crop  rapeseed  has  emerged  well  in  light  soils,  but  uneven  on  heavy  soils, 
such  as  in  East  Angelia.  Nearly  all  the  area  is  reportedly  sown  in  double  low 
varieties. 

DENMARK:  Rapeseed  area  is  forecast  to  increase  marginally  to  270,000  hectares 
in  1991/92.  Winter  rapeseed  sowing  is  reported  at  215,000  hectares,  up  37 
percent  from  last  year  due  to  Danish  legislation  requiring  65  percent  of  the 
arable  land  covered  with  growth  during  the  winter  to  absorb  nitrate  washout.  A 
mild  winter,  coupled  with  hardy  winter  rapeseed  varieties  will  improve  yield 
prospects  for  1991/92. 

SPAIN:  Rapeseed  area  is  forecast  to  increase  to  30,000  hectares,  up  from 
25,000  hectares  last  year.  Spanish  farmers  are  continuing  the  trend  to  plant 
more  rapeseed  as  an  alternative  crop. 

ITALY :  Rapeseed  area  is  forecast  unchanged  at  13,000  hectares.  After  2  years 
of  drier  than  normal  weather  in  central  Italy,  conditions  this  winter  have 
improved  potential  yield  prospects. 

THE  NETHERLANDS  AND  BELGIUM-LUXEMBOURG:  Rapeseed  area  in  the  Netherlands  is 
forecast  unchanged  at  7,000  hectares.  The  Government  is  a  major  producer  of 
rapeseed  as  they  plant  the  crop  on  reclaimed  land  before  turning  the  land  over 
to  the  farmer.  Belgium-Luxembourg  is  forecast  to  increase  rapeseed  area 
significantly  during  1991/92,  climbing  to  8,000  hectares  from  5,000  hectares 
last  year.  The  farmers  view  rapeseed  as  a  profitable  crop  for  1991/92.

SENEGALESE  AGRICULTURAL  PRODUCTION 


AGRICULTURAL  OVERVIEW 


The  Government  of  Senegal  has  historically  performed  a  major  role  in  regulating 
the  agricultural  sector.  During  the  mid-1980's  however,  the  Government 
launched  a  new  agricultural  policy  as  part  of  an  economic  reform  package  aimed 
at  reducing  the  role  of  the  Government  in  the  agricultural  and  commercial 
sectors.  The  policy  intended  to  increase  productivity  and  reduce  government 
intervention  by  eliminating  input  subsidy  and  credit  programs,  removing  support 
prices  on  coarse  grains,  and  liberalizing  domestic  grain  markets.  The 
Government  retained  its  role  in  extension  and  research  services,  holding  seed 
stocks,  and  regulating  the  market  for  oilseeds.  As  part  of  a  current  banking 
reform  movement  the  Government  has  also  reduced  its  ownership  in  any  bank  to  25 
percent.  This  initiative  has  forced  many  banks  to  close  or  be  restructured. 

As  a  result,  banks  were  reluctant  to  extend  credit  to  farmers  during  this 
transition  period,  leaving  farmers  without  adequate  funds  for  the  1990/91 
planting  season. 

The  reduced  availability  of  credit  for  the  purchase  of  inputs  coupled  with  the 
progressive  reduction  of  input  subsidies,  have  limited  fertilizer  use  during 
the  1990/91  season.  Most  inputs  are  purchased  for  use  on  cash  crops  such  as 
peanuts  and  cotton,  although  some  fertilizers  and  pesticides  are  used  on 
irrigated  rice  and  corn.  While  grain  production  is  primarily  for  local 
consumption  needs,  oilseeds  are  produced  to  generate  export  earnings,  leaving 
the  oilseed  sector  more  vulnerable  to  changes  in  government  price  controls, 
input  subsidy  reductions,  and  credit  limitations. 

Agricultural  activity  is  localized  in  two  distinct  growing  regions.  The  Peanut 
Basin  in  the  south  and  the  Senegal  River  Basin  along  the  northern  border  of  the 
country.  The  major  agricultural  region,  the  Peanut  Basin,  lies  within  the 
Sahelian  zone  of  West  Africa  and  can  be  characterized  as  having  a  tropical 
climate  with  a  long  dry  season.  Oilseed  and  grain  production  are  primarily 
rain-fed,  and  productivity  is  dependent  on  the  length,  timing,  and  intensity  of 
the  rainy  season,  which  extends  from  May  until  October.  Peanut  and  millet  are 
the  predominant  crops  grown  in  the  Peanut  Basin.  Farmers  in  this  region 
currently  face  a  growing  problem  with  soil  nutrient  depletion.  Local  farmers 
use  virtually  all  peanut  and  millet  vegetative  material  as  fuel  and  feed, 
incorporating  a  negligible  amount  of  organic  matter  back  into  the  soil.  This 
problem  has  been  compounded  in  recent  years  by  the  decline  in  fertilizer  use  as 
input  subsidies  and  purchase  prices  are  phased  out.  Irrigated  rice  and  corn 
are  grown  in  the  Senegal  River  Basin,  which  falls  within  the  Sahelian  or 
sub-desert  region. 

The  1990/91  rainy  season  began  late,  with  inadequate  and  poorly  distributed 
rainfall  for  all  major  growing  regions.  Cumulative  rainfall  totals  in  the 
Peanut  Basin  ranged  from  approximately  20  to  70  percent  of  the  30-year  average. 
The  uneven  temporal  and  spatial  rainfall  distribution  was  most  damaging  to  crop 
development,  although  the  southern  Peanut  Basin,  which  is  the  major  cotton 
producing  region,  was  less  affected.  Crop  production  in  the  Senegal  River 
Basin  was  affected  by  the  lack  of  adequate  precipitation  and  was  further 
retarded  by  crop  diseases  and  insect  infestations.

COARSE  GRAINS 


Coarse  grains,  including  millet,  sorghum,  and  corn,  are  grown  for  local 
consumption  in  the  rural  areas.  Only  a  small  percentage  of  coarse  grain 
production  enters  the  commercial  sector  and  is  sold  to  urban  markets.  Land 
preparation,  tillage,  and  cultivation  are  performed  primarily  by  hand  or  with 
the  assistance  of  draft  animals.  Planting  begins  with  the  onset  of  the  rainy 
season  in  May  and  continues  until  July.  The  late  arrival  of  the  1990/91  rainy 
season  resulted  in  late  plantings  and  poor  early  crop  establishment. 

Harvesting  occurs  from  September  through  November.  Senegalese  farmers  planted 
1.111  MHa  of  coarse  grains  in  1990/91,  a  7  percent  decrease  from  the  1.197  MHa 
planted  last  year.  The  area  decline,  compounded  by  weather-induced  yield 
reductions  resulted  in  a  10  percent  decline  in  1990/91  coarse  grain  production. 

Millet  is  Senegal's  most  widely  produced  grain  crop.  In  1990/91  Senegal 
produced  an  estimated  567,000  tons,  down  13  percent  from  the  650,000  tons 
produced  in  1989/90.  The  decreased  production  was  due  both  to  an  area  shift  to 
peanuts  and  to  dry  weather.  All  production  is  rain-fed  with  the  exception  of 
approximately  6,000  irrigated  hectares  in  the  Senegal  River  Basin.  Sixty 
percent  of  the  crop  is  produced  in  the  Peanut  Basin,  where  millet  competes  with 
peanut  for  area.  However,  millet  is  not  a  competing  source  of  cash  income 
since  it  is  grown  as  a  staple  food  for  home,  consumption.  Fertilizers  and 
pesticides  are  generally  not  applied  to  millet,  although  some  application  of 
NPK  14-7-7  may  occur.  This  year  purchases  of  this  fertilizer  were  limited  due 
to  the  elimination  of  government  input  subsidies. 

Sorghum  production,  which  is  centered  in  the  primary  peanut  and  millet  growing 

regions,  was  also  negatively  impacted  by  the  poor  weather.  Seventy  percent  of 

Senegal's  corn  crop  is  produced  in  the  southeastern  Peanut  Basin  near  Kolda  and 
Tambacounda.  Production  is  typically  located  near  villages,  where  the  farmers 
can  easily  utilize  manure  and  village  waste  as  fertilizer.  Corn  is  usually  the 

first  crop  planted  in  the  south,  with  planting  under  way  in  May  and  harvest 

beginning  in  August.  In  the  southern-most  areas  farmers  have  recently  begun 
planting  corn  instead  of  millet,  due  to  corn's  greater  resistance  to  parasitic 
diseases.  Corn  production  is  primarily  rain-fed,  with  approximately  500 
hectares  of  irrigated  corn  grown  along  the  northern  Senegal  River. 

RICE 


Rice  is  planted  from  August  to  mid-September  and  is  grown  in  two  distinct 
regions.  The  northern  rice  production  areas  in  the  Senegal  River  Basin  account 
for  55  percent  of  total  production.  Farmers  in  the  southern  Casamance  region 
produce  40  percent  of  Senegal's  rice  crop.  All  production  in  the  Senegal  River 
Basin  is  irrigated,  whereas  production  in  Casamance  is  rainfed.  Fertilizer  use 
is  limited  to  areas  of  high  rainfall  or  irrigation.  Irrigated  rice  production 
costs  are  high  due  to  expensive  irrigation  supplies  and  land  development  costs 
-  associated  with  the  expansion  of  irrigated  area  and  the  completion  of  the 
Manatali  and  Diama  dams.  Due  to  credit  limitations  at  the  outset  of  the 
1990/91  season,  farmers  in  the  Senegal  River  Basin  lacked  the  funds  needed  to 
purchase  irrigation  equipment.  Producer  inability  to  obtain  credit  for  input 
purchases  and  equipment  resulted  in  yield  reductions.  Recent  civil  unrest  in 
the  Casamance  region  disrupted  production  operations  as  the  conflict 
intensified.  The  irregular  1990/91  rainy  season  also  contributed  to  yield 
reductions.

OILSEEDS 


Oilseeds  are  cash  crop  alternatives  to  the  basic  food  crops,  such  as  rice, 
millet,  sorghum,  and  corn.  Peanuts  and  cottonseed  are  the  two  predominant 
oilseeds  produced  in  Senegal.  Government  oilseed  policy  is  primarily  aimed  at 
supporting  farm  income.  A  secondary  objective  is  to  encourage  foreign  exchange 
earnings.  These  objectives  are  achieved  through  the  implementation  of 
guaranteed  producer  prices  and  the  underwriting  of  the  crushing  industry. 
Subsidizing  of  cottonseed  and  peanut  export  products,  combined  with  the  taxing 
of  imports,  serves  as  a  means  of  combating  the  country's  reportedly  overvalued 
currency. 

Senegal  is  Africa's  largest  peanut  producing  country.  The  most  important 
oilseed  crop  is  peanuts,  and  they  have  been  an  important  cash  crop  since  the 
mid-1800's.  Oilstock  peanuts  are  the  most  widely  produced.  The  export  of 
peanut  meal  and  oil  is  a  major  foreign  exchange  earner  for  Senegal.  Smuggling 
of  peanuts  from  The  Gambia  into  Senegal  is  widespread;  Gambian  farmers  can  move 
their  crop  across  the  border  and  sell  the  peanuts  for  a  greater  profit,  due  to 
the  higher  peanut  support  price  paid  in  Senegal.  Last  year  farmers  produced  an 
estimated  0.815  MMT  of  peanuts  from  0.784  MHa,  leaving  farmers  with  a 
substantial  carry  over  of  personal  seed  stocks.  Significant  area  diversions 
from  millet  to  peanuts  occurred  due  to  the  abundance  of  seed.  However,  this 
area  increase  was  more  than  offset  by  the  weather-induced  yield  reductions. 

Cottonseed  is  produced  as  a  by-product  of  the  cotton  fiber  industry.  Area 
planted  to  cotton  reached  a  peak  in  1984/85  at  46,000  hectares  with 
production  at  87,000  480-pound-bales,  then  began  to  decline  as  farmers 
responded  to  the  lack  of  incentives  for  cotton  production.  The  gradual 
elimination  of  subsidies  on  farm  inputs  has  made  production  of  cotton,  which 
requires  intensive  use  of  inputs,  less  attractive  to  farmers.  Area  planted  to 
cotton  fell  to  a  record  low  level  of  24,000  hectares  last  year.  Cotton  area 
increased  50  percent  to  an  estimated  36,000  hectares  in  1990/91,  as  producers 
returned  to  cotton  and  planted  less  food  crops  such  as  millet  and  cowpeas.  The 
inadequate  and  poorly  distributed  rainfall  during  the  1990/91  growing  season 
also  affected  cotton  yields.  However,  the  primary  cotton  growing  region  in 
Casamance  is  located  in  the  southern  Peanut  Basin,  where  rainfall  was  somewhat 
more  favorable  than  in  other  regions.  Cotton  yields  were  therefore  not  reduced 
as  dramatically  as  peanut  yields.  Cotton  production  in  1990/91  is  expected  to 
be  about  55,000  480-pound-bales.  There  is  growing  concern  that  the  reductions 
in  subsidies  on  farm  inputs  may  seriously  impact  future  productivity  of  the 
cotton  sector.  Traditionally,  cotton  has  been  a  relatively  profitable  crop, 
however,  the  high  production  costs  associated  with  cotton  make  it  sensitive  to 
credit  limitations  and  input  costs.

February  1991  Production  Estimates  &  Crop  Assessment  Division,  FAS,  USDA 


INDONESIAN  OILSEEDS 


Total  Indonesian  oilseed  production  is  expected  to  reach  a  record  3.94  million 
tons  during  1990/91,  the  fourth  record  crop  in  as  many  years.  This  figure 
includes  copra,  soybeans,  peanuts,  and  cottonseed.  The  USDA  total  oilseed 
figure  does  not  include  tropical  oils  production,  such  as  palm  oil,  choosing 
instead  to  publish  palm  oil  as  a  separate  category.  Palm  oil  accounts  for  the 
bulk  of  domestic  production,  estimated  at  a  record  2.35  million  tons  for 
1990/91. 

COPRA 


Copra  rivals  soybeans  in  volume  of  production,  estimated  at  1.25  million  tons. 
But  unlike  soybeans,  copra  output  has  remained  stable  over  the  last  10  years, 
while  soybean  production  nearly  doubled.  Copra  is  grown  throughout  Indonesia, 
97  percent  by  small  private  producers.  The  island  of  Celebes  (also  known  as 
Sulawesi)  accounts  for  25  percent  of  total  output,  followed  by  Sumatra,  Java, 
and  Ambon.  The  use  of  coconut  for  domestic  consumption  and  home-crush  for  oil 
is  widespread.  Copra  that  enters  the  commercial  market  is  influenced  by  the 
excess  above  domestic  utilization  and  the  price  of  copra â which  is  sensitive  to 
the  copra  situation  in  the  neighboring  Philippines.  Area  planted  to  coconut 
trees  has  remained  stable,  with  trees  being  replanted  due  to  age  and  low 
productivity.  The  U.S.  agricultural  attache  stationed  in  Jakarata  reports  that 
an  estimated  30  percent  of  the  coconut  trees  on  North  Celebes  require 
replacement.  Most  coconut  trees  are  the  low  yielding  variety  (characteristic 
of  tall  trees).  It  is  estimated  that  more  than  50  percent  of  all  trees  are 
over  10  years  old  with  many  of  these  over  50  years  old.  Re-plantings  are 
proceeding  at  a  slow  pace  however,  as  government  credit  has  been  in  short 
supply,  leaving  most  producers  dependent  on  World  Bank  funds  through  the 
Smallholders  Coconut  Development  Program. 

SOYBEANS 


Soybean  production  in  1990/91  is  estimated  at  1.20  million  tons,  up  0.1  million 
from  last  year,  and  equal  to  the  record  set  during  1988/89.  Although  average 
yield  was  slightly  below  the  5-year  trend,  record  harvested  area  bolstered 
output.  Soybeans  are  grown  mainly  in  the  East  and  Central  regions  of  the 
island  of  Java  (accounting  for  approximately  57  percent).  The  remainder  is 
grown  on  Sumatra  (about  24  4)ercent)  and  more  recently  on  the  island  of  Celebes 
(5  percent).  Many  soybeans  are  double  cropped,  with  the  first  harvest  during 
February  through  April  and  the  second  harvest  lasting  from  July  through  August. 
Competitive  crops  are  mainly  rice  and  corn.  Rice  is  the  most  important  crop 
due  to  the  Government's  long-standing  rice  support  program â including  input 
price  supports,  extension  services,  and  government  credit â to  attain 
self-sufficiency.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the  central  Java  region,  where 
both  soybeans  and  rice  are  significant  crops.  Recent  reductions  in  government 
input  supports  for  rice  and  soybeans â which  are  not  expected  to  effect  soybeans 
due  to  the  low  use  of  fertilizers  by  producers â and  real  rice  prices  below  last 
year,  favors  soybeans  over  rice  for  some  producers.  The  Government  has 
targeted  soybean  area  expansion  to  increase  by  300,000  hectares  (equivalent  to 
an  estimated  295,000  tons)  over  the  next  few  years,  but  this  level  may  have 
little  chance  of  success  without  additional  incentives.  At  present,  the  major 
government  incentive  for  soybeans  is  the  protection  of  the  domestic  price  which 
is  often  30  to  50  percent  above  the  world  market  price.  BULOG,  the  Indonesian 
National  Food  Agency,  effectively  supports  the  domestic  price  by  restricting 
imports  of  soybeans  and  soybean  meal  through  import  licensing.

PEANUTS 


Indonesia  is  the  world's  fourth  largest  peanut  producer,  but  only  comprises  4 
percent  of  the  world's  total  output.  With  harvested  area  estimated  at  620,000 
hectares  and  adequate  rainfall,  1990/91  production  is  pegged  at  a  record 
880,000  tons,  up  slightly  over  last  year.  Peanuts  are  grown  mainly  on  the 
islands  of  Java  (70  percent)  and  Sumatra  (14  percent).  There  is  no  active 
Indonesian  Government  program  for  peanuts  as  there  is  for  other  commodities 
such  as  rice  and  soybeans.  The  Government's  first  priority  in  food  production 
is  aimed  at  maintaining  rice  self-sufficiency,  with  its  second  priority  focused 
on  the  achievement  of  soybean  self-sufficiency.  The  Government  allocates 
limited  credit  to  the  farmers  and  they  in  turn  prefer  to  use  it  for  rice. 
Despite  Indonesia's  attempts  to  increase  peanut  production  through  research 
into  improved  varieties  and  input  packages,  production  increases  have  been 
small  from  year  to  year  and  are  unlikely  to  change  in  the  near  future. 

COTTONSEED 


Cotton  production  is  a  minor  crop  in  Indonesia,  resulting  in  estimated 
cottonseed  output  of  just  6,000  tons  in  1990/91,  unchanged  for  the  last  3 
years.  Cottonseed  output  is  not  expected  to  increase  in  the  future,  since  net 
returns  to  domestically  produced  cotton  are  generally  below  that  of  alternative 
crops.  Cotton  is  mainly  grown  on  the  south  and  southeast  of  Celebes,  followed 
by  the  islands  of  Tenggara  and  Java.  Yields  are  typically  low,  as  cotton  is 
usually  planted  on  dry,  non-irrigated,  marginal  land.  In  addition,  Indonesia's 
tropical  climate  and  pest  problems  pose  continuous  obstacles  to  efficient  and 
profitable  production. 

PALM  OIL 


Palm  oil  production  is  by  far  the  largest  domestic  oil  crop  grown  in  Indonesia, 
estimated  at  a  record  2.35  million  tons  in  1990/91,  accounting  for  20  percent 
of  world  output.  This  places  Indonesia  as  the  world's  second  largest  palm  oil 
producer,  but  well  behind  it's  neighbor  Malaysia â estimated  to  produce  6.20 
million  tons  in  1990/91.  Palm  oil  output  has  virtually  set  new  records  every 
year.  With  the  recent  aggressive  government  programs  to  stimulate  private 
investment  in  oil  palm  development,  this  sector  has  begun  to  increase  output  at 
a  more  rapid  pace.  With  more  new  trees  beginning  to  bear  fruit,  output  has 
increased  by  over  30  percent  since  1988/89.  The  Government's  planned  oil  palm 
expansion  has  set  a  goal  of  4.0  million  tons  of  oil  by  the  year  1993,  but  the 
cost  of  corresponding  transportation  infrastructure  and  processing  facilities 
will  likely  slow  this  progress. 


61 


Oil  palm  is  grown  throughout  the  provinces  of  Indonesia,  with  the  largest  area 
in  North  Sumatra.  Recent  expansion  has  taken  place  in  southern  Sumatra, 
Sulawesi,  and  Kalimantan,  as  well  as  other  provinces.  The  Government's  program 
to  encourage  the  development  of  oil  palm  plantations  includes  liberal  licensing 
policies  and  the  Transmigration  Related  Nucleus  Estate  and  Smallholders 
(NES-Trans)  program,  in  order  to  ensure  that  small  producers  will  have  access 
to  the  commercial  sector.  At  present,  government  controlled  plantations 
account  for  two-thirds  of  large  shareholder  production,  the  rest  by  privately 
financed  operations â to  date  dominated  by  just  three  private  firms.  The 
Government  reports  that  over  the  past  year  dozens  of  licenses  have  been  issued 
for  new  plantations  and  crushing  facilities.  Some  of  these  plans  will  not 
materialize  but  expansion  of  Indonesia's  oil  palm  industry  is  healthy  and  is 
expected  to  continue  to  grow  in  the  foreseeable  future.
