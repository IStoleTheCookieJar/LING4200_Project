Danishness  in  the  Translation  of  the  Suiones 
Bernhard  Bierschenk 


Abstract  Six  translations  into  the  (1)  Swedish,  (2)  Danish,  (3)  English,  (4)  German,  (5)  French 
and  (6)  Italian  languages  have  been  carried  out.  Based  on  self-reference  and  self-organization, 
Danishness  in  the  structure  of  the  second  translation  is  shown  to  couple  with  system  dynamics. 
Balancing  the  operating  processes  implies  working  with  the  reversibly  synthesising  [AaO] 
mechanism  of  Perspective  Text  Analysis  (PTA).  Since  the  state  attractors  of  the  resulting 
landscapes  are  the  consequences  of  processing,  the  termini  have  important  theoretical 
implications  concerning  their  conservation  and  communication.  Its  strength  is  founded  on  the 
validity  of  the  computational  solution.  For  assessing  the  import  of  emergent  differences  in 
intention  and  orientation,  it  is  essential  to  conceive  the  variations  in  the  developing 
configurations  as  a result  of  natural  changes  in  their  degrees  of  complexity.  Thus,  a solution  to 
the  underlying  language  equations  comes  from  the  text  processing  itself,  which  however 
always  requires  the  presence  of  a structured  context.  As  a logical  consequence,  a solution 
becomes  determined  not  only  by  the  termini  but  also  by  the  landscape-embedded  structures. 
The  final  state  attractor  of  the  dimension  of  Intention  has  materialised  in  Alertness,  meanwhile 
the  global  state  attractor,  appearing  in  the  dimension  of  Orientation,  is  shown  to  connect  to 
Capacity. 


Source  Materials 

Structure  cannot  be  imposed  a priory,  but  can  only  be  discovered.  The  question  to  be 
answered  needs  to  address  the  kind  of  structure  that  is  establishing  itself  during  vernacular 
translations  of  the  Suiones.  A first  analysis  of  Chapter  44  of  the  Germania  has  been  used  with 
the  purpose  to  capture  the  typical  Swedish  self-understanding  with  the  purpose  to  provide  a 
long-range  correlation  in  a unique  physical  space-time  context.  Only  this  capacity  is 
contributing  to  the  fact  that  the  present  approach  is  binding  intentional  dynamics  to  the 
production  of  textual  movement  patterns.  The  produced  and  shaped  ‘Zeitgeist’  has  been 
presented  in  B.  Bierschenk  (2015). 

Furthermore,  the  basis  of  the  present  study  will  consist  of  the  Danish  translation  of 
Chapter  44.  Thereby,  the  basic  focus  will  be  on  the  textual  pattern  dynamics  as  outcome  of  a 
subtle  interplay  between  intentionality  and  orientation  of  the  Danish  translators  N.  W Bruun 
and  A.  A.  Lund  (1978)  and  a control  of  their  text  building  behaviour.  Text  building 
incorporates  markers  that  are  expected  to  specifying  a uniquely  Danish  perspective.  However 
an  operational  analysis  requires  a demonstrative  definition.  Such  a definition  will  be  based  on 
the  following  text:

vaben  ogsa  er  staerke  som  flademagt.  Skibenes  form  afviger  fra  den  gaengse  derved  at  der  er

sejl,  og  man  laegger  ikke  arene  i raekke  langs  siderne,  men  arerne  er  - ligesom  det  bruges  pa 
visse  floder  - l0se  og  kan  vendes  i den  ene  eller  anden  retiring,  som  forholdene  nu  kraever  det.

og  lediggang  far  let  bevaebnede  maend  til  at  gribe  til  vaben.  I hvert  fald  er  det  ikke  i en  konges

Since  a depiction  in  the  form  of  words  puts  the  producer  into  the  discourse,  perspectivation 
requires  the  presence  of  a perceiver  or  observer  of  the  scene,  which  is  producing  a verbal  or 
textual  expression.  A producer,  conceived  as  indicator,  provides  the  unique  physical  contexts 
for  the  expression  of  a perspective  as  well  as  viewpoints.  How  viewpoints  and  perspective  can 
make  up  space  and  time  and  still  be  imagined  as  existing  in  space  and  time  is  approached  in  a 
constructive  way  and  implies  a focus  on  discontinuity  in  its  most  fundamental  sense.  From  a 
methodological  point  of  view  this  points  towards  the  coupling  and  entanglement  of  states  as 
well  as  to  the  establishment  of  kinetic  wave  functions. 

Processing  begins  with  the  conversion  of  kinetic  energy  into  graphemes  which  are 
generated  and  composed  into  string  sequences.  Based  on  their  production,  interactions  are 
specified  by  the  degree  of  rotation  in  simultaneously  developing  language  spaces.  This  means 
that  a step  on  the  path  of  observation  must  be  involved  in  the  activation  of  a natural 
perspective.  The  possibility  to  establish  the  gait  in  a movement  and  to  trace  movement 
patterns  comes  from  the  observation  that  the  (A)  as  well  as  the  (O)  component  of  the  [AaO] 
formula  is  contributing  to  the  formation  of  bonds.  At  the  nominal  level  of  text  processing,  it 
implies  that  the  underlying  bio-physically  working  machinery  is  establishing  the  correct 
entanglement  of  the  components  and  consequently  permissible  channelling  in  a given  textual 
context.  This  however,  requires  that  textual  movement  patterns  can  be  observed.  To  discover 
the  coordinate  systems  which  develop  on  the  basis  of  the  [AaO]  formula  therefore  is  the 
primary  goal  of  the  study  of  texture.  The  underlying  fundamental  assumption  is  that  the  basis 
in  the  manifestation  of  texture  is  formed  by  their  invariant  structural  relations.  Plainly,  this 
formula  is  responsible  for  self-reference  and  self-organisation. 

Functional  [AaO]  units  provide  the  mechanism  for  processing  their  own  intrinsic  co- 
ordinates in  space  and  time.  The  theoretical  significance  of  the  space-time  concept  (Wheeler, 
1998,  p.  235),  when  applied  to  the  kinematics  of  the  resulting  A-O-configurations,  will  be 
demonstrated  on  the  basis  of  the  “mirror”-strategy,  proposed  by  Greene  (1999,  p.  278). 
Accordingly,  [AaO]  spaces  have  been  split  into  (A)  and  (O)  subspaces.  At  a first  glance,  it 
may  seem  as  if  this  measure  would  destroy  the  strict  dependency,  which  has  governed  the 
coordinative  cooperation  of  the  A’s  and  O’s  on  the  nominal  processing  level.  However,  as 
will  be  shown,  this  is  not  the  case. 

In  a second  step  the  space  of  the  textual  objectives,  belonging  to  the  O-component  has 
been  established  as  well  as  the  space  of  the  textual  agents,  belonging  to  the  A-component. 
Thereby,  it  has  been  possible  to  demonstrate  that  the  open  sphere  of  a text  space  is  controlled 
by  displacement  functions,  which  means  that  these  functions  are  working  in  the  direction  of 
growing  string- vectors.  However,  with  respect  to  the  viscous-elastic  properties  that  determine 
the  magnitude  of  shearing  and  straining  the  strings,  the  functions  control  also  rolling  vectors, 
which  can  be  observed  to  emerge  in  hyperbolic  spaces.  Since  the  separation  of  the  A’s  and 
O’s  has  led  to  a step  where  the  space  of  intention  can  be  separated  from  the  space  of 
orientation,  it  provides  for  a very  radical  test  of  the  proposed  validity  of  the  AaO-axiom. 

Now,  based  on  Figure  1,  the  order  between  the  produced  variables  within  an  interval 
should  be  transferred  to  the  X-axis  and  the  number  of  intervals  to  the  Y-axis.  The  radians  of 
the  alpha  and  beta  strands  should  govern  the  development  on  the  Z-axis.  In  the  mathematical 
sense,  there  is  no  requirement  for  a subjective  choice  of  the  order  parameters.

Figure  1 Articulation  in  the  unfolded  Objective  space 


Based  on  Figure  1,  it  will  be  demonstrated  that  theoretically  significant  angular  articulations 
relate  to  the  way  in  which  their  sequencing  spaces  are  constraining  the  gradient  dynamics  of  a 
component.  The  significance  of  the  order  parameters  is  addressing  the  fact  that  free 
parameters  are  “pointless  in  the  string- approach”  (Greene,  1999,  p.  383).  PES  is  gathering  all 
relevant  string  composites.  Since  intermittent  phase-transitions  are  resulting  from  changes  in 


4 Bernhard  Bierschenk 


the  stability  of  a gradient,  phase-transitions  lead  to  changes  in  acceleration  and  the  identified 
order  parameters,  which  are  fundamental  for  forming  the  shape  of  developing  space. 

The  Unfolded  Objective 

The  unfolded  Objective  allows  a very  important  observation  through  which  the  effects 
of  multi-layered  entanglements  can  be  made  evident.  For  that  reason,  growing  must  be 
equated  with  rotational  differences,  which  are  the  result  of  differences  in  energy,  originally 
invested  into  perfect  [AaO]  units,  and  energy,  fused  into  imperfect  units.  Even  more 
important  is  that  this  kind  of  refraction  through  imperfect  [AaO]  units  allows  for  the 
deformations  to  appear  as  differences  at  the  thermodynamic  level,  which  in  the  produced 
waves  relate  to  various  forms  of  rotational  speed  and  acceleration.  This  implies  that  angular 
articulation  and  attitude  change  provide  the  context  for  the  manifestation  of  Potential  Energy 
Surfaces  (PES). 

With  respect  to  the  phase  drifting  in  the  Objective  of  Figure  1,  rotational  dissociations 
have  occurred  because  the  spins  in  the  composites  have  influenced  the  centrifugal  barriers 
before  the  path  can  level  off  and  advance  towards  the  centre.  The  most  distinctive  features  of 
the  unruffled  surface  appear  at  the  left-hand  side  where  the  texture  develops  into  cups-like 
contours. 

Observable  are  transformations  which  demonstrate  a very  high  degree  of  implicitness. 
On  the  kinetic  level  of  text  production,  it  means  that  increasing  depth  implies  increasing 
indirectness  and  consequently  extension  of  the  distance  in  the  sinking  beta  variables.  Hence, 
the  trajectory  is  dependent  on  a place  of  departure  and  a distance,  influencing  the  tunnelling. 
The  evolution  of  a trajectory  is  dependent  on  the  function  of  slanting  curves  like  the  curve  in 
the  middle  of  the  intervals  which  is  rolling  helically  and  is  producing  the  first  local  minimum. 
However  it  is  not  the  global  minimum.  Nevertheless,  it  is  a pronounced  expression  of 
implicitness. 

As  demonstrated,  accessing  the  scope  of  tunnelling  is  possible  through  the  observed 
phase  transitions.  Thus,  the  first  slight  dip  below  the  zero  level  occurs  in  interval  eight  which 
means  that  the  verb  is  followed  by  a dummy  variable  for  the  textual  objective  ( kan  0).  The 
deepening  part  on  the  textual  surface  is  instantiated  by  the  2D-function  which  means  that  the 
dummy  is  substituted  with  the  following  sequence  of  strings:  [{Ariose  og)+(Oi=vendes  i den 
ene  eller  anden  retning),+(A2=som  forholdene  nu)+{02=krcever  det )].  The  magnitude  of  the 
two  substitutions  is  very  close  to  zero  (*-0.11),  which,  as  shown,  contains  the  value  of  the 
grapheme  strings  of  the  verb  together  with  the  values  of  word  sequence  and  sentence  marker. 

A very  large  increase  in  critical  acceleration  can  be  observed,  as  for  example  the  deep 
in  the  far  left  region.  This  deep  is  pointing  towards  the  global  minimum.  To  reiterate,  a steep 
below  zero  corresponds  operationally  with  lower  rotational  speed,  compared  to  non-negative 
expressions. 

Next  deep  is  marked  with  (*-1.50).  It  is  similarly  formed  by  the  verb  ( udbredte  0 ,), 
which  appears  in  interval  fourteen  and  likewise  is  followed  by  a word  sequence  followed  by  a 
flow  stop  (!).  As  indicated  through  the  lighter  part  of  the  plot  behind  the  last  sentence, 
containing  the  verb  (frigiven ),  the  process  resumes  its  initial  phase  value  (*+4.18).  Relatively 
low  values  imply  some  restricted  moves.  Obviously,  the  variables  of  the  Objective  do  flow 
evenly  which  may  be  said  to  resemble  a calm  approach  path. 

The  twist  in  the  middle  of  the  shape  is  caused  by  some  twinning  and  twisting  rotations. 
The  articulation  has  at  this  location  resulted  in  a rotating  and  swinging  beta  variable.  It  is 
composed  of  both  the  shaded  alpha  variable,  i.e.,  ( Oceanet ),  which  is  channelled  through  the 
compound  ( i0at ) downwards  from  the  first  to  the  second  clause.  The  “D-function  carries  the 
magnitude  (*-3.79)  which  can  be  observed  in  interval  sixteen.  Finally,  interval  seventeen 
shows  the  lowest  value,  namely  (*-6.71).  It  refers  to  the  clause  with  the  verb  ( bevcebnede ), 


Danishness  in  the  Translation  of  the  Suiones  5 

where  the  "D-function  again  is  marked  with  the  pattern  ( i0at ).  Hence,  the  pointer  function  of 
the  preposition  initiates  an  extensive  rotation  of  both  alpha  and  beta  variables,  which  are 
moving  in  upward  direction. 

The  Unfolded  Agent 

The  task  with  the  Agent-space  of  Figure  2 is  to  generate  an  image  of  the  dynamics  of 
the  intention. 

Agent 


Figure  2 Articulation  in  the  unfolded  Agent  space

Characteristic  of  the  textual  flow  in  the  translation,  related  to  the  alpha  variables  of  the  Agent- 
component,  is  a fairly  inertial  movement  which  moreover  is  more  pressed.  The  result  is  a 
space  which  looks  relatively  stacked  or  amassed.  The  reason  for  this  observation  is  a 
recurrence  of  certain  alpha  variables,  which  often  are  duplicating  themselves. 

Further,  the  flow  dynamics  represents  relations  between  mutually  dependent  alpha 
variables.  The  time  relation  in  the  form  of  intervals  is  binding  the  flow  dynamics  to  the 
produced  variables.  This  means  that  the  produced  variables  carry  empirical  values  of 
significance  for  the  formation  of  a hyperbolic  space. 

Hence,  an  exception  is  related  to  the  first  four  variables  in  the  first  interval,  which 
presents  itself  by  a smoothly  pressed  bubble.  Thereafter,  a long  and  explicit  sequence  of 
variables  is  standing  for  a number  of  values  that  stand  in  close  relation  to  each  other.  Thus, 
characteristic  of  the  Agent  is  a fairly  inertial  flow.  The  reason  is  that  the  Agent  often 
duplicates  itself.  In  case  of  several  Objectives  in  a clause  the  Agent  may  be  the  same  for  all 
the  Objectives.  In  the  present  text  the  result  is  an  Agent  graph  that  looks  relatively  motionless. 

An  exception  is  variable  (4)  in  interval  seventeen,  which  presents  itself  by  a smoothly 
pressed  bubble.  A long  explicit  sequence  of  variables  is  standing  for  values  between  (3)  and 
(4).  There  is  a sequence  in  the  middle  of  the  plot,  which  makes  it  a long  stack  of  Agent- 
strings.  Thus,  it  marks  a formation  that  may  be  called  an  advance.  Therefore,  the  sequence  in 
the  middle  of  the  space  makes  up  a long  stack  of  alpha  strings.  Accordingly,  it  marks  a 
formation  that  may  be  called  a progression  ridge. 

However,  when  at  the  textual  level,  a hole  appears  in  the  texture,  it  is  marked  with  a 
dummy.  Then,  the  following  displacement  (D)  function  will  become  active:  D-function:  [0] 
-^Substitution  — >[0A,  o]  — >[0]  -t-Substitution— »[0A+o]  — »[0].  Indexing  with  components  [A] 
and  [O]  means  that  linear  conditions  are  governing  the  layering  of  text  segments.  A single  A- 
or  O-component  implies  that  the  surface-oriented  empirical  relation  is  utilising  a 
perpendicular  path  and  appears  as  single-layered  ('D).  The  compound  (A+O)  is  utilising  a 
collinear  path,  which  implies  that  a twofold-layered  text  segment  (2D)  is  channelled  into  its 
proper  place. 

In  observing  the  recurrence  of  certain  alpha  variables,  a path  can  be  identified  which 
ends  at  a place  in  the  textual  surface  which  has  the  following  string  sequence:  [0A  frigiven 
slave  ...].  Calculation  of  the  involved  rotations  is  resulting  in  the  value  (»-1.56),  which  is  the 
value  of  variable  (6)  in  interval  eighteen,  which  is  to  be  found  in  the  background  of  the  left- 
hand  side.  With  respect  to  phase  drifting  in  Figure  2,  a rotational  pre-dissociation  has 
occurred  because  the  rotations  in  a composite  will  influence  any  centrifugal  barrier  before  the 
path  is  levelling  off  towards  its  destination. 

A most  distinctive  feature  of  the  unruffled  surface  appears  at  the  left-hand  side  where 
the  texture  develops  into  cups-like  contours.  The  textual  surface  requires  a replacement  of  the 
dummy  for  the  A-component:  [0A/d  opsyn  ...].  At  this  place,  the  articulation  has  resulted  in  a 
rotation  with  the  value  (*-3.91).  Thus,  a further  disappearance  of  the  Agent  into  the  ongoing 
conceptualisation  has  deepened  its  mental  shading.  A further  deepening  part  of  the  text  carries 
the  magnitude  (*-3.79)  and  can  be  observed  in  the  interval  sixteen  due  to  (i  0 ,).  At  this 
place,  the  articulation  has  resulted  in  a rotating  and  swinging  objective.  It  is  composed  of  both 
the  shaded  agent  ( Oeceanet ),  which  through  the  dummies  is  channelled  downwards  from  the 
first  to  the  second  clause.  Finally,  interval  seventeen  shows  the  lowest  value,  namely  (*-6.71). 
It  refers  to  the  place  in  the  clause  with  the  verb  ( bevcebnede ),  where  the  preposition  (10) 
initiates  an  extensive  rotation  of  both  agent  and  objectives  in  an  upward  direction.  Moreover, 
in  the  final  interval  (18)  it  can  be  noted,  that  the  value  of  variable  (8)  is  (*-3.06),  denoting  a 
root  that  has  been  extracted  repeated  times  before  manifesting  itself  into  the  articulation  of  the 
final  agent-variable. 


Danishness  in  the  Translation  of  the  Suiones  7 


The  PES  of  the  language  spaces  will  now  be  analysed  further  with  a focus  on  the  free 
energy  surfaces  (FES)  of  the  dimensions  of  Intention  and  Orientation.  In  other  words,  it  will 
be  made  evident  the  way  in  which  information  is  concentrated  and  conceptualized. 

The  Procedure  of  Folding 

The  discussion  of  the  Danish  translation  will  now  proceed  with  the  Orientation 
landscape  formed  in  Figure  3.

Figure  3 Resonance  in  the  folded  dimension  of  Orientation 


Two  mountain  massifs  are  observable  with  a valley  in  the  middle  and  a distinct  hill  at  the 
upper  left-hand  side.  The  process  has  been  carried  upwards  and  reached  the  state  attractor 
Disposition  at  (shear-5,  strain-10)  which  conveys  the  fusion  value  of  (q«221).  It  is  the  highest 
point  on  the  path  and  structurally  an  expression  of  the  predominant  “Geist”,  that  directs  the

entire  configuration.  For  example,  the  distinguishing  characteristics,  picked  up  by  the 
translators,  seem  to  be  a perfectly  factual  property,  despite  its  virtual  appearance.  Thus  the 
Disposition  of  a tribe  directs  the  path  towards  its  fate. 

By  foreseeing  successive  action  of  enforcers  from  in-  and  outside  dominating  actions 
are  expected  to  prevent  multiple  disturbances.  Thus,  the  attractor  formed  at  the  position 
(shear-5,  strain-12)  has  resulted  in  the  terminus  Hegemony.  With  a concentration  value  of 
(q~2 1 8)  a state  attraction  is  formed  which  implies  a process  which  has  generated  an  image  of 
distinct  and  marked  leadership,  which  is  able  to  exert  control  over  people  and  environment 
and  also  to  prevent  anticipated  violations  of  territorial  integrity.  Thus,  the  attractor  determines 
central  values  for  the  control  of  emergencies  due  to  temporary  changes  in  environmental 
conditions  that  may  have  devastating  effects  on  the  tribe. 

The  way  in  which  the  people  perform  in  an  acute  situation  is  transforming  its 
dispositional  properties  into  an  expression  of  Capacity.  The  latter  is  the  most  integrated 
terminus  of  the  configuration  and  appears  at  (shear-5,  strain-2)  with  a fusion  value  of  (q~209). 
As  the  highest  transformative  result,  the  people  are  here  conceived  of  as  being  able  to  acquire 
natural  as  well  as  artificial  means  which  are  growing  out  of  their  ability  to  hold  or  conquer 
land  This  Capacity  enables  them  to  claim  Exclusive  Rights.  This  state  of  attraction  appears  in 
the  position  (shear-5,  strain-15)  and  carries  a value  of  (q«204).  In  order  to  avoid  conflicts 
between  one’s  supremacy  and  others,  it  is  a mighty  expression  and  it  is  dominating  the 
regulation  of  responsibilities.  Taking  on  responsibility  and  accepting  obligations  points  to  the 
fact  that  authority  is  conceived  as  central,  that  is,  as  a major  appeal.  At  the  superficial  as  well 
as  at  the  concrete  level,  it  means  that  a leader  dominates  the  main  course  of  events  and  whose 
actions  are  followed  by  the  people. 

The  other  dominating  state  at  the  position  (shear-5,  strain-22)  appears  with  a value  of 
(q«171)  and  is  termed  Safety  Measures.  The  condition  of  being  protected  against  damage 
suggests  an  understanding  of  impending  dangers.  The  concept  shows  that  the  ability  to 
recognize  and  control  hazards  implies  the  achievement  of  an  acceptable  level  of  risk.  This 
appears  to  take  on  forms  of  protection  against  the  loss  of  people  or  possessions. 

Watchfulness  is  the  depicted  state  at  the  location  (shear-6,  strain-26).  It  carries  the 
fusion  value  of  (q~l  57)  and  prompts  the  meeting  of  danger.  From  an  environmental  point  of 
view,  this  sense  making  function  draws  attention  to  a conscious  integration-disintegration  of 
experiences.  For  being  able  to  embody  available  information  into  one’s  synthesis,  a person 
must  have  the  capacity  to  carry  the  essence  of  life,  and  thus  needs  to  be  concentrated  on  the 
activation  of  a required  re-action.  Nevertheless  despite  a centralized  power  and  a tight  control 
of  people,  still  small  crowds  may  manage  to  carry  out  raids  as  their  way  of  life. 

Together  with  the  term  Prevention  at  the  location  (shear-6,  strain-27)  and  a fusion 
value  of  (q~  1 48),  this  circumstance  is  capturing  perceived  environmental  qualities  as  for 
example  hindrance  of  adventures,  launched  by  neighbours  or  enemies.  This  is  a profound 
coordinative  ability  which  provides  information  for  prospective  processing. 

Intention 

Folding  the  dimension  of  Intention  builds  on  the  functions  of  spacing  and  timing 
through  the  Agent  component.  Concurrently,  the  designated  mountain  peaks  communicate 
distinctive  conceptual  relations  which  reflect  the  resonance  in  the  motif  structure  of  the 
configuration.  From  the  concentration  of  this  kind  of  information  follows  a remarkably 
precise  identification  of  the  ‘intention’  contained  in  the  translation. 

Pure  translation  must  have  its  anchorage  in  a translator’s  individuality.  As  a product  of 
changing  attitudes,  it  can  be  expected  that  the  functional  relation  between  a position  formed 
and  the  meaning-generating  context  give  rise  to  realizations  that  differ  in  relation  to  the 
resonance  in  the  folded  Intention  space,  shown  in  Figure  4.

Intention 


Figure  4 Resonance  in  the  folded  dimension  of  Intention 


With  a conceptual  perspective,  advances  in  the  growth  of  knowledge  means  Capacity  which 
appears  as  peak  descriptor  in  the  position  (shear-5,  strain-3)  and  a fusion  value  of  (qxT79).  It 
implies  supreme  leadership.  Moreover,  acceptability  and  the  subjective  value  of  strong 
leadership  provide  benefits.  Hence  a high  degree  of  processing  is  associated  with  the  attractor 
which  bends  towards  a leader’s  right  to  determine  residence  and  assisting  protection.  The 
most  immediate  description  relates  to  the  intrinsic  merit  of  exercising  efficient  control.  Thus, 


10  Bernhard  Bierschenk 


Custody  at  the  location  (shear-5,  strain-5)  has  a likewise  high  fusion  value,  namely  (q«177) 
which  transforms  charging  into  highhandedness  and  flexibility  in  guarding. 

Even  though  the  Suiones  are  conceived  of  as  the  most  skilled  people,  their  capability 
is  pronounced  through  the  attractor  Alertness  which  appears  in  the  position  (shear-4,  strain-3) 
with  a fusion  value  (q~l  68).  At  another  level  of  processing,  this  means  that  cues  have  been 
picked  up  which  concern  the  possible  effect  of  violent  acts  by  individual  trouble  makers. 

The  next  attractor  is  an  essential  step  towards  the  transformation  of  scepticism  into 
Suspiciousness  at  (shear-5,  strain- 11)  with  a fusion  value  (q«l  57).  The  attractor  refers  to 
everything  that  disconcerts  and  instils  tribal  anxiety.  Hence,  this  attractor  may  lead  one’s 
thoughts  towards  a play  by  Shakespeare  that  ‘something  is  rotten  in  the  state  of  Denmark’  as 
an  expression  used  to  describe  an  undisclosed  fact  or  ulterior  motive  which  cannot  be 
pinpointed  because  of  its  doubtful  nature. 

The  Concern  at  (shear-5,  strain- 15)  and  a fusion  value  (q~146)  in  this  context  is  with 
some  individual’s  behaviour  that  might  relate  to  special  interest  groups  which  maybe  afflict 
the  tribe.  Hence,  the  fusion  value  (q«135)  of  Watchfulness  at  (shear-5,  strain-19)  should  be 
seen  as  a function  of  proscriptive  cautionary  measures  for  protecting  exclusive  rights. 
Whether  these  measures  are  effective  depends  on  one’s  attentiveness  and  readiness  to  act  as 
well  as  on  one’s  maturity  to  remain  prepared  at  all  times.  Longitudinal  preparedness  appears 
to  be  connected  with  trusting  the  N on-Privileged  at  the  location  (shear-6,  strain-23)  and  a 
value  of  (q«l  22).  In  particular,  they  have  the  advantage  to  be  trusted  because  they  do  not  have 
the  wealth  and  power  that  the  privileged  elite  possess. 

Discussion 

In  the  realized  landscapes,  the  distinctness  of  a derived  concept  follows  from  the 
direction  of  influence  on  the  path  of  climbing  towards  its  highest  peak,  namely  the  common 
disposition  of  Germanic  societies.  The  roots  of  the  Danish  identity  reach  deeply  into  peasant 
culture.  Disposition  here  links  to  a centrally  controlled  state  as  the  most  basic  characteristic  of 
a highly  efficient  state.  In  focus  is  a sensed  ability  to  enforce  law.  Moreover,  one  should  be 
aware  of  the  Danish  hegemony  which  refers  to  the  exclusive  rights  of  the  king  and  his 
capacity  to  instill  laws.  Both  capacity  and  hegemony  refer  to  the  exclusive  kingly  rights. 
These  are  safety  measures  and  were  oriented  towards  signs  of  danger  or  possible  calamities. 
Hence,  the  state  of  being  constantly  attentive  and  responsive  is  not  only  a sign  of 
watchfulness  but  it  is  also  a reflection  of  attentiveness  towards  particular  threats.  A capacity 
to  prevent  violent  acts  is  given  serious  attention  and  was  formed  through  the  historic 
trajectory  and  the  relation  between  state  and  monarchy. 

Through  reconfiguration  an  important  change  in  focus  can  be  observed  through  the 
differentiation  of  the  states  of  intention.  This  may  be  seen  as  an  indication  of  sensitivity 
towards  the  articulation  of  concern.  Attention  is  directed  towards  the  necessity  of  custody  in 
order  to  guard  for  subsistence.  Sufficiently  subsumed,  it  implies  that  the  character  of  the 
translator’s  synthesis  becomes  embodied  conceptually  in  alertness  vis-a-vis  others.  The 
characteristic  properties  used  are  designating  a process  that  transfers  the  co-operation  between 
egalitarian  attitudes  and  cultural  inheritance.  These  two  dimensions  are  carried  over  by 
language.  The  cultural  dimension  of  the  results  refers  to  the  embodied  degree  of  Danishness, 
whereas  the  ability  to  translate  refers  to  a persistent  and  order  creating  activity  which  comes 
about  through  refined  and  well-educated  behaviour.  In  this  sense,  mirroring  Danishness 
through  the  translator’s  text  building  behaviour  clearly  is  a matter  of  intention  which  may 
develop  through  perspectivation  and  brought  about  simultaneously  with  the  process  of  timing. 
Thus  the  configuration  is  determining  the  condition  of  alertness  as  well  as  unrestricted 
compliance  to  the  development  of  capacities.
