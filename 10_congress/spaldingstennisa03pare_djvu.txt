America's  National  Game 
By  A.  G.  SPALDING 

Price,  $2.00  Net 

A  book  of  600  pages,  profusely  illustrate<i 
with  over  100  full  page  engravings,  and  hav- 
ing sixteen  forceful  cartoons  by  Homer  C. 
Davenport,  the  famous  American  artist. 

No  man  in  America  is  better  equipped 
\o  write  on  all  the  varied  phases  of  the  Na- 
tional Game  than  is  A.  G.  Spalding.  His 
observation  and  experience  began  when  the 
game  was  young.  He  gained  fame  as  a 
pitcher  forty  years  ago,  winning  a  record  as 
player  that  has  never  yet  been  equalled. 
He  was  associated  with  the  management  of 
the  pastime  through  trying  years  of  struggle 
against  prevailing  evils.  He  opposed  the 
gamblers;  he  fought  to  eradicate 
drunkenness  ;  he  urged  and  intro- 
duced new  and  higher  ideals  for 
the  sport ;  he  was  quick  to  see  that 
ball  playbg  and  the  business  man- 
agement of  clubs,  at  the  same  time 
and  by  the  same  men,  were  imprac- 
ticable ;  he  knew  that  ball  players 
might  be  quite  competent  as  magnates,  but  not  while  playing 
the  game ;  he  was  in  the  forefront  of  the  fight  against  syndi- 
cating Base  Ball  and  making  of  a  Nation's  pastime  a  sordid 
Trust;  he  was  the  pioneer  to  lead  competing  American 
Base  Ball  teams  to  a  foreign  land  ;  he  took  two  champion 
teams  to  Great  Britain  in  I  874,  and  two  others  on  a  tour  of 
the  world  in  1  888-9 ;  he  was  present  at  the  birth  of  the 
National  League,  and  has  done  as  much  as  any  living 
American  to  uphold  and  prolong  the  life  of  this  great  pioneer 
Base  Ball  organization. 

When  A.  G.  Spalding   talks  about  America's  National 
Game  he  speaks  by  authority  of  that  he  does  know,  because 


he  has  been  in  the  councils  of  the  management  whenever 
there  have  been  times  of  strenuous  endeavor  to  purge  it 
from  abuses  and  keep  it  clean  for  the  people  of  America 
— young  and  old 

In  this  work  Mr.  Spalding,  after  explaining  the  causes 
that  led  him  into  the  undertaking,  begins  with  the  inception 
of  the  sport ;  shows  how  it  developed,  by  natural  stages 
from  a  boy  with  a  ball  to  eighteen  men,  ball,  bats  and  bases ; 
gives  credit  for  the  first  scientific  application  of  system  to 
the  playing  of  the  game  to  Abner  Doubleday,  of  Coopers- 
town,  N.  Y.:  treats  of  the  first  Base  Ball  club  ;  shows  how 
rowdyism  terrorized  the  sport  in  its  early  days ;  how  gam- 
bling and  drunkenness  brought  the  pastime  into  disfavor 
with  the  masses,  and  how  early  organizations  were  unable 
to  control  the  evils  that  insidiously  crept  in.  He  then 
draws  a  series  of  very  forceful  pictures  of  the  struggle  to 
eradicate  gambling,  drunkenness  and  kindred  evils,  and  shows 
how  the  efforts  of  strcmg  men  accomplished  the  salvation  of 
the  great  American  game  and  placed  it  in  the  position  it  occu- 
pies to-day — the  most  popular  outdoor  pastime  in  the  world. 

Interspersed  throughout  this  interesting  book  are  remin- 
iscences of  Mr.  Spalding's  own  personal  observations  and 
experiences  in  the  game  as  player,  manager  and  magnate, 
covering  a  period  of  many  years.  Some  of  these  stories 
deal  with  events  of  great  import  to  Base  Ball,  and  others 
have  to  do  with  personal  acts  and  characteristics  of  players 
prominent  in  the  game  in  earlier  days — old  time  favorites 
like  Harry  and  George  Wright,  A.  C.  Anson,  Mike  Kelly, 
Billy  Sunday  and  others. 

This  book  should  be  in  the  library  of  every  father  in 
the  land,  for  it  shows  how  his  boy  may  be  built  up  physically 
and  morally  through  a  high-class  pastime.  It  should  be  in 
the  hands  of  every  lad  in  America,  for  it  demonstrates  the 
possibilities  to  American  youth  of  rising  to  heights  of  eminent 
material  success  through  a  determined  adherence  to  things 
that  make  for  the  upbuilding  of  character  in  organizations  as 
well  as  of  men.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


American   Championship 

As  has  been  the  case  for  many  years  in  the  National  Championship  event, 
the  dominant,  overpowering  ability  of  Champion  William  A.  Larned  was 
again  the  principal  factor  of  the  day,  and  for  the  seventh  time  America's 
premier  honors  fell  into  his  accustomed  grasp.  What  with  all  the  gossip 
of  the  unexcelled  condition  of  some  of  the  veterans  and  ex-champions  and 
the  marvellous  leaps  of  improvement  shown  by  the  younger  element  of 
"comers,"  there  were  those  who  hinted  expressions  of  forebodings  and 
regrets  for  what  might  happen  to  the  redoubtable  "Bill,"  but  it  was  not  to 
be.  It  was  again  the  teacher  with  his  pupils,  clay  in  the  hands  of  the 
potter,  and  to  McLoughlin  fell  the  role  of  pupil  for  the  demonstration.  It 
was  the  reac^-haired  youth  from  California  who  earned  an  unquestionable 
right,  by  virtue  of  of  genuine  superiority,  to  try  to  wrest  from  Larned  the 
laurels  so  lom*  and  ably  worn.  And  it  was  he  who  suffered  a  defeat  for 
the  audacious  boldness  of  his  play,  which  proved  beyond  a  doubt  that 
Larned  stands  \i  America  without  an  equal.  The  challenge  match  was  one- 
sided, uneven,  more  so  than  many  of  the  matches  which  McLoughlin  won 
on  his  way  up  the  ladder  from  several  able  opponents.  On  the  whole  the 
tournament,  which  began  August  21,  resulted  very  much  as  had  been 
expected,  with  the  possible  exception  of  the  doubles  championship,  in  which 
final  match  Hackett  and  Alexander,  four  times  national  title-holders,  yielded 
before  the  attack  of  their  challengers,  Little  and  Touchard,  after  a  fast, 
«;ven  battle  lasting  through  four  sets. 

Each  season  for  several  years  past  has  established  a  record  for  the  num- 
ber of  entrants,  and  191 1  proved  no  exception.  Two  hundred  and  two 
enrolled  against  one  hundred  and  eighty  the  year  before.  There  was,  as 
usual,  a  large  number  of  defaults,  but  not  so  many  as  on  several  past  occa- 
sions. Four  days  of  rain  toward  the  close  of  the  tournament  hindered  and 
delayc^  matches  greatly,  and  it  was  not  until  two  weeks  had  elapsed  that 
the  event  came  to  an  end. 

The  draw  was  unusually  well  divided,  and  in  each  eight  there  was  at 
least  o»ie  competitor  belonging  m  the  first  class. 

McLoughlin's  triumphal  march  was  the  result  of  a  brand  of  tennis  of 
which  there  must  be  but  little  criticism  and  unbounded  praise.  Never 
before  had  he  displayed  such  consistency  or  sustained  excellence  of  play. 
Not  once  was  he  in  danger  and,  until  he  encountered  B.  C.  Wright  in  the 
final,  he  did  not  lose  a  set. 

In  spite  of  the  number  of  matches  the  tournament  was  run  off  in  splen- 
did shape,  characterized  by  a  businesslike  precision,  and  with  really  no 
unnecessary  delays.  The  inclement  weather  at  its  wind-up  was  the  only 
feature  to  mar  proceedings  and  the  improvement  was  remarked  on  all  sides. 

Only  two  matches  worthy  of  attention  resulted  from  meetings  in  the 
preliminary  round.  One,  the  base  line  exchanges  between  K.  H.  Behr  and 
the  veteran-  R.  Stevens,  was  interesting  and  a  really  excellent  example  of 
that  passe  style  of  play.  Behr  had  the  better  of  it  and  won  in  four  fairly 
even  sets.  The  other  match  was  the  fight  between  T.  C.  Bundy  and  F.  C. 
Inman.  The  New  Yorker  started  like  a  race  horse,  but  soon  played  him- 
self out,  after  which  Bundy's  relentless,  even  attacks  dominated  the  situa- 
tion completely. 

The  first   round  was  much  more  interesting.     E.   P.    Larned,  quite   unex 

fectedly,  met  his  Waterloo  in  the  person  of  A.  S.   Dabney.    The  champion's 
rother    had    one     of    his    too    numerous    streaky    days,    and     after    barely 
holding  his  own  for  a  time,   went  to   pieces  badly  in  the  fifth   set. 

W.  M.  Washburn  outplayed  A.  S.  Cragin  easily,  winning  in  straight  sets, 
and  Karl  Behr  made  short  work  of  R.  P.   Schwengers.     The  big  Victorian 


6  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

was  a  decided  disappointment,  for  although  unable' to  round  into  shape  in 
earlier  events,  better  results  were  excepted  of  him  when  he  reached 
Newport. 

Nothing  startling  occurred  in  the  next  round.  F.  H.  Gates,  Yale's  ablest 
player,  caught  Touchard  when  the  latter  was  having  a  hard  time  with  him- 
self and  made  it  exciting  enough  for  a  time  by  leading  at  two  sets  to  one. 
E.  H.  Whitney  lacked  speed  to  such  an  extent  that  Dean  Mathey  did  as 
he  chose  with  his  returns,  winning  at  2/6,  8/6,  7/5,  7/5.  Whitney's  game 
was  the  better  that  day  in  every  respect,  save  space,  of  which  his  Princeton 
adversary  had  aplenty. 

It  was  the  fourth  round  that  marked  the  beginning  of  many  good 
matches.  Hall  and  Behr  clashed,  but  the  old  Yale  leader  had  too  much 
pace  and  energy  for  Hall,  and  after  dividing  the  first  two  sets  ran  out  the 
third  and  fourth  with  no  trouble  at  all.  Craig  Eiddle  was  in  erratic  mood. 
Although  steady,  the  conservative  efforts  of  J.  D.  S.  Jones  were  too  much 
to  successfully  combat.  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  got  out  of  a  deep  hole  into  which 
the  accurate  shots  of  W.  _F.  Johnson  had  put  him,  and  after  being  within 
a  point  of  defeat  rallied  nicely.  The  fifth  set  was  a  walkover.  Bull  improv- 
ing steadily  and  cutting  off  his  opponent's  slices  with  excellent  volleying. 

In  the  fifth  round  J.  O.  Ames  came  within  an  ace  of  eliminating  the 
veteran  R.  H.  Palmer.  Palmer  was  wild  as  a  hawk  until  within  a  point  or 
two  of  defeat,  when  he  suddenly  got  his  famous  left  arm  going.  There- 
after, Ames  stopped  a  few  and  took  what  came  his  way  in  the  shape  of 
his  rival's  errors,  but  the  result  could  be  but  one  way,  the  deciding  set 
going  to  Palmer  at  6/2.  A  match,  which  many  who  saw  the  tournament 
through  declared  to  have  been  the  best  of  the  week,  was  one  between 
those  old  rivals,  Behr  and  Little.  From  every  standpoint  it  stood  out 
prominently.  The  tennis  played  was  excellent,  and  until  the  last  ball 
crossed  the  net  the  result  hung  in  the  balance.  Weather,  court  conditions 
and  the  forrn  of  the  men  might  have  been  accepted  as  a  forerunner  of 
what  was  to  happen.  Both  were  at  their  best,  and  that  fact  of  itself  tells 
the  story. 

Little  started  off  with  a  rush  that  left  Behr  far  behind.  His  driving  was 
perfect  and  he  passed  Behr,  who  ran  in  on  everything  with  astonishing 
ease;  6/0  was  the  score  at  the  end  of  sixteen  minutes*  play.  The  second 
set  was  better.  Behr  improved  with  every  stroke  and  eighteen  games  were 
necessary  before  Little  annexed  it.  Still  playing  faultlessly.  Little  got  to 
5/3  and  40/15.  With  his  defeat  an  apparent  certainty,  Behr  raced  in  and 
by  several  beautiful  volleys  of  fast  drives  pulled  up  to  five-all.  Thereafter 
Little  was  within  a  point  of  winning  the  set  three  times,  but  eventually 
Behr  took  it  at  8/6.  Encouraged  by  his  recovery,  Behr  started  at  an  even 
faster  clip,  and  the  honors  of  the  fourth  set  were  his,  six  games  to  one. 
The  fifth  was  a  fight  from  beginning  to  end.  At  4/3  Little  won  a  game 
and  took  the  ninth  after  Behr  had  got  to  40/15.  The  tenth  was  over 
quickly.  Little  drove  by  his  opponent  three  times  for  aces  and  a  net  ended 
the  match. 

A.  S.  Dabney  failed  to  give  McLoughlin  much  of  a  fight.  His  usually 
clever  ground  strokes  were  hopelessly  disabled  by  the  Californian's  light- 
ning service,  and  at  other  angles  of  the  game  he  was  outclassed.  The 
second  best  match  of  the  round  was  the  battle  on  the  championship  court 
between  Niles  and  Long.  Niles  was  at  the  very  top  of  his  game,  but  the 
same  cannot  be  said  for  Long.  He  lacked  fire  and  dash  and  apparently 
was  without  the  usual  fighting  spirit  he  generally  has.  He  was  quite  list- 
less, and  when  it  became  obvious  to  Niles  that  his  rival  was  going  to  play 
back,  not  at  the  net,  he  did  likewise  and  defeated  him  by  a  good  margin. 
Long  got  the  third  set  by  coming  in,  but  in  the  fourth  he  gave  up  the 
net  and  was  badly  defeated  in  a  rather  tame  exchange  of  ground  strokes. 

The  biggest  surprise  of  the  tournament  came  in  the  next  round.  Rain 
the  night  before  had  rendered  some  of  the  courts  almost  unplayable  and 
all    so   muddy   and   soft   that   a   fast   game  was   out   of   the   question.     The 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  7 

round  brought  together  W.  M.  Washburn,  the  sixteen-year-old  New  York 
schoolboy,  and  Little,  and  it  was  a  foregone  conclusion  that  Washburn 
would  have  all  the  pleasures  of  an  ordinary  spectator  from  that  time   on. 

Little  started  well  and  for  five  games  his  youthful  rival  did  little  more 
than  score  an  occasional  point,  but  at  5/0  a  change  came  over  him  and  he 
scored  game  after  game  till  he  had  pulled  up  level.  Even  then  Little  did 
not  apparently  realize  his  danger,  and  at  seven-all  Washburn  broke  through 
for  the  set.  That  evidently  caused  his  rival  to  consider  more  thoughtfully 
the  possibilities  of  what  might  happen  and  for  two  sets  Little  had  a  decided 
advantage.  He  again  eased  off,  however,  and  Washburn  took  an  early 
lead  which  he  maintained  till  the  score  stood  at   two  sets-all. 

Determined  to  end  it  now.  Little  got  off  quickly  and  soon  had  the  score 
at  3/1  in  his  favor,  but  at  that  point  Washburn  began  a  streak  of  fast,  low 
driving  against  which  his  opponent's  frantic  efforts  went  for  naught.  Five 
straight  games  reeled  off  gave  him  the  set  and  match,  and  a  notch  on  his 
racket  for  his  first  big  scalp. 

It  is  true  that  Little  was  handicapped  by  the  low  bounding  balls  and 
slippery  court  surface  and  that  the  same  conditions  suited  Washburn  per- 
fectly, but  his  careless  beginning  lost  him  the  match,  and  he  had  only 
himself  to  blame.  Washburn  is  by  far  the  most  promising  young  star  the 
East  has  developed  for  many  seasons  and  much  may  be  expected  of  him 
in  the  future.  An  ideal  temperament,  height,  strength  and  natural  ability 
are  all   his,  and  the  remaining  necessity,  experience,   is  bound   to   come. 

Floundering  about  on  the  adjoining  court,  T.  C.  Bundy  was  having  no 
end  of  trouble  with  another  future  star,  G.  M.  Church.  By  better  net  play 
the  Californian  got  off  with  the  first  set,  8/6,  but  Church  had  it  all  his 
own  way  in  the  second,  winning  at  6/3.  The  third  set  was  nip  and  tuck 
up  to  six-all,  when  Church,  by  really  splendid  smashing  and,  under  the 
circumstances,  par  driving,  took  the  necessary  two  games  to  win.  Bundy 
came  back  strong  in  the  fourth,  losing  but  one  of  the  seven  games  played, 
but  Church  was  not  yet  through,  and  at  four-all  broke  through  Bundy's 
delivery.  Here  was  the  young  star's  chance,  but  he  let  it  pass.  Four 
times  he  had  to  resort  to  a  second  service  and  four  times  he  was  passed 
clean  as  he  foolishly  tried  to  run  in.  Bundy  was  quick  to  press  his  advan- 
tage,  and   the   match   ended  with  the   two  games  that   followed, 

C.  R.  Gardner  passed  Gross  for  the  round  ahead  and  R.  H.  Palmer  was 
outclassed  by  Touchard.  McLoughlin  eliminated  G.  P.  Gardner.  The 
other  winners  were  Wright,  Niles  and  Jones,  none  of  whom  were  hard 
pressed.  . 

In  the  top  half  Touchard  earned  a  semi-final  bracket  by  defeating  C.  R. 
Gardner  in  four  tame  sets.  The  loser  played  half-heartedly,  and  thou.c;h 
he  won  the  third  set  was  never  a  serious  contender.  Against  McLoughlin 
Washburn  was  helpless.  Standing  way  behind  the  base  line  to  receive  the 
Westerner's  service,  he  found  the  latter  at  the  net  waiting  for  his  returns, 
which  were  promptly  accepted  and  a  point  v.-as  a  result.  Without  a  chance 
of  breaking  through,  and  having  dropped  his  own  service  several  times, 
the  youngster  seemed  to  realize  the  uselessness  of  his  attempts,  and  before 
the  match  was  half  over  began  a  listless  finish,  which  indicated  plainly  his 
belief   that  defeat   was   inevitable. 

In  the  lower  section,  Bundy  made  short  work  of  Jones,  but  Wright  had 
as  narrow  as  any  of  the  innumerable  escapes  he  has  had  in  his  long  career. 
The  man  who  deferred  a  defeat  for  the  Bostonian  was  Niles,  and  to  two 
bad  blunders  alone  can  he  attribute  his  failure  to  convert  it  into  a  victory. 
For  two  sets  Niles  had  all  the  better  of  it;  then  Wright  forged  to  the 
front.  The  fourth  was  the  turning  point.  Wright  got  to  3/0,  4/1  and  5/3, 
but  Niles  put  on  steam  and  soon  made  it  five-all.  A  little  later  it  was  y/S 
and  40/30  for  Niles.  but  a  wretched  smash  of  a  short  lob  made  it  deuce. 
An  identical  opportunity  came  two  points  later  and  Niles  repeated  his 
former  mistake  in  precisely  the  same  manner.  It  was  the  best  chance  he 
had,   for  thereafter  Wright   led  all   the   way.     The  fifth  set  was   much  like 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  9 

the  fourth.  At  4/1  Wright  began  to  make  errors  and  almost  before  he 
realized  it  the  score  was  five-all.  Niles  was  all  in,  however,  and  was  not 
really   dangerous  from   then   on. 

It  was  not  until  three  days  later  that  the  rain,  which  had  started  almost 
immediately  after  the  Wright-Niles  contest,  let  up  sufficiently  to  permit  a 
continuance  of  play.  Then  it  was  decided  to  play  the  McLoughlin-Touchard 
match  on  the  championship  court.  The  ground  was  wet  and  heavy  and 
the  bound  low  and  slow.  The  balls  got  heavy  and  rackets  broke,  but  time 
was  pressing,  and  it  was  decided  to  go  on.  From  the  first  game  on  the 
positions  of  the  men  remained  unchanged.  Touchard  served  and  lost  it, 
and  McLoughlin  went  into  the  lead  to  stay.  It  was  not  a  good  match 
from  any  standpoint.  Touchard  never  once  showed  evidences  of  coming 
round,  and  McLoughlin  had  but  little  more  to  do  than  get  the  ball  back 
and  keep  doing  it.  Once  or  twice  there  was  a  rally,  which,  by  comparison, 
seemed  quite  exciting,  but  it  was  the  Westerner  who  dominated  the  situa- 
tion  from   beginning  to   end. 

Meanwhile  the  Wright-Bundy  contest  was  going  on  in  what  was  literally 
a  sea  of  mud.  The  Californian  had  objected  to  playing  under  so  unfavor- 
able conditions,  but  he  was  overruled  and  quite  unwillingly  decided  to 
make  the  best  of  it.  From  the  first  ball  he  returned  it  was  apparent  that 
the  doughty  little  warrior  was  going  to  have  his  troubles.  Tr»y  as  he 
•would,  he  could  do  nothing  with  the  heavy  spheres.  Wright,  seeing  this, 
decided  on  a  play  of  action  which  was  simply  to  get  the  ball  back  and  let 
Bundy  err.  This  he  did  to  such  good  effect  that  in  an  incredibly  short 
time  the  match  had  ended  in  his  favor  at  6/4,  6/3,  6/1.  Bundy,  who  was 
up  against  it,  realized  that  fact,  and  after  trying  vainly  and  gamely  to  get 
control  of  his  shots,  gave  it  up  as  a  bad  job.  The  day  had  afforded  any- 
thing but  satisfaction  to  players  and  spectators  alike,  but  the  worse  was  yet 
to  come,  for  the  rain  came  down  in  torrents  and  it  was  not  until  Saturday, 
three  days  later,  that  Wright  and  McLoughlin  took  the  court,  preparatory 
to    finding    which    was   to    try    his    luck    against   Champion    Larned. 

The  day  was  ideal,  but  the  same  could  not  be  said  for  the  condition  of 
the  court.  It  was  slow  and  slippery,  a  condition  supposed  to  be  to 
Wright's  advantage  and  harmful  to  the  heavy-hitting  methods  of  the 
Westerner. 

The  match  began  with  slow,  nervous  returns  by  both  men,  but  McLough- 
lin, after  a  few  tentative  wallops,  decided  that  speed  was  his  forte,  and 
thereupon  began  an  attack  which  was  too  severe  for  Wright  to  withstand. 
Only  in  the  second  set,  when  he  attempted  to  put  his  strategy  against  the 
Bostonian's,  was  there  a  time  when  his  superiority  seemed  in  danger.  It 
was  not  his  cue  to  make  the  battle  one  of  wits,  but  it  took  him  a  set  to 
find  it  out.  The  third  set  was  close,  but  the  Californian  had  the  neces- 
sary reserve  for  the  pinches.  The  fourth  set  was  one-sided,  Wright  being 
obviously  fatigued,  while  McLoughlin  played  faster  than  at  any  previous 
time. 

Although  McLoughlin  made  many  errors,  due  to  the  reckless  daring  of 
and  those  accredited  Wright.  In_  the  four  sets  he  earned  68  points  to 
his  play,  there  is  a  surprising  discrepancy  between  the  aces  he  earned 
Wright's  total  of  29.  Even  the  second  set,  which  Wright  won,  showed 
McLoughlin  to  have  earned  five  more  points  than  the  Easterner.  Of 
course  the  error  table  is  one-sided,  but  not  nearly  so  much  so  as  the 
comparison  of  earned  tallies.  An  odd  feature  of  the  match  was  that 
while  Wright  played  through  without  changing  his  racket,  McLoughlin 
broke  the  gut  of  five.  The  incident  gives  a  fair  idea  of  the  relative 
amount    of    striking    force    used    by   both    men. 

An  enormous  crowd  had  gathered  around  the  court  when  McLoughlin 
and  Larned  appeared  for  the  challenge  match.  It  was  a  perfect  day,  a 
trifle  warm,  perhaps,  but  clear  and  dry.  After  a  shout  of  welcome  had 
subsided  and  a  rather  brief  warm-up  ended,  McLoughlin  toed  the  back- 
line  and  the  fight  was  on. 


10  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  opening  game  was  close,  but  the  Californian  pulled  it  out  after  X. 
bad  start  i-love.  Larned  evened  matters  in  the  second,  for  his  opponent 
drove  into  the  net  and  out  and  failed  to  score  a  point.  The  third  and 
fourth  games  were  like  their  predecessors  and  Larned  scored  his  second 
love  game.  At  three-all  the  champion  got  three  perfect  passes  and  Ijroke 
McLoughlin's  delivery.  He  made  it  5/3,  lost  the  game,  and  took  the  set 
with  the  tenth.  So  far  Larned's  play  had  been  faultless.  He  handled 
McLoughlin's  service  easily  and  had  no  difficulty  winning  his  own.  His 
young  rival,  however,  was  having  no  end  of  trouble  with  his  ground 
strokes,  and  though  sound  on  all  other  shots,  could  not  control  his  service 
returns. 

McLoughlin  scored  four  straight  points  for  the  opening  game  of  the 
second  set,  but  his  advantage  had  a  boomerang  effect,  for  it  served  to 
stir  Larned  to  greater  efforts.  He  won  his  own  service  and  achieved  the 
remarkable  performance  of  winning  McLoughlin's  to  love.  At  4/2  Larned 
almost  succeeded  in  repeating,  but  the  youngster  staved  it  off  with  some 
great  volleying.  At  5/4  Larned  again  won  his  service  with  but  one  lost 
point,    and    the    second    set   was   over. 

The  third  saw  the  champion  quite  at  his  best.  After  allowing  the  open- 
ing game  to  get  away  from  him,  he  reeled  oft'  five  straight.  McLoughlia 
fought  hard,  but  to  no  avail.  At  1/5  he  sent  over  some  services  witk 
unbelievable  pace,  but  it  was  a  final  flash,  for,  aided  by  two  beautiful 
volleys,    Larned   took   the   seventh  and   last   game   at   love. 

Throughout  the  match  a  great  difference  was  in  evidence  between  the 
men.  Larned  was  without  a  weakness,  no  vulnerable  point  existed,  yet 
no  one  play  stood  out  superior  to  others,  so  evenly  rounded  was  his  game 
as  a  whole.  In  the  case  of  McLoughlin,  there  was  one  great  defect,  and 
that  was  a  complete  loss  of  control  at  times  on  strokes  made  off  the 
ground.  Barring  that  fatal  weakness,  his  game  was  quite  up  to  the 
standard  of   his  master  opponent.

The  Doubles  Championship 

One  of  the  most  surprising  incidents  of  the  tennis' season  occurred  when 
the  heretofore  invincible  doubles  champions,  F.  B.  Alexander  and  H  H 
Hackett,  were  defeated  by  a  new  combination,  R.  D.  Little  and  G  F* 
louchard,  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  doubles  championship. 

u-  u  °t"^'^  ^^^  ^^"^'^  holders  had  not  displayed  in  earlier  events  the  form 
which  had  won  them  the  championship,  it  was  rather  generally  supposed 
that  Newport  would  find  them  on  edge  and  fit  to  play  as  well  as  ever 
before.  Even  though  Touchard  and  Little  had  made  a  clean  sweep  of 
every  event  in  which  they  had  entered,  they  were  thought  to  be  an  inferior 
combination,  consequently  their  victory  came  in  the  nature  of  a  country- 
wide surprise. 

In  the  presence  of  an  enthusiastic  gathering  the  match  was  played  Tues- 

T^'u     'i^"^^  ^^'   ""'^^'"   conditions  that   were   ideal   in   every   respect. 

Ihe  first  set  was  excitingly  close  up  to  five-all,  at  which  point  Alexan- 
ders delivery  was  broken  through  and  Touchard  won  his  after  a  deuce 
game.  It  was  fast,  hard  tennis,  with  all  four  men  playing  at  top  speed. 
Little  was,  if  anything,  a  bit  the  best  of  the  four,  with  Hackett  a  close 
second. 

The  second  set  was  memorable  for  its  length  and  for  the  fact  that  each 
team  had  it  Within  a  point  repeatedly  before  the  champions  finally  won  it 
iNo   less   than   twenty-eight   games    were   required.      Once   Alexander   slipped 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  15 

as  he  was  about  to  make  the  finishing  play  and  the  opportunity  afforded 
seemed  forever  lost,  when  a  little  later  the  score  had  veered  12/13  and 
30/40  against  them.  Little,  however,  m  his  anxiety  to  end  it,  stepped  too 
far  out  of  his  own  territory,  and  he  and  Touchard  came  together  with  a 
thud,  marring  each  other's   chance  of  making  a  sure  kill. 

The  third  set  was  one-sided.  Hackett  was  obviously  tiring  and  he 
promptly  become  the  target  for  practically  all  of  the  opposition's  shots. 
Alexander's  frantic  attempts  to  come  to  his  assistance  proved  quite  futile. 
His  efforts  only  served  to  prolong  the  set  toward  its  finish,  and,  with  Little 
serving,  the  challengers  ran  it  out  at  6/2. 

The  fourth  set  was  an  odd  one.  Playing  faster,  steadier  tennis,  Hackett

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Preliminary  Davis  Matches 

Strange  things  happen  in  the  game  of  lawn  tennis,  but  to  the  average 
American  mind  the  happening  which  had  its  beginning  at  the  West  Side 
Tennis  Club,  September  9,  was  the  strangest  that  had  occurred  in  a  long, 
long  time.  On  that  day  the  formality  of  disposing  of  Great  Britain's 
team  of  three  began,  and  ended  two  days  later,  with  the  laurels  borne  by 
America's  quartet,  to  be  sure,  but  not  before  the  men  from  across  the 
seas  had  established  their  ability  beyond  all  question  by  coming  danger- 
ously  near   to   turning  an   expected   defeat   into   an   unlooked-for   victory. 

From  every  standpoint  the  matches,  which  were  the  first  of  their  kind 
played  in  the  Metropolitan  District  since  the  time  of  the  Doherty  brothers 
invasion,  were  successful.  The  largest  crowd  that  ever  attended  a  tennis 
event  in  New  York  assembled,  and  financially  no  series  ever  approached 
the  degree  of  success  that  this  attained.  The  courts  and  management 
were  all  that  could  be  asked  for,  and  certainly  the  condition  of  the  men, 
barring  W.  A.  Larned,  could  not  have  been  improved  upon.  The  Ameri- 
can captain,  unfortunately,  was  not  feeling  fit,  but  it  did  not  prevent  his 
winning  both   of   his   matches. 

England  was  represented  by  Captain  C.  P.  Dixon,  a  veteran  of  other 
international  matches;  A.  H.  Lowe  and  A.  E.  Beamish.  America's  team 
was  composed  of  Captain  W.  A.  Larned.  M.  E.  McLoughlin,  R.  D.  Little 
and  T.  C.  Bundy.  Beamish,  Little  and  Bundy  were  played  only  in  the 
doubles,  the   latter  two  together  and  C.    P.    Dixon   with  Beamish. 

The  draw  for  the  first  day's  play  brought  together  Larned  and  Dixon. 
Lowe  was  opposed  to  McLoughlin.  The  matches  began  within  a  few  min- 
utes of  each  other.  Interest  centered  of  course,  upon  the  former  match 
and  the  court,  around  which  was  erected  the  major  portion  of  the  grand 
stand,    was   alloted   to   it. 

Ex-Champion  H.  D.  Slocum  was  chosen  as  referee  and  a  full  quota  of 
linesmen  appointed.  Dixon  won  the  toss  and  decided  to  serve.  He  got 
to  40/30,  but  Larned  broke  through  with  two  smashes  and  a  passing  fore- 
hand. The  American  played  fast  and  struck  his  stride  in  little  or  no 
time,  but  Dixon  was  not  so  quick  to  get  under  way.  At  4/0  Larned  was 
within  a  point  of  the  next  game,  but  was  defeated  in  a  pretty  driving 
duel.  At  5/1  Larned  gave  up  coming  to  the  net,  but  the  result  was  dis- 
astrous. Dixon  improved  every  moment  of  play.  Passing  his  opponent 
consistently,  he  won  two  games  and  was  40/30  for  a  third,  but  a  close 
decision   and   effective   volleying   by    Larned   ended   the   set   at   6/3. 

The  Englishman  settled  down  for  the  second  set  and  by  clever  passing 
took  Larned's  service  twice  in  succession,  besides  winning  his  own.  His 
shots  were  marvels  of  accuracy,  but  absurdly  slow.  '  Time  after  time  the 
ball  slid  by  Larned  with  so  little  momentum  that  it  looked  as  though  he 
might  easily  have  returned  it  had  he  turned  and  run  after  it.  But  the 
fastest  drives  of  McLoughlin  could  have  been  no  more  effective  than 
those  puzzling  "floaters"  which  Larned  seemed  so  utterly  unable  to  antici- 
pate with.  Dixon  leading  at  5/1,  Larned  served  and  by  better  play  took 
the  game.  On  Dixon's  service  Larned  attempted  to  follow  his  returns  to 
the   net,   but  was   passed   repeatedly. 

The  first  six  games  of  the  third  set  were  divided.  At  4/3  Larned  drove 
faultlessly,  defeating  Dixon  by  sheer,  speed  for  the  latter's  service  game. 
The  ninth,  with  the  American  serving,  was  short  and  one-sided.  Dixon's 
eye   seemed  a  trifle   off  and   he   tossed  away   several   points   on   weak   errors. 

Larned  got  off  well  for  the  fourth  set,  but  at  2/1  against  him  Dixon, 
by  wonderful  passing,  captured  three  in  a  row.  Larned  put  more  pace 
to   his   shots   in  the   seventh  gam^   and  by   placing  deep   to  the   corners   got

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  19 

to  3/4  Again  the  Britisher  shot  the  ball  by  as  Larned  followed  in  his 
delivery,  and  the  game  score  read  5/3.  The  visitor  followed  up  his  advan- 
tage and,  as  usual,  passed  the  American  as  the   latter  came   up. 

The  fifth  set  was  a  nerve-racking  aftair  from  start  to  finish.  Larned 
opened,  but  a  deep  drive  to  one  corner  gave  Dixon  the  game.  He  took 
the  second  game,  largely  as  a  result  of  Larned's  errors,  and  divided  the 
next  four.  At  2/4  Larned  served  and  got  to  40/30,  when  Dixon  shot  a 
service  return  by  -for  deuce.  A  bad  bound  and  another  beautifully 
directed    drive    put   the   American    still    further   behind. 

Although  there  seemed  but  little  chance  for  Larned  at  that  stage,  he 
started  by  getting  a  net  cord  shot  for  the  first  point.  The  second  was  a 
■drive  past  Dixon  as  the  latter  came  in.  Larned  then  netted  two  more, 
and  the  score  was  30-all.  Dixon's  chance  seemed  at  hand,  but  he  drove 
out  and  tossed  away  the  game  with  a  double  fault.  Larned  rolled  up  his 
sleeves  then  and  served  a  fast  one  to  Dixon's  back-hand,  which  he  killed 
outright  as  it  came  back  high  and  short;  a  rally  ended  by  a  netted  shot  of 
Dixon's,  and  Larned  got  to  40/0  with  his  second  net  cord  stroke.  The 
game  ended  when  Dixon  put  one  into  the  net,  which  a  little  higher  would 
have   been   a   clean   ace. 

The  excitement  by  that  time  was  intense.  The  crowd  shouted  and 
yelled  continuously.  It  seemed  to  worry  Dixon  and  he  began  the  tenth 
game  with  a  double  fault.  Larned  made  it  15-all  by  volleying  out,  but 
hit  the  next  two  services  for  aces.  At  15/40  Dixon  was  in  a  winning 
position  to  choke  a  hard  drive,  but  for  the  third  time  in  as  many  games 
Larned's  ball  struck  the  tape  and  barely  rolled  over.  To  say  that  it  was 
exasperating  to  the  visitor  at  that  stage  of  the  game  would  be  putting  it 
mildly.      He    was   plainly    upset. 

The  next  two  games  were  short.  Dixon  shot  his  first  return  into  the 
net,  and  was  defeated  by  a  fourth  net  cord  stroke.  It  was  almost  laugh- 
able to  see  the  expression  on  the  latter's  face  as  the  ball  fell  over,  but 
no  one  could  laugh  at  such  hard  luck  and  at  such  a  time.  A  lob  which 
he  killed  outright  and  a  drive  too  fast  for  Dixon  to  handle  gave  Larned 
the   odd  game. 

The  last  game  was  one  of  the  tamest.  Each  man  made  two  error«,  but 
Larned  drove  one  out  of  reach  and  Dixon's  last  return  found  the  net. 
It  was  a  great  pull-up  for  Larned,  but  an  equally  great  disappointment  to 
Dixon.  With  the  match  all  but  lost,  Larned  cut  loose  and,  taking  big 
■chances,   ran   it   out   with   a   "Garrison    Finish." 

Dixon's  game  had  been  uniformly  excellent  and  remained  so  during 
Larned's  run.  He  played,  on  the  whole,  better  and  sounder  tennis  and 
at  no  time  was  in  danger  from  his  own  errors,  as  was  Larned.  His  style 
is  as  unusual  as  it  is  effective.  He  is  remarkably  fast  and  graceful  for 
a  man  of  his  weight  and  does  everything  with  a  minimum  of  exertion.  He 
is  so  skillful  at  conserving  his  efforts  and  eliminating  unnecessary  action 
that  he  gives  an  impression  of  being  slow,  that  is  accentuated  by  the  slow 
pace  of  his  strokes.  Dixon's  one  fault  is  the  lack  of  speed.  In  view  of 
his  exceptionally  fine  control  it  is  doubtful  if  his  inability  to  hit  hard 
may  be  termed  a  fault,  for  there  is  no  doubt  that  with  added  pace  goes 
diminishing  accuracy. 

The  McLoughlin-Lowe  match  began  with  the  former  serving  and  for 
ten  games  the  delivery  won.  As  is  so  often  the  case  with  him,  McLough- 
lin_  was  wild  and  unsteady  on  ground  strokes,  and  although  Lowe's 
delivery  was  not  a  severe  one,  the  Californian  could  not  muster  any 
•degree  of  certainly  in  his  returns.  Lowe  was  not  much  better  off,  and 
during  the  first  set  failed  dismally  to  meet  the  Westerner's'  cannon-ball 
services.  At  five-all  the  latter,  as  usual,  took  the  game  and  by  slightly 
improved   ground    play   managed   to   break   through    Lowe   for   the   set. 

In  the  second  set  McLoughlin  struck  his  stride  and  after  dropping 
Lowe's  first  service  game  ran  five  straight.  He  was  fast,  aggressive 
always,  and  never  better  overhead  and  at  volleying.     The   Englishman   was 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  21 

outclassed  for  the  time  and  it  began  to  look  like  a  runaway  for  the  Coast 
expert. 

With  the  third  set  a  change  began.  A  drizzle  had  made  fast  footwork 
a  precarious  thing  to  attempt,  and  much  against  his  will  McLoughlin  was 
forced  to  remain  back  most  of  the  time.  Lowe,  of  course,  came  in  only 
when  he  had  to  and  was  far  superior  to  the  American  at  driving.  The 
result  was  that  he  more  than  held  his  own.  pounding  McLoughlin's  service 
for  a  love  game  on  one  occasion  and  breaking  through  twice  afterwards. 
He  won  the   set  at  6/4,   winding  it  up   with   a   series   of   splendid   drives. 

Lowe  fell  behind  in  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  set,  but  at  1/3  against 
him  steadied  enough  to  even  up.  The  Calif ornian  made  it  4/3,  but  it  wa» 
his  last  for  the  set.  Lowe  braced  finely  and  made  it  two  sets-all  with  a 
run  of  three  games. 

The  fifth  set  began  auspiciously  for  the  Englishman.  He  took  McLough- 
lin'^ service  to  love  and  won  his  own,  but  thereafter  annexed  only  one 
more  game.  McLoughlin  played  fiercely,  hammering  everything  and  rarely 
missing.      It   was  a  great  finish   and   showed  the  youngster  at  his  best. 

The  following  Monday  the  doubles  was  played.  It  was  a  fast,  interest- 
ing match  from  beginning  to  end,  but  it  was  not  a  close  one  or  well 
played  on  the  American's  part.  Little  and  Bundy,  playing  together  for 
the  first  time,  failed  entirely  to  form  any  sort  of  team  work,  while  on  the 
other  hand  Dixon's  and  Beamish's  team  play  was  a  revelation  in  its 
harmony.  The  Englishmen  were  steady  and  clever,  but  again  the  absence 
of  any  speed  in  their  strokes,  even  smashes,  was  noticeable.  Bundy  and 
Little   were    infinitely    harder    hitters,    but    decidedly    more    erratic. 

Beamish's  play  was  watched  with  great  interest,  but  it  was  on  the 
whole  a  stereotyped  sort  of  game,  sound  enough,  but  lacking  in  origin- 
ality. All  his  strokes  were  made  correctly,  but  just  as  one  reads  of  how 
the  strokes  should  be  made.  There  was  nothing  new  in  any  play  he 
made,  nor,  on  the  other  hand,  was  there  fault  to  find  with  anything  he 
did.  Dixon  played  a  pretty  game  from  first  to  last.  He  hit  harder  than 
in   his   singles   match   and   made    even    fewer   mistakes. 

Little  was  characteristically  aggressive  and  fast.  He  used  great  speed 
on  all  his  strokes  and  his  volleying  was  the  feature  of  the  match.  In 
that  department  he  was  invincible,  catching  his  opponents  times  innumer- 
able  on   the   trickiest   sort   of   plays. 

The  weakness  of  the  team  was  due  largely  to  Bundy's  faulty  play.  The 
Californian  was  way  off  and  failed  in  all  his  efforts  to  strike  his  game. 
Ordinarily  sure  at  volleying  and  lobbing,  on  that  occasion  he  did  neither 
with  any  degree  of  accuracy.  His  lobs  were  nearly  always  short  and  his 
volleying  lacking  in  that  severity  for  which  it  is  famous.  The  match  went 
three   sets,    only   one    of   which,    the   second,    was   close. 

On  Tuesday  the  greatest  crowd  of  the  series  t-urned  out.  The  loss  of 
the  doubles  had  left  the  issue  in  doubt  and  after  the  close  matches  of 
Saturday  a  general  feeling  that  anything  might  happen  prevailed  among 
the  tennis  enthusiasts,  drawing  them  irresistibly  to  the  grounds  to  be  on 
hand   for   whatever   might    take   place. 

The  feature  was  the  Dixon-McLoughlin  set-to,  and  it  was  of  a  kind 
that  made  the  spectators  congratulate  themselves  for  having  made  the 
trip  to   the   club. 

Dixon  began  by  serving  and  won  his  game  after  deuce  was  twice  called. 
McLoughlin's  first  serve  was  a  double  fault,  but,  as  with  most  players  who 
try  to  handle  his  delivery  for  the  first  time,  Dixon  could  do  nothing  with 
it.  The  server  continued  to  win  until  five-all.  but  after  McLoughlin  broke 
through  Dixon  did  likewise.  The  youngster  repeated,  however,  and  on 
the  fourteenth  game  got  two  service  aces  and  the   first   set. 

Thus  far  there  was  but  little  to  choose.  McLoughlin  was  much  more 
severe  and  generally  aggressive,  but  Dixon  was  master  of  all  the  tricks  of 
the  game,  and  time  after  time  caught  the  Californian  off  balance  or  out- 
guessed him  in  their  maneuvers  for  position.

McLoughlin  became  very  erratic  in  the  second  set,  throwing  away  shots 
continuously,  and  Dixon  lost  no  time  in  making  the  most  of  the  situation. 
At  4/0  McLoughlin  got  into  the  game,  succeeding  in  temporarily  stopping 
the  Englishman,  but  the  latter  was  too  steady  and  clever  to  be  permanently 
downed,   and  ran  the   set  out  at   6/3. 

The  third  set  was  as  uneven  as  the  second  had  been,  only  this  time  the 
shoe  was  on  the  other  foot.  It  was  McLoughlin  who  got  off  vi^ith  a  flying 
start  and  led  at  4/1.  Dixon  had  slacked  unconsciously  and  was  piling  up 
errors.  It  was  not  like  the  visitor  at  all,  but  his  biaces  were  short  and 
spasmodic.  At  5/3  McLoughlin  served  and  following  in  to  the  net,  volleyed 
sharply  for  the  points.  The  set  ended  with  a  drive  down  the  line  which 
Dixon,  thinking  it   would   fall   out,   let   pass. 

The  fourth  set  was  settled  quickly.  Dixon  played  as  though  very  tired. 
He  continued  to  strive  his  utmost  to  check  the  oiirush  of  his  fiery  oppo- 
nent, but  his  efforts  were  of  little  avail.  McLoughlin  got  faster  and  faster 
as  the  game  wore  on,  finishing  in  a  whirlwind  of  serving  which  his  rival 
could   not   begin   to   stop. 

Larned  and  Lowe  furnished  the  minor  attraction  of  the  afternoon,  but 
there  was  a  time  during  their  match  when  the  watchers  held  their  breath 
and  when  the  mighty  Larned  seemed  in  imminent  danger,  for  the  second- 
time  in  three  days. 

The  first  set  was  an  even  thing  for  six  games.  Neither  man  was  very 
strong  on  his  ground  strokes,  but  at  4/3  the  American  passed  Lowe  on. 
two  fast  crosscourt  shots  and  broke  through  Lowe's  service.  The  ninth 
game   was  Larned's  at  love   and   with  it   the   first   set. 

The  second  set  was  a  bad  one  for  Larned.  He  could  not  steady  and 
Lowe,  by  fine  driving  and  an  occasional  volley  ace,  took  five  straight 
games.  The  next  was  Larned's,  but  the  seventh  ended  the  set,  for  Lowe's 
delivery   was   driven   out  and  into   the   net  twice,   each   way. 

During  the  set  Larned  played  nervously  and  seemed  to  be  constantly 
trying  to  find  his  swing.  He  failed  utterly  to  get  going  and  was  no  better 
at  the  beginning  of  the   set  than   he   was  at  its  end. 

Lowe  kept  on  with  his  winning  streak  until  the  score  stood  3/1  in  the 
third  set.  He  had  been  going  at  a  fast  clip  and  instinctively  slowed  dowr 
at  that  point  to  ease  the  strain.  That  it  was  fatal  was  proven  instantly. 
for  Larned  raced  ahead,  putting  twice  the  pace  to  his  shots  and  never  for 
a  second  letting  up.  At  that  Lowe  managed  to  win  two  more  games,  but 
at  five-all   Larned   pounded   out  two   games  and   his   second   set. 

The  fourth  set  was  over  in  less  time  than  it  takes  to  tell  it.  Larned 
played  faster,  more  accurately,  and  took  the  net  oftener.  At  5/0  Lowe 
won  a  game,  but  the  next  one   ended  the  match. 

Lowe's  game  was  favorably  commented  upon  by  many  experts  who  were 
near  the  side  lines,  but  it  was  not  in  any  sense  a  well  rounded  one.  Off 
the  ground  his  play  was  excellcTit  and  his  peculiar  delivery  seemed  quite 
effective.  His  volleying  was  not  to  be  compared  with  his  other  strokes,  nor 
was  his  smashing  severe  enough  to  be  at  all   effective.

Davis  Cup  Final 

Although  universally  conceded  to  have  sent  the  strongest  team  which 
could  be  mustered,  America's  third  attempt  to  wrest  from  Australasia  the 
world-famous  Davis  Cup  proved  as  futile  as  its  predecessors,  and,  in  spite 
of  the  addition  of  Captain  W.  A.  Larned,  the  visitors  went  down  to  a 
defeat  as   disappointing  as  it  was  decisive. 

N.  E.  Brookes,  A.  W.  Dunlop  and  Rod  Heath  were  the  men  who  suc- 
cessfully withstood  the  assault  of  the  challengers.  The  vain  efforts  for  the 
United  States  were  made  by  W.  A.  Larned,  B.  C.  Wright  and  M.  E. 
McLoughlin.  The  latter  trio,  champion,  ex-champion  and  most  promising 
youngster  ever  produced  in  this  or  any  other  country,  made  a  sorry  show- 
ing for  men  of  their  recognized  ability.  Not  one  of  the  five  points  possible 
to  earn  were  credited  to  them,  and  but  one  of  the  four  matches  actually 
played  went  the  limit  of  five  sets. 

This,  in  the  face  of  the  fact  that  Australasia's  team  was  by  no  means 
considered  the  strongest  that  might  have  been  put  in  the  field,  undoubtedly 
created  a  world-wide  surprise  and  astonishment  in  tennis  circles.  So  gen- 
eraliy  was  the  feeling  of  America's  superiority  entertained  that  up  to  the 
very  day  of  the  first  matches  played  speculation  favored  them,  and  what 
betting  was  done  showed  the  cup  defenders  to  be  on  the  short  end,  even 
in  the  judgment  of  their  most  ardent   supporters. 

November  i  saw  the  Americans  leave  Vancouver  aboard  the  steamship 
Zelandia  and,  according  to  schedule,  a  month  or  more  intervened  between 
the  time  of  their  arrival  in  Christchurch,  New  Zealand,  and  the  dates  set 
for  the  matches,  December  29,  30  and  January  i.  That  time  was  utilized 
for  practice,  and  it  was  not  long  before  sea  legs  disappeared  and  daily 
improvementlwas  apparent  in  each.  Wright  was  the  first  to  come  around, 
with  Larned  improving,  and  McLoughlin  a  trifie  slow  to  attain  a  normal 
stride.  Day  after  day  they  tried  each  other  out,  but,  from  indications 
which  were  subsequently  borne  out,  Wright  and  Larned  had  the  call  for 
tingles,  with  McLoughlin  and  the  Bostonian,  the  previously  agreed  upon 
team  in  doubles. 

Improving  steadily,  the  Americans  approached  the  day  set  for  the  battle 
to  begin,  when  the  most  disastrous  of  occurrences  came  about.  Larned  began 
to  show  the  effects  of  continued  damp  and  inclement  weather  in  the  form 
of  rheumatism  in  the  left  ankle  and  right  elbow.  In  spite  of  treatment 
and  every  precaution  his  condition  failed  to  improve,  and  on  the  day 
previous  to  the  first  matches  the  American  champion  intimated  his  attention 
of  withdrawing  to  F.  M.  B.  Fisher,  the  referee.  At  the  last  moment,  how- 
ever, he  decided  against  defaulting  or  the  substitution  of  McLoughlin  and 
was  drawn  against  Heath  in  the  second  match  of  the  opening  day.  Wright 
drew  Brookes,  and  to  these  old  rivals  fell  the  honor  of  commencing 
hostilities. 

Steady  rain  made  it  impossible  to  play  on  Friday,  December  28,  and  it 
was  not  until  Monday  that  conditions  warranted  a  beginning.  By  one- 
thirty,  the  time  set  for  the  opening  match,  every  seat  was  occupied,  and  a 
huge,  enthusiastic  Crowd  greeted  Brookes  and  Wright,  who  appeared 
punctually  on  time. 

The  American  won  the  toss  and  elected  to  serve.  A  brief  warm-up, 
followed  by  a  hush  from  the  crowd,  and  the  fight  between  the  two  world- 
famotis  left-handers  began. 

Wright's  first  service  was  driven  out  of  court,  each  netted,  and  then  a 
well-placed  service,  followed  by  a  winning  cross-court  volley,  and  the 
American  had  drawn  first  blood.  Wright  got  to  30-love  on  Brookes'  deliv 
ery  in  the  second  game,  but  that  snake-like  service  soon  got  its  work  in 
and  the  game  score   was  quickly  tied.     The  third  game   was  a  bad  one  for

the  visitor.  From  30-love  he  volleyed  v^^eakly  double-faulted,  and  then 
becoming  momentarily  confused,  dropped  two  more  points.  He  made  two 
beautiful  shots  in  the  fourth  game,  but  they  were  not  enough,  and  the 
score  went  up  to  3/1.  Though  Brookes  made  uniformly  excellent  returns 
in  the  next,  Wright  was  keen  and  on  his  toes  every  second,  anne>{ing  the 
game  on  wonderful  volleying.  Three  times  in  the  sixth  Wright  found  the 
net  on  his  opening  drives  and  ended  the  agony  with  a  poor  volley  into  the 
bottom  of  the  barrier.  At  3/4  Brookes'  accuracy  went  askew  and  he  barely 
missed  the  side  lines  twice.  He  was  aided  then  by  a  double  and  a  win- 
ning block  of  a  fast  chop.  A  wretched  smash  of  a  weak  lob  and  a  cross- 
court  chop  that  was  just  out  lost  the  game  for  the  American.  The  latter 
then  broke  through  Brookes  for  the  ftrst  time  one  point  being  a  net  cord 
play,  but  the  Australasian  crowded  on  steam  in  the  tenth  and  his  opponent 
was  out  of  it  entirely   for  the  time. 

It  was  a  fast,  exciting  set,  with  Wright  the  aggressor  but  less  steady,, 
and  Brookes  cold,  calculating  and,  as  usual,  taking  full  advantage  of  the 
smallest  opportunities. 

Although  endeavoring  in  every  conceivable  way  to  follow  the  advantage 
thus  gained,  Brookes  was  fairly  smothered  by  the  tremendously  daring  yet 
accurate  play  of  his  opponent  in  the  second  set.  No  matter  where  he  put 
the  ball  Wright  tried  for  it,  with  the  result  that  numberless  seemingly 
point-winning  plays  were  picked  up  and  turned  against  hirn.  The  Ameri- 
can, by  his  strenuous  labors,  allowed  his  rival  but  four  points  in  the  first 
three  games  and  almost  captured  the  fourth  at  1/3.  Brookes  got  to  40/15^ 
but  put  two  in  succession  over  the  base  line,  allowing  Wright  to  make  it, 
4/1.  Meantime,  Wright  was  exhausting  an  enormous  amount  of  energy 
and  strength  in  his  body-racking  starting  and  stopping  and  twisting  and 
turning.  It  seemed  that  a  reaction  must  come  at  any  second  and  with  it 
Brookes'  chance.  At  5/1  Wright  dropped  his  second  game,  and  then,  with 
Brookes  serving,  a  fiercely  contested,  stubborn  fight  began.  No  less  than 
twenty-two  points  were  required  to  decide  the  game  and  each  apparently 
had  it  won  a  dozen  times.  Once  Wright  made  a  miraculous  save  in  the 
form  of  a  pick-up  and  followed  it  with  a  volley  that  whistled  through 
Brookes  for  the  point  and   set. 

Wild  applause  greeted  the  visitor's  success,  for  indications  pointed'  ta 
another  1908  struggle,  and  it  is  for  such  contests  that  spectators  travel  far 
to  see  and  to  which  they  give  a  permanent  nook  in  their  memories. 

However,  the  physical  effort  which  Brookes  had  made  up  to  that  point 
was  as  nothing  compared  to  the  exhausting  tax  Wright  had  been  forced  to, 
and  the  third  set  found  the  Australian  comparatively  fresh  and  quite  at 
his  best. 

Wright  opened  and  lost  one  point  in  the  game,  but  Brookes  retaliated 
with  a  love  game  in  the  second.  Wright  returned  the  compliment  in  kind 
and  a  minute  later  Brookes  made  it  two-all.  It  was  then  that  Wright 
showed  the  effects  of  his  efforts.  He  was  forced  to  let  up  and  Brookes 
jumped  away,  winning  three  successive  games.  Wright  came  back  and, 
with  clever  passing,  took  Brookes'  service,  but  it  was  a  momentary  flash, 
for  Brookes  did  likewise  to  the  American's  delivery,  and  the  all-important 
third  set  ended  at  6/3.  „r  •  . 

The  third  set  was  merely  a  forerunner  of  what  was  to  follow.  Wright 
was  done.  Tired,  he  continued  to  fight,  making  many  fine  shots,  but 
Brookes,  a  Napoleon  for  strategy  and  a  miniature  giant  of  strength,  was  a. 
veritable  stone  wall  into  which,  no  matter  which  way  he  turned,  the  Ameri- 
can ran.  Brookes'  volleying  was  perfect,  flawless,  and  as  he  camped  at 
the  net  and  would  not  be  dislodged  with  Wright's  best  plays,  the  result 
was  never  in  doubt.  It  was  a  set  intensely  interesting,  not  from  the  stand- 
point of  a  contest,  but  for  what  Brookes,  with  his  genius  for  the  game, 
would  do  next.  The  spectators  were,  like  Wright,  utterly  unable  to  fathom 
or  possess  the  Australian's  next  move,  and  therein  lay  the  secret  of  the 
man's  success. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  29 

After  a  brief  intermission,  in  which  time  was  taken  to  roll  down  the 
court,  Larned  and  Heath  appeared.  The  American  got  off  well,  winning 
Heath's  service  and  his  own.  Both,  during  the  beginning,  remained  back, 
driving  rather  weakly  and  apparently  intent  upon  safety.  Heath  retaliated 
by  placing  the  third  and  fourth  games  to  his  credit,  but  it  was  his  total 
for  the  set.  Larned  played  fast  and  accurately  and  ran  out  four  games  in 
good  shape. 

It  was  then  that  the  unaccountable  happened.  Heath  got  to  2-love  before 
Larned  tallied.  He  was  playing  soundly  now,  brilliantly  occasionally,  but 
always  doing  a  bit  more  than  had  been  expected  from  him,  yet  his  game 
was  certainly  not  of  that  class  or  calibre  to  hold,  much  less  defeat,  the 
great  Larned.  Something  was  wrong,  and  Larned's  game  for  the  time  was 
pitiable  in  its  helplessness.  Heath  got  the  set  after  the  loss  of  that  third 
game,  and  then  began  the  struggle  for  the  odd  one.  Again  Larned  jumped 
away,  and  again  something  happened  to  break  up  his  game.  From  a  win- 
ning position  at  4/2  the  visitor  suddenly  broke.  Shots  usually  good  for 
the  point  went  wild,  and  it  was  the  backstop  and  net  which  the  majority 
of  his  returns  found.  There  was  no  apparent  reason  for  it.  It  was  not 
due  to  a  great  improvement  on  Heath's  part.  It  was  altogether  unaccount- 
able, unreasonable,  yet  it  happened,  and  Heath  forged  steadily  on,  rolling 
up  points.     The   fourth  set  was  a  walkover. 

Larned,  lame  and  utterly  helpless,  without  poise  or  control,  was  defeated. 
Defeated  by  a  combination  of  his  own  errors  and  his  opponent's  sound, 
steady  play.  It  was  a  surprise,  and  disappointment  shared  by  the  multi- 
tude, who  for  the  first  time  saw  the  world-famous  veteran  in  action,  that 
has  rarely  if  ever  been  equalled  in  the  history  of  the  game.  That  Larned 
"was  not  himself,  was  ill  and  mentally  unfit,  was  perfectly  apparent.  That 
he  was  able  to  play  at  all  was  merely  an  evidence  of  his  grit  and  deter- 
mination. A  physician's  certificate  to  the  elYect  that  he  was  unfit  to  play 
had  little  effect.  So  far  as  his  decision  to  take  part  was  concerned  and 
■because  such  were  the  circumstances,  it  is  difficult  to  draw  conclusions  or 
to  give  to  Heath  the  full  measure  of  credit,  which,  under  other  conditions, 
■would  be  rightfully  his.  The  winner  played  well,  better  than  it  was  sup- 
posed he  could,  but  for  all  that  there  will  always  remain  the  doubt,  the 
possibility  or  dissention  which  a  victory  so  lacking  in  decisiveness  must 
necessarily  entail. 

However  dark  the  prospects  at  this  point  in  the  series  may  have  looked 
to  the  Americans,  there  was  no  evidence  of  discouragement  shown.  That 
Larned  would  yet  come  round  was  the  hope  they  bore,  consequently  it  was 
•with  a  grim  determination  that  Wright  and  McLoughlin  took  the  court  on 
the  second  day  of  the  series.  It  was  McLoughlin's  first  appearance  as  well 
as  A.  W.  Dunlop's  entry  into  the  fight,  and  a  crowd  of  over  four  thousand 
were  on  hand  to  watch  the  turning  point  or  end,  as  the  fortunes  of  war 
might  decree. 

Wright  won  the  toss  and  chose  his  own  service  with  which  to  begin. 
The  game  was  short,  marred  by  a  double  fault  at  a  critical  point,  and  was 
won  by  the  Australasians.  Brookes  followed  in  the  order  of  delivery  and 
3-love  was  quickly  called.  Then  it  was  McLoughlin's  turn,  and  the 
*'Comet,"  as  he  was  dubbed  by  his  enthusiastic  admirers,  promptly  set 
things  aflame.  Four  sizzling  services  and  a  volley  that  streaked  through 
Dunlop  for  an  ace  wound  up  a  love  game.  The  crowd  roared  its  approval 
*nd  continued  to  applaud  as  McLoughlin  and  Wright  broke  Dunlop's 
service  for  two-all.  But  again  Wright  fai*«??l  to  win  his  service.  He  was 
too  careful  and  endeavored  to  play  too  often  to  Dunlop,  with  the  result 
that  his  volleying  was  very  ineffective.  Too  late  in  the  set  he  awoke  to 
his  errors  of  judgment,  and  although  he  won  his  third  service  game  to 
love,  the  brace  came  at  a  time  when  the  damage  had  been  done,  and  the 
Pet   went  to   the   cup  defenders   at   6/4. 

The  second  set  began  with  the  "California  Comet's"  service  and  he  shut 
out  his  opponents,  four  points  to  love.     Brookes  and  Dunlop  each  suffered 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL,  31 

the  indignity  of  being  unable  to  even  get  their  rackets  on  the  ball. 
Throughout  the  set  the  youngster  played  in  whirlwind  fashion,  killing  and 
volleying  with  absolutely  unapproachable  speed  and  certainty.  Never  were 
lobs  treated  with  such  scant  consideration  or  services  shot  back  as  though 
from  the  mouth  of  a  cannon.  It  was  a  pace  too  fast  for  Brookes  or  Dun- 
lop  to  cope  with,  and  the  set  went  to  the  Americans'   credit  in  short  order. 

Again  it  fell  to  McLoughlin  to  begin  the  set,  and  for  the  second  time  a 
love  game  was  tallied  at  the  beginning.  As  the  fight  had  become  largely  a 
matter  of  services,  it  was  a  question  of  where  the  break  was  coming.  Not 
from  Brookes  or  McLoughlin,  for  each  was  delivering  with  heart-breaking 
regularity  almost  unplayable  balls.  It  therefore  was  up  to  Dunlop  and 
Wright,  and  finally,  at  five-all,  Wright  fell  down.  Not  literally,  but  figur- 
atively; he  lost  his  punch.  _  Only  one  point  was  credited  him  and  with 
Brookes  following,  the  Americans'  chance  for  the  set  went  glimmering.  Up 
to  that  point  in  the  match  it-  was  Wright  who  trailed  the  held  and  whose 
play  on  the  whole  was  below  par.  His  service  was  the  least  effective,  and 
his  whole  game  below  that  standard  of  which  he  is  capable.  Brookes'  form 
was  characteristic  of  that  great  player,  and  that  being  so,  no  further  com- 
ment is  necessary.  His  partner,  Dunlop,  was  on  edge,  and  as  he  is  one 
of  the  really  great  doubles  men,  his  value  may  well  be  imagined.  Over- 
head and  at  volleying  he  was  irresistible.  Only  his  service  may  be  said  to 
have  been  weak,  but  as  both  he  and  Brookes  covered  it  with  phenomenal 
volleying,  it  was  a  point  which,  though  vulnerable,  did  not  stand  out  as 
did  Wright's.  McLoughlin  was,  as  'tis  said,  "all  there."  Nothing  troubled 
him  during  that  stage  of  the  game,  unless  it  was  an  occasional  tendency 
to  "pull"  his  smashes,  due  to  the  insistent  demand  from  Wright  for  caution. 

But  the  fourth  set  did  not  go  the  way  of  its  predecessors.  Here,  at  last, 
the  fight  became  more  one-sided.  True,  the  challengers  got  off  to  a  flying 
start,  but  it  was  not  long  before  they  were  levelled.  At  2-love  it  was 
'  Wright's  service,  but  he  tailed  to  improve.  Obviously  it  was  not  his  day. 
Everything  he  did  was  just  a  trifle  off.  He  was  not  playing  badly.  It 
seemed  more  like  hard  luck.  His  shots  just  missed,  but  that  little  was  as 
disastrous  as  if  he   was  dropping  them  yards  beyond   the   boundaries. 

Losing  that  game  was  the  beginning  of  a  slump  which  of  itself  settled 
the  possession  of  the  cup  for  another  year.  Brookes  and  Dunlop  took  four 
straight,  winning  from  McLoughlin  for  the  first  time.  Here  Wright  braced 
and  won  his  service  and  followed  by  breaking  through  Brookes  for  four- 
all.  Then,  with  McLoughlin  up  and  Dunlop  to  follow,  the  chances  looked 
bright,  but  instantly  faded  when  the  Californian,  for  the  second  time, 
weakened  and  allowed  his  opponents  to  get  the  advantage  again.  The  tenth 
spelled  "finis"  for  the  Americans.  Not  a  point  was  won  by  them  and  the 
series  was  over,  so  far  as  the  result  as  a  whole   was  concerned. 

Meantime,  Larned  had  failed  to  improve,  and  it  had  been  decided  to 
play  McLoughlin  in  his  place  against  Brookes.  Great  disappointment  was 
felt  when  it  became  known  that  Brookes  and  Larned  were  not  to  meet.  A 
match  between  them  was  what  the  tennis  world  had  been  looking  forward 
to  ever  since  the  Australian  captured  the  English  title  in  1908,  and  when 
at  the  eleventh  hour  the  meeting  was  declared  oft  and  the  question  of 
supremacy  between  these  two,  most  famous  and  of  greatest  ability,  in  all 
the  world,  it  took  from  the  series  an  interest  which  no  other  match  could 
supply. 

However,  no  one  was  prepared  for  the  surprise  of  the  third  day.  Wright 
scratched  to  Heath,  and  the  only  match  was  that  between  Brookes  and 
McLoughlin.  With  a  memory  of  what  had  happened  to  the  youngster  in 
his  previous  meeting  with  Brookes,  the  spectators  expected  but  little  from 
him.  Therefore,  his  fight  so  nearly  successful,  was  a  revelation  to  the 
hundreds  who  had  seen  him,  a  helpless  novice  in  the  power  of  his  crafty 
opponent   but  two   years  ago. 

Perfect  weather  conditions,  a  hard  court  and  huge  crowd  greeted  the 
combatants  as  they   stepped  on  the   court.     There   was  nothing  unusual  for 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  33 

the  first  six  games.  Each  won  three  on  services,  with  McLoughlin  having 
the  advantage  of  delivery  on  the  odd  game.  The  seventh  game  was  close. 
Brookes  volleyed  an  easy  drive  too  deep  when  the  score  stood  30/40,  but 
after  deuce  was  called  passed  and  lobbed  over  his  rival  for  the  necessary 
aces.  He  won  his  own  service  for  5/3,  but  could  do  nothing  against  the 
tremendous  speed  which  the  *'Comet"  imparted  to  his  delivery  in  the  next. 
In  the  tenth  game  McLoughlin  hit  the  net.  drove  out,  fumbled  a  low  one 
at  his  feet,  drove  another  into  the  barrier,  and  found  himself  one  set  down. 
Nothing  daunted,  he  set  sail  in  the  second  set  and  soon  had  Brookes  in 
deep  water.  After  losing  the  first  game  he  won  three  straight,  with  13 
aces  to  6.  He  was  hitting  with  tremendous  power,  recklessly,  and  yet 
without  a  trace  of  wildness.  Brookes  was  temporarily  outclassed,  being 
fairly  smothered  by  speed.  The  fifth  game  started  auspiciously  for 
McLoughlin,  for  his  first  three  services  were  unreturned.  He  double- 
faulted  next  and  was  outvolleyed  twice.  He  got  the  vantage  point  on  a 
volley,  and  then  missing  his  first  service,  sent  his  second  with  such  pace 
and  direction  that  Brookes  failed  to  touch  it,  4/1.  Brookes,  volleying  in 
the  next  game,  checked  the  Californian's  stampede,  but  in  the  seventh 
game  Brookes  was  defeated,  four  points  to  love,  and  each  point  a  perfect 
volley.  At  5/2  Brookes  won  his  service,  but  McLoughlin  sent  over  the 
delivery  in  the  eighth  game  with  such  fierce  speed  that  set-all  was  called 
in  jig  time. 

The  crowd  cheered  and  then  settled  back  with  the  evident  belief  that 
here  was  a  match  that  would  not  soon  be  over,  and  an  opponent  for 
Brookes  that  was  going  to  keep  that  gentleman  rather  busy.  The  third  set 
opened  with  Brookes  serving.  He  got  to  30-all  before  McLoughlin  tried  a 
tentative  bang,  which  flew  past  like  a  cannon  shot.  Evidently  satisfied 
that  his  artillery  was  still  in  working  order,  he  tried  two  more  with  the 
same  result.  Brookes  deuced  it  with  a  clever  back-hander,  but  the  young- 
ster  swatted  two  beauties  and   captured  the  game. 

Brookes'  expression  remained  unchanged  as  his  opponent  thus  assumed 
a  lead  and  imperturable  as  ever  he  grappeled  with  the  American's  service 
to  such  good  effect  that  i-all  was  recorded.  A  streak  of  wild  hitting  let 
Brookes  in  for  the  third  game  rather  easily,  but  McLoughlin  soon  steadied 
and  with  the  aid  of  a  lucky  volley  made  it  2-all.  Brookes  took  his  own 
service  without  serious  opposition  in  the  fifth  game,  but  another  streak  of 
phenomenally  brilliant  play  by  the  "Comet"  left  him  far  behind,  with  a 
total  of  five  points  scored  to  his  opponents'  twelve.  At  5/3  the  Australian 
crept  up  a  game  closer,  but  again  McLoughlin,  serving,  was  irresistible, 
and  a  love  game  found  him  leading  at  two  sets  to   one. 

The  crowd  roared  its  approval.  Partisanship  was  a  thing  unknown,  for- 
gotten, and  the  greeting  accorded  the  red-haired  youth  was  an  unbiased 
tribute  to  his  natural  brilliancy  and  spectacularly  reckless  style  of  play. 
Brookes  scored  the  first  game  of  the  fourth  set  after  deuce  was  called,  and 
a  little  later  ran  up  to  3/1;  3/1.  3/2,  4/2,  4/3  and  5/3  was  the  order  of 
games  thereafter.  McLoughlin  had  slowed  down  a  bit  and  Brookes  was 
handling  the  situation  with  more  of  his  accustomed  poise  and  ease.  Sud- 
denly crowding  on  pace  he  caught  McLoughlin  unprepared  and  ran  out  on 
his  own  service,  making  the  score  two  sets  all. 

A  hushed  excitement  fell  over  the  crowd  when  the  fifth  set  began.  The 
cup  was  won  and  there  was  consequently  nothing  to  fear  from  the  result 
of  this  match.  A  win  by  the  youngster  would  be  as  warmly  received  as 
a  reverse  result,  and  the  lack  of  anxiety  enhanced  the  joy  of  watching  the 
two  master  hands  fight  to  a  finish. 

Again  McLoughlin  had  the  advantage  of  opening  on  service.  Relent 
lessly  determined  as  Brookes  was  now,  he  was  forced  to  bow  to  that  unbeat- 
able delivery,  and  though  he  forced  the  score  to  deuce  he  was  unable  to 
do  better.  He  won  the  second  game  to  15  by  inimitable  volleying  and 
which   forced    McLoughlin    to    err.      The   third   game    went   to    the   latter   at

love.  Two  winning  volleys,  a  fast  dropping  drive  and  service  act, 
acccounted   for  it. 

The  fourth  game  was  a  battle  royal.  At  15-all  Brookes  slipped  and  fell, 
but  was  uninjured.  Finally,  after  twenty  points  had  been  won  and  lost. 
Brookes  got  one  of  his  famous  backhand  volleys  across  court  and  the 
score  was  tied  at  2-all.  Every  variety  of  play  had  been  put  into  use  in 
that  game,  and  at  the  end  there  was  but  little  to  choose  in  the  manner 
each   man  had   made   his  strokes. 

Brookes  had  a  great  chance  for  the  fifth  game.  After  paving  the  way 
to  15/40  he  was  outvolleyed  twice,  and  McLoughlin  ran  it  out  with  a 
thundering  smash  and  service  ace.  The  sixth  game  was  another  hotly  con- 
tested session,  but  Brookes,  volleying,  was  too  good,  and  he  evened  the 
game  score. 

Then  the  unexpected  happened.  McLoughlin  dropped  his  service. 
Brookes  passed  him  twice,  and  a  net  and  out  by  the  server  ended  the 
game.  At  top  speed  the  Australian  captain  followed  up  his  advantage,  and 
with  the  loss  of  but  one  set  made  it  5/3.  McLoughlin  tightened  up  in  the 
ninth  and  help  a  safe  lead  till  5/4  was  announced.  A  deuce  set  looked 
imminent  when  two  side  line  passes  left  Brookes  to  gaze  at  where  the  ball 
went  by,  but  that  was  the  youngster's  final  stand.  Four  successive  aces  by 
Brookes   on   volleys   ended   the   match. 

For  another  year  at  least  the  Davis  Cup  remains  unchanged.  No  more 
valiant  or  successful  defense  of  the  famous  trophy  could  be  made  than 
that  of  the  allied  forces  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand.

The  Meeting   of   the  Sectional^  Doubles 
Winners  at  Chicago 

The  day  afted  Bull  and  Martin  had  annexed  the  Western  Championship, 
Tuesday,  August  i,  the  draw  for  the  preliminary  doubles,  played  at  the 
Onwentsia  Club  of  Lake  Forest,  was  made,  and  as  luck  would  have  it,  the 
two  teams  conceded  to  be  the  strongest  were  compelled  to  meet.  They 
were  McLoughlin  and  Bundy,  winners  of  the  Pacific  Coast  elimination 
series,  and  Touchard  and  Little,  who  had  won  the  Longwood  event,  the 
classic   of  the   East. 

That  left  Bull  and  Martin  to  face  the  South's  representatives,  C.  B. 
and  H.  L.  Doyle.  The  first  match  played  was  the  former.  It  was  con- 
tested on  a  court  a  trifle  slow  from  a  rainy  morning,  before  the  largest 
crowd  ever  gathered  in  the  West  to  watch  a  tennis  match.  Touchard  was 
the  first  to  serve  and  had  little  difficulty  in  winning  the  game  to  fifteen. 
Bundy  followed,  but  only  managed  to  win  one  point;  Little,  however, 
was  defeated  at  love,  and  with  McLoughlin  to  follow  it  looked  like  two-all. 
A  long  game  resulted,  which  ended  finally  when  Little  drove  one  too  hard 
for  Bundy  to  handle.  The  next  game  was  the  Easterners,  but  Bundy 
made  it  4/2  a  moment  later.  Little  took  his  service  to  love,  but  the  lead 
of  5/2  thus  gained  appeared  done  for  when  the  Westerners  took  two 
straight  with  only  three  points  lost.  Bundy,  however,  was  hammered  hard 
in  the  tenth  game,  and  the  set  ended  when  Touchard  passed  McLoughlin 
down   his   alley. 

The  California  pair  got  away  to  a  better  start  in  the  second  set,  but 
from  a  two-love  lead  they  were  overhauled,  eventually  losing  the  set  by 
a  score  of  6/4.  Throughout  the  two  sets  Touchard  and  McLoughlin  were 
in  far  better  form  than  their  partners.  The  former  was  at  his  best,  but 
McLoughlin  was  at  times  phenomenally  brilliant  and  at  others  in  his  most 
erratic  mood.  Bundy  was  the  weakest  of  th^  quartet,  lobbing  short  and 
lacking  pace  on  all  his  returns.  Little  was  very  wild  at  first,  but  improved 
steadily,  and  at  the  close  of  the  second  set  had  approached  form  charac- 
teristic  of  him   at  his  best. 

The  third  set  was  a  fight  from  start  to  finish.  Bundy  was  made  the 
object  of  attack  by  the  New  York  pair,  but  instead  of  crumpling  before 
it  he  met  it  at  every  turn  and  showed  a  general  improvement  remarkable 
for  its  aggressive  strength.  After  an  alternation  of  games  to  seven-all 
Little's  service  was  won  by  the  Californians,  and  the  next,  with  McLoughlin 
serving,   ended   the   set. 

The  short  rest  that  followed  worked  wonders  in  McLoughlin  and  Bundy 
and  after  an  even  break  to  three-all  they  went  ahead  to  stay,  winning  at 
6/3.  Touchard  had  gone  off  in  that  set,  and  though  Little  was  going 
splendidly,  his  partner's  slump  proved  too  big  a  handicap  for  him  to  beat. 

The  fifth  set  was  watched  with  intense  interest.  By  all-round  superior 
play  the  Californians  managed  to  gain  a  lead  of  4/2,  but  Little  served  and 
took  the  game  for  4/3.  Bundy  followed,  and  aided  by  two  great  smashes 
of  McLoughlin's,  gave  his  side  another  game  lead.  A  long  struggle  for 
Touchard's  service  followed,  but  after  deuce  was  called  three  times,  it 
finally  went  to  his  credit.  It  looked  to  be  all  over  then,  for  McLoughlin's 
delivery  had  been   invincible   for  two   sets. 

The  first  point  was  an  ace  straight  down  the  middle  by  Touchard,  and 
Little  made  it  0/30  by  driving  cross  court  as  McLoughlin  rushed  in.  The 
game  ended  when,  at  30/40,  McLoughlin  smashed  a  deep  lob  some  ten  feet 
over  the  base  line.  Again  at  six-all  the  Westerners  took  the  lead  by  driv- 
ing   Touchard's    service    for    repeated    aces,    and    again    McLoughlin,    after 


38  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

getting  to  40/30,  failed  to  put  over  the  winning  stroke.  Little  made  a 
miraculous  save  of  a  hard-dropping  drive  and  the  game  score  was  a 
moment  later  evened. 

At  last,  when  8-all  was  called.  McLoughlin  had  his  third  chance  but 
his  attempt  to  get  by  was  woefully  weak.  The  match  ended  when  Littl- 
served  out  his  gan^e  to  30.  The  last  point  was  a  drive,  which,  had  it  gone 
by  would  undoubtedly  have  dropped  out,  but  it  was  so  fast  that  Bundy 
could  not  get  his  racket  out  of  the  way  in  time,  and  the  ball  caught  it  and 
deflected   high  up  into   the   backstop. 

Immediately  after  the  match  ended  Bull  and  Martin  took  the  court  with 
the  Doyles.  It  was  early  apparent  that  Bull  was  still  suffering  from  the 
gruelling  effect  of  his  match  the  day  before  against  Church  and  Mathey. 
He  could  not  get  under  way  and  seemed  slack  and  lifeless.  Martin  too 
was  in  far  from  his  best  form,  but  the  Doyles  were  on  edge  and  quick  to' 
strike  their  gate.  The  latter  pair  lacked  speed,  but  that  defect  was  offset 
by  their  accurate  placing  and  bewildering  formations.  The  tactics  of  the 
brothers  were  as  unusual  as  they  were  effective.  Original  positions  they 
certainly  were  and  in  absolute  opposition  to  the  recognized  formations  of 
that  mysterious  enigma   termed    "good   form." 

The  first  set  was  won  by  the  Washingtonians  at  6/3  and  the  second  at 
8/6.  In  the  latter  the  tennis  was  faster  and  all  four  men  played  better 
but  Bulls  service  went  against  him  in  the  thirteenth  game  and  the  set 
ended   with   H.   E.    ("Rol")    Doyle   serving. 

The  third  set  was  a  walkover  for  the  brothers.  In  the  first  four  games 
the  New  \  ork  team  won  only  six  points.  The  fifth  was  theirs,  but  the 
sixth  and   seventh    were   the   Doyles'   by   wide   margins. 

Throughout  the  match  neither  Bull  nor  Martin  approached  their  best 
form  which  was  due  in  no  small  degree  to  their  exhausting  struggle  of  the 
day  before. 

The  result  of  the  day's  play  was  to  bring  the  East  against  the  South  for 
final  honors.  The  meeting  took  place  the  following  day,  Wednesday 
before  a  crowd,  many  of  whom  expected  to  see  the  honors  fall  into  south- 
^""j  \%  ■'  ^"^,  ^"^  convincing  manner  in  which  they  had  eliminated  Bull 
and  Martin.  Though  disappointed  in  that  respect,  they  at  least  had  the 
satisfaction  of  seeing  a  match  that  abounded  in  remarkable  playing  and 
reflected  more  credit  on  C.  B.  Doyle  than  to  either  man  on  the  winning 
team.  ^ 

Paying  easily  and  almost  carelessly,  the  Easterners  went  out  in  front 
and  stayed  there  till  the  first  set  ended  at  6/4.  H.  L.  Doyle  was  the 
weak  point  and  it  was  his  service  that  was  lost  for  the  odd  game  The 
second  set  saw  the  order  of  things  reversed.  Taking  the  net  and  vo'lleving 
at  sharp  angles  and  to  their  rivals'  feet,  the  Dovles  soon  had  a  leaci  of 
four  games  to  one.  The  New  York  pair  tried  to  overcome  the  advantage 
but,  after  a  tie  at  four-all,  were  defeated  by  a  series  of  deep  lobs  and  the 
loss  of  their  position  at  the  net. 

That   setback  spurred   Touchard   and   Little   on   to   more   strenuous   efforts 
d   in   almost   no   time   the    score   in   the   third   set   stood   at   4-love   in   their 
vor.      It  was  then  the  Washingtonians'  turn  to   brace,   but  three  jjames  in 
a  row  was  their  limit,   and  the   set  finally  ended  at   6/4. 

After  the  seven-minute  interval  it  was  at  once  apparent  that  the  South- 
erners had  decided  on  a  new  plan  of  attack.  They  lobbed  continuously 
and  soon  had  Little  badly  off.  Touchard  was  no  better,  and  by  smashing 
out  and  into  the  net  they  tossed  away  numerous  points.  So  successful 
was  the  methods  of  the  brothers  that  they  evened  the  set  score  by  taking 
the  fourth  at  6/1.  •'  * 

In  spite  of  their  poor  performance  a  short  time  before,  the  Eastern  com- 
bination go  down  to  fast,  sound  play  remarkably  well.  The  fifth  set  found 
them  right  on  the  top  of  their  game  and  they  ran  up  a  lead  of  4/1  It 
was  enough  to  win  the  set  and  match,  for  the  next  four  games  were  "won 
by  the  server.

The  feature  of  the  play  was  C.  B.  Doyle's  excellent  all-round  work  His 
service  was  of  the  best  and  his  smashing  faultless.  H  E.  Doyle  s  forte 
was  his  volleying.  He  was  quick  as  a  flash  and  used  a  motion  of  the 
wrist  which  made  it  impossible  to  anticipate  which  side  of  the  court  the 
ball  would  go.  Little  and  Touchard  were  at  no  time  so  good  as  on  the 
previous  day,  although  when  points  were  most  needed  they  were  able  ta 
meet  the  emergency  successfully.  Both  were  far  ahead  of  the  Doyles  in 
ground   play,    and   it    was   that  advantage   alone   that   gave   them   the   victory.

National  Championships  for  Women 

California,  the  land  from  which  all  good  tennis  players  must  emanate, 
upheld  its  reputation  in  this  respect  when  the  challenge  round  of  the  match 
for  men  was  fought  out  by  two  experts  of  the  Golden  State,  Miss  Hazel 
Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Florence  Sutton.  The  meeting  was  the  twenty-fifth 
since  the  inauguration  of  the  event  and,  as  usual,  was  played  on  the 
Philadelphia   Cricket   Club    courts   at   Chestnut   Hill,   June    17   and   following 

By  coming  through  the  tournament  in  impressive  style  Miss  Florence 
Sutton  earned  the  privilege  of  challenging  Miss  Hotchkiss  for  the  premier 
title.  On  her  way  through,  Miss  Sutton  met  and  defeated  in  succession. 
Miss  Dorothy  Green,  6/1,  6/2;  Miss  Elizabeth  Bunce,  6/0,  6/1;  Miss 
Cheston,  6/0,  6/4;  Miss  Edna  Wildey,  6/1,  6/3;  Miss  Adelaide  Browning 
in   the   semi-final,   6/1,    6/2,  and   in   the   final   round,    Miss    Eleonora    Sears, 

From  the  recorded  scores  may  be  seen  at  a  glance  that  the  self-imposed 
task  of  disposing  of  the  other  aspirants  was  not  a  difficult  one  for  the 
California  girl.  Not  one  of  the  Eastern  experts  encountered  was  able  to 
extend  the  former  to  any  great  effort.  Miss  Sutton's  driving,  judgment 
and  consummate  skill  in  court-generaling  was  more  than  a  match  tor  the 
ambitious    Easterners.  ^  ^   ^:^ 

The 'challenge  round  will  long  be  remembered  as  one  of  the  most  excit- 
ing matches  which  ever  took  place  between  women  in  this  country.  Ihe 
play  at  the  beginning  was  somewhat  slow  and  both  players  were  inclined 
to  be  over  cautious,  consequently  there  was  no  real  form  exhibited.  Miss 
Hotchkiss  by  steadier  work  and  an  occasional  ace,  made  when  it  counted 
most,  quickly  assumed  the  lead  of  4/1.  Then  Miss  Sutton,  who  realized 
the  necessity  of  cutting  loose  from  the  careful  style  of  play  she  had  up 
to  that  time  adopted,  hit  harder  and  at  sharper  angles,  with  the  result 
that  she  quickly  brought  the  score  to  4-all  From  then  on  it  see^sawed 
back  and  forth  until  Miss  Hotchkiss  dropped  her  service  at  8-all,  and  Miss 
Sutton  won  her  own  and  the  set.  It  looked  bad  for  the  little  cham,pion 
for  Miss  Sutton  continued  her  winning  play  and  led  at  i/o  in  the  second 
set  Then  the  Berkeley  girl  demonstrated  what  resourcefulness  she  pos- 
sesses by  varving  her  game,  which  was  so  effective  that  she  ran  six 
straight  games  and  evened  the  set  score.  .  ^    ,     , 

The  third   set   found   Miss   Sutton   going  her  best.     It   was   nip  ^and  tuck 
most  of 
from   3/ 
A    mome 

deep^lob  "vas'kifled  out?ight"by 'Miss^HotchkiVs'for  the  next  pmnt,  and  she 
eventually  pulled  the  game  out.  At  7-all  Miss  Hotchkiss  who  seemed 
tiring  rapidly,  put  everything  into  a  final  effort  and,  lasting  just  long 
enough,  ran  out  two  games  and  the  set.  which  gave  her  for  the  third  suc- 
cessive time  the  American  championship.  ,  .  r  ,  .  u  •„„ 
The  doubles  produced  many  very  good  matches  both  filial  teams  having 
their  hands  full  in  reaching  their  positions,  Miss  Sutton  Pl^ymg  with  Miss 
Green,    faced    Miss    Hotchkiss   and    Mi&s    Sears    in    the    match    which    ended 


)f   the   way.   when   suddenly   the   Los   Angeles   girl   rallied  and   ran   out

ment    later    Miss    Sutton    made    it    6/5.    and,    after    a    series    of    hard- 
fought    rallies,    got    to    40-30,    or    within    a    point    of    the    championship.      A

Miss  Sears  won.  In  the  second  Miss  Sutton  and  her  partner  won  by  a 
similar  score,  6/4.  The  third  was  more  one-sided.  Miss  Hotchkiss  and 
Miss    Sears   playing  by   far  the   better  tennis.      The   summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Second  Clay  Court  Championship 

Although  a  trifle  inferior  in  point  of  class  to  the  tournament  of  a  year 
ago,  the  second  clay  court  championship,  which  was  played  on  the  Omaha 
Field  Club's  courts,  beginning  August  s,  was  a  bigger  event  than  ever, 
and  in  many  ways  more  successful.  Players  from  sixteen  States  were  on 
hand,  and  a  total  entry  of  120  in  singles  and  60  teams  in  doubles  was 
recorded. 

The  one  disappointing  feature  of  the  meeting  was  the  default  of  M.  H. 
Long,  the  holder.  He  could  not  arrange  to  be  on  hand,  and  in  his  absence 
the  title  passed  on  to  W.  T.  Hayes  of  Chicago,  who  by  his  splendid  per- 
formances stamped   himself  a   worthy   successor  to   the   brilliant   Californian. 

Others  players  of  high  rank  who  participated  were  D.  Jones  of  Yale, 
H.  G.  Whitehead,  G.  O.  Winston,  the  MacQuiston  brothers,  J.  Armstrong 
and  Percy   Siverd. 

In  coming  through  Hayes  was  easily  master  in  all  his  matches.  Ray 
Branson  of  Sioux  Falls  played  well  against  him,  but  not  well  enough  to 
be  very  dangerous.  Hayes'  first  real  struggle  came  when  he  faced  Joe 
Armstrong.  For  two  sets  it  was  an  even  thing,  but  in  the  third  and 
fourth  Hayes  outclassed  the  Minnesota  champion.  The  Rev.  H.  J.  Ren- 
■dall,  by  a  persistent  net  attack,  took  two  of  the  first  three  sets  from  the 
Chicagoan.  but  his  efforts  were  so  fatiguing  that  he  could  not  continue 
them,   and   Hayes  made   short   work   of  the   remainder  of  the   match. 

On  the  other  side  of  the  draw  Siverd  had  quite  as  easy  a  time  as  Hayes 
had.  He  outclassed  all  of  his  opponents  but  two,  and  in  the  latter  cases 
was  never  in  real  danger  of  losing.  His  first  hard  match  was  with  J.  G. 
McKay  of  Indianapolis.  The  latter  was  brilliant  but  unsteady,  and  Siverd 
usually  came  out  on  top  after  struggles  for  the  advantage.  His  engage- 
ment with  J.  O.  Winston  was  a  hard  one.  Winston's  reach  made  it  hard 
for  the  Pittsburger  to  pass  him.  It  was  only  by  remarkably  clever  lob- 
bing and  then  chopping  short  that  Siverd  was  able  to  win.  His  general- 
ship was  excellent,  however,  and  he  used  his  head  in  the  manner  of  much 
older  and   more  experienced   players. 

Everyone  looked  forward  to  what  seemed  in  advance  to  be  the  match  of 
the  tournament  when  Siverd  and  Hayes  came  together,  but  there  was  a 
disappointment  in  store  for  the  spectators,  who  had  expected  a  close,  even 
fight. 

The  opening  set  was  a  bit  slow  at  first,  with  each  man  afraid  to  let  out. 
Siverd  was  very  cautious,  but  Hayes  was  puzzled  by  the  spinning  chops 
the  Pennsylvanian  sent  back  and  could  not  handle  balls  off  the  ground  at 
all  eflfectively.  At  5/4  Siverd  had  his  chance,  but  Hayes  came  in  and 
volleyed  so  well  that  three  games  went  to  him  in  rapid  succession.  It  was 
then  that  Hayes  discovered  his  opponents'  monumental  weakness,  his  back- 
hand, and  with  a  persistency  that  was  discouraging  in  the  extreme  for 
Siverd,  the  former  plugged  away  at  his  off-side.  The  result  was  a  sadly 
one-sided  victory  for  the  Chicagoan.  In  two  sets  Siverd  won  but  three 
games.  He  fought  hard  for  every  point,  but  it  was  to  no  use  or  advan- 
tage if  the  ball  shot  down  to  his  backhand.  The  return  was  invariably 
weak,  and  Hayes   was  ever   ready   for   it  at   the   net. 

The  value  o-f  experience  and  practice  of  team  work  was  effectively 
demonstrated  in  the  doubles,  for  the  pair  that  won.  Whitehead  and  Win- 
ston, have  been  partners  for  years  and  winners  of  more  than  one  big 
event.  The  latter  pair  were  drawn  in  the  upper  half,  and  after  disposmg 
of  the  Fisher  brothers  and  Siverd  and  Kendall,  both  in  straight  sets,  they 
found  themselves  opposed  to  the  McQuiston  brothers,  a  team,  like  them- 
selves,   for    years    partners   and    with    an    ability    to    work    together    equal    to 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  47 

their  own.  The  result  was  the  best  match  of  the  tournament,  more 
exciting  by   far   than   anything   in   either   singles   or  doubles. 

The  vigorous  hitting  of  Whitehead  and  Winston  soon  landed  them  in 
front  and  for  two  sets  it  looked  like  a  walkover.  However,  the  third  and 
fourth  sets  were  even  more  in  the  Texans'  favor  than  the  others  had  been 
against  them  and  the  fourth  was  theirs  at  love.  The  fifth  set  was  a  fight 
from  beginning  to  end.  At  one  time  the  score  stood  at  6/5  and  40/30 
for  the  brothers,  but  Whitehead  and  Winston  took  the  point  and  event- 
ually the  set  at  9/7.  It  was  as  close  a  battle  as  one  could  care  to  see, 
with  tne  losers  having  scored  two  more  games  and  two  more  points  than 
the   winners.

Intercollegiate  Championship 

The  thirty-first  intercollegiate  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the 
Merion  Cricket  Club,  Haverford,  Pa.,  September  7  and  following  days, 
resulted  in  a  victory  for  E.  H.  Whitney  of  Harvard  in  the  singles.  The 
Crimson's  point  total  for  the  Isaac  H.  Clothier  Trophy  is  now  six.  As 
only  seven  points  are  necessary  for  absolute  possession,  Harvard's  chances 
are  excellent.  Whtiney's  victory  over  A.  H.  Mann  of  Yale  was  achieved 
in  straight  sets,  the  score  being  6/1,  6/2,  6/2.  Dean  Mathey  and  Butler 
accounted  for  the  doubles  for  Princeton,  w'inning  from  their  college  mates, 
Titft  and    Kuhn,   by    7/5,    6/1,    6/3.      The   summary:

New  England  Intercollegiate  Tennis  Association. 

C.  L.  Johnston.  Jr.,  of  Amherst,  won  the  annual  New  England  Inter- 
collegiate championship  which  began  on  May  22  at  the  Longwood  Cricket 
Club,  Boston.  Johnston  eliminated  Oakley  of  Williams  in  the  final  round 
by  the  rather  close  score  of  8/6,  5/7,  6/3,  8/6.  Dartmouth's  champions. 
Harris  and  Nelson,  got  away  with  the  doubles.  Johnston  and  Shumway 
made  a  strong  bid  for  that  event  in  the  final,  after  winning  two  of  the 
irst  three  sets  against  the  Dartmouth  team,  but  fell  off  badly  in  the 
Fourth  and   fifth   sets.     The   summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  57 


Lon^wood  Singles  and  Eastern  Doubles 

For  a  series  of  remarkable  happenings  and  ending  the  twenty-first  annual 
Longwood  tournament,  which  came  to  a  close  on  July  26,  has  few,  if  any, 
precedents. 

To  enumerate  all  the  unusual  incidents  of  the  week  would  require  too 
much  time  and  space.  A  number,  however,  were  the  default  of  Champion 
W.  A.  Larned;  the  winning  of  the  singles  by  his  younger  brother,  E.  P. 
Larned;  the  victorious  career  of  G.  F.  Touchard  and  R.  D.  Little  in  the 
doubles,  and  finally,  the  poor  showing  of  the  Pacific  Coast  trio  who 
participated. 

"Longwood  Week"  was,  as  usi-al,  one  of  sunshine  and  heat.  There 
was  no  bad  weather  to  mar  the  programme,  and,  as  in  years  past,  enor- 
mous crowds  turned  out  daily  to  watch  the  progress   of  play. 

There  was  but  one  bad  feature  o£  the  entire  meeting,  and  that  was  the 
extreme  unevenness  of  the  draw.  The  doubles  was  quite  well  balanced,  but 
the  former  event  was  painfully  lop-sided.  The  upper  bracket  contained 
R.  D.  Little,  W.  J.  Cothier,  N.  W.  Niles,  M.  E.  McLoughlin,  M.  H. 
Long,  T.  R.  Pell,  C.  R.  Gardner  and  G.  F.  Touchard,  while  arrayed 
against  such  talent  were  E.  P.  Larned,  L.  E.  Mahan  and  R.  Bishop  in  the 
lower  section. 

The  play  in  the  singles  was  one  unbroken  succession  of  surprises,  and 
the   doubles,   too,   was   not   without  its   thrillers. 

There  were  a  number  of  interesting  matches  in  the  first  round.  Touchard 
•was  within  a  point  of  defeat  in  his  match  against  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.,  and 
the  veteran  R.  C.  Seaver  had  a  chance  to  demonstrate  his  ability  in  court 
covering  when  J.   O.   Ames  all   but  put  him   out. 

The  feature  of  the  second  day's  play  was  the  meeting  of  N.  W.  Niles 
and  R.  D.  Little.  Little  got  off  well  and  by  really  wonderful  driving  ran 
up  to  5/1.  Carelessness  then  cost  him  a  game  or  two,  and  when  he  tried 
to  get  back  he  found  himself  unable. 

Niles  crept  up  steadily,  and  to  the  amazement  of  everyone,  took  the 
set,  7/5.  The  second  set  was  nip  and  tuck,  with  first  one  ahead  and  then 
the  other.  Toward  the  close  Little  made  the  mistake  of  running  in,  and 
between  weak  volleying  and  being  passed  clean,  lost  two  successive  games 
and  the  match.  It  was  a  splendid  exhibition  of  base  line  play,  but  the 
net  was  severely  ostracized  until  Little  made  the  fatal  attempts  which 
ended   the  match. 

Many  fast  matches  were  played  in  the  third  round,  but  none  more  excit- 
ing than  that  between  Touchard  and  Niles,  which  was  the  morning  fea- 
ture. Niles  took  the  first  set  easily.  Touchard  was  apparently  unable  to 
get  under  way,  but  in  the  second  he  got  a  good  start  and  led  at  4/0. 
Then,  as  on  the  previous  day  against  Little,  Niles  began  an  uphill  climb 
which  ended  only  after  he  had  won  six  straight  games.  He  drove  beauti- 
fully and  continued  his  streak  until  he  led  at  5/2  and  40/15  in  the  third 
set.  There  Touchard  made  a  phenomenally  lucky  backhand  pass  and 
finally  pulled  out  the  game  and  set  at  7/5.  Improving  with  every  stroke. 
the  New  Yorker  kept  right  on,  landing  the  match  at  2/6,  4/6,  7/5,  6/3, 
6/4.  Niles  slowed  up  a  bit  toward  the  close,  being  unable  to  keep  the 
pace.     It  was  then  Touchard  had  his  chance  and  used  it. 

The  big  match  of  the  afternoon  was  the  McLoughlin-Pell  meeeting  and 
it  was  watched  by  an  enormous  crowd.  Pell,  playng  steadily  and  hitting 
hard,  had  the  first  set  won  in  jig  time.  McLoughlin  was  bad  on  ground 
strokes  and  it  was  his  inability  to  effectively  return  the  service  that  gave 
Pell  the  set  so  easily.  The  second  was  the  Californian's  by  virtue  of  a 
net  game  that  was  faultless,   but  the   third   went  to   Pell  at  6/4.      The  latter 


58  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

played  his  best  tennis  of  the  match  then,  passing  his  opponent  time  and 
again  for  aces.  Pell  had  every  opportunity  to  end  the  match  with  the 
fourth,  but  the  calling  of  foot  faults,  when  he  led  at  4/3,  so  demoralized 
him  that  he  lost  his  service  and  with  it  his  chance  for  the  match. 
McLoughin  took  the  set,  7/5,  and  the  fifth  at  6/1.  Pell  practically  gave 
up  in  the  last  set.  He  was  tired  and  erratic,  the  result  of  a  hard  five-set 
doubles  contest  in  the  morning. 

The  fight  between  E.  H.  Whitney  and  W.  M.  Hall  lasted  nearly  three 
and  a  half  hours.  After  winning  the  third  and  fourth  sets,  Whitney  was 
seized  with  cramps,  and  Hall  had  no  trouble  in  running  out  the  fifth  set 
at  6/2.  J.  D.  E.  Jones'  defeat  by  A.  S.  Dabney  in  four  sets  was  unex- 
pected, as  was  also  the  poor  showing  of  W.  C.  Grant  against  W.  J. 
Clothier.     Grant  was  defeated  at  6,  i,   6/1,   6/2. 

Dick  Bishop  showed  his  improved  form  by  eliminating  F.  C.  Inman  in 
a  very  even  four-set  encounter,  and  Touchard  put  young  W.  M.  Washburn 
out   of  the  running  in  a  poor  exhibition  that  lasted  all   morning. 

M.  H.  Long,  who  had  not  met  a  strong  opponent  until  he  faced  Hall, 
advanced  tn  the  fifth  round  by  winning  from  the  New  Yorker  in  straig^it 
sets.  Hair  was  good  on  all  his  strokes,  but  Long's  volleying  was  wonder- 
fully fast  and  true,  and  his  great  reach  made  it  next  to  impossible  to  pass 
him.  F.  H.  Gates  was  a  victim  of  one  of  Dabney's  "on"  days.  The  Eos- 
tonian  whanged  away  at  everything  and  rarely  failed  to  make  his  returns 
count.  Clothier  won  from  E.  Taylor  without  much  effort,  and  Mahan  and 
Larned  won   their   matches  in   straight   sets. 

The  feature  of  the  Friday's  play  was  the  encounter  of  Touchard  with 
McLoughlin.  The  latter  soon  struck  his  gait,  and  going  at  top  speed,  ran 
out  the  first  set  at  6/2.  Touchard  had  not  made  much  resistance  and 
played  indifferently  and  without  snap.  The  second  saw  McLoughlin  forg- 
ing ahead  until  he  led  at  4/2,  at  which  point,  by  placing  deep  drives  to 
the  Californian's  backhand  and  running  in,  Touchard  ran  four  straight 
games  and  the  set. 

The  third  set  was  a  runaway  for  McLoughlin,  After  falling  behind  for 
three  games,  Touchard  virtually  quit  and  made  little  effort  to  overtake 
his  rival.  The  fourth  was  Touchard's  as  easily  as  was  the  third  the  West- 
erner's. He  made  few  errors  and  forced  McLoughlin  to  volley  badly  by 
playing  slow  ones  to  his  feet.  The  fifth  was  a  struggle  that  threatened  to 
go  on  indefinitely,  not  because  the  game  score  was  big,  but  because  each 
game  in  itself  was  of  unusual  length.  Finally,  at  4/3,  Touchard  broke 
through  his  opponent's  delivery  and  after  losing  his  own,  took  the  set  and 
match  by   winning  again   on   McLoughlin's   service. 

Throughout  the  latter  part  of  the  match  Touchard  outwitted  McLoughlin 
at  every  turn.  The  latter's  insatiable  desire  to  take  the  net,  no  matter 
how  short  his  returns  might  be,  cost  him  innumerable  points,  and  his 
service,  usually  so  vicious,  was  on  that  occasion  comparatively  slow  and 
easy  to  control. 

Meanwhile  Clothier  and  Long  were  arguing  the  matter  of  superiority  on 
the  adjoining  court.  For  four  sets  it  was  a  toss-up.  Long  won  the  first 
and  third  and  Clothier  the  other  two.  Each  man  would  have  a  w-inning 
streak,  only  to  be  overhauled  and  passed  a  bit  later.  Long  was  very- 
strong  in  serving,  and  off  the  ground  Clothier  was  his  master  at  volleying 
and  overhead.  There  were  long  rallies  and  hair-raising  gets  by  both  men» 
and  up  to  the  beginning  of  the  fifth  honors  were  about   equally  divided. 

The  fifth  set  was  a  poor  finish  for  so  good  a  beginning.  The  first  three 
games  touched  deuce,  but  in  each  Long  managed  to  slip  over  the  winning- 
point.  The  second  three  were  Long's  by  wide  margins.  Clothier  mis- 
handled what  few  chances  he  had,  while  Long  was  death  to  every  ball 
within  reach.  He  cut  loose  then  and  banged  drives  and  service  aces  galore, 
and   during  the   period    was   credited   with    only   one    error. 

In  the  lower  half  Bishop  and  Dabney  clashed  and  a  five-set  match,  which 
Dabney  was  within  a  point  of  winning,  resulted.     The  latter  was  brilliant. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  59 

but  at  critical  times  was  erratic.  Bishop  was  steady  always  and  at 
moments  of  pressure  capable  of  great  tennis.  Once,  when  Dabney  led  at 
two  sets  to  one  and  5/2  and  40/15,  Bishop  drove  one  so  close  that  the 
white  chalk  scattered,  and  again  Dabney  failed  to  administer  the  coup  de 
grace  when  a  rather  short  lob  was  handed  him  for  the  match  point. 

Mahan  was  way  off  his  game  when  he  faced  Larned.  He  made  a  sur- 
prising total  of  errors  and  failed  to  make  the  best  of  the  few  opportunities 
Larned  gave  him.  The  latter  played  splendidly,  driving  with  great  speed 
and  covering  his  court  in  admirable  fashion.  At  no  point  did  he  falter, 
continuing  his   pace  and  accuracy   throughout  the   three   sets. 

Perfect  weather  and  an  enthusiastic  crowd  greeted  Touchard  and  Long 
when  they  met  on  Tuesday  for  the  right  to  enter  the  final  bracket.  Long 
served  tirst  and  won  his  game  at  love,  two  points  being  service  aces 
Touchard  came  back  in  similar  fashion,  and  then  took  Long's  delivery.  At 
5/3  Long  landed  another  game,  but  the  set  ended  when  Touchard  won  his 
own  delivery  for  the  tenth. 

Touchard  increased  his  pace  with  the  second  set  and  Long  fell  oflF  badly, 
so  that  the  New  Yorker  soon  led  at  5/2.  There  Long  braced,  but  after 
winning  two  games,  dropped  his  second  set  with  the  tenth. 

The  third  was  by  far  the  best  of  the  match.  It  was  an  even  thing  to 
four-all,  at  which  point  Long  raced  ahead  to  5/4  and  40/15.  There  he 
made  two  errors  and  was  passed  twice.  Later,  at  8/7,  Long  was  three 
times   within  a  point   of   winning,   but   errors  cost  him   the  game   and  match. 

Long  was  at  no  time  going  smoothly.  He  seemed  uncertain  as  to  what 
course  to  pursue,  and  Touchard  was  quick  to  make  the  most  of  his  hesi- 
tancy. The  latter  varied  his  game  constantly,  and  it  was  that  feature 
which  Long's   indecision   was  due   to. 

In  the  lower  half  Bishop  and  Larned  played  five  long  sets  to  decide  a 
winner.  Larned  got  off  well,  winning  the  lirst  three  games,  but  Bishop 
caught  up  and  evened  the  score.  The  next  three,  with  Larned  hitting 
harder,  left  Bishop  far  behind.  Improved  volleying  and  driving  gave  the 
Bostonian  the  second  set  at  6/4.  The  third  looked  like  a  walkover  for 
the  champion's  brother.  In  three  games  he  allowed  Bishop  but  two  points 
and  later  led  at  5/2.  Here  Bishop,  taking  advantage  of  Larned's  let-down, 
came  with  a  rush  and  took  five  straight  games  and  his  second  set.  The 
loss  of  that  set  roused  Larned  and  he  went  into  the  next  with  a  grim 
determination  to  make  it  short  and  sweet.  He  was  much  too  fast  for 
Bishop  then  and  the  latter  won  only  four  more  games,  two  in  the  fourth 
and  two  in  the  fifth  sets. 

The  final  between  Larned  and  Touchard  was  played  before  a  record- 
breaking  gallery.  In  view  of  his  success  in  the  earlier  rounds,  the  odds 
seemed  to  favor  Touchard's  winning.  That  he  failed  and  was  outplayed, 
actually  outclassed,  came  as  a  surprise  to  the  majority  of  the  game's  fol- 
lowers. Larned  won  in  four  sets  and  at  no  time  was  in  real  danger.  His 
tennis  was  of  a  kind  to  inspire  all  who  saw  it  and  there  was  no  flaw  or  a 
criticism  to  make  from  beginning  to  end.  No  one  could  have  played  with 
a  greater  degree  of  accuracy  and  pace  combined,  nor  could  anyone  have 
conceived  a  better  plan  of  attack.  Following  terrfiic  drives  into  the  net, 
there  to  kill  with  a  precision  that  was  masterly,  was  his  plan  of  campaign, 
from  which  he  never  deviated.  Touchard  never  had  a  chance  to  really 
start,  for  his  returns  were  smothered  and  he  was  on  the  defensive  nine- 
tenths  of  the  time.  The  match  lasted  a  little  over  an  hour  and  both  men 
were  as  fresh   at  the  finish  as  at  the   beginning  of   play. 

W.  A.  Larned,  who  for  years  past  has  won  the  Longwood  event,  claimed 
the  right  to  default  to  his  brother.  Ned,  and  after  the  latter's  perform- 
ance, there  were  few  to  question  his  ability  to  guard  the  title  thus  thrust 
upon  him. 

No  less  surprising  was  the  result  of  the  doubles  event  than  the  singles 
had  been,  for  out  of  the  mass  of  teams  which  started  off  in  the  preliminary 
round  was  to  emerge  a  pair  who,  though  they  played  together  for  the  first 


60  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

time  at  Longwood.  were  to  finally  accomplish  the  greatest  feat  that  a  team 
can,  namely,  overthrow  the  national  champions  at  Newport  and  earn  the 
premier   honors  in   the   doubles  game. 

There  was  plenty  of  "class"  to  the  combination  entered.  Larned  and 
Clothier,  Gardner  and  Long,  Wright  and  Xiles,  Pell  and  Mahan  and 
Touchard  and  Little  were  formemost  among  them,  and  there  were  plenty 
of   fast   matches   each   day  of   play. 

The  first  round  produced  only  one  contest  of  note,  and  that  was  between 
Clothier  and  Larned  and  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.,  and  H.  Torrance.  The  former 
pair  ran  out  the  first  two  sets  easily  at  6/2,  6/2,  but  the  third  and  fourth 
were  as  close  as  one  could   wish   to  see. 

The  second  round  saw  the  near  defeat  of  Touchard  and  Little  by  G.  P. 
Gardner  and  A.  S.  Dabney.  The  latter  pair  led  at  two  sets  to  one  and 
3/1  before  the  New  Yorkers  pulled  together  and  drew  away.  Pell  and 
Mahan  had  hard  work  to  dispose  of  E.  P.  Larned  and  F.  T.  Freyling- 
huysen,  but  the  rest  of  the  big  men  came  through   with  comparative  ease. 

The  third  round  produced  nothing  startling,  but  in  the  fourth  there  were 
two  contests  that  were  spectacular  struggles  from  their  very  beginning. 
The  featured  one  was  that  between  Touchard  and  Little  and  Gardner  and 
Long.  The  first  set  went  to  Long  and  Gardner  at  7/5.  The  team  work 
of  their  opponents  was  a  sad  afifair.  Touchard  was  the  offender,  being 
slow  to  run  in,  and  covering  only  a  small  part  of  the  court  that  was  his 
to   look  after. 

The  second  and  third  sets  were  faster  and  in  favor  of  the  Easterners. 
By  dint  of  many  expressive  suggestions  and  rules  made  then  and  there  by 
Little,  the  head  of  the  combination,  Touchard  woke  up  and  worked  much 
harder.  The  fourth  set  was  won  by  Long  and  Gardner  quite  easily,  and 
they  continued  to  play  all  around  the  New  Yorkers  until  the  score  stood 
at  5/2  and  40/0,  or  match  point,  in  their  favor.  Touchard  was  serving, 
and,  as  all  through  the  tournament,  his  service  was  weak  and  uncertain, 
but  a  smash  of  Little's  and  two  errors  of  the  Californians  evened  the 
score.  From  that  moment  on  the  latter  team  went  off  and  by  fast,  hard 
tennis  Touchard  and   Little  took  four  straight   games  and   the   match. 

The  second  important  match  of  the  day  was  that  between  Niles  and 
Wright  and  Pell  and  Mahan.  It  was  played  on  a  court  badly  cut  up  and 
in  need  of  attention,  and  the  false  bounds  were  numerous.  The  tennis 
was,  as  a  consequence,  much  below  standard.  Not  one  of  the  four  was 
in  good  form,  Wright,  in  particular,  being  off  on  all  his  strokes.  The  first 
two  sets  went  to  the  Bostonians  and  the  third  and  fourth  to  Pell  and 
Mahan.  The  fifth,  which  was  played  on  another  court  in  somewhat  better 
condition,  went  to  the  Hub  players  at  6/3.  Niles  was  the  best  of  the 
four,  being  good  at  driving  and  serving.  Pell  and  Mahan  had  alternate 
streaks  of  good  and  bad  playing,  but  not  once  could  they  both  settle  down 
in  unison. 

The  remaining  two  pairs  to  come  through  were  Larned  and  Clothier, 
who  took  the  measure  of  Putnam  and  Seaver  in  straight  sets,  and  Bishop 
and   Whitney,   who   vanquished   Grant  and    McKinney. 

On  Saturday  afternoon  Larned  and  Clothier  and  Touchard  and  Little 
furnished  the  excitement  for  the  day.  The  match  abounded  in  fast,  clean 
hitting,  but  neither  pair  was  up  to  the  mark  in  team  work.  Little  and 
Touchard  showed  a  vast  improvement,  but  also  a  lack  of  finish  that  made 
their  game  seem  very  ragged.  Larned  and  Clothier  were  far  worse  in  that 
respect,  clashing  repeatedly,  and  often  leaving  one  side  of  their  court 
exposed.  Clothier  as  unsteady  and  soft,  double-faulting  frequently  and 
volleying  poorly  in  each  set.  Larned  was  very  good  on  strokes  of  all 
kinds,  but  seemed  to  have   little  idea   of  position   or  defense. 

The  final,  played  on  Monday,  attracted  an  unusually  large  attendance  in 
spite  of  the  weather,  which  threatened  showers  momentarily  throughout 
the  afternoon. 

The   first   set  was  even   up  to  four-all,    at   which   point   Niles  dropped   his 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  61 

service  and  Touchard  won  his.  The  second  was  precisely  the  same,  except 
that  at  four-all  Wright  weakened  and  failed  to  win  his  delivery,  and  Little 
served   out  the   tenth   game. 

The  New  Yorkers  kept  on  going  until,  with  Touchard  serving,  at  5/4 
and  30-Iove,  a  ridiculous  thing  occurred.  Eight  successive  times  the  service 
was  delivered,  and  not  once  did  the  ball  tind  the  court.  Four  double- 
faults  and  a  game  thrown  away.  It  was  unbelievable  that  such  a  thing 
could  happen.  However,  the  check  thus  occasioned  was  temporary,  for  the 
New  York  combination  broke  Niles'  service  and  won  Little's  for  the 
following  two   games. 

As  a  team,  the  Bostonians  proved  disappointing.  They  did  not  work 
well  together  nor  individually.  Wright  was  better  than  at  any  previous 
time  in  the  week,  but  Niles  was  way  off  form.  He  volleyed  wretchedly 
.and  his  usually  strong  service  was  noticeable  only  for  its  weakness.  The 
summaries;

New  England  Championship 

R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.  covered  himself  with  glory  by  coming  through  the 
field  at  the  annual  tournament  for  the  New  England  championship,  which 
was   begun   at   the   Hartford    (Conn.)    Golf   Club   on   June    19. 

In  the  challenge  round  Holden  met  T.  R.  Pell,  the  title-holder  for  four 
years,  and  defeated  him  in  five  sets.  Pell  at  one  time  led  at  two  sets  to 
one,   but  Holden  won  the   fourth  at   6/4  and  the  fifth   easily  at   6/2. 

F.  H.  Harris,  the  Dartmouth  player  who  has  come  on  so  rapidly,  was 
Holden's  opponent  in  the  final.  The  first  two  sets  were  divided,  but  the 
third  and  fourth  both  went  to  "Rube"  at  6/2.  His  easy,  graceful  style 
was  a  pleasure  to  watch,  and  no  matter  how  difficult  the  returns  he  was 
called  upon  to  make  might  be,  he  never,  apparently,  exerted  himself  to 
any   great   degree. 

In  tlie  doubles  Harris  had  tetter  luck,  for,  paired  with  J.  G.  Nelson, 
he  defeated,  in  a  long  four-set..match,  W.  C.  Grant  and  H.  A.  McKinney.

Middle  States  Championship 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Middle  States  was 
begun  on  July  2  at  Orange,  N.  J.,  but  failed  to  attract  the  high  class 
men  that  for  years  past  have  competed,  and  was  also  below  the  records  ot 
previous  years  in  the   number   of  entries. 

To  add  to  disappointment,  the  challenge  match  between  W.  M.  Hall 
and  the  holder.  N.  W.  Niles,  came  to  an  abrupt  end  when  Niles  twisted 
his  ankle  and  as  a  result   was  forced   to  default. 

"Hall  in  winning  the  tournament  put  Dean  Mathey  and  R.  A.  Holden 
out  of  the  running.  Holden,  who  had  previously  defeated  E.  P.  Larned 
in  a  pretty  three-set  battle,  was  vanquished  by  Hall  at  6/4,  7/5,  9/7.  Hall 
was  the  harder  and  steadier  and  played  his  best  when  in  the  deepest  holes. 

To  reach  the  final.  Hall  had  for  an  opponent  in  the  semi-final  Dean 
Mathey.  The  Princeton  champion  played  all  around  Hall  for  a  time  and 
was  once  within  a  point  of  victory.  He  lacked  the  steadiness  at  that 
stage  to  bring  off  the  winning  return  and  was  never  dangerous  after  the 
third    set  began. 

The  challenge  match  while  it  lasted  seemed  an  even  thing.  Niles  won 
the  first  set  at  9/7  by  better  driving  toward  its  finish.  The  second  set 
stood  at  4/5  and  40/15,  with  Niles  serving,  when  he  suddenly  wrenched 
his   foot  in   running  back  and  was  forced  to  drop  out. 

The  doubles  attracted  twenty-one  teams.  The  biggest  surprise  of  the 
week  came  with  the  defeat  of  Clothier  and  E.  P.  Larned  by  the  Gates 
brothers  of  Yale.  It  occurred  in  the  first  round  to  the  tune  of  2/6,  6/3, 
8/6.  Bull  and  Martin  found  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.  and  F.  Souther  a  good 
team,  but  after  losing  the   first   set  at  8/6,   took   the  match   at   6/3,   6/2. 

In  the  semi-finals  Torrance  and  Hinck,  a  veteran  combination  with  excel- 
lent team  work,  proved  too  experienced  for  the  Gates,  whom  they  defeated 
at  6/4,  6/2.  Holden  and  Mathey  were  no  match  for  Bull  and  Martin  and 
lost  at  6/3,   6/3. 

The  final  developed  a  big  surprise  in  the  straight  set  defeat  of  the 
Crescent  club  combination  by  liinch  and  Torrance.  Only  the  first  set  was 
close,  and  that  went  to  the  winners  at  6/4.  The  second  and  third  were 
very   one-sided,    for   Bull   and    Martin   won  but   a  singles   game   in   each. 

The  challenge  match  was  as  much  in  favor  of  the  holders,  Hackett  and 
Alexander,  as  the  final  had  been  for  Hinck  and  Torrance.  The  defending 
team  was  too  fast  and  aggressive  for  the  title  seekers  and  won  at  6/3, 
6/2,   6/4.      The   summaries:

Western  Championship 

By  far  the  biggest  and  best  tournament,  from  every  standpoint,  that  has 
"been  held  in  the  West  was  that  for  the  Western  Championship,  which  was 
begun  on  July  22  at  the  Onwentsia  Club  of  Lake  Forest,  a  suburb  of 
Chicago. 

Everything — courts,  weather  and  tournament  management — was  ideal 
from  the  players'  standpoint,  and  the  hospitality  and  entertainment  afforded 
the  visitors,  who  came  from  Maine  to  California,  made  their  stay  a 
delightful  one. 

The  first  match  of  much  importance  was  that  between  McLoughlin  and 
J.  H.  Winston  in  the  second  round.  Winston  was  at  his  best  and  forced 
the  Californian  to  a  deuce  set,  but  was  outclassed  in  the  second.  H.  H. 
Whitman,  brother  to  the  ex-champion,  defeated  Drummond  Jones  with 
surprising  ease   in  the   same   round. 

The  third  round  brought  together  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  who,  with  Martin, 
had  made  the  journey  from  New  York  with  their  eyes  on  the  doubles,  and 
Heath  Byford.  The  latter  played  splendidly,  and  Bull  just  got  by  in  a 
close  third  set.  Waidner,  a  star  for  ten  years  past,  eliminated  Whitehead 
by  6/4,  6/j,  and  H.  C.  Martin  dropped,  by  a  similar  score,  his  chances  to 
Walter  Hayes. 

G.  M.  Church  had  an  awful  time  with  Albrecht  Ludke.  Ludke  was  hit- 
ting much  too  hard  for  the  Princetonian  at  first  and  won  at  6/3.  The 
second  was  Church's  by  6/1.  Each  man  was  within  a  point  of  the  third 
before   Church   finally   captured   it   at   9/7. 

The  feature  of  the  fourth  round  was  the  meeting  of  L.  H.  Waidner  and 
W.  T.  Hayes.  The  two  have  met  often  and  the  results  have  invariably 
favored  Waidner.  Hayes  turned  the  tables,  however,  and  outplayed  his 
famous  opponent  two  to  one.  The  score  was  6/4,  6/1.  Bull  rather  unex- 
pectedly eliminated  C.  B.  Doyle  in  straight  sets,  and  McLoughlin  held  J. 
Armstrong  safe  in  the  same  round.  H.  H.  Whitman  advanced  a  round 
through  the  default  of   Church. 

The  semi-finals  brought  together  Bull  and  Hayes  and  Whitman  and 
McLoughlin.  Bull  led  Hayes  at  two  sets  to  one  when  darkness  ended 
hostilities.  The  next  day  he  defaulted  in  order  to  save  himself  for  the 
doubles.  Against  McLoughlin,  Whitman  failed  to  ^make  much  headway  and 
was  defeated  at  6/4,  6/4,   6/1. 

The  final,  played  on  Saturday  between  Hayes  and  McLoughlin,  was  all 
in  favor  of  the  Californian.  Hayes  was  baffled  by  the  Westerner's  speed 
and  could  do  nothing  with  his  service,  so  that  the  result  was  never  for  a 
moment  in  doubt.     The  score  was  6/2,  6/3,  6/3. 

The  challenge  round  between  McLoughlin  and  Bundy,  the  holder,  was 
fast  and  interesting  from  start  to  finish,  although  the  advantage,  after  the 
first  set,  was  all  McLoughlin's.  He  improved  rapidly  and  was  compara- 
tively little  bothered  by  a  strong  wind  which  blew  across  the  court. 
Bundy's  slower  chops  were  carried  all  over  and  he  lost  control  of  his 
ground  returns  completely.  McLoughlin  was  so  much  faster  that  the  match 
took  on  a  very  one-sided  aspect  as  it  progressed.  The  finish  was  tame  and 
flat.  Bundy,  apparently  realizing  the  futility  of  his  efforts,  did  not  make 
the  determined  stand  it  was  thought  he  might,  and  the  match  ended  in 
McLoughlin's  favor  at  4/6,  6/1,  6/3,  6/3. 

The  real  interest  in  the  tournament  was  aroused  in  the  struggle  for 
doubles  honors.  The  Eastern  event  had  falj.en  to  Touchard  and  Little, 
the  Southern  to  the  Doyle  brothers  of  WasPfifigton,  and  the  premier  pair 
on  the  Coast  had  been  decided  when  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  had  taken 
the   measures   of  all  teams  who   had  questioned   their   superiority.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  €9 

The  Western  title  was  the  last  decided  and  the  remaining  one  to  create 
the  play-off  for  the  privilege  of  playing  the  champions,  Hackett  and 
Alexander,  at  Newport.  The  entry,  accordingly,  was  a  large  one.  Most 
of  the  teams  were  of  men  who  resided  in  the  West,  but  there  were  others 
from  widely  distant  sections,  namely:  P>u]l  and  Martin  and  Church  and 
Mathey   from   New   York,  and  Whitehead  and   Winston   from   Norfolk. 

In  the  first  round  Church  and  Mathey  were  pushed  to  five  sets  by  A.  L. 
Green  and  A.  Squair,  and  Whitehead  and  Winston  -dropped  a  set  to  Neely 
and  Hayes.  The  Princetonians  got  better  as  they  went  along  and,  dispos- 
ing of  Waidner  and   Whitman,   landed  in  the  final. 

In  the  other  half  Bull  and  Martin  got  by  their  opponents  one  after 
another  until  a  four-set  victory  from  the  men  from  Norfolk  gave  them  the 
right  to   fight  it  out  with  Church  and   Mathey. 

The  final  match  was  a  heart-breaking  five-set  affair,  which  hung  in  the 
balance  until  the  last  ball  crossed  the  net.  The  first  two  sets  went  to  the 
Princetonians  and  the  third  to  Bull  and  Martin.  The  fourth  saw  the 
youngsters  at  their  best  and  they  piled  up  a  lead  of  5/1.  The  seventh 
game,  with  Church  serving,  went  to  40/15  before  Bull  and  Martin  began 
to  pick  up.  Steadily,  point  by  point,  they  came  on  until  with  a  rally  that 
was  remarkable  for  its  aggressive  force  and  accuracy,  they  drew  even  and 
ran  out  two  games  for  the  set.  The  crowd  shouted  its  approval  and  the 
encouragement  acted  like  a  tonic  on  the  tired  Crescent  men.  Bull,  in 
spite  of  his  powerful  appearance,  was  all  but  exhausted,  and  at  that  time 
it   seemed  doubtful   if   he   could   continue. 

Though  discouraged,  as  the  youngsters  must  have  been  by  such  a  won- 
derful uphill  fight  of  their  opponents,  they  did  not  show  it,  and  the  fifth 
set  was  much  like  its  predecessor.  The  stand  this  time  was  made  by 
Mathey  and  Church,  and  loud  applause  greeted  their  winning  of  the  game, 
which  made  the  score  five-all.  Finally,  however,  at  seven-all,  Bull  and 
Martin  made  a  last  stand,  and  it  succeeded.  They  took  two  games  and 
the  match,  as  hard  fought  and  even  a  one  as  was  ever  plaryed  in  the  West. 

The  entry  of  Miss  Hazel  Hotchkiss  stirred  up  unusual  interest  in  the 
events  for  women.  That  she  won  her  matches  easily  was  but  fulfilling 
expectations.  Her  opponent  in  the  final  was  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely.  Miss 
Neely   was  outclassed  and   won   only   a   single  game  in   each  set. 

Playing  together  in  doubles,  Miss  Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Neely  captured 
the  event  with  no  serious  opposition,  except  the  stand,  made  by  Miss  Marie 
Wimer  and  Miss  Hoyt.  In  that  match  an  odd  set  was  required,  but  in 
the  final,  against  Miss  Adelaide  Chatfield-Taylor  and  Miss  Marion  Butler, 
the  winners  ran   out  at   6/2   and  6/3. 

Miss  Hotchkiss  scored  the  third  victory  when  playing  with  M.  E. 
McLoughlin.  She  ran  off  with  the  mixed  event.  In  the  final  Miss  Neely 
and   L.   H.   Waidner   were   their  victims   by   a   6/2-,   6/3   score.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  73 


Pacific  Coast  Championship 

M.  E.  McLoughlin's  third  win  of  the  season  came  on  June  26,  when,  at 
Santa  Cruz,  on  the  courts  of  the  Casa  del  Rey  Hotel,  he  became  coast 
champion  for  the  third  time.  The  tournament  attracted  all  the  best  of  the 
Northern  California  experts  and  many  from  the  southern  part  of  the 
State.  Seven  events  were  run  off — men's  singles  and  doubles,  women's 
singles  and  doubles,  mixed  doubles  and  a  junior  singles  and  doubles  for 
men. 

In  the  men's  singles  McLoughlin  and  Foley  clashed  in  the  final.  The 
match  was  fast  and  interesting,  but  McLoughlin  held  it  safe  at  all  times, 
winning    at    6/2,    6/3,    6/2. 

The  challenge  round  between  McLoughlin  and  Long  was  as  uneven  in 
the  game  score  as  the  final  had  been,  but  the  tennis  was  of  a  much  higher 
standard.  Long,  though  not  at  his  best,  was  good  and  the  rallies  were 
frequent   and    brilliant. 

The  doubles  did  not  involve  a  title  as  the  singles  had,  and  was  therefore 
of  less  interest.  Nevertheless  there  was  plenty  of  excellent  tennis  in  every 
round.  Foley  and  Long  won  from  W.  Mace  and  W.  Dawson  at  6/2,  8/10, 
4/6,   6/1,  6/1    in  the   final. 

Miss  May  Sutton  had  no  great  difficulty  in  holding  her  title  against 
Miss  Browne's  efforts  to  snatch  it  away.  The  two  sets  played  were  fast 
and  full  of  long  rallies,  but  Miss  Sutton's  control  was  better  than  her 
opponent's   and   her  shots    had   greater   pace.      The   summaries:

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  75 

Pacific  Coast  Doubles. 

A  great  entry  was  received  for  the  doubles  championship  of  the  Pacific 
Coach,   which   began  July   i.   at   Long   Beach,   just   out  of   Los  Angeles. 

All  the  big  men  from  Northern  and  Southern  California  took  part,  but 
the  final  result,  with  a  man  from  the  eastern  section  comprising  the  suc- 
cessful team,  must  have  done  much  to  alleviate  the  feeling  so  pronounced 
between  the  two  sections.  T.  C.  Bundy  from  Los  Angeles  and  M.  E. 
McLoughlin  from  San  Francisco  were  the  triumphant  combination,  and 
their   victory  was  as  decisive  as  it  was  popular. 

Their  first  match  was  an  easy  one  and  the  second  was  but  little  harder. 
In  the  latter  their  opponents,  R.  G.  Hufit  and  F.  Knowlton,  were  good 
enough   to   extend    lliem.    but   there    was   never   a   doubtful    moment. 

The  semi-final  brought  the  winners  against  Hal  Braly  and  T.  Hendrick, 
Bundy's  partner  of  the  previous  yar.  McLoughlin  and  Braly  were  the 
stars  of  their  respective  sides,  each  hitting  with  tremendous  power  and 
quite  remarkable  control.  It  was  an  exciting  battle  from  beginning  to  end 
and   was   won   at   6/4.   6/4.  4/6.   6/4. 

The  second  semi-final  match  was  between  Foley  and  Hardy  and  Browne 
and   Duncan.      It  went  the   full  five  sets   before  the   San   Franciscans   won. 

The  final  was  a  thrilling,  spectacular  battle  that  attracted  an  enormous 
and  appreciative  crowd.  The  first  set  was  one  of  the  longest  in  Coast  rec- 
ords. It  was  an  even  thing  to  four-all.  at  which  point  the  server  won 
until  14-all  was  reached.  At  that  point  Foley's  delivery  was  won  by 
Bundy  and  McLoughlin.  and  the  set  went  to  the  pair  with  the  next  game. 
Foley's  play  was  the  best  of  the  four  during  that  set.  His  smashing  was 
wonderful,  and  no  more  speedy  or  accurate  driving  has  ever  been  seen  on 
the  Coast.  The  second  set,  in  which  Foley  continued  to  outplay  his  part- 
ner and  opponents,  went  to  him  and  Hardy  at  6/4.  The  third  and  fourth 
sets  were  like  the  other  two,  principally  on  account  of  their  difference. 
Foley  seemed  worn  and  steadily  slowed  down.  Hardy,  too,  showed  signs 
of  fatigue,  but  their  opponents  were  faster  than  before.  The  result  was 
that   Bundy  and   McLoughlin   ran  out  at   6/1,   6/1.      The   summaries:

76  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL. 


Southampton  Tournament 

For  the  second  time  in  two  years,  the  "California  Peril"  laid  a  devas- 
tating course  through  the  Eastern  talent  arrayed  against  it  at  Southamp- 
ton's big  meeting,  which  began  on  the  famous  Meadow  Club's  courts, 
August  14.  The  invasion  was  of  even  greater  fatality  to  the  hopes  of 
some  of  the  Eastern  "ten,"  for  both  first  and  second  places  fell  to  the 
men  from  the  coast.  The  entry  was  an  exceptionally  high  class  one  and 
included    Behr   and    Clothier,   as   well   as   Long,    Bundy,   Pell   and    others. 

The  first  round  brought  together  Behr  and  Clothier,  but  after  a  few 
games  had  been  played  a  storm  put  an  end  to  hostilities.  The  following 
day  Clothier  increased  his  4/2  lead  to  6/2,  but  Behr  improved  rapidly. 
Winning  a  close  second  set  he  made  short  work  of  the  third,  taking  the 
match  at  2/6,  7/s,  6/3.  M.  H.  Long  had  no  easy  time  winning  from 
Schwengers,  the  Victorian  champion,  these  two  matches  being  the  fea- 
tures  of  the   round. 

In  the  second  round  Behr  was  perilously  near  defeat  in  his  match  with 
J.  D.  E.  Jones,  but  managed  to  pull  out  by  some  miraculous  gets  toward 
the  end. 

The  third  was  exciting  because  of  the  Pell-Niles  meeting.  Pell  won  in 
straight  sets  by  the  cleanest  sort  of  fast,  sound  tennis.  Behr  eliminated 
W.  F.  Johnson,  and  Bundy  took  L.  E.  Mahan  into  camp  in  the  ssme 
round. 

The  semi-final  brackets  brought  out  two  of  the  best  matches  of  the 
week.  Behr  was  coupled  with  Bundy  and  Long  found  himself  opposed  to 
Pell.  The  former  match  was  by  far  the  better.  Behr  wasted  no  time  in 
getting  under  way  and  after  establishing  a  big  lead  took  the  first  set,  6/4, 
Still  going  strongly,  the  New  Yorker  got  to  5/4,  but  luck  was  against 
him  and  he  faded  from  that  time  on.  Bundy  got  the  set  at  8/6,  and  in 
the  third  his  clever  playing  so  tired  his  opponent  that  the  latter  volun- 
tarily   stopped    half    way    to    the    finish. 

The  Pell-Long  match  was  closer  than  the  other  had  been.  The  former 
finally  won  the  opening  set,  10/8,  but  Long  was  always  ahead  in  the 
second.  The  third  provided  the  visitor  with  an  awful  scare.  By  careful, 
hard  work  Pell  got  to  4/1,  only  to  have  Long  catch  him.  The  ninth 
game  was  Pell's,  due  to  Long's  want  of  steadiness,  but  it  was  his  last. 
He  became  very  erratic  for  no  apparent  reason  and  Long  took  three 
games   without   trouble. 

The  final  match  between  Bundy  and  Long  was  played  in  a  high  wind, 
which  interfered  greatly  with  the  accuracy  of  both  men.  Bundy  found 
himself  first,  and  while  Long  was  still  experimenting  with  the  wind 
carry,  etc.,  ran  out  the  set  at  6/3.  Bundy  had  completely  mastered  the 
situation  by  the  time  the  second  set  commenced,  and  with  an  exhibition 
of  marvellous  accuracy  and  judgment  ran  six  straight  games.  The  little 
expert  slowed  up  a  bit  then  and  Long  was  quick  to  take  advantage  of 
the  action.  He  came  in  at  every  opportunity  and  by  much  improved  vol- 
leying  took    si.x   01    the    nine    games   played. 

The  fourth  was  fast  and  hotly  contested.  Long  seemed  a  trifle  more 
effective  and  led  at  5/4  and  40-love.  Bundy  placed  perfectly  then  but 
though  he  evened  the  game  score  he  was  outdistancd  in  his  race  for  the 
following  two. 

The  fifth  set  was  of  short  duration.  Bundy  fought  like  a  demon  for 
every  point  and,  though  every  game  touched  deuce,  Long  managed  to 
land   but    one. 

The  sensation  of  the  tournament  was  provided  by  the  doubles  event. 
Bundy   and   McLoughlin   were   undoubtedly   the   logical   team   for   first   place, 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  77 

but,  to  the  consternation  of  their  backers,  went  down  before  the  remark- 
ably line  game  of  R.  Fincke  and  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.  It  was  a  close  three- 
set  afifair,  but  at  four-all  in  the  third  the  Easterner  braced  and  by  faultless 
tennis    won    the    necessary    pair    of   games. 

The  final  round  brought  Fincke  and  Watson  and  the  Larned  brothers 
to  opposite  sides  of  the  net.  The  match  was  fast  and  quite  even  and 
went  the  limit  of  live  sets  before  the  Larneds  emerged  triumphant.  W.  A. 
Larned  was  the  star  of  the  four  and  it  was  largely  due  to  his  perfect 
ground   strokes   that  he   and   E.   P.    were  able   to   win. 

Miss  Marion  Fenno  and  Fincke  had  the  mixed  doubles  event  won  from 
the  start.  No  other  team  approached  them,  and  in  the  final  Miss  Hen- 
derson  and   C.    F.    Watson   were   decisively   defeated   at   6/0   and   6/4.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  79 


Sectional  Championships 


Gulf  States  Championship. 

That  the  South  is  becoming  more  and  more  an  important  factor  in 
American  tennis  was  evidenced  by  the  large  crowd  and  high  class  tour- 
nament which  was  played  during  the  week  of  June  19,  at  the  New  Orleans 
Tennis  Club,  for  the   Gulf   States  championship. 

The  entry  was  an  excellent  one,  including  L.  H.  Waidner  of  Chicago, 
a  player  of  international  reputation;  W.  F.  Johnson  of  Philadelphia,  and 
H.  M.   McQuiston  of  Texas. 

The  semi-final  brackets  were  filled  by  H.  McQuiston  and  Johnson  in  the 
upper  half  and  by  Waidner  and  Phelps  in  the  lower.  The  latter  proved 
to  be  no  match  for  Waidner  at  all,  but  the  Johnson-McQuiston  set-to  was 
a  hummer.  The  Philadelphian  won  the  opening  set  at  6/4,  but  after  drop- 
ping far  behind  in  the  second,  gave  it  up  and  allowed  it  to  go  at  love. 
The  third  was  a  base  line  battle,  in  which  each  man  won  the  other's 
service  up  to  three-all.  At  that  point  McQuiston  took  a  game  by  smashing 
and  another  by  getting  three  successive  net  cord  shots,  not  one  of  which 
Johnson  could  reach.  He  won  the  set  and  match  with  the  ninth  game  by 
clever  serving  to  Johnson's  backhand. 

That  brought  Waidner  and  McQuiston  together  in  the  final,  and  in  spite 
of  the  belief  that  a  close  match  would  result,  Waidner  won  easily  in  three 
sets.  He  hit  much  harder  and  volleyed  at  better  angles.  McQuiston,  on 
the  other  hand,  was  soft  and  rather  unsteady  and  far  below  his  best  form. 

The  challenge  match  resulted  in  another  victory  for  Waidner.  The  1910 
champion,  Paul  McQuiston,  had  no  better  luck  than  his  brother,  although 
he  came  within  a  point  of  winning  the  first  set.  On  account  of  the  late 
hour  at  which  play  was  commenced,  it  was  decided  to  play  only  two  out 
of  three  sets.     Waidner  won  at  9/7,   6/3. 

The  doubles  event  resulted  in  a  great  five-set  final  match  between  Waid- 
ner and  Johnson  and  the  McQuiston  brothers.  In  the  end  the  long 
experience  of  playing  together  proved  enough  to  give  the  brothers  the  win 
at  6/2,  6/1,   s/7,  6/2,  6/3.     The   summaries:

Northwestern  Championship. 

L.  Harry  Waidner  successfully  defended  his  title  of  Northwestern 
champion,  which  was  held  on  the  Minnetonka  Yacht  Club  courts  at  Lake 
Minnetonka,  Minn.  It  was  Waidner's  fourth  year  of  title  holding  and  it 
was  secured  by  a  victory  over  J.  Adams,  the  Minnesota  champion.  Adams 
met  an  old  rival  in  the  final  round  when  he  faced  Paul  Armstrong  and  a 
stubborn  battle  was  waged  before  the  former  pulled  out.  The  score  was 
8/6,    4/6,    6/4,    10/8. 

In  the  challenge  round  Waidner  proved  his  right  to  the  premier  honors 
by  disposing  of  Adams  at  6/2,   7/5,  3/6,   6/3. 

Adams  and  Armstrong  won  the  doubles.  Their  only  hard  match  was 
the  final  against  Ward  Burton  and  L.  H.  Northrop.  The  latter  pair  were 
too  erratic  to  be  effective  at  critical  times.  They  would  succeed  in  a  game 
or  two  of  really  excellent  play,  but  then  came  a  streak  of  wildness  which 
more  than   offset  their   good   work.      The   summaries:

Central  United  States  Championship. 

Tennis  in  St.  Louis  is  mainly  fostered  by  the  Triple  A  Club.  They  are 
recognized  as  the  only  tennis  club  in  the  city,  but  being  practically  the 
only  club  active  in  the  game  of  tennis,  by  no  means  can  it  be  said  that 
they  do  not  encourage  the  game.  They  have  eighteen  of  the  finest  clay 
courts  in  the  country,  which  are  always  in  the  best  of  condition,  every 
court  being  occupied  from  morning  to  twilight  during  the  season.  They 
extend  to  the  wives  and  daughters  of  its  members  all  the  privileges  of  the 
courts  in  the  mornings  and  the  boys  under  eighteen  years  have  free  use 
of  same.  It  is  not  an  uncommon  sight  to  see  the  future  tennis  players, 
ranging  in  age  from  seven  years  up,  playing  in  the  foreno6ns. 

During  the  season  the  club  gives  three  tournaments  open  to  its  mem- 
bers, namely,  the  Inaugural,  in  April;  Mid-Summer,  in  June,  and  the  club 
championship   in   August. 

In  July  the  Central  championship  is  held  under  the  auspices  of  the 
club;  in  September,  the  city  championship  for  women  and  men.  The  inter- 
scholastic  and  the  Sunday  School  championships  of  the  city  are  also  staged. 

The  Central  championship  is  the  big  event  of  the  season  and  attracts  a 
large  entry,  owing  to  the  hospitality  and  fine  prizes  offered.  It  is  one  of 
the  big  events  of  the  country.  Over  one  thousand  dollars  are  presented 
to  the  winners  in  cups  and  the  visitors  are  entertained  at  the  club  house 
while  in  the  city,  and  at  the  end  of  the  tournament  a  banquet  is  given 
them  at  one   of  the  leading  summer  gardens. 

In  191 1  Charles  S.  Peters  and  Drummond  Jones  lifted  the  two  large 
cups  offered  by  the  club  to  the  team  that  would  win  the  doubles  cham- 
pionship three  times,  not  necessarily  in  succession.  The  club  has  made 
arrangement  to    have   them    replaced   ft»r   this   year's    competition. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  85 

Jack  Cannon  of  Kansas  City,  an  all-round  athlete,  captured  the  singles 
championship,  and  he  had  to  play  the  very  best  kind  of  tennis  every  day 
to  win  out  in  the  finals  to  defeat  Roland  M.  Hoerr,  one  of  the  Triple  A 
young  stars   who   is  favorably   known   in   the   East  as  a  coming   player. 

The  big  consolation  cup  in  the  singles  was  won  by  Tyson  Dines,  Jr., 
while  the  Serrano  brothers  annexed  the  consolation  cups  in  the  doubles.

Southern  Championship. 


Connie  B.  Doyle  of  Washington  scored  a  double  victory  for  the  second 
time  during  the  week  ending  July  13.  when  he  won  the  singles  champion- 
ship for  the  South  and,  with  his  brother,  H.  E.  Doyle,  captured  the  doubles 
championship  as  well.  The  tournament  was  played  at  Atlanta,  but  did 
not  attract  the  high  class  of  entries  that  it  did  in  past  years.  In  fact, 
there  was  no  one  in  the  event  who  might  be  considered  a  serious  con 
tender  for  the  title  worn  by  the  Washingtonian.  C.  E.  Smith  defeated 
E.  V.  Carter,  Jr.,  in  the  final  round  in  straight  sets,  6/3,  9/7.  Against 
Doyle.  Smith  could  make  but  little  headway.  Beyond  a  very  fast  twist 
service,  the  challenger  had  no  stroke  which  bothered  the  Capital  City  man. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  87 

On    the    other    hand.    Doyle    took    the    net,    effectively    smothered    Smith's 
returns  at   ease,   and   won,   6/2,   6/4,   6/2. 

The  doubles  event  was  won  by  the  Doyles  hands  down.  Not  a  team  in 
the  field  was  able  to  take  a  set  from  the  brothers,  who  disposed  of  B.  M. 
Grant  and  Carter  in  the  final   round,  6/1,  6/3,   6/2.     The  summaries:

Pacific  Northwest  Championship. 

The  twenty-first  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Pacific 
Northwest  was  held  on  the  grounds  of  the  Tacoma  Lawn  Tennis  Club, 
Tacoma,  Wash.,  August  7-12,  It  was  by  far  the  biggest  event  of  its  kind 
ever  held  in  that  section,  and  included  Miss  May  Sutton  and  Miss  Mary 
Brown  of  California,  and  the  ex-western  champion,  Nat  Emerson,  now 
residing  in  North  Yakima,  Wash.  In  the  men's  singles,  Emerson  reached 
the  final  round  with  greatest  ease  and  Joe  C.  Tyler  of  Spokane  came 
through  the  other  side,  but  not  without  w-eathering  a  number  of  harrt 
matches.  In  the  final  the  match  between  Emerson  and  Tyler  was  quite 
close  and  very  interesting.  It  lasted  four  sets,  during  which  the  old 
Western  title   holder  held  a  safe   lead.     He  won  at  6/4.   6/3.   3/6.  7/5. 

Emerson  won  the  doubles  with  Russell.  They  defeated  Captain  Foulkes 
and  Tyler  in  the  final  round  in  the  closest  kind  of  a  five-set  match.  This 
set  was  a  battle  royal  until  5-all  was  called,  at  which  point  Tyler  weakened 
and    Russell    rallied    sufficiently   to   land   the   two   necessary   games. 

Of  course  Miss  May  Sutton  won  the  women's  singles,  her  victim  in  the 
final  being  Miss  Brown,  who  was  lucky  to  score  the  single  game  in  each 
set  which  was  her  lot.  Miss  Sutton  and  Captain  Foulkes  won  the  mixed 
doubles.      The    summaries:

South  Atlantic  Championship.

tournament  began.  Both  in  class  and  in  number  the  entry  for  this  meet-

score  a  set  against  him.  In  the  challenge  round  C.  E.  Ramspeck.  the

The  courts  of  the  Country  Club  of  Scranton  were  again  the  scene  of 
the  Northeastern  Pennsylvania  championship,  which  Tjegan  on  September 
13.  It  resulted  in  the  winning  of  an  open  event  for  the  first  time  by 
little  Leonard  Beekman  of  Bronxville,  N,  Y.,  a  100  pounder  of  sixteen 
years,  who  shows  more  ability  at  his  age  than  most  youngsters  older  than 
he  and  twice  as  heavy.  Beekman  played  splendidly  on  his  way  to  the 
finals,    where   he   met    P.    S.    Osborn.      The    latter    got   away    with    two    sets

and  seemed  to  have  the  match  in  hand,  when  Beekman  started  in  with  a 
rush  and  quickly  ended  the  scoring  by  taking  the  third  and  fourth  at  6/1 
each.  The  fifth  was  very  close.  At  4-all  Beekman  broke  through  and  won 
the  next  game  and  match  on  his  own  service.  The  doubles  were  won  by 
the  Markle  brothers  from  McClave  and  Brooks  in  straight  sets.  The

Missouri  Valley  Championsliips 

The  annual  Missouri  \'alley  tennis  championships,  held  under  the  aus- 
pices of  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  at  Kansas  City,  Mo.,  were  perhaps 
the  most  successful  during  the  season  of  .1911  than  at  any  time  during  the 
past  ten  years  or  so  that  the  events  have  been  in  existence. 

The  men's  tournament  was  the  tenth  annual  event  of  its  kind  and  it 
attracted  one  of  the  largest  and  classiest  entries  in  its  history.  Of  the 
prominent  visitors  might  be  named  J.  H.  Winston  and  Hugh  G.  Whitehead, 
Norfolk,  Va.;  Paul  D.  and  Harvey  M.  MacQuiston,  New  Orleans;  R.  M. 
Hoerr  and  W.  C.  Brodix,  St.  Louis;  Ralph  R.  Rainey  and  L.  G.  McConnell, 
Omaha.  The  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  was  well  represented  by  Jack 
Cannon,  Herbert  V.  Jones,  A.  G.  Welhener,  Harry  W.  Durall  and  a  num- 
ber of  lesser  lights.  There  were  seventy-two  entries  in  the  singles  and 
over  twenty  teams  in  the  doubles. 

Some  splendid  exhibitions  of  tennis  were  in  evidence  during  the  week's 
play  and  when  Friday  found  the  singles  narrowed  down  to  the  semi-finals 
a  rather  curious  feature  presented  itself,  as  the  four  men  left  in  the  tour- 
ney were  the  two  Virginians  and  Cannon  and  Jones  of  Kansas  City.  Can- 
non was  pitted  against  Whitehead  and  Jones  was  slated  to  play  Winston. 
The  first  named  opened  the  afternoon's  play,  Whitehead  forcing  the  pace 
and  taking  the  first  set,  6/2,  although  not  easily.  The  next  was  also  a 
fight  to  the  finish,  but  Cannon  was  equal  to  the  occasion  and  took  the  set, 
7/5,  after  a  desperate  struggle.  The  third  set  was  all  to  the  Kansas  City 
man,  who  seemed  to  have  his  opponent's  measure,  winning,  6/1,  and  the 
match. 

The  Jones-Winston  match  was  even  more  exciting  and  it  looked  several 
times  as  if  the  Kansas  City  A.C.  man  would  win.  He  started  off  with  a 
rush  and  ran  up  the  first  three  games,  only  to  lose  the  set,  6/4.  Again, 
in  the  second  set,  he  set  the  pace  and  had  the  long  Virginian,  5/1,  only 
to   lose  after  a   heart-breaking  struggle,   7/5. 

This  placed  Cannon  vs.  Winston,  and  a  crowd  of  over  one  thousand  was 
not  disappointed  by  any  means,  although  their  champion  was  defeated.  The 
first  set  was  a  serving  match,  each  player  winning  his  service  up  to  9-all. 
Here  Winston  broke  through  and  then  taking  his  own  serve  won  the  set, 
1 1/9.  This  seemed  to  give  him  confidence  and  he  captured  the  second, 
6/1.  Cannon,  however,  is  a  "Marathoner"  and  his  admirers  were  not 
surprised  to  see  him  go  after  the  third  set  in  earnest.  He  ran  the  score 
to  4/2,  and  although  in  the  next  few  games  he  was  several  times  within 
one  point  of  the  game,  he  could  not  get  the  needed  one  and  Winston 
fi.nally    proved    himself   the    winner,    6/4. 

The  doubles  were  won  by  Winston  and  Whitehead  from  Hoerr  and 
Brodix   of   St.   Louis  in   straight  sets,   6/3,   6/4,   6/2. 

The  women's  tournament,  held  the  week  of  July  3,  was  by  far  the  most 
successful  of  its  kind  ever  played  here.  There  were  over  forty  entries  in 
the  singles,  while  sixteen  teams  competed  for  the  doubles  title.  There  was 
decided  interest  taken  in  the  tournaments  and  the  finals  brought  out  an 
audience  of  considerably  over  one  thousand.  Mrs.  Theodore  B.  Entz  of 
St.  Louis,  who  won  the  tournament,  met  a  worthy  opponent  in  Miss  Evelyn 
Seavey  of  Kansas  City,  who  was  the  winner  of  the  previous  year.  The 
match  was  the  hardest  fought  of  the  tournament  and  it  was  perhaps  gen- 
eralship and  experience  that  won  for  the  visitor  more  than  actually  better 
playing,  as  the  scores  were  7/5,  8/6.  Miss  Evelyn  Seavey  and  Miss  Burmah 
Brokaw  won  the  doubles  event  from  Miss  Patience  Hocker  and  Miss  Janet 
McCrurn    by   scores    of  6/3,    11/9. 

Mixed    doubles    were    attempted    for    the    first    time    in    Kansas    City    the

State  Championships 

New  York  State  Championship. 

The  usual  attraction  the  New  York  State  Championship  meeting  has  had 
for  leading  players  throughout  the  country  was  evidenced  to  a  greater 
extent  than  ever  when  the  entries  closed  on  July  3.'. 
.  Eighty-eight  singles  asi)irants  and  by  far  the  fastest  doubles  teams  that 
were  brought  together  in  any  tournament  of  the  year  were  on  hand  when 
])lay   began   on   the   Crescent   club's   courts  at   Bay    Ridge,    August   2. 

The  singles  draw  was  a  splendid  one,  with  Bundy  and  Pell  the  leaders 
ill   one   half,  and   McLoughlin,   J'>ull  and   Mahan   the   "class"   in   the   other. 

The  doubles  division  was  not  so  even.  The  upper  half  contained  the 
champions,  Ilackett  and  Alexander,  Pell  and  Mahan,  Cardner  and  Long, 
and  McLoughlin  and  Bundy.  The  lower  had  Touchard  and  Little,  Bull 
and  Martin,  and  Church  and   Mathey. 

The  brst  round  resulted  in  some  excellent  matches,  the  best  of  which 
was  that  between  T.  K.  Pell  and  C.  R.  Gardner.  Pell  was  off  like  a  shot 
in  the  first  set,  which  he  won  at  6/1,  but  by  assiduous  attention  to 
'"Teddy's"  forehand,  Cardner  landed  the  second  at  6/4.  The  third  was 
close  up  to  three-all,  but  Gardner  erred  frequently  from  then  on,  and  Pell 
pulled  out  at  6/4.  The  later  preferred  to  remain  back  while  Gardner 
rushed  the  net  at  every  opportunity.  lie  was  brilliant  at  times,  but  at 
others  made  inexcusable  errors.  In  the  same  round  R.  IL  Palmer  had  the 
better    jf  a  slugging  bee  with   IL   L.   Westfall. 

The  second  round  there  was  nothing  to  warrant  attention,  but  the  third 
produced  some  excellent  tennis.  L.  E.  Mahan  engaged  H.  H.  Hackett  in 
an  interesting  aftair.  The  return  of  the  latter  to  singles  play  nearly  cost 
Malian  his  chances  right  there.  Ilackett  took  the  first  set,  6/4,  and  v.as 
within  a  point  of  the  second.  Mahan  stuck  it  cut,  however,  and  was 
rejiaid  by  an  easy  win  of  the  deciding  set.  Church  had  a  close  shave  in 
his  fight  with  H.  C.  Martin.  The  third  set  was  won  at  9/7.  Pell  out- 
classed Palmer,  for  the  latter  was  wild  as  a  deer.  I'ell  was  not  forced  to 
extend  himself  at  any  time.  F.  C.  Baggs,  a  player  of  mediocre  ability, 
created  a  big  sensation  by  taking  a  set  from  M.  H.  Long.  The  latter  was 
good  one  minute  and  bad  the  next,  but  he  so  far  outranked  Baggs  that  the 
latter  was  not  conceded  the  slightest  chance.  W.  M.  Hall  caught  young 
Washburn  on  a  bad  day  and  trounced  him  at  6/2,  6/2,  and  the  remaining 
favoiites  played  true  to  form. 

The  feature  of  the  fourth  round  was  the  Long-Liltle  meeting,  but  it  was 
a  short  aijd  decisive  victory  for  the  Easterner.  Long's  ground  strokes  were 
no  match  for  the  former's,  yet  he  persisted  in  playiiig  drive  for  drive  and 
rarely  attempted  to  gain  the  net.  L.itile's  play  was  sharp  and  true  and  he 
drove  perfectly  from  start  to  finish.  The  score  was  6/2,  6/3.  Pell  had 
his  hands  full  when  he  met  Hall,  narrowly  averting  a  defeat.  Hall's  rather 
slow,  high  bounding  drives  took  all  the  steam  out  of  Pell's  game,  and  it 
became  a  battle  of  lobs  or  "floaters"  which  threatened  to  be  interminable. 
At  the  eleventh  hour  Pell  began  to  hit  hard  and  the  effect  was  magical. 
He  passed   Hall  for  a  series   of  aces  and  took  the  deciding  set  at  9/7. 

A  feather  in  Mahan's  cap  was  his  defeat  of  the  19 10  champion,  F.  C. 
Inman.  He  accomplished  the  feat  in  straight  sets  by  sound  all-round  play 
and  a  remarkable  ne"  attack.  T.  C.  Bundy  started  off  in  careless  fashion 
in  his  match  with  H.  W.  Slocum.  At  5/1  against  l-.im  he  began  to  let  out, 
and  so  far  outclassed  .he  veteran  that  the  latter  did  not  win  another  game.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  101 

The  fifth  round  brought  out  two  fine  matches,  one  the  Little-Bundy  set-to, 
and  the  other  between  McLoughlin  and  Mahan. 

The  first  named  was  a  demonstration  of  ability  and  form  against  Simon- 
pure  generalship,  in  which  craft  emerged  triumphant.  Little  took  the  first 
set  at  8/6.  He  drove  and  volleyed  magnificently,  but  was  a  bit  slow  in 
covering  court.  The  defect  was  a  minor  one,  but  gave  -Bundy  an  object  of 
attack  which  he  worked  to  the  very  limit.  His  whole  game  was  one  long 
change  of  pace.  Short  chops,  deep  ones,  and  low,  deep  lobs  alternated 
evenly,  and  the  effect  gradually  became  apparent.  Little  was  forced  to 
cover  an  enormous  amount  of  ground  and  the  fatigue  of  such  necessity 
gradually  increased.  Toward  the  end  his  strokes  became  very  uncertain 
and  erratic  and  he  allowed  Bundy,  by  errors,  as  many  points  as  the  latter 
actually  earned. 

McLoughlin  evidently  had  underestimated  Mahan's  ability,  for  he  began  i 
their  match  with  some  very  careless  work.  When  he  did  steady  down  and 
try  his  utmost  it  was  too  late,  for  the  gigantic  New  Yorker  held  the  lead 
safe  for  the  set  at  7/5.  The  second  and  third  were  closer  than  the  score 
of  6/2,  6/3  indicates,  for  Mahan  was  dangerous  at  all  times.  In  the  third 
set  he  had  two  bad  slumps  in  which  he  dropped  his  service.  Had  he  main- 
tained the  high  standard  of  the  balance  of  his  play,  McLoughlin  might 
never  have  passed  on. 

Church  made  his  exit  after  his  encounter  with  Pell,  but  not  before  he 
had  given  his  older  rival  a  bad  scare.  He  swamped  the  latter  in  the  first 
set  and  made  a  strong  bid  for  the  third.  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  was  the  remaining 
winner,   he   having  disposed  of  A.   B.   Wadsworth  at  6/4,   7/5. 

The  semi-final  matches,  which  were  the  best  of  five  sets,  were  both  played 
August   10. 

Bundy  and  Pell  were  the  principal  entertainers  and  had  the  championship 
court.  Bundy  led  off  with  a  3/1  lead,  but  Pell,  who  had  not  then  found 
his  gait,  suddenly  came  on,  winning  five  straight  games  and  the  first  set. 
Bundy  again  took  the  lead  and  this  time  managed  to  hold,  it,  winning 
at  6/4. 

The  third  set  was  Pell's  by  a  narrow  margin.  At  5/3  he  dropped  tw» 
games,  but  made  up  for  it  by  winning  the  following  two  and  his  second  set. 

The  fourth  was  exactly  like  the  first.  Bundy  started  well,  jgetting  to 
3/1  before  Pell  began  to  overhaul  him.  The  latter  drove  beautifully  and 
was  not  lacking  in  any  department  of  the  game.  He  duplicated  his  feat 
of  the  opening  set  and   ran  out  five   successive  games  and  the  match. 

On  the  adjoining  court  McLoughlin  and  Bull  were  engaging  in  a  very 
one-sided  battle.  It  was  Bull  who  had  put  the  Californian  out  of  the  run- 
ning in  the  same  event  a  year  ago  and  he  was  undergoing  the  disagreeable 
experience  of  his  opponent's  revenge.  Bull  was  outclassed  and  defeated 
from  beginning  to  end.      The   score   was  6/3,  6/3,  6/3. 

The  final  match  was  not  played  until  Monday,  August  14.  A  big  gallery- 
was  on  hand  in  the  hope  of  seeing  the  State  title  remain  in  a  New  Yorker's 
hands. 

McLoughlin  began  the  set  and  struck  his  stride  immediately.  Pell  won 
only  one  game  and  really  had  no  chance  to  get  started.  The  second  set  i 
was  a  corker.  Pell  began  to  gauge  the  Westerner's  shots  and  by  deep,  fast  \ 
driving  ran  up  to  5/2.  It  looked  like  his  set  then,  but  he  wavered  a  bit 
and  McLoughlin  came  on  with  a  great  burst  of  speed.  At  six-all,  however. 
Pell  forged  ahead  and  annexed  two  games  in  quick  succession.  McLoughlin 
worked  like  a  beaver  in  the  third  set  and  Pell  v.as  unable  to  stop  the 
fussilade  of  drives,  volleys  and  smashes  that  came  from  the  Californian's 
racket.  The  result  was  a  6/2  verdict  in  McLoughlin's  favor.  The  fourth 
set  was  nip  and  tuck  to  six-all.  Pell  had  repeated  chances  to  win,  but 
passed  them  up  time  after  time.  At  six-all  McLoughlin  shot  out  in  front 
and  won  the  set  and  match.  His  work  was,  on  the  whole,  better  than  it 
had  been  at  any  time  since  his  arrival  in  the  East.  He  volleyed  and 
smashed  with  great  severity  and  accuracy  and  his  driving  was  far  better 
than    it    had    previously    been.      His    service    lacked   a   bit    of    its    usual    tre- 


102  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

mendous  power,  but  was,  notwithstanding,  quite  as  effective,  for  it  was 
splendidly   placed. 

The  doubles  began  quietly  enough  with  the  exception  of  the  meeting  of 
Pell  and  Mahan  with  Long  and  Gardner.  The  first  set  w'ent  to  the  former 
pair  at  6,4.  In  the  second  they  led  at  2/0,  but  Long  and  Gardner  ran 
six  straight  games.  The  third,  played  in  fast  waning  light,  found  Long  at 
his  worst  and  Gardner  not  much  better.  Pell  and  Mahan  took  it  easily 
at  6/2. 

The  second  round  brought  together  Alexander  and  Hackett  and  O.  H. 
Hinck  and  IL  Torrence  The  latter  team  came  within  a  point  of  each  set, 
but  could  not  send  over  the  winning  shot.  Alexander  showed  how  badly 
in  need  of  practice  he  was  by  missing  many  shots  which  he  customarily 
kills,  and  Hackett,  though  better,  was  far  from  his  normal  form. 

in  tlie  fourth  round  Pell  and  Mahan  found  themselves  facing  the  cham- 
pions in  the  featured  match  of  the  day.  The  former  pair  started  carefully 
and  by  good,  sound  teiniis  took  the  tirst  set  at  6,  !;.  No  one  was  alarmed 
by  the  fact,  for  the  title  holders  were  often  in  apparently  bad  positions 
but  had  never  failed  to  pull  out.  But  when,  instead  of  living  up  to  their 
reputations,  they  dropped  game  after  game  until  six  had  been  played  and 
they  had  failed  to  win  one,  astonishment  was  unbounded.  Not  since  1907, 
in  which  year  they  tirst  won  the  national  championship,  had  they  tasted 
defeat,  and  it  without  elation  that  the  spectators  witnessed  their  clownfall. 
Pell  and  Mahan  had  played  faultlessly.  The  former  drove  for  ace  after 
ace  right  through  the  middle  of  his  opponent's  court  and  Mahan's  volleying 
was  nothing  short  of  miraculous.  His  enormous  reach  made  it  i)ossible  for 
him  to  return  and  kill  drives  that  looked  like  winners  and  his  great 
strength  made  it  easy  for  him  to  stop  with  ease  Alexander's  fastest  returns. 

Bull  and  Martin,  the  new  champions  of  the  West,  made  a  strong  bid  for 
the  opening  set  of  their  match  with  Little  and  Touchard,  but  the  second 
was  short  and  one-sided. 

The  meeting  of  the  western  pair.  Bundy  and  McLoughlin,  with  Pell  and 
Mahan  was  looked  forward  to  by  all  who  had  watched  both  teams  in  action, 
and  opinion  as  to  the  outcome   was  about  equally  divided. 

Ideal  conditions  existed  on  the  day  of  the  match  and  it  was  about  3 
o'clock  when  play  began. 

The  tirst  set  was  very  even,  but  at  six-all  the  New  Yorkers  fell  off  and 
were  distanced  in  the  succeeding  two  games.  The  second  set  was  all  in 
favor  of  the  Californians.  McLoughlin  was  a  tower  of  strength  on  all  his 
shots  and  it  was  largely  due  to  him  that  it  was  so  much  in  his  team's 
favor. 

Pell  and  Mahan  got  to  5/4  and  40/30  in  the  third  set,  but  the  following 
point,  a  smash  of  McLoughlin's,  tied  the  score,  and  they  were  never  dan- 
gerous from  then  on.  The  set  and  match  ended  v  hen  Peil,  in  an  attempt 
to   return  a  drive,   struck   Mahan  in   the  back  of   the   head. 

Mathey  and  Church  gave  Touchard  and  Little  a  hard  fight,  but  were 
outgeneraled  in  the  pinches.  Their  control  was  at  times  faulty,  whereas 
the  winners,  when  they  made  up  their  minds  to  play,  were  accurate  and 
fast.     The  score  was  3   6,  6   3,   7/5,  63. 

The  final,  played  August  i-.  was  watched  by  an  enormous  crowd.  Not 
an  inch  of  space  was  left  unoccupied  and  the  excitement  was  intense  from 
start  to  finish.  Touchard  began  the  match  with  service  but  could  not  get 
enough  pace  on  the  balls  to  win.  McLoughlin  followed,  but  he,  too.  proved 
ineffective,  and  the  score  was  one-all.  From  that  time  on  the  service  won, 
until  at  eleven-all  Bundy's  was  broken  through  and  Little  won  his  for 
the  set. 

The  second  set  was  another  terrific  fight  from  beginning  to  end.  At  5/6 
Bundy  just  squeezed  through  with  his  delivery  and  later,  at  g'lo.  Touchard 
and  Little  were  within  a  point  three  times,  again  oii  Bundy's  service.  It 
was  their  last  chance  for  the  set,  for  McLoughlin  broke  Touchard's  service 
a  game  later  and   won   tlie   set  with   his  own. 

The    third    and    fourth    sets    were    far    less   even,    but    furnished    a    higher 


srALDINGS    LAWN    TENNiS    ANNUAL.  103 

standard  of  play  on  Touchard's  and  Little's  part.  They  hit  harder  and 
with  even  greater  accuracy,  really  outclassing  their  opponents  as  a  team 
and  individuals.     The  scores  were  6/2  and  6/3.

Maryland  State  Championship. 

Owing  to  the  fact  that  no  players  of  rank  competed,  the  annual  tour- 
nament for  the  championship  of  Maryland  proved  somewhat  disappointing, 
the  event  resolving  itself  into  a  purely  local  aifair.  In  the  final  round 
Fisher  and  Wagner,  two  old  rivals,  met  and  furnished  the  best  play  of 
the  tournament.  Fisher,  a  much  improved  player,  was  too  fast  for  his 
heavy  rival,  his  better  condition  at  the  beginning  of  the  fifth  set  allowing 
a  comparatively  easy  win.  The  title  holder,  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr..  did  not 
defend.      The    summary:

Oregon  State  Championship. 

On  July  17  the  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Oregon  began  at 
the  Multnomah  Amateur  Athletic  Club  of  Portland.  The  entry  of  Nat 
Emerson  and  C.  E.  Foley,  a  San  Franciscan  of  well  known  ability, 
enhanced  the  interest  of  the  meeting  greatly.  The  latter  had  no  trouble 
in  reaching  the  final  round.  He  disposed  of  Wickersham,  one  of  the  best 
local   men,   easily,  and   in   the   final   won   from    Shives   at   6/1,   6/2,   3/6,   6/3. 

Emerson,  in  his  attempt  to  defend  his  title  against  Foley,  showed  how 
badly  in  need  of  practice  he  was.  As  a  player  he  was  a  shadow  of  his 
former  self.  He  won  the  first  set,  6/3,  but  thereafter  had  never  a  chance. 
Foley   won  at  6/1.  6/3,   6/1. 

The  doubles  went  to  Foley  and  J.  W.  Lewis,  a  local  man  of  fair  ability. 
It  was  generally  expected  that  Gorrill  and  Wickersham,  who  had  won  the 
North  Pacific  International  a  week  earlier,  would  have  things  their  own 
way,   but  they  were  defeated,   6/1,   3/6,   6/1,   6/3.     The   summaries: 

Colorado  State  Championship. 

W.  L.  Andrews,  Jr.,  is  the  191 1  champion  of  Colorado,  having  won  that: 
title  on  the  courts  of  the  Denver  Country  Club,  by  the  defeat  of  A.  G. 
McKay  in  the  final  round  at  4/6,  6/3,  6/3,  6/3.  The  event  was  started^, 
on  August  28  and  completed  the  following  Saturday.  Dan  Harker  and 
T.  B.  Townsend,  Jr.,  won  the  doubles,  defeating  Hughes  and  Andrews  iu 
the   final    match. 

In  coming  through  the  singles  Andrews  lost  a  set  to  D.  B.  Knowlton  ir. 
the  first  round,  winning  6/2,  2/6,  6/3.  McKay  had  a  hard  time  witb 
Townsend  in  the  semi-final  round,  winning  0/6,  6/3,  7/5,  6/0. 

Harker    and    Townsend    had    two    close    matches    in    winning   the    doubles,, 
several  of  the  teams  being   pretty  evenly  matched.      The   summaries:

Virginia  State  Championship. 

T.  R.  Pell,  the  well  known  expert  from  New  York,  took  a  spring  trip 
and  as  a  souvenir  of  his  journey  brought  back  to  Gotham  the  Virginia 
State  championship  title,  along  with  several  others.  The  meeting  was  held 
at  the  Norfolk  Country  Club  in  June,  and  though  small  in  numbers,  was 
a  "classy"  event,  indeed.  Pell  had  a  rather  easy  time  in  coming  through, 
although  J.   S.  Taylor   made   him   play  an  odd  set  in   an   early   round. 

The  final  against  H.  Whitehead  proved  a  walkover  for  the  New  Yorker. 
He  won  as  he  chose  at  6/3,  6/1,  6/2.  The  Virginian  was  far  below  his 
average  standard,  which,  of  course,  accounted  for  the  severity  of  his 
defeat.  Against  Pell,  J.  H.  Winston,  the  champion,  did  much  better  than 
any  of  "Teddy's"  other  opponents  were  able  to  do.  The  Southerner,  by 
clever  net  play,  took  the  first  set  at  6/2,  but  Pell  won  the  follov/ing 
through,   the   last   of   which   was   6/0. 

Pell  paired  with  T.  R.  Bogert  in  the  doubles,  and  though  they  won  the 
tournament,  they  were  soundly  whioned  in  straight  sets  by  Whitehead  and 
Winston   in   the   challenge   round.      The    summaries:

Delaware  State  Championship. 

Seeking  new  fields  to  conquer,  C.  R.  Gardner  of  New  York  took  train 
to  Wilmington,  Del.,  and  there,  after  a  series  of  hard  and  easy  matches, 
wrested  the  title  of  State  champion  from  W.  F.  Johnson.  The  tourna- 
ment was   held  at  the   Wilmington   Country  Club,  and   began  June   26. 

Gardner  came  through  his  half  of  the  draw  easily  enough,  and  F.  C. 
Inman,  another  expert  of  the  Metropolitan  district,  had  an  equally  easy 
time.  Their  meeting  in  the  final  was  the  best  of  the  week  and  went  to 
four  sets.  Inman  took  the  first  at  6/4,  but  Gardner,  by  splendid  net  play 
and  the  aid  of  a  fast,  sliding  chop,  took  the  following  three  at  6/2,  6/1, 
6/3,  respectively.  Inman  seemed  unable  to  do  anything  with  Gardner's 
twisting  ground  strokes,  and  his  usually  effective  driving  was  noticeable 
for  its  absence. 

In  the  challenge  round  against  Johnson,  Gardner  was  at  his  best.  In 
spite  of  intense  heat,  he  worked  hard  for  every  point.  The  first  set  went 
to  him  at  6/2  and  the  second  at  9/7.  The  third  was  much  slower,  but 
what  bursts  of  speed  appeared  were  all  the  New  Yorker's,  and  he  ran  out 
at  6/4.     Johnson  was,   as  usual,   deadly  with  a  forehand  chop,   but  his  back- 


116  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

hand  was  not  up  to  the  mark.  It  was  by  placing  deep  shots  to  Johnson's 
backhand  and  running  in  to  kill  the  return  that  Gardner  won  as  easily 
as   he   did. 

The  doubles  went  to  Inman  and  A.  Holmes  without  a  set  being  won 
from  them.  They  outclassed  every  team  that  went  against  them,  including 
the  title-holders,  H.  M.   Tilden  and  A.  Thayer.      The  summaries:

District  of  Columbia  Championship. 

R.  L.  James  sprang  into  sudden  prominence  in  Washington  tennis  cir- 
cles when,  in  May,  he  won  the  championship  of  the  District  of  Columbia. 
James  came  throUt,h  one  half  and  C.  B.  Doyle  the  other.  Then,  for  a 
reason   not  clearly   understood,    Doyle   defaulted   to   James,   and   his   brother. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  117 

H.  E.  Doyle,  did  likewise  in  the  challenge  round.  James  had  the  cham- 
pion two  sets  down  when  the  latter  withdrew,  and  it  is  more  than  likely 
that  the   title  would   have  passed   from  him,   regardless  of  his  default. 

The  Doyles  made  short  work  of  the  doubles  and  outclassed  every  other

Pennsylvania  State  Championship. 

Philadelphia  lias  for  many  years  produced  the  player  to  win  the  Penn- 
sylvania State  championship,  but  191 1  proved  the  year  of  Pittsburgh's  suc- 
cessful invasion,  when  P.  D.  Siverd,  a  player  who  has  improved  remarkably 
in   two   short   seasons,   took   the   title   away   from   Wallace   F.   Johnson. 

The  meeting  began  on  June  5  at  the  Merion  Cricket  Club  of  Haverford. 
Siverd  in  winning  exhibited  splendid  form,  defeating,  in  succession,  F.  C. 
Inman  and  R.  H.  Palmer,  and  in  the  final  round  F.  G.  Anderson.  Johnson 
was  no  match  for  the  Smoky  City  champion  and  lost  his  title  and  the 
challenge  match  at  8/6,   9/7,   6/2. 

The  doubles  title  also  changed  hands,  when  H.  M.  Tilden  and  A.  D. 
Thayer  downed  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.  and  E.  B.  Dewhurst.  The  younger 
team  had  a  wide  margin  at  the  end  of  each  set,  except  the  second,  which 
Carpenter  and  Dewhurst  won  at    10/8.     The  summaries:

West  Virginia  State  Championship. 

The  sixth  annual  invitation  tennis  tournament  for  the  championship  of 
West  Virginia  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Parkersburg  Country  Club, 
August  21,  22  and  23,  191 1.  Each  succeeding  year  seems  to  be  more  pro- 
ductive of  interest  and  enthusiasm  than  its  predecessor  and  the  splendid 
entry  list,  together  with  ideal  weather  and  high  class  tennis,  made  this 
tournament  the  most  successful  one  in  the  history  of  the  club.  Besides 
the  numerous  informal  affairs  arranged  for  the  visiting  players,  they  were 
royally  entertained  on  the  evening  of  the  second  day  at  a  large  banquet, 
and  the  brilliant  club  dance  on  the  evening  of  the  third  day  marked  a 
fitting  close  of  the  tennis  season.  In  the  singles  event  the  championship 
was  carried  away  by  Everett  Drennen  of  Fairmont,  W.  Va.,  who  success- 
fully defended  in  the  challenge  round  against  Phil  Laughlin  of  Wheeling, 
and  by  his  finished  and  aggressive  play  won  in  straight  sets  by  a  score  of 
6/4.  6/3,  6/2.  However,  great  credit  is  due  to  Mr.  Laughlin  for  his  clever 
and  consistent  play  throughout  the  tournament  and  it  made  quite  an 
impression  among  the  followers  of  the  game.  The  doubles  championship 
was  won  by  R.  A.  Johnson  and  J.  A.  Shrewsbury  of  Parkersburg  against 
Messrs.  Washington  and  Lawrence  of  Charleston.  The  tennis  committee 
consists  of  R.  A.  Johnson,  chairman;  J.  A.   Shrewsbury  and  E.   R.  Kingsley.

Illinois  State  Championship. 

Walter  T.  Hayes  strengthened  his  claim  to  recognition  as  th*  strongest 
player  of  the  Middle  West,  when,  in  August,  he  successfully  defended  his 
title  of  Illinois  champion  against  his  challenger,  Albrecht  Ludke.  The 
event  was  held  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  Aztec  Tennis  Club  (ni  Chicago. 
The  entry  was  a  record-breaker  and  included  -all  the  best  men  of  that 
section  of  the  country.  In  the  first  round  W.  Wilkens  upset  Heath 
Byford.  The  latter,  one  of  Chicago's  best  men,  was  a  bit  off  his  stroke 
and  Wilkens,  who  is  famous  for  his  hard  hitting,  won  easily  at  6/2,  6/3. 
Ludke  and  Wilkes,  old  rivals,  met  in  the  third  round  and,  contrary  to 
expectations,  Ludke  won  in  two  sets.  The  semi-final  brought  together 
Ludke  and  C.  C.  Collier  and  C.   S.  Peters  against  E.  Morley.     The  results 


128  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

were  quick  wins  by  Ludke  and  Peters.  They  outclassed  their  respective 
opponents   and  both    won   in   straight   sets. 

The  final  was  disappointing.  In  19 lo  Ludke  and  Peters  had  a  great 
match,  but  the  meeting  in  question  was  slow  and  uninteresting.  Peters 
was  no  match  for  the  German  expert  and  lost  at  6/3,  6/3,  6/2.  Morley 
and  Ludke  won  the  doubles.  Their  hardest  match  was  in  the  semi-final 
where  they  faced  Hayes  and  Peters,  but  even  the  latter  two  could  not 
press   them   very   hard. 

Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely  won  the  women's  singles,  defeating  Miss  Edith 
Paradise  in  the  final,  and  taking  the  title  by  default  from  Miss  Miriam 
Steever,  who  was  in  Europe  at  that  time.     The  summaries:

North  Dakota  State  Championship. 

North  Dakota  held  its  championship  during  the  week  of  July  10  at  the 
Town  and  Country  Club  of  Grand  Forks.  As  usual  the  Red  River  Valley

in  the  defeat  of  the  champion,  E.  S.  Read,  by  F.  W.  Leistikow  of  Win- 
nipeg. An  unusual  score  was  recorded,  for  although  the  match  went  five 
sets  Leistikow  won  three  at  love.  The  score  was  6/0,  3/6,  3/6,  6/0,  6/0.

The  annual  championship  for  the  State  of  Rhode  Island  came  to  an  end 
late  in  June.  E.  T.  Gross,  for  years  one  of  the  State's  top-notchers, 
annexed  the  championship  in  both  singles  and  doubles.  Gross  played  with 
J.  D.  E.  Jones  in  doubles  and  the  two  outclassed  all  the  teams  they  faced.

winning    the    opening    set    was    outplayed    completely.      The    summaries:

Massachusetts  State  Champiohship. 

Next  to  Beals  Wright,  N.  W.  Niles  is  probably  the  best  player  in 
Massachusetts,  and  that  the  State  title  should  fall  to  him  again  is  as  it 
should  be.  He  did  not  prove  his  superiority  very  decisively,  however,  and 
for  a  time  it  looked  very  much  as  though  his  laurels  were  on  the  verge 
3f  departing,  for  that  sturdy  little  veteran,  F.  J.  Sulloway,  forced  him  to 
a  very   close  five-set   match   in  the   challenge   round. 

The  tournament  is  decided  at  a  time,  June  10,  when  few  players  are  in 
good  form.  Longwood  was  the  battle-ground  as  usual,  and  the  entry  was 
substantially   the   same   that   it   had   been   for   years. 

The  surprise  of  the  meeting  was  E.  T.  Dana's  first  round  with  Har- 
vard's champion,  E.  H.  Whitney.  The  latter  was  in  anything  but  top 
form,  and  the  steady  get-back  game  played  by   Dana  won  out. 

The  fifth  round,  in  which  four  matches  were  scheduled,  was  marred 
by  three  defaults.  In  the  only  match  that  was  played  Sulloway  defeated 
A.    S.   Dabney,  Jr.,  in  two  sets  at  6/4,  6/0. 

The  semi-final  resulted  in  Dick  Bishop's  win  from  H,  I.  Forster  and 
SuUoway's  crushing  defeat  of  Dana,  in  which  the  latter  won  but  two 
games.  Bishop  looked  as  though  he  might  get  away  with  Sulloway  in 
the  final,  but  after  winning  the  first  set  was  outplayed  completely.  Sullo- 
way won  at  4/6,   7/5,   6/2,   6/3. 

In  the  challenge  round  Niles  was  very  erratic.  He  came  in  constantly, 
but  between  passing  and  volleying  poorly  made  little  headway.  Sullo- 
way won  the  first  set  at  io/8  and  the  third  6/3.  The  fourth  and  fifth 
were  faster  and  saw  Niles  much  improved.  He  had  better  control  and 
volleyed  short  and  at  sharp  angles.  Sulloway  covered  Niles  in  going  for 
the  ball,  but  his  earnestness  got  him  nothing  in  the  end.  The  score  was 
8/10,   6/4,   3/6,  6/2,  6/2.     The   summaries:

Massachusetts  State  Doubles. 

The  tennis  season  in  Boston  was  ushered  in  by  the  tournament  for  the 
State  champion  of  Massachusetts,  which  was  played  at  the  Brae  Burn 
Club.  B.  C.  Wright  and  F.  J.  Sulloway  renewed  their  partnership  and 
had  little  trouble  in  winning  the  tournament.  In  the  final,  Seaver  and 
Putnam  were  downed  in  four  sets,  but  the  defending  pair,  Niles  and  Dab- 
ney, were  even  easier  for  the  challenging  team.  Wright  and  Sulloway

Texas  State  Championship. 

Semp  Russ  proved  the  fallacy  of  the  "can't  come  back"  theory  on  June 
19,  when  at  the  San  Antonio  Country  Club  he  regained  the  ■  Texas  State 
title  and  dethroned  no  less  a  person  than  H.  M.  McQuiston.  The  match 
which  placed  Russ  on  the  tennis  map  for  the  second  time  was  an  interesting 
five-set  affair.  McQuiston  held  his  own  for  four  sets,  but  in  the  fifth  his 
opponent's  sl'illful  net  work  was  too  much  for  him  and  he  scored  only  a 
single    game. 

Russ  played  with  Walthall  in  the  doubles  and  there  again  he  proved  his 
class.  McQuiston  and  Payne  made  a  bid  for  the  title,  but  the  rock  in  the 
road  bobbed  up  in  Russ  and  his  partner  in  the  final  round  and  they  were 
defeated  at   6/1,    7/5,    5/7,   6/1.      The    summaries:

Florida  State  Championship. 

On  February  24  Percy  Siverd  annexed  the  third  annual  State  cham- 
pionship of  Florida,  which  is  played  on  the  courts  of  the  Royal  Poinciana 
Hotel  at  Palm  Beach,  neither  B.  Wright,  who  won  the  event  in  1910,  nor 
G.  M.  Church,  who  succeeded  him  the  following  year,  were  on  hand,  and 
the  result  was  a  meeting  in  the  final  between  Siverd  and  A,  S.  Dabney  of 
Boston,   to  settle  the  holding  of  the  State  title. 

There  were  a  number  of  good  men  entered  and,  next  to  the  finalist,, 
young  Ralph  Racey,  a  local  player,  showed  greater  ability  than  the  balance 
of  the  field.  He  forced  Siverd  to  a  close  three-set  match,  in  which  he 
won  the  first  set,  6/4,  and  lost  the  following  two  by  the  same  score. 
Siverd  scored  his  victory  over  Dabney  in  the  final  at  6/4,  6/4,  0/6,  6/3,

California  State  Championship. 

The  eleventh  annual  championship  for  the  State  of  California  began  on 
November  29  on  the  University  of  California  courts  at  Berkeley.  While 
the  entry  was  not  a  big  one,  it  was  sprinkled  with  players  of  national 
reputation.  Herbert  Long,  brother  of  the  young  internationalist,  won  the 
singles,  but  had  the  time  of  his  life  in  disposing  of  B.  H.  Batkin  It  was 
only  the  former's  beautiful  dribbing  that  enabled  him  to  pull  out  the  third 
set  at  9/7.  The  challenge  round  between  Herbert  and  Melville  Long  was 
^T  ,,  M^,'^,^^  r^"^'^'.'^^'^^'^^^'  though  interesting  while  it  lasted,  was  much  in 
Mellville  s  favor  from  start  to  finish.  The  brothers  have  played  together 
so  often  that  each  is  aware  of  the  other's  limitations  and  it  was  Melville's 
greater  versatility  that  gave  him  such  a  big  advantage  over  his  more 
methodical    brother. 

C.  F;oley  and  Herbert  Long  won  the  doubles,  defeating  Berry  and 
Lvans  in  the  semi-final  in  straight  sets  and  Reuben  Hunt  and  J.  C.  Rohlis

Michigan  State  Championship. 

A  new  champion  was  created  when  Richard  H.  Doughty  annexed  the 
championship  singles  from  Charles  O.  Benton,  of  Cleveland,  Ohio,  the 
previous  holder  of  the  Michigan  title,  in  straight  sets.  Doughty  is  a  new- 
comer in  Michigan  tennis  and  there  is  apparently  no  doubt  of  hs  superi- 
ority to  most  if  not  all  of  the  State  experts.  Playing  with  Ford,  whom 
he  had  defeated  in  the  final  of  the  singles,  Doughty  won  the  doubles  cham- 
pionship from  Corey  and  Leidy.  The  match  was  a  close  one,  three  of  the 
four  sets  played  going  to  deuce.  The  event,  which  began  on  August  28, 
was  successful  from  every  standpoint  and  was  by  far  the  biggest  which 
had  ever  been   played  off  in  Detroit.

Oklahoma  State  Championship. 

Fifty-two  entries  in  singles  and  twenty-four  doubles  teams  broke  all 
records  for  the  Oklahoma  State  championship,  which  began  August  22. 
Charles  Speice  met  and  defeated  Harry  Southard  in  the  final  round  of  the 
singles.  Southard  got  off  well,  winning  the  first  set  at  6/2,  but  the  set- 
back acted  as  a  tonic  on  Speice,  who  came  on  with  a  rush  and  won  at 
6/3,    6/2,   6/2. 

Speice  and  his  partner,  John  G.  Bailey,  were  much  too  fast  for  Southard 
and  Fleming,  whom  they  met  in  the   doubles.     The  summaries:

Tennessee  State  Championship. 

B.  E.  Cornelius  of  Memphis  displaced  Champion  Cowan  Rodgers  in  the 
■challenge  round  of  the  Tennessee  State  championship  tournament,  which 
was  begun  on  June  26  at  the  Memphis  Tennis  Club.  Cornelius  took  his 
title  by  default,  but  in  winning  the  tournament  proved  his  right  to  bear 
the  burden  of  a  State's  premier  honors.  He  had  several  close  matches, 
but  none  to  compare  with  his  five-set  battle  against  W.  C.  Alexander  in 
the  final  round.  The  latter  won  two  of  the  first  three  sets  and  was  within 
•a  few  points  of  the  fourth.  The  fifth  was  close,  but  went  to  Cornelius  at 
6/4.  Ehlers  and  Cornelius  won  the  doubles  tournament,  but  lost  the 
challenge  round  to  the  title  holders,  Hardy  and  Cooper,  in  a  close  five-set 
affair.     The  summaries:

Connecticut  State  Championship. 

F.  C.  Inman  retained  his  title  of  Connecticut  State  champion  in  spite 
of  C.  L.  Johnston's  efforts  to  take  it  from  him.  As  usual,  the  tournament 
was  played  at  the  Litchfield  Club  the  week  of  July  10.  Johnston  came 
through  the  singles  in  good  style,  although  he  had  a  close  match  with  Dr. 
P.  B.  Hawk,  in  the  semi-final  and  another  in  the  final  with  young  Vander- 
bilt  Ward.  He  defeated  Hawk  7/5,  8/6,  and  Ward  2/6,  6/3,  6/4,  8/6. 
Against  Inman  Johnston,  though  he  won  the  second  set  at  11/9,  failed  to 
make  much  headway.  The  latter's  hard  drives  and  service  made  big  holes 
through  the  Amherst  player's  court  and  he  won  three  sets  fairly  easily  at 
6/3,  6/3,  6/2.  F.  M.  Watrous  and  W.  S.  Anderson  won  the  doubles,  defeat- 
ing Dr.  Hawk  and  C.  A.  Lindley  in  the  final  at  4/6,  7/5,  10/8,  6/2.  The

Iowa  State  Championship. 


The  sixth  annual  tournament  for  the  Iowa  State  championship  was  held 
on  the  Golf  and  Country  Club  courts  of  Des  Moines,  commencing  August 
14.  R.  L.  Branson  of  South  Dakota  won  the  tournament  and  challenged 
F.  W.  Bradley  for  the  latter's  title  and  defeated  him  in  three  straight 
sets,  6/4,  6/3,  6/3.  Oilman  and  Carey,  the  19 10  doubles  holders,  were 
unable  to  defend  their  title  and  it  thus  passed  to  Branson  and  Young. 
The  principal  match  of  the  week  was  that  between  Branson  and  Hoerr  in 
the  final  round.  It  was  a  great  contest,  as  close  as  one  could  wish  to  see.

held  the  title  in  1909.  Adams  had  taken  it  from  him  in  191  o  and  it  was 
generally  thought  that  he  would  succeed  in  retaining  it.  It  was  therefore 
with  considerable  surprise  that  the  spectators  saw  little  Armstrong  com- 
pletely outclass  his  old-time  rival.  Armstrong  in  coming  through  the 
tournament  did  not  lose  a  set  and  his  playing  from  the  first  day  on  was 
such  an  improvement  over  his  performances  of  a  year  ago  that  it  was 
remarkable.  In  the  final  of  the  doubles  Armstrong,  playing  with  Ward 
Burton,  won  a  four-set  match  from  Payne  and  Wheeler,  6/4,  5/7,  6/0,  6/3.

Arkansas  State  Championship. 

The  Little  Rock  Country  Club  was  again  the  scene  of  the  annual 
Arkansas  State  championship  and  September  25  was  the  date  of  the 
beginning  of  the  meeting.  Ralph  Payne  of  Texarkana  won  the  champion- 
ship in  singles,  when  he  defeated  Harry  Munz  in  the  linal  round  at  11/9, 
3/6,  6/0,  6/1.  Payne  played  splendidly  toward  the  end  of  the  match, 
serving  and  driving  with  remarkable  speed.  These  two  combined  in  the 
doubles  and  won  that  event  easily.  Alexander  and  Hannay  who  met 
them   in   the   final   match   were   outclassed   completely.      The    summaries:

Metropolitan  Championship 

^  In  a  meeting  which  was  remarkable  for  its  form  reversals  and  surpris- 
ing results,  Fred  C.  Inman  won  the  Metropolitan  Championship  for  the 
second  time  in  three  years,  in  191 1.  The  tournament  was  played,  as  usual, 
at  the  upper  .grounds  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  of  New  York,  begin- 
ning June   17. 

Though  not  to  be  compared  in  class  with  the  same  event  of  a  year  ago, 
which  was  won  by  W.  A.  Larned,  there  were  a  number  of  good  men  in 
It,  including  the  winner,  Inman,  C.  R.  Gardner,  G.  F.  Touchard,  W.  M. 
Hall,  L.  E.  Mahan  and  K.  H.  Behr.  The  doubles  was  decidedly  better, 
and  had,  among  other  good  teams,  N.  W.  Niles  and  B.  C.  Wright  of 
Boston. 

The  luck  of  the  draw  brought  two  of  the  best  men  together  in  the  first 
round,  namely,  C.  R.  Gardner  and  G.  F.  Touchard.  Gardner  won  in  a 
match  which  was  noteworthy  only  for  its  length,  all  three  sets  going  to 
deuce.  A  decided  upset  occurred  in  the  same  round  when  G.  C.  Shafer 
eliminated  K.  H.  Behr.  The  latter  was  very  wild,  and  Shafer,  who  was 
steady  and   sure,   made   fewer   errors  by   half  than   his   famous   opponent 

The  next  surprising  feature  appeared  in  the  defeat  of  W.  M.  Washburn 
^j  i.  ^"  \oshell.  The  latter's  hard  hitting  swept  Washburn  off  his  feet 
and   he   made  a   poor   showing  against  the   Brooklyn   man. 

In  a  later  round  an  interesting  meeting  took  place  between  L.  E.  Mahan 
and  Inman.  Th-  gigantic  West  Sider  was  apparently  in  control  of  the 
situation  when  darkness  ended  play.  He  led  at  6/3  and  3/0,  but  the 
following  day  Inman  took  six  straight  games  and  the  deciding  set  later  at 
6/4.  He  was  much  improved,  while  in  Mahan's  case  the  interval  seemed 
to   have   thrown   him   way   off   his   game. 

Dean  Mathey  won  from  F.  Gates  after  dropping  the  first  set,  and 
Church  did  the  same  in  his  match  with  Dr.  E.  Taylor.  A.  S  Stillman 
won  from  Hugh  Tallant,  and  Shafer  made  short  work  of  C.  R.  Leonard, 
after  the  latter  had  defeated  H.  J.  Mollenhauer.  Two  veterans  met  when 
E.  P.  Fisher  and  C.  W.  Leonard  clashed,  but  Leonard  got  away  with  the 
deciding  set. 

Hall  sprung  a  surprise  in  the  fourth  round  by  putting  C.  R.  Gardner 
out  of  the  running,  but  failed  to  maintain  the  high  standard  he  set  for 
himself  by  losing  in  the  semi-final  to  Shafer.  The  latter  gained  his  place 
by  disposing  of  Church.  Inman  outclassed  Leonard  in  their  match,  and 
Mathey   coupled    with    him   by   smothering   Stillman. 

The  Inman-Mathey  set-to  was  one  of  the  best  of  the  week.  Inman 
struck  his  gait  first  and  ran  out  the  first  set  at  6-3.  Mathey  took  the 
second,  6/2,  but  the  third  was  Inman  all  the  way.  He  "hit  harder  and 
was  more   accurate,  and   Mathey   was   credited    with   but   one   game. 

The  final  between  Inman  and  Shafer  was  fast,  interesting  tennis  from 
beginning  to  end.  Inman  was  the  first  to  get  going  and  by  beautiful 
driving  took  two  sets  easily.  He  passed  Shafer  forehand  and  back- 
hand with  the  greatest  ease  and  for  the  time  being  outclassed  him  com- 
pletely. The  third  set  found  Shafer  getting  stronger,  while  Inman  seemed 
to  have  tired  from  his  early  efforts.  The  former  won  at  7/5,  but  it  was 
no  easy  task.  After  the  rest  Inman  appeared  greatly  refreshed,  and  play- 
ing perfect  tennis,  ran  out  the  fourth  set  at  love.  Shafer  never  had  a 
chance,   for  no  matter  what  he  attempted,  Inman  met  him  with   something 

The  doubles  produced  a  good  match  in  the  first  round,  when  Wright 
and  Niles  played  Mahan  and  Touchard.  The  latter  put  up  an  unexpectedly 
f-J^'^^rr^l^^^'  ^"^  ^fter  being  led  at  3/0  in  the  third  set,  ran  it  out  at 
6/4.      ihe  best  meeting,   however,   was  between  C.   R.   Gardner  and  H.   H. 


154  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

Hackett  and  W.  A.  and  E.  P.  Larned.  After  set-all  had  been  reached  the 
former,  by  brilliant  all-round  play,  got  to  5/0  and  40/0,  but  W.  A.  Larned, 
who  was  serving,  pulled  that  game  out  and  another  before  relinquishing 
his  chances.     The   score  was  3/6,   6/2.. 

The  winners  of  that  match  had  little  time  to  gloat  over  their  victory, 
however,  for  in  the  very  next  round  they  were  decisively  trounced  by 
Behr  and  Little.  Little  played  magnificently,  and  Behr,  too,  was  in  good 
form,  so  that  Hackett  and  Gardner,  who  were  a  shade  below  par,  made  a 
sorry  showing. 

In  the  upper  half  of  the  semi-final  Touchard  and  Mahan  had  hard  work 
in  defeating  O.  H.  Hinck  and  H.  Torrance,  but  Behr  and  Little,  after 
dropping  the  second  set  at  14/12,  took  the  deciding  one  at  6/2  from  W, 
Rosenbaum  and   B.   M.   Phillips. 

The  final  match  upset  calculations  by  going  to  Mahan  and  Touchard  in 
four  sets.  No  one  expected  them  to  win,  but  Mahan  was  a  tower  of 
strength  at  serving,  volleying  and  overhand,  while  Touchard  had  his  drives 
under  perfect  control.  The  score  was  6/3,  2/6,  7/5,  7/5-  The  summaries:

Miscellaneous   Tournaments 


Chevy  Chase  Tournament. 

The  Chevy  Chase  Club,  with  its  beautiful  grounds  and  excellent  courts; 
held  its  fourth  annual  tournament  late  in  May.  But  for  all  its  attractive 
features  and  mid-season  weather,  which  one  finds  at  that  time  of  year  jn 
Washington,  the  event  did  not  draw  the  high  class  entry  of  former  years 
in  either  singles  or  doubles. 

C.  B.  Doyle,  far  the  fastest  man  developed  in  the  nation's  capital,  won 
the  singles  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  His  play  was  so  good  that  opinion 
favored  him  in  his  challenge  match  against  G.  F.  Touchard,  especially  after 
a  series  of  practice  games  between  the  two,  in  which  the  latter  was 
invariably  worsted.  However,  the  Washingtonian  was  found  wanting,  and 
alter  a  good  start  and  determined  fight  for  three  sets,  was  overwhelmed  in 
the   fourth.     The  score  in   Touchard's  favor   was   6/8,   8/6    7/5,   6/1. 

The  doubles  was  practically  a  present  to  the  famous  Doyle  brothers.  No 
one  approached  their  class  and  not  a  team  was  able  to  force  a  set  to 
deuce.  In  the  final,  E.  P.  Grosvenor  and  G.  P.  Parks  were  defeated.  6/1, 
6/2,  6/4.  The  victory  gave  the  brothers  permanent  possession  of  the  chal- 
lenge bowls,  for  the  defending  team,  W.  F,  Johnson  and  L.  E.  Mahan, 
were  not  on  hand.     The  summaries:

New  York  Tennis  Club  Tournament. 

One  of  the  handsomest  trophies  ever  presented  for  a  tennis  event  was 
captured  outright,  when  G.  F.  Touchard  won,  for  the  third  successive  year, 
the  New  York  Tennis  Club's  annual  spring  meeting.  There  was  a  fair 
entry  in  both  singles  and  doubles,  but  the  defending  players  in  both  were 
the  strongest.  W.  M.  Hall  won  the  tournament.  He  surprised  everyone 
by  defeating  T.  R.  Pell  in  the  final  in  most  convincing  style.  Pell  never 
had  a  real  chance,  and  Hall  won  at  8/6,  6/0,  6/1.  Hall  made  a  strong 
fight  in  the  challenge  round.  He  won  the  first  and  third  sets,  but  fell  off 
badly   in  the   fifrh.      The   complete   score   was:   4/6,   7/5,   6/3,   4/6,    6/2. 


160  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Hackett  and  Alexander  clinched  the  hold  on  the  bowls,  which  represent 
the  championship  of  Manhattan,  by  again  wading  through  the  field  in 
hollow  style.  It  was  their  third  victory  of  the  kind,  and  so  the  club  suf- 
fered the  final  loss  of  two  more  challenge  trophies.  Pell  and  Mahan  were 
the  only  other  high  class  combination  to  enter.  The  latter  won  the  open- 
ing set.  but  thereafter  the  national  champions  had  matters  much  their  own 
way.     The  summaries:

Central  California  Championship. 

The  first  meeting  for  191 1  of  the  famous  San  Franciscans,  M.  E. 
McLoughlin  and  M.  H.  Long,  occurred  at  the  end  of  the  newly  created 
Central  California  championship,  held  in  May  by  the  Stockton  Tennis  Club 
of  Stockton,  Cal. 

Neither  man  lost  a  set  on  his  way  through  to  the  finals,  but  the  final 
match  was  as  one-sided  as  the  contestants'  earlier  victories  had  been.  Long 
was  short  of  practice  and  utterly  without  control.  McLoughlin,  on  the 
other  hand,   was  at   his  best  and   won  easily  at   6/2,  6/2,   7/5. 

Long  and  McLoughlin  as  a  team  were  too  fast  for  the  rest  of  the  field 
and  won  the  doubles  easily.  With  Miss  Hotchkiss,  McLoughlin  scored 
his  third  victory  in  the  mixed.     The  summaries:

Central  Iowa  Tennis  Association  Tournament. 

The  sixth  annual  meet  of  the  Central  Iowa  Tennis  Association  was  held 
on  its  home  courts  at  Toledo,  Iowa,  July  11 -15.  A  number  of  states  were 
represented  and  the  only  regret  for  Iowa  was  the  fact  that  in  the  persons 
of  John  Barton  and  George  Douthit,  both  of  Sioux  Falls,  S.  D.,  that  State 
•was  enabled  to  carry  off  our  trophies,  both  in  singles  and  doubles;  but 
defeat  only  tends  to  greater  effort,  and  the  1912  tournament  already  prom- 
ises great  things  in   tennis  for  the   Central   Iowa   Tennis  Association. 

"Who's  Who"  in  Iowa  tennis  is  shown  annually  in  the  Central  Iowa  at

New  Haven  Tournament. 

One  of  R.  A.  Holden's  wins  during  the  191  r  season  was  the  New  Haven 
Lawn  Club  event,  which  was  played  early  in  June.  Professor  G.  H. 
Nettleton,  who  challenged  Holden,  was  routed  ingloriously  and  failed  to 
make  much  of  a  fight.  Holden  took  the  cup  away  from  Nettleton  in  1910 
and  it  was  predicted  that  the  Professor  would  retaliate  by  doing  likewise 
to  his  student.  Holden,  however,  showed  none  of  the  respect  that  might 
characterize  his  actions  under  different  circumstances  and  trounced  his 
dispenser  of  knowledge  at  6/3,  6/1,  6/3.  Nettleton  had  better  luck  in  the 
doubles.  Paired  with  Z.  Sargent  he  won  from  Man  and  Wainwright  in 
the  final  at   7/9,   3/6,   6/4,   6/4,   6/2.      I 


Bronxville  Tournament. 

G.  F.  Touchard  came  within  one  point  of  losing  his  match  with  G.  M. 
Church  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  Bronxville  tournament,  which  was 
played  the  week  beginning  July  3.  The  Princeton  freshman  waded 
through  a  big  field  of  ninety-two  players  without  the  loss  of  a  set  and 
for  a  time  played  Touchard  to  a  standstill  in  the  challenge  round.  He  led 
at  2  sets  to  I  and  was  within  a  point  of  the  match,  when  an  unlucky 
smash  gave  his  older  rival  a  chance.  The  flubbing  of  that  single  shot 
upset  the  young  Tiger  crack  for  several  points  following,  and  he  was 
never    within   striking    distance    after   that. 

Church,  playing  with  W.  Blache,  won  the  doubles  easily,  and  Touchard, 
with  Miss  Emeline  W.  Holmes  for  a  partner,  got  away  with  the  mixed 
event. 


Long  Island  Championship. 

Once  a  Mecca  for  the  strongest  players  of  the  Metropolitan  district,  the 
old  Kings  County  Club,  where  the  championship  of  Long  Island  is  annually 
played  for,  no  longer  attracts  the  elect  in  tennis.  On  June  26  the  yearly 
meeting  began,  but  it  proved  a  runaway  for  G.  F.  Touchard.  The  New 
Yorker  won  hands  down,  and  in  the  challenge  round  took  the  measure  of 
W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.  The  match  went  the  full  five  sets,  but  in  the  fifth 
Cragin   was   outclassed  and  failed  to  win  a  game. 

Just  as  easy  as  Touchard's  victory  in  the  singles  had  been  was  the 
doubles  for  Bull  and  Martin.  The  Crescent  pair  met  the  Gates  Brothers 
of  Yale  in  the  final  and  defeated  them  without  an  effort  at  6/2,  6/0,  6/1.

Tennis  at  Pinehurst. 

On  January  29,  191 1,  the  annual  midwinter  tournament  at  Pinehurst 
began  at  the  Pinehurst  Country  Club  and  as  usual  attracted  a  number  ot 
well-known  players.  Among  these  were  R.  D.  Little  of  New  York,  Richard 
Bishop  of  Boston  and  R.  L.  James  of  Saratoga  Springs,  N.  Y.  The 
women,  however,  were  on  hand  in  greater  numbers  and  included  such 
experts  as  Miss  Edna  Wildey,  Mrs.  George  L.  Chapman,  Mrs.  A.  G.  Miles, 
Mrs.   Marshall    McLean  and   Miss   Elsie    Little. 

In  the  men's  singles  Bishop  and  Little  outclassed  the  rest  of  the  field 
and.  having  been  on  opposite  sides  of  the  draw,  came  together  in  the  final. 
The   result   was  a  long  five-set  match,   which   Little  finally  pulled   out.      The

Metropolitan  League. 


The  Metropolitan  League  of  New  York  City  and  District  regained  con- 
siderable prestige  last  fall  by  putting  through  its  annual  schedule  of  inter- 
club  matches  without  any  great  accidents  happening  to  mar  the  tourna- 
ment. In  19 10  the  schedule  was  dragged  along  through  summer  and  fall 
till  there  was  little  left  but  tatters  and  no  result  was  obtained.  In  191 1, 
however,  the  month  of  September  was  chosen  for  the  play  and  the  affair 
came  promptly  to  a  definite  conclusion  on  September  30,  the  New  York

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  181 


Seabri^ht   Tournament 

The  performance  of  M.  H.  Long  in  coming  from  California  and  begin- 
ning on  the  same  day  he  arrived,  July  lo,  to  play  in  the  Seabright  tour- 
nament, his  first  grass  court  effoits  in  over  a  year  and  a  half,  was  remark- 
able for  the  fact  of  his  plural  success.  Long  not  only  won  the  singles, 
defeating  Niles  in  the  challenge  round,  but  the  doubles  as  well,  with  his 
one-time  team-mate,   C.   R.   Gardner,   for  a   partner. 

Long  defeated  in  succession  E.  P.  Larned,  G.  M.  Church,  A.  S.  Dabney, 
R.  R.  Pell  and  N.  W.  Niles.  His  first  match,  against  Larned,  was  won 
in  straight  sets  at  6/3  and  6/4.  Church  did  better,  winning  the  opening 
set  at  6/4,  but  dropping  the  third  and  fourth,  6/3.  6/2.  Dabney,  who  had 
previously  eliininated  Touchard,  was  outclassed,  winning  but  two  games  in 
each  set.' 

The  final,  against  Pell,  was  a  four-set  affair,  which  Long  held  safe  after 
the  first  set,  but  Niles  made  a  stronger  stand  when  they  faced  each  other 
in  the  challenge  match.  Five  sets  were  played  and  throughout  there  was 
little  advantage  gained  on  either  side.  A  flying  start  in  the  fifth  set  of 
four  games  to  none  practically  ended  the  match,  for  although  Niles  braced 
well  and  succeeded  in  getting  to  3/4  and  4/5,  Long  took  the  tenth  game 
with  his  own  delivery,  and  the  match. 

His  win  gave  him  a  leg  on  the  famous  Achilles  Cup,  which  is  now  the 
best  from  the  standpoint  of  sentiment,  in  America.  The  names  of  W.  A. 
Larned.  B.  C.  Wright,  F.  B.  Alexander,  W.  J.  Clothier,  R.  D.  Little,  N. 
W.  Niles  and  M.  H.  Long  are  now  engraved  on  it,  and  its  value  as  a 
trophy   still   in   competition  is   without   a   parallel. 

There  were  a  number  of  good  teams  in  the  doubles,  which  finally  sim- 
mered down  to  the  Larned  brothers  and  Long  and  Gardner.  The  final 
was  played  on   Saturday  before   the   largest  crowd   of  the   week. 

For  two  sets  the  Californians  had  it  all  their  own  way,  but  after  drop- 
ping the  first  four  games  of  the  third  set,  they  made  no  effort  to  even  up, 
allowing  it  to  go  at  love.  The  fourth  was  theirs  at  6/2.  By  taking  the 
net  and  volleying  and  smashing  perfectly,  they  had  the  brothers  on  the 
defensive  continuously  and  without  a  chance  to  get  aggressive,  point- 
winning  plays  in  action.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


The  English  Championships 

Early  in  July  the  annual  English  championship  was  played  at  the  All 
England    Lawn   Tennis   and    Croquet   Club    of   Wimbledon. 

Entries  were  received  from  every  important  tennis  playmg  county  of 
the  world — America,  France,  Canada.  Australia,  Germany,  Portugal, 
Sweden,  Denmark,  Belgium  and  New  Zealand  all  had  representatives  in 
the  field  and,  with  the  exception  of  America,  the  men  from  foreign  coun- 
tries  were   the    strongest   that  could   have   been    sent. 

As  it  has  always  been  in  England,  the  big  annual  fixture  attracted  atten- 
tion which  in  America  and  other  lands  would  be  focused  only  on  racing, 
foot  ball  or  some  other  sporting  event.  Tennis  there  ranks  with  the  lead- 
ing  sports   and    interest   from    all    classes   is   invariably    manifested. 

First  round  results  were  unimportant,  saving  the  unexpected  defeat  of 
the  German,  H.  Kleinschroth,  by  the  veteran  T.  M.  Mavrogordato,  and 
H.   Roper  Barrett's   easy    win   over   J.   C     Parke. 

The  second  session  produced  a  big  sensation  when  young  A.  H.  Gobert. 
the  French  champion,  who  had  taken  Europe  by  storm  with  his  remarkable, 
though  erratic,  performances,  went  down  in  straight  sets  to  the  ex-English 
champion,  Gore.  Tlie  latter's  driving  was  too  fast  and  accurate  for  the 
youthful  son  of  France  and  he  "blew  up"  before  the  match  was  well 
under    way. 

The  meeting  of  the  brothers  Lowe  was  the  feature  of  the  third  round, 
but  after  F.   G.   had  secured  a   lead   of  two   sets  to   one     A.   H.   defaulted. 

The  fourth  had  but  few  of  the  weaker  entrants  left.  C.  P.  Dixon 
eliminated  M.  T-  G.  Ritchie  m  tour  close  sets  and  Max  Decugis  put  Gore 
out  of  the  running  with  a  similar  number.  Roper  Barrett  upset  Mavro- 
gordato at  6/3,  3/6,  8/6,  8/6.  and  Rahe.  another  German  ot  great  ability, 
defeated   de    Borenau   in   straight    sets. 

The  fifth  round  resulted  in  the  hnai  appearance  of  Rod  Heath  of  Aus- 
tralia, Thomas,  Beamish  and  Rahe.  Decugis  accounted  for  the  first  named 
and  Dixon  did  for  Thomas.  Beamish  was  outplayed  by  Barret*-  and  Rahe 
struggled    vainly    against    Lowe's   accurate    baseline    game. 

Decugis  met  Dixon  in  the  upper  half  of  the  semi-final  and  Barrett  faced 
Lowe   in   the  lower. 

France's  chance  of  representation  was  snuffed  by  Dixon  in  four  sets. 
Decugis  won  the  second  at  7/5.  but  the  other  three  were  easy  for  the 
Britisher. 

In  the  lower  half  Barrett  played  all  around  Lowe.  The  younger  man 
was  outgeneraled  from  the  first  point  to  the  last  and  never  had  a  real 
chance.      Barrett    won,   6/2,    6/3,   6/2. 

The  final  round  between  Dixon  and  Barrett,  was  one  of  the  features 
of  the  week.  Played  in  excessive  heat,  the  former  was  apparently  net 
affected  at  all  and  won  the  first  two  sets  handily  It  looked  then  as 
though  Barrett  was  done  for,  but  a  remarkable  recovery  and  the  winning 
of  three  successive  sets  for  the  match  was  the  amazing  accomplishment 
which  he  displayed.  Certainly  Dixon  should  have  won  it  but  lapses  into 
indifferent  play,  for  which  he  is  noted,  cost  him  many  opportunities,  never 
so  pronounced  as  on  this  occasion  when  the  championship  seemed  within 
his  grasp. 

The  greatest  disappointment  was  felt  at  the  result  of  the  challenge 
match  between  Wilding,  the  title  holder,  and  Barrett.  The  latter  was  so 
unfortunate  as  to  suffer  with  illness  the  night  before  and  he  came  upon 
the  court  the  following  day  absolutely  unfit  for  the  contest  before  him. 
Wilding  took  the  first  set.  6/4,  and  then  proceeded  to  go  completely  off 
his  game.      Barrett  played    softly,    but  with   telling  steadiness,   and  the   hard

hitting  New  Zealander,  who  can  do  his  best  only  against  an  opponent  who 
plays  with  equal  speed;  whanged  away  at  the  net  and  backstop  and  totaled 
numberless   errors. 

The  fourth  set,  however,  was  Wilding's  easily  by  virtue  of  Barrett's 
■wretched  physical  condition.  The  latter  played  only  by  tremendous  force 
of  will,  but  even  his  determination  failed  him,  for  his  condition  was  such 
at  the  beginning  of  his   set  that   he   was   compelled   to   drop   out. 

The  doubles  fell  to  Gobert  and  Decugis.  They  defeated  Parke  and 
Hardy,  the  Americans,  in  straight  sets  in  the  tinal  round.  The  losers 
were   outclassed,   as   the   score    of   6/2,   6/1.   6/2,   shows  only   too    plainly. 

In  the  challenge  round  Gobert  and  Decugis  upset  calculations  by  defeat- 
ing the  title  holders.  Wilding  and  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie  in  a  fast,  interesting 
iive-set  affair. 

The  ladies'  championship  was  retained  by  Mrs.  Lambert  Chambers,  her 
challenger.  Miss  Dorothy  Boothby,  failing  to  score  a  single  game  against 
her.      The   summaries:

some  very  hard  rounds  on  his  way  through  the  field.  In  the  third  round  he 
was  forced  to  his  best  by  C.  Major,  the  score  being  8/6,  4/6,  6/4,  and  again 
in  the  following  round  A.  Behr  carried  him  at  a  pace  which  required  the 
playing  of  a  third  set.  In  the  semi-final  he  lowered  the  colors  of  Dr.  Rosen- 
baum  at  6/1,  6/2,  much  to  the  surprise  of  everyone,  and  in  the  final  tilt  he 
was  victorious  over  A.  H.  Hammett  in  straight  sets  at  6/3,  6/4,  6/2.  Major

that  made  him  a  formidable  expert  three  or  four  years  ago,  and  at  times 
completely   outplayed  the   Crescent   club   man. 

Mount  Washington  Tournament. — At  the  annual  open  tournament  of  the

Kar.sas  Intercollegiate  Tennis  Association. — The  TC.  I.  T.  A.  was  organized 
at  the  first  tournament  held  among  the  colleges  of  the  State  at  Emporia,  ia 
May,  1910.  Messrs.  Mercer  and  Hetzel  of  Emporia  won  the  doubles  and 
Mercer  won  the  singles.  In  the  tournament  held  at  Topeka  in  May.  1911, 
Paul  Neese  of  Kansas  University  won  the  singles  and  the  Kansas  University 
team  won  the  doubles.  The  institutions  represented  were  Kansas  University, 
Southwestern,  Washburn  Kansas  State  Normal,  McPherson  College  and 
Baker. 

Tennis  at  Williamsport.  Pa, — With  five  teams  from  neighboring  cities,  two 
from  city  clubs  and  two  from  the  Country  Club  itself,  the  most  successful 
open  tournament  ever  held  in  Lycoming  County  was  held  on  the  courts  of 
the  Country  Club  The  summaries;  Men's  doubles:  Preliminary  round — J. 
J.  Harris  and  W.  W.  Harris  d.  C.  Horton  and  O.  R.  H.  Thomson.  6/0.  6/1. 
First  round — J.  R.  McCormick  and  S.  H.  Fredericks  d.  H.  Bowman  and  H. 
Ulmer.  6/2,  6/1;  Harris  and  Harris  d.  H.  G,  Rorabaugh  and  L.  M.  Goodman,

6/3:  L.  M.  Hayes  and  C.  R.  Armstrong  d  R.  P.  Davis  and  A.  R.  Hopkins. 
6/2.  6/4.  Second  round— Harris  and  Harris  d.  .McCoimick  and  Fredericks. 
6/4.  6/1;  Hayes  and  Armstrong  d.  Clark  and  Otto,  2/6.  6/2,  6/2.  Both  the 
surviving  teams  clearly  outplayed  their  various  opponents,  the  Harris  brothers 
by  team  work  and  court  covering  and  Hayes  and  Armstrong  by  faster  driving 
and  cleaner  smashing.  Of  the  local  entries.  Clark  and  Otto  did  the  best 
work,  though  Brown" and  Lyon  forced  them  to  their  limit.  When  the  balls 
were  put  in  play  in  the  final  round  Hayes  and  Armstrong  took  the  first  two 
games  before  the  Lewisburg  combination  showed  how  almost  i)erfect  was 
their  team  work  and  effectual  their  covering  of  court.  Volleving  extremely 
low  and  smashing  accurately  rather  than  severely  the  Harris  brothers  ran 
six  straight  games  for  the  set.  In  the  second  set  thev  allowed  their  oppo- 
nents but  one  game.  The  third  set  produced  the  best  tennis  ever  seen  on 
local  courts,  Lock  Haven  making  a  desperate  struggle  nnd  onlv  losing  6  to  4, 
while  18  points  were  required  to  decide  the  eighth  game,  which  brought  the 
score   to   4-all.

Minnedosa  Lawn  Tennis  Club  Open  Tournament  and  Championship  of  North- 
west Manitoba. — The  fifth  annual  open  tournament  was  held  on  the  club 
grounds  at  Minnedosa,  Manitoba,  on  July  31,  lyil,  and  the  four  following 
days.  A  large  outside  entry  was  received  and  many  fine  matches  were  wit- 
nessed. The  cup  round  for  the  championship  of  Northwest  Manitoba  was 
contested  by  P.  S.  Hancock  of  Shoal  Lake,  Man.,  and  St.  L.  K.  Verley  of 
Winnipeg.  Some  very  fast  tennis  was  witnessed,  Verley  playing  a  strong 
driving  game  from  the  back  line,  Hancock  netting  more  of  his  brilliant  shots 
than  usual;  the  sets  were  6/2,  e/2,  6/2.  The  ladies'  open  singles  was  won 
by  Mrs.  Palmer  of  Birtle,  after  a  splendid  three-set  match,  6/1,  1/6,  6/4, 
more  even  than  the  score  would  indicate. 

Interscholastic  Tennis  in  St.  Louis. — The  interest  in  interscholastlc  tennis 
in  the  high  schools  of  St.  Louis  has  developed  remarkably  in  the  last  two  or 
three  years.  The  completion  of  the  new  Soldun  High  School  added  another 
team  to  the  league,  and  for  the  past  two  seasons  this  school  has  captured 
the  league  championship.  Although  the  Soldun  players  won  all  their  matches, 
the  tournament  of  1911  was  exciting  and  every  match  was  strongly  contested 
up  to  the  last  point.  The  match  in  doubles  between  the  teams  of  Soldun 
and  Central  was  the  star  event  of  the  tournament.  The  first  set  was  decided 
only  after  twenty-eight  games  had  been  played.  The  Central  and  McKinley 
High  Schools  tied  for  second  place,  each  team  winning  50  per  cent  of  their 
matches.  Yeatman  had  to  take  fourth  place,  but  the  prospects  are  that  with 
the  material  at  band  this  school  will  develop  a  much  stronger  team  in  1912. 
The  spirit  existing  among  the  schools  of  the  league  is  excellent.  The  coaches 
hope  that  it  will  continue,  in  which  case  some  excellent  matches  will  be  seen 
at  the  Amateur  Athletic  Association  courts  during  the  annual  tournaments. 

Nice  International  Tournament. — March  4  and  follOTTing  days.  Max  Decugis 
must  look  upon  the  Nice  tournament  as  an  inexhaustible  fountain  of  "pots," 
asi  he  not  only  won  two  out  of  three  possible  open  events,  but,  thanks  to 
the  lenience  of  the  handicapper,  got  to  the  finals  of  the  handicap,  mixed  and 
handicap  doubles,  winning  out  in  the  latter  event  without  the  loss  of  a 
single  set.  Great  disappointment  was  felt  at  the  absence  of  Wilding, 
Gobert  and  R.  N.  Williams,  which  left  the  field  in  possession  of  Germot  and 
Decugis.  The  Allen  twin  brothers,  once  more  playing  on  the  Riviera  after 
five  years,  no  longer  display  their  old  championship  form,  though  still  play- 
ing a  game  by  no  means  to  be  despised.  The  ladies,  however,  turned  out 
in  full  force,  and  the  presence  of  such  players  as  the  Misses  Tripp,  Miss 
Stuart,  Frau  von  Satzger  and  Fraulein  Rieck  lent  considerable  interest  to 
the  meeting.  The  final  of  the  championship  singles  between  Max  Decugis  and 
Germot  was  a  great  game  struggle  while  it  lasted.  Max  took  the  first  four 
games  off  the  reel,  but  Germot.  by  sheer  hard  work,  evened  up  to  four-all, 
finally  losing  the  first  set  at  10/8  on  a  very  doubtful  linesman's  decision, 
and  after  leading  at  seven  games  to  six  and  40/30.  The  second  set  showed 
Germot  at  his  best.  Keeping  the  lead  throughout  by  dint  of  hard  hitting 
and  harder  running,  he  placed  it  to  his  credit  by  6/4.  In  the  third  set. 
however,  he  showed  signs  of  fatigue,  and  upon  losing  it,  6/2,  was  compelled 
to  retire.  Germot  is  a  pretty  player,  with  an  easy  style,  reminding  one  of 
H.  L.  Doherty,  but  is  handicapped  by  indifferent  health,  which  affects  his 
staying  powers.  Miss  J.  Tripp  carried  off  the  women's  championship,  this, 
with  Monte  Carlo  and  San  Remo,  being  her  third  of  the  season  on  the 
Riviera.  The  doubles  championship  (cups  offered  by  Eugene  Higgins)  was 
won  easily  by  Decugis  and  Germot.  only  one  match,  a  semi-final  against 
Count  Salm  and  A.  Wallis  Myers,  being  at  all  close.  The  final  of  the  mixed 
doubles  proved  to  be  a  game  of  considerable  interest,  as  Wallis  Myers,  who 
is  no  singles  player,  has  built  up  quite  a  reputation  as  a  mixed  Sipecialist. 
and  his  partnership  with  Miss  J.  Tripp  formed  a  combination  which  had 
little  difficulty  in  disposing  of  the  redoubtable  Decugis  and  his  wife,  6/3,  6/3. 

Cannes  Beau-Site  Open  Tournament.^March  11  and  following  days.  In  the 
doubles  semi-final.  Count  Salm  and  Wallis  Myers,  playing  against  the 
brothers  Allen,  started  off  brilliantly,  winning  the  first  set  with  great  ease 
at  6/2,  but  the  Aliens,,  giving  a  great  exhibition  of  low  volleying,  recovered 
themselves  and  secured  the  match,  winning  the  last  two  sets,  6/2.  6/4.  A 
good  game  was  expected  in  the  other  semi-final,  Decugis  and  Germot  vs. 
Chancerel    and    Poulin.    but   it    proved   to    be   an    easy    win    for    Decugis    and

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNES    ANNUAL.  197 

Germot  with  a  score  of  6/2,  6/1.  Germot,  however,  had  a  close  and  interest- 
ing match  with  Poulin  in  the  handicap  singles.  Both  men  were  playing  at 
the  top  of  their  form  and  Germot,  who  was  only  owing  4/6  to  the  younger 
player,  won  out  after  a  hard  fight,  at  6/2.  4/6,  6/3.  In  the  final  of  the 
singles  championship,  Max  Decugis  defeated  Germot,  6/1,  6/2,  6/4.  The 
third  was  the  only  interesting  set  in  the  match,  when  Germot.  after  leading 
at  4/0,  allowed  Max  to  crawl  up  on  him  and  secure  the  set  without  allowing 
him  another  game.  The  doubles  final  was  a  certainty  for  the  Decugis-Germot 
pair  from  the  beginning.  Though  the  Aliens  played  well  in  the  first  set  and 
at  one  time  looked  like  winning  it,  the  French  pair  were  too  good  for  them 
in  all  departments  of  the  game  and  won  the  match,  6/4,  6/2,  6/2.  A  fea 
ture  of  this  match  was  the  excellent  tennis  played  by  Germot,  who  was 
seen  at  his  best  in  doubles  play  during  all  the  Riviera  season.  Miss  J. 
Tripp  and  Wallis  Myers,  the  invincible  mixed  pair,  did  not  fail  to  get  away 
with  the  open  mixed  event,  thus  completing  an  unbroken  series  of  victories 
for   all  the   year's   Mediterranean   tournaments.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  209 


Annual  Meeting   of   the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

The  thirty-first  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  Lawn  Tennis  Asso- 
ciation was  held  at  the  Waldorf-Astoria,  New  York,  on  the  afternoon 
and  evening  of  February  9,  1912.  There  were  many  radical  changes 
effected  in  both  reorganizing  the  association  itself  and  in  the  new  regula- 
tion pertaining  to  the  championship  which  was  passed  upon  and  put  into 
effect  for  the  season  of   1912. 

Most  important  of  the  actions  taken  was  the  decision  settled  by  vote  to 
require  champions  at  Newport  to  play  through  the  tournament,  thereby 
doing  away  with  the  challenge  round.  That  the  same  alteration  did  not 
apply  to  the  doubles  championship  as  well  was  due  solely  to  the  fact  that 
the  preliminary  doubles  are  played  at  Chicago  and  there  would  be  no 
doubles  at  Newport  at  all  if  the  winners  of  the  preliminary  play-off  were 
made  champions  by  their  success  in   that   event. 

Next  in  importance  was  the  accepted  resignation  of  Dr.  James  Dwight 
from  the  presidency  of  the  association  and  the  election  in  his  place  of 
Robert  D.  Wrenn.  Henry  W.  Slocum  was  elected  vice-president,  with 
A.  L.  Hoskins  again  secretary,  and  Richard  Stevens  succeeding  himself 
as   treasurer. 

Among  other  things,  the  question  of  the  revision  of  the  constitution 
was  proposed  and,  upon  meeting  with  no  opposition,  was  decided  upon. 
A  committee  of  five,  two  of  which  must  be  lawyers,  was  recommended  to 
take   the   matter   up. 

There  was  considerable  discussion  on  the  subject  of  ranking,  as  the 
departure  from  the  old  method  met  with  more  or  less  generally  severe 
criticism. 

The  more  important  awards,  including  the  championship,  were  decided, 
Newport  again  coming  in  for  the  year's  biggest  event  and  Pittsburgh  for 
the  clay  court  championship.  Philadelphia  was  given  the  women's  cham- 
pionship again.  Longwood  got  the  Eastern  Doubles,  Onwentsia  the  Pre- 
liminary Doubles  and  Western  Championship  and  Atlanta  the  Southern 
Championship. 

The  retiring  members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  L.  D.  Scott,  Ralph 
Holterhoff  and  Sumner  Hardy,  who  had  served  out  their  term  of  one  year, 
were  re-elected  and  the  meeting  was  concluded  with  a  vote  of  thanks  to  the 
members   of  the    Davis   team. 

The   complete  list   of  officers   for   the   ensuing  year   is  as   follows: 

President — R.   D.    Wrenn,    24    Broad    Street.    New   York   City.

Street,   Hoboken,    N.   J.

THE  COURT. 
1.  The  Court  is  78  feet  long  and  27  feet  wide.  It  is  divided  across 
the  middle  by  a  net,  the  ends  of  which  are  attached  to  two  posts, 
A  and  B,  standing  3  feet  outside  of  the  court  on  either  side.  The 
height  of  the  net  is  3  feet  6  inches  at  the  posts,  and  3  feet  in  the 
middle.     At  each  end  of  the  court,  parallel  with  the  net,  and  39  feet

from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E  and  F  G,  the  ends  of  which 
are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F  and  E  G.  Halfway  between  the 
side  lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn  the  half  court  line  I  H, 
dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the 
right  and  left  courts.  On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21 
feet  from  it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and 
M  N. 

THE    BALLS. 

2.  The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  2%  inches,  nor  more  than 
2  9-16  inches  in  diameter  ;  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than  1  15-16 
ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 

THE    GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss  ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become  server, 
and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.  e.,  further  from 
the  net  than  the  base  line  and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary 
continuation  of  the  centre  service  and  the  side  lines.  It  is  not  a 
fault  if  one  onhj  of  the  server's  feet  do  not  touch  the  ground  at  the 
moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He  shall  place  both  feet 
upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serving  and  shall  not  take  a  run- 
ning nor  a  walking  start.  He  shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right 
and  left  courts  alternately,  beginning  from  the  right,  in  each  of  his 
service  games,  even  though  odds  he  given  or  owed. 


244  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  half-court 
line,  and  the  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally  opposite  to  that  from 
which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  Fault  if  the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond  the 
service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court  ;  or  if  the  server 
do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6.  If  the  server,  in  attempting  to 
serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  )Wt  count  a  fault,  but  if  the 
ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is 
thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the  sei-\'ice  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after'the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  until  the  striker-put  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  TTie  sei-A'ice  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8.  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net  ;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  sers'ice, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults  ;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play  ;  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by   law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  by   that  line. 

20.  Either  olayer  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  anything 
that  he  wears  or' carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking:  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  liis  racket  more  than  once  ;  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;•  or  if  he  volley 
the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  ••let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If.  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player :  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player  :  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  :  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  the  player,  except  as  below. 
If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that 
player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  : 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except  as 
below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all; 
and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 


SrALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  245 

that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all  ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage   sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con- 
cluding set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded  :  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  :  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour,  the 
player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  wnen  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  m  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below  : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  36  feet  in  width:  4Vj  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service 
lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service 
side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shail  do  so.  and  the  ap- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third, 
and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall 
serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the 
subsequent  eames  of  the  set. 

31.  At   the   beginning  of   the  next  set,   either  partner  of  the  pair 


*  All  raatchps  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the 
auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawnn  Tenis  Association  shall  be  the  best 
two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest  not  exceeding  seven  minutes  after  the  second 
Bet.

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 


which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve ;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  game  of  the  new 
set. 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the 
game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  partner : 
and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established  shall  not 
be  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  receive  the 
service,  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  between  the  service 
line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  as  provided  in

carries.

Decisions  on  Doubtful  Points 

Offlcialhj  recognized  hy  the  U.  8.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  tlie  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
ft  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court.  _ 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count  V 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.     If   he   attempts    to    return  the    service   he   is 

deemed  ready. 

•  IV.     The   striker-out  calls   "not   ready."   for  a   second  service.     The 

ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and^  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 

fact  that  he  was  nol;  ready  makes  no  difference,   since  a  fault  cannot 

be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — ITie  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  "Not  ready,"  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or 
not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into  the 
court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 
it  before  it  fall.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  soV 

Decision. — Yes.  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time, 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — .Yes.  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Y'es.  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  oyer  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player   touches   the  net   beyond  the   inside  posts,  and  claims   that  he 


248  SPALDING'S    LATVN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

does   not   lose   the   stroke   because   there    should   be  no  net  more  than 

three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball.  and.  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  ou 
opposite  sides  of  the  net."  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decis  ion . — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net  and  bounds  into   the   opposite  court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  Ttie  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision.— Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is  returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary  ? 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes.  if.  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  gronnd.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  T'he  server  had  previously  served  a 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — -It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  ia 


SPALDING'S   LAWN   TENNIS   ANNUAL.  249 

simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  ttie  wrong  court  lie 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
s  to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
len  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.     What 

to  be  done? 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
ar  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
ipire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
e  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
at  the  umpire  has   called   "play."     Has  he  any   redress  V 

Decision. — ^Iso. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
ys  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
(  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
ange  his  decision. 

Decision. — Tlie  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
,11s  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
11.     He  then  claims  to  have  the  stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The   ball   strikes   the  ground  close  to   a   line ;   the   scorer 
ores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal  to  the  linesman,  the 
tter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
;t  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
ay  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
le  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault?    . 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
is  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
L  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
mded  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Lawn  Tennis.) 
Both    of   the   opponents    of   the   servers    in   doubles    are   strikers-out 
Iternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
rst,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  thi'oughout  each  set. 
A  player   does  not   lose   a    stroke   for   striking   at   a  ball    that   ulti- 
lately    falls    outside    his    court,    providing    he    does    not    touch    it    in 
oing  so. 


250  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  ;  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "lef'  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  '"let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-liue,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"'  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  nothing 
w-hich  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  w'hen  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court  ;  he  may- 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  boxmds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  T'he  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  th^^  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him,   or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  arw^  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  "Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  doe's  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

9.     It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire — 

fa)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before  the 
commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the  net  during 
play,  if  aslied  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its  height  has  altered. 

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets  unless 
he  delegates  such  power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to  call 
them,  and  to  record  them  upon  the  Umpire's  scoring  sheet.  (See 
example  below.) 

(d)  To  call  the  games  and  the  sets  at  the  end  of  each,  or  when

"B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called  thus,  "three

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior plaj-er  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30).  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  i  layers  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table.  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures.  , 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  'not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if.  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed. 


IISSTRUCTIONS    FOR    HANDICAPPING.

ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
TTiese  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

262  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth   and   corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (In)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2).  fifteen 
and  three  sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  to 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it.  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the"  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ei:- 
treme  cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  touniament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Aijplication  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
ofiicial   sanction    for   the   tournament,   stating  dates  and   other   particu- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  263 

ars.  If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
ecognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 
A  printed  circvilar  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
i^hich  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
ion  of  the  courts  ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
ompeted  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
f  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 

5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee  ;  and 

6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
ue  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
hey  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
raw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
Tournament    Regulations.") 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes,, 
:>r  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
?urs.  Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other' 
ouvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies, 
t  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
iwn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
hange,  and  therefore  not  engraved  until  after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
er  or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
Iso  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
urpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
Iso  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
Durnament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
)urnaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ig  on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
ivice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
^ell  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
ie  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  conrt  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
ay  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
"he  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
ill  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes, 
'here  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
ourt  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
ood  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
ccommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
tieir  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
rounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
f  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
dvance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
lie  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
ourt  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ught  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
eeing  that  they   are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  clsb 
rounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
mature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  d-uly 
ibeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
3r.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
lent  and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
r  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchlxnvl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
akes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
layers   and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


264  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
tb!  n  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
gai  le  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  hov/  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,   light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
(lie  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  f^re  to  take  place  on  it,  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
G  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60x120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can   surround   all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  tiecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  diain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  groimd  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes   are   put   in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use.  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper   level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  deptli  of  oii» 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.     After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  265 

level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  broken 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 
the  purpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  on  the  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  well  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suflice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  Avhereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  th-;''  court  as 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  six-inch  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
cracked  stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  if 
it  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
is  played  on  at  all.  and  any  depressions  or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain 
storm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  the  players 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  drainage  more  difllcult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  It  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavv"  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolfing  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.     Any  inequalities  which  the  heavy  pres- 


266  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

sure  of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cu':  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  suflBciently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sods  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  Tlie  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  ;  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  untW  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  It 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  will  be  found  much  les^ 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in 'the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  coxirt  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  ^larch  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use.  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
rt-eather  nearly  every  day.  \Yith  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
The  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
cannot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use. 

Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are  very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  fotuid  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble    court.  * 

Once  ihe  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use.  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.      In  every  case,  unless   it  be  of  grass,  and  the   lines  are 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  267 

to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little,  lump;  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  TTie  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.  It  should  be 
watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  in 
fertile  grolind  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
sod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  it  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  13 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
soled  shoes  witlaout  heels.

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 

A. G ,0 


As  a  double  court  practically  includes  every  line  to  be  found  in  a 
single  court,  it  is  best  to  take  tirst  the  measure  for  the  latter.  Hav- 
ing determined  the  position  of  your  net,  plant  in  the  ground,  in  the 
line  chosen,  two  pegs,  27  feet  apart  (at  the  points  .1  and  D  in  the 
diagram).  Then  take  two  measures  and  attach  their  respective  ends 
to  the  pegs  A  and  B.  On  the  first,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal 
of  the  court,  take  a  length  of  47  feet  5  inches  ;  on  the  other  39  feet  ; 
pull  both  taut  in  such  directions  that  at  these  distances  they  meet 
in  a  point  C.  This  will  give  one  corner  of  the  court.  At  that  point  F, 
21  feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.  The 
other  corner,  D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  G,  may  be 
found  by  interchanging  the  measures  and  repeating  the  process.  The 
same  measurements  on  the  other  side  of  the  net  will  complete  the 
exterior  boundaries  of  the  court.  L»y  prolonging  the  base-line  4  feet 
6  inches  in  each  direction,  and  joining  the  four  new  points  thus 
obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.  It  only 
remains  to  mark  the  central  line.  This  is  done  by  joining  the  middle 
points  of  the  service-lines.  If  a  double  court  alone  be  re-quired,  the 
interior  side-lines  need  not  be  prolonged  to  meet  the  base-lines. 
Remember  that  in  all  cases  the  net-posts  must  stand  at  a  distance 
of  three   feet  from   the   side-lines.

If  posts  are  placed  just  42  or  36  feet  apart,  net  will  fit  exactly  when  allowed  to

SPALDING  ILAWN  TENNIS  POSTS 

This  style  post  is  in  use  on  the  courts  of 
the  most  prominent  clubs  in  this  country. 

The  uprights  are  of  heavy  2-inch 
japanned  steel  tubing,  pointed  at  lower 
end  so  as  to  go  24  inches  into  ground 
and  equipped  with  wheel  at  top.  Ratchet 
for  tightening  net  has  a  particularly  strong 
leverage  Iron  hooks  and  cleats  for 
fastening  ropes. 

By  means  of  triple  claw  clutches, 
made  of  heavy  wrought  iron,  there  can 
be  no  shifting  or  shaking  once  posts  are 
placed  in  position,  and  the  tighter  the  net 
is  drawn  the  more  rigid  the  posts  become. 
No.  A.     Per  pair.

We  recommend  these  posts  especially  for  private  courts 
or  wherever  it  is  desirable  to  remove  posts  immediately 
after  play  is  finished.  The  "Auto-Loc"  tightening  ratchet 
is  a  patented  device  which  permits  the  closest  adjustment 
in  tightening  and  regulating  the  height  of  the  net,  and 
locks  automatically  eind  instantly  as  soon  as  released. 

The  spade-shaped  iron  sockets  with  which   these   posts 
are   equipped  are   driven   into  the   ground   in   the   proper 
position  for    the    posts,  which   are  fitted    with 
iron  bases  terminating   in    square    iron    exten-    Fitted  with 
sions  which  fit  exactly  the  sockets  in  the  spade    __Patented

placed  in  position.     When  posts  are  removed      15  jV""^ 
from  sockets  there  is  no  projecting  obstruction, 
and  we  furnish  a  block  of  wood  to  be  inserted 
in  the  hole  in  each  socket  as  soon  as  the  posts 
are  taken  up.      We    also    furnish    hooks    with 
handles    for    removing    sockets    from    ground

A  Standard  Quality  must  be  inseparably  linked  to  a  Standard  Policy. 

Without  a  definite  and  Standard  Mercantile  Policy,  it  is  impossible  for  a 
Manufacturer  to  long  maintain  a  Standard  Qyality. 

To  market  his  goods  through  a  jobber,  a  manufacturer  must  provide  a 
profit  for  the  jobber  as  well  as  for  the  retail  dealer.  To  meet  these  conditions 
of  Dual  Profits,  the  manufacturer  is  obliged  to  set  a  proportionately  high  list 
price  on  his  goods  to  the  consumer. 

To  enable  the  glib  salesman,  when  booking  his  orders,  to  figure  out 
attractive  profits  to  both  the  jobber  and  retailer,  these  high  list  prices  are 
absolutely  essential;  but  their  real  purpose  will  have  been  served  when  the 
manufacturer  has  secured  his  order  from  the  jobber,  and  the  jobber  has  secured 
his  order  from  the  retailer. 

However,  these  deceptive  high  list  prices  are  not  air  to  the  consumer,  w^ho 
does  not,  and,  in  reality,  is  not  ever  expected  to  pay  these  fancy  list  prices. 

When  the  season  opens  for  the  sale  of  such  goods,  with  their  misleading 
but  alluring  high  list  prices,  the  retailer  begins  to  realize  his  responsibilities,  and 
grapples  with  the  situation  as  best  he  can,  by  offering  "special  discounts," 
which  vary  with  local  trade  conditions. 

Under  this  system  of  merchandising,  the  profits  to  both  the  manufacturer 
and  the  jobber  are  assured ;  but  as  there  is  no  stability  maintained  in  the  prices 
to  the  consumer,  the  keen  competition  amongst  the  local  dealers  invariably 
leads  to  a  demoralized  cutting  of  prices  by  which  the  profits  of  the  retailer  are 
practically  eliminated. 

This  demoralization  alw^ays  reacts  on  the  manufacturer.  The  jobber  insists 
on  lower,  and  still  lower,  prices.  The  manufacturer,  in  his  tum,  meets  this 
demand  for  the  lowering  of  prices  by  the  only  way  open  to  him,  viz. :  the  cheap- 
ening and  degrading  of  the  quality  of  his  product. 

The  foregoing  conditions  became  so  intolerable  that,  1 3  years  ago,  in  1 899, 
A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  determined  to  rectify  this  demoralization  in  the  Athletic 
Goods  Trade,  and  inaugurated  what  has  since  become  known  as  "The  Spalding 
Policy." 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  eliminates  the  jobber  entirely,  so  far  as  Spalding 
Goods  are  concerned,  and  the  retail  dealer  secures  the  supply  of  Spalding 
Athletic  Goods  direct  from  the  manufacturer  by  which  the  retail  dealer  is 
assured  a  fair,  legitimate  and  certain  profit  on  all  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  and 
the  consumer  is  assured  a  Standard  Qyality  and  is  protected  from  imposition. 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  is  decidedly  for  the  interest  and  protection  of  the 
users  of  Athletic  Goods,  and  acts  in  two  ways  : 

First. — ^The  user  is  assured  of  genuine  Official  Standard  Athletic  Goods 
and  the  same  prices  to  everybody. 

Second. — As  manufacturers,  we  can  proceed  with  confidence  in 
purchasing  at  the  proper  time,  the  very  best  raw^  materials  required 
in  the  manufacture  of  our  various  goods,  well  ahead  of  their 
respective  seasons,  and  this  enables  us  to  provide  the  necesssary 
quantity  and  absolutely  maintain  the  Spalding  Standard  of  Quality. 

All  retail  dealers  handling  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  are  requested  to  supply 
consumers  at  our  regular  printed  catalogue  prices — neither  more  nor  less — thesame 
prices  that  similar  goods  are  sold  for  in  our  New  York,  Chicago  and  other  stores. 

All  Spalding  dealers,  as  well  as  users  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  are  treated 
exactly  alike    and  no  special  rebates  or  discriminations  are  allowed  to  anyone. 

This  briefly  is  the  "Spalding  Policy,"  which  has  already  been  in  successful 
operation  for  the  past  13  years,  and  will  be  indefinitely  contintied. 

In  other  words,  "  The  Spalding  Policy  "  is  a  "  square  deal "  for  everybody.

standard  Quality 


An  article  that  is  universally  given  the  appellation  "  Standard  "  is  thereby 
conceded  to  be  the  criterion,  to  which  are  compared  all  other  things  of  a  similar 
nature.  For  instance,  the  Gold  Dollar  of  the  United  States  is  the  Standard  unit 
of  currency,  because  it  must  legally  contain  a  specific  proportion  of  pure  gold, 
and  the  fact  of  its  being  Genuine  is  guaranteed  by  the  Government  Stamp 
thereon.  As  a  protection  to  the  users  of  this  currency  against  counterfeiting  and 
other  tricks,  considerable  money  is  expended  in  maintaining  a  Secret  Service 
Bureau  of  Experts.  Under  the  law,  citizen  manufacturers  must  depend  to  a 
creat  extent  upon  Trade-Marks  and  similar  devices  to  protect  themselves  against 
counterfeit  products— without  the  aid  of  "Government  Detectives"  or  "Public 
Opinion"  to  assist  them. 

Consequently  the  "Consumer's  Protection"  against  misrepresentation  and 
"inferior  quality"  rests  entirely  upon  the  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the 
'  Manufacturer." 

A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  have,  by  their  rigorous  attention  to  "  Quality,"  for 
thirty-four  years,  caused  their  Trade-Mark  to  become  known  throughout 
the  world  as  a  Guarantee  of  Qyality  as  dependable  in  their  field  as  the 
U.  S.  Currency  is  in  its  field. 

The  necessity  of  upholding  the  Guarantee  of  the  Spalding  Trade-Mark  and 
maintaining  the  Standard  Qyality  of  their  Athletic  Goods,  is,  therefore,  as  obvi- 
ous as  is  the  necessity  of  the  Government  in  maintaining  a  Standard  Currency. 

Thus  each  consumer  is  not  only  insuring  himself  but  also  protecting  other 
consumers  when  he  assists  a  Reliable  Manufacturer  in  upholding  his  Trade- 
Mark  and  all  that  it  stands  for.  Therefore,  we  urge  all  users  of  our  Athletic 
Goods  to  assist  us  in  maintaining  the  Sp£ilding  Standard  of  Excellence,  by 
insisting  that  our  Trade-Mark  be  plainly  stamped  on  all  athletic  goods  which 
they  buy,  because  without  this  precaution  our  best  efforts  towards  maintaining 
Standard  Quality  and  preventing  fraudulent  substitution  will  be  ineffectual. 

Manufacturers  of  Standard  Articles  invariably  suffer  the  reputation  of  being 
high-priced,  and  this  sentiment  is  fostered  and  emphasized  by  makers  of 
"  inferior  goods,"  with  whom  low  prices  are  the  main  consideration. 

A  manufacturer  of  recognized  Standard  Goods,  with  a  reputation  to  uphold 
and  a  guarantee  to  protect,  must  necessarily  have  higher  prices  than  a  manufac- 
turer of  cheap  goods,  whose  idea  of  and  basis  of  a  claim  for  Standard  Quality 
depends  principally  upon  the  eloquence  of  the  salesman. 

We  know  from  experience  that  there  is  no  quicksand  more  unstable  than 
poverty  in  quality — and  we  avoid  this  quicksand  by  Standard  Quality.
