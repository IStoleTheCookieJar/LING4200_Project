On  the  cover:  The  peafowl,  or  peacock  (P.  cristatus),  the 
national  bird  of  India,  is  protected  under  the  Indian 
Wild  Life  Protection  Act  of  1972.  A  traditional  fixture 
in  literature,  folklore,  legends,  and  art,  the  peafowl 
inhabits  most  of  peninsular  India,  Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir, eastern  Assam,  and  southern  Mizoram.  Art  of 
this  type  is  found  in  parts  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and  Rajas- 
than  and  is  based  on  traditional  paper  stencil  art 
(sanzi  khaka)  used  on  festive  occasions  for  floor  deco- 
rations employing  marble  dust  and  colored  powders.

Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared 
by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress 
under  the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  spon- 
sored by  the  Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  two  pages  of  this 
book  list  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  coun- 
try, describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and 
national  security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the 
interrelationships  of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are 
shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors.  Each  study  is  written 
by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The  authors 
seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular 
attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society, 
their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  common  inter- 
ests and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and 
extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should 
not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States 
government  position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have 
sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity. 
Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  read- 
ers will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


This  edition  supersedes  the  fourth  edition  of  India:  A  Coun- 
try Study,  published  in  1985  under  the  editorship  of  Richard  F. 
Nyrop.  The  new  edition  provides  updated  information  on  the 
world's  second  most  populous  and  fastest-growing  nation. 
Although  much  of  India's  traditional  behavior  and  organiza- 
tional dynamics  reported  in  1985  have  remained  the  same, 
internal  and  regional  events  have  continued  to  shape  Indian 
domestic  and  international  policies. 

To  the  extent  possible,  place-names  used  in  the  text  conform 
to  the  United  States  Board  on  Geographic  Names,  but  equal

Introduction 


INDIA  IS  A  LAND  of  ancient  civilization,  with  cities  and  vil- 
lages, cultivated  fields,  and  great  works  of  art  dating  back  4,000 
years.  India's  high  population  density  and  variety  of  social,  eco- 
nomic, and  cultural  configurations  are  the  products  of  a  long 
process  of  regional  expansion.  In  the  last  decade  of  the  twenti- 
eth century,  such  expansion  has  led  to  the  rapid  erosion  of 
India's  forest  and  wilderness  areas  in  the  face  of  ever-increasing 
demands  for  resources  and  gigantic  population  pressures — 
India's  population  is  projected  to  exceed  1  billion  by  the 
twenty-first  century! 

Such  problems  are  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon.  Rhinoc- 
eros inhabited  the  North  Indian  plains  as  late  as  the  sixteenth 
century.  Historical  records  and  literature  of  earlier  periods 
reveal  the  motif  of  the  forest  everywhere.  Stories  of  merchant 
caravans  typically  included  travel  through  long  stretches  of  jun- 
gle inhabited  by  wild  beasts  and  strange  people;  royal  adven- 
tures usually  included  a  hunting  expedition  and  meetings  with 
unusual  beings.  In  the  Mahabharata  and  the  Ramayana,  early 
epics  that  reflect  life  in  India  before  1000  B.C.  and  500  B.C., 
respectively,  the  forest  begins  at  the  edge  of  the  city,  and  the 
heroes  regularly  spend  periods  of  exile  wandering  far  from  civ- 
ilization before  returning  to  rid  the  world  of  evil.  The  formu- 
laic rituals  of  the  Vedas  also  reflect  attempts  to  create  a 
regulated,  geometric  space  from  the  raw  products  of  nature. 

The  country's  past  serves  as  a  reminder  that  India  today,  with 
its  overcrowding  and  scramble  for  material  gain,  its  poverty 
and  outstanding  intellectual  accomplishments,  is  a  society  in 
constant  change.  Human  beings,  mostly  humble  folk,  have 
within  a  period  of  200  generations  turned  the  wilderness  into 
one  of  the  most  complicated  societies  in  the  world.  The  process 
began  in  the  northwest  in  the  third  millennium  B.C.,  with  the 
Indus  Valley,  or  Harappan,  civilization,  when  an  agricultural 
economy  gave  rise  to  extensive  urbanization  and  long-distance 
trade.  The  second  stage  occurred  during  the  first  millennium 
B.C.,  when  the  Ganga-Yamuna  river  basin  and  several  southern 
river  deltas  experienced  extensive  agricultural  expansion  and 
population  growth,  leading  to  the  rebirth  of  cities,  trade,  and  a 
sophisticated  urban  culture.

By  the  seventh  century  A.D.,  a  dozen  core  regions  based  on 
access  to  irrigation-supported  kingdoms  became  tied  to  a 
pan-Indian  cultural  tradition  and  participated  in  increasing 
cross-cultural  ties  with  other  parts  of  Asia  and  the  Middle  East. 
India's  inclusion  within  a  global  trading  economy  after  the  thir- 
teenth century  culminated  in  the  arrival  of  Portuguese  explor- 
ers, traders,  and  missionaries,  beginning  in  1498.  Although 
there  were  ebbs  and  flows  in  the  pattern,  the  overall  tendency 
was  for  peasant  cultivators  and  their  overlords  to  expand  agri- 
culture and  animal  husbandry  into  new  ecological  zones,  and 
to  push  hunting  and  gathering  societies  farther  into  the  hills. 

By  the  twentieth  century,  most  such  tribal  (see  Glossary) 
groups,  although  constituting  a  substantial  minority  within 
India,  lived  in  restricted  areas  under  severe  pressure  from  the 
caste-based  agricultural  and  trading  societies  pressing  from  the 
plains.  Because  this  evolution  took  place  over  more  than  forty 
centuries  and  encompassed  a  wide  range  of  ecological  niches 
and  peoples,  the  resulting  social  pattern  is  extremely  compli- 
cated and  alters  constantly. 

India  had  its  share  of  conquerors  who  moved  in  from  the 
northwest  and  overran  the  north  or  central  parts  of  the  coun- 
try. These  migrations  began  with  the  Aryan  peoples  of  the  sec- 
ond millennium  B.C.  and  culminated  in  the  unification  of  the 
entire  country  for  the  first  time  in  the  seventeenth  century 
under  the  Mughals.  Mostly  these  conquerors  were  nomadic  or 
seminomadic  people  who  adopted  or  expanded  the  agricul- 
tural economy  and  contributed  new  cultural  forms  or  religions, 
such  as  Islam. 

The  Europeans,  primarily  the  English,  arrived  in  force  in  the 
early  seventeenth  century  and  by  the  eighteenth  century  had 
made  a  profound  impact  on  India.  India  was  forced,  for  the 
first  time,  into  a  subordinate  role  within  a  world  system  based 
on  industrial  production  rather  than  agriculture.  Many  of  the 
dynamic  craft  or  cottage  industries  that  had  long  attracted  for- 
eigners to  India  suffered  extensively  under  competition  with 
new  modes  of  mass  production  fostered  by  the  British.  Modern 
institutions,  such  as  universities,  and  technologies,  such  as  rail- 
roads and  mass  communication,  broke  with  Indian  intellectual 
traditions  and  served  British,  rather  than  Indian,  economic 
interests.  A  country  that  in  the  eighteenth  century  was  a  mag- 
net for  trade  was,  by  the  twentieth  century,  an  underdeveloped 
and  overpopulated  land  groaning  under  alien  domination. 
Even  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century,  with  the  period  of 


xxx vi 


colonialism  well  in  the  past,  Indians  remain  sensitive  to  foreign 
domination  and  are  determined  to  prevent  the  country  from 
coming  under  such  domination  again. 

Through  India's  long  history,  religion  has  been  the  carrier 
and  preserver  of  culture.  One  distinctive  aspect  of  the  evolu- 
tion of  civilization  in  India  has  been  the  importance  of  heredi- 
tary priesthoods,  often  Brahmans  (see  Glossary),  who  have 
functioned  as  intellectual  elites.  The  heritage  preserved  by 
these  groups  had  its  origin  in  the  Vedas  and  allied  bodies  of  lit- 
erature in  the  Sanskrit  language,  which  evolved  in  North  India 
during  the  second  millennium  B.C.  This  tradition  always 
accepted  a  wide  range  of  paths  to  ultimate  truth,  and  thus 
encompassed  numerous  rituals  and  forms  of  divinity  within  a 
polytheistic  system.  Generally,  Brahmans  supported  the  phe- 
nomenon known  as  Sanskritization,  or  the  inclusion  of  local  or 
regional  traditions  within  Sanskrit  literary  models  and 
pan-Indian  cultural  motifs.  In  this  way,  there  has  been  a  steady 
spread  of  North  Indian  cultural  and  linguistic  forms  through- 
out the  country.  This  process  has  not  gone  unopposed.  Sid- 
dhartha  Gautama  (the  Buddha)  and  Mahavira  (founder  of 
Jainism)  in  the  fifth  century  B.C.  represented  alternative  meth- 
ods for  truth-seekers;  they  renounced  the  importance  of  priest- 
hoods in  favor  of  monastic  orders  without  reference  to  birth. 
The  largest  challenge  came  from  Islam,  which  rests  on  Arabic 
rather  than  Sanskritic  cultural  traditions,  and  has  served,  espe- 
cially since  the  eleventh  century,  as  an  important  alternative 
religious  path.  The  interaction  of  Brahmanical  religious  forms 
with  local  variations  and  with  separate  religions  creates  another 
level  of  complexity  in  Indian  social  life. 

Closely  allied  with  religious  belief,  and  deeply  rooted  in  his- 
tory, caste  remains  an  important  feature  of  Indian  society. 
Caste  in  many  Indian  languages  is  jati,  or  birth — a  system  of 
classifying  and  separating  people  from  birth  within  thousands 
of  different  groups  labeled  by  occupation,  ritual  status,  social 
etiquette,  and  language.  Scholars  have  long  debated  the  ori- 
gins of  this  system,  and  have  suggested  as  the  origin  religious 
concepts  of  reincarnation,  the  incorporation  of  many  ethnic 
groups  within  agricultural  systems  over  the  millennia,  or  occu- 
pational stratification  within  emerging  class  societies.  What  is 
certain  is  that  nineteenth-century  British  administrators,  in 
their  drive  to  classify  and  regulate  the  many  social  groups  they 
encountered  in  everyday  administration,  established  lists  or 
schedules  of  different  caste  groups.  At  that  time,  it  seemed  that 


xxxvn 


the  rules  against  intermarriage  and  interdining  that  defined 
caste  boundaries  tended  to  freeze  these  groups  within 
unchanging  little  societies,  a  view  that  fit  well  with  imperialistic 
models  imposed  on  India  as  a  whole.  Experience  during  the 
twentieth  century  has  demonstrated  that  the  caste  system  is 
capable  of  radical  change  and  adaptation. 

Modernization  and  urbanization  have  led  to  a  decline  in  the 
outward  display  of  caste  exclusiveness,  so  that  issues  of  caste 
may  never  emerge  directly  on  public  transit  or  in  the  work- 
place. Entire  castes  have  changed  their  status,  claiming  higher 
positions  as  they  shed  their  traditional  occupations  or  accumu- 
late money  and  power.  In  many  villages,  however,  the  segrega- 
tion of  castes  by  neighborhood  and  through  daily  behavior  still 
exists  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century.  In  the  cities,  segrega- 
tion takes  more  subtle  forms,  emerging  directly  at  times  of 
marriage  but  existing  more  often  as  an  undercurrent  of  dis- 
crimination in  educational  opportunities,  hiring,  and  promo- 
tion. The  British  schedules  of  different  castes,  especially  those 
of  very  low  or  Untouchable  (Dalit — see  Glossary)  groups,  later 
became  the  basis  for  affirmative-action  programs  in  indepen- 
dent India  that  allowed  some  members  of  the  most  oppressed 
caste  groups  access  to  good  education  and  high-paying  jobs. 
The  reservation  of  positions  for  Backward  Classes  (see  Glos- 
sary) has  remained  a  sore  point  with  higher-ranked  groups  and 
has  contributed  to  numerous  political  confrontations.  Mean- 
while, attempts  by  low-ranking  (and  desperately  poor)  castes  to 
organize  and  agitate  against  discrimination  have  been  met  with 
violence  in  most  Indian  states  and  territories.  Caste,  therefore, 
is  a  very  live  issue. 

Religious,  caste,  and  regional  diversity  exist  in  India  against  a 
background  of  poverty.  At  independence  in  1947,  the  British 
left  India  in  terrible  condition.  The  country  emerged  from 
World  War  II  with  a  rudimentary  scientific  and  industrial  base 
and  a  rapidly  expanding  population  that  lived  primarily  in  vil- 
lages and  was  divided  by  gross  inequalities  in  status  and  wealth. 
Under  the  leadership  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  India's  first  prime 
minister  (1947-64),  India  addressed  its  economic  crisis 
through  a  combination  of  socialist  planning  and  free  enter- 
prise. During  the  1950s  and  1960s,  large  government  invest- 
ments made  India  as  a  whole  into  one  of  the  most 
industrialized  nations  in  the  world.  Considerable  expenditure 
on  irrigation  facilities  and  fertilizer  plants,  combined  with  the 
introduction  of  high-yield  variety  seeds  in  the  1960s,  allowed 


xxxviii 


the  Green  Revolution  to  banish  famine.  The  abolition  of 
princely  states  and  large  land  holdings,  combined  with  (mostly 
ineffective)  land  redistribution  schemes,  also  eliminated  some 
of  the  most  glaring  inequalities  in  the  countryside  and  in  some 
areas,  such  as  Punjab,  stimulated  the  growth  of  middle-sized 
entrepreneurial  farms.  Building  on  the  education  system 
bequeathed  by  the  British,  India  established  an  infrastructure 
of  universities,  basic  research  institutes,  and  applied  research 
facilities  that  trained  one  of  the  world's  largest  scientific  and 
technical  establishments. 

The  socialist  model  of  development  remained  dominant  in 
India  through  the  1970s,  under  the  leadership  of  Prime  Minis- 
ter Indira  Gandhi,  Nehru's  daughter.  Government-owned  firms 
controlled  iron  and  steel,  mining,  electronics,  cement,  chemi- 
cals, and  other  major  industries.  Telecommunications  media, 
railroads,  and  eventually  the  banking  industry  were  national- 
ized. Import-substitution  policies,  designed  to  encourage 
Indian  firms  and  push  out  multinational  corporations, 
included  strict  and  time-consuming  procedures  for  obtaining 
licenses  and  laws  that  prohibited  firms  from  operating  in  India 
without  majority  ownership  by  Indian  citizens  or  corporations. 
These  rules  were  instrumental,  for  example,  in  driving  IBM 
from  India  in  the  1970s,  leading  to  the  growth  of  an  indige- 
nous Indian  computer  industry.  By  the  late  1980s,  however, 
after  Mrs.  Gandhi's  1984  assassination,  the  disadvantages  of  the 
centrally  planned  economy  began  to  outweigh  its  benefits. 
Inefficiency  in  public-sector  firms,  lack  of  entrepreneurial 
innovation,  excessive  bureaucracy,  and  the  inability  of  the 
Indian  scientific  and  technical  apparatus  to  transfer  technology 
to  marketable  goods  kept  many  Indian  firms  from  being  com- 
petitive in  international  markets. 

Under  Prime  Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  and  his  successors,  the 
national  and  state-level  (states,  union  territories,  and  the 
national  capital  territory)  governments  liberalized  licensing 
requirements  and  eventually  rescinded  rules  on  foreign  owner- 
ship, while  taking  steps  to  scale  down  government  market 
share  in  a  number  of  high-technology  markets.  Multinational 
firms  began  to  reenter  India  in  the  late  1980s  and  the  early 
1990s,  as  the  government  encouraged  private  enterprise  and 
international  sales  in  its  search  for  foreign  exchange.  India 
began  to  open  its  economy  to  the  world. 

Indian-style  socialism  was  probably  necessary  in  the  years 
after  independence  to  protect  the  nation  from  foreign  eco- 


xxx  IX 


nomic  domination,  but  its  biggest  problem  was  that  it  did  not 
eliminate  poverty.  The  vast  majority  of  India's  population  con- 
tinued to  live  in  small  agricultural  villages  with  few  public 
amenities.  A  significant  minority  of  the  population  in  the  1990s 
live  below  the  Indian  definition  of  the  poverty  line,  surviving  at 
subsistence  level,  unemployed  or  underemployed,  with  little 
education  or  opportunity  for  training,  and  suffering  from  a 
variety  of  curable  health  problems.  There  are  also  some  200 
million  people  who  live  above  the  official  poverty  line,  but 
whose  lives  remain  precariously  balanced  on  the  border  of  des- 
titution. The  per  capita  income  of  India  as  a  whole  remains 
among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  One  of  the  biggest  issues  facing 
India  as  its  economy  has  changed  direction  is  that  free-market 
capitalism  offers  little  help  for  this  large  mass  of  people,  who 
lack  the  skills  or  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  new  econ- 
omy. 

The  big  social  story  of  India  in  the  1980s  and  the  1990s  is  the 
emergence  of  the  middle  class.  This  group  includes  members 
of  prosperous  farming  families,  as  well  as  the  primarily 
urban-based  professional,  administrative,  and  business  elites 
who  benefited  from  forty  years  of  government  protection  and 
training.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the  drive  toward  modernization 
had  transformed  26.1  percent  of  the  country  into  urban  areas, 
where,  amid  masses  of  impoverished  citizens,  a  sizable  class  of 
consumers  has  arisen.  The  members  of  this  increasingly  vocal 
middle  class  chafe  under  the  older,  regulated  economy  and 
demand  a  loosening  of  economic  controls  to  make  consumer 
goods  available  on  the  free  market.  They  want  education  for 
their  children  that  prepares  them  for  technical  and  profes- 
sional careers,  increasingly  in  the  private  sector  instead  of  the 
traditional  sinecures  in  government  offices.  They  build  their 
well-appointed  brick  houses  in  exclusive  suburban  neighbor- 
hoods or  surround  their  lots  with  high  walls  amid  urban  squa- 
lor, driving  their  scooters  or  automobiles  to  work  while  their 
children  attend  private  schools. 

The  result  of  these  processes  over  the  course  of  fifty  years  is  a 
dynamic,  modernizing  India  with  major  class  cleavages.  The 
upper  1  or  2  percent  of  the  population  includes  some  of  the 
wealthiest  people  in  the  world,  who  can  be  seen  at  the  race- 
track in  the  latest  fashions  from  Paris  or  Tokyo,  who  travel 
extensively  outside  India  for  business,  pleasure,  or  advanced 
medical  care,  and  whose  children  attend  the  most  exclusive 
English-language  schools  within  India  and  abroad.  For  the 


x! 


middle  class,  which  makes  up  between  15  and  25  percent  of  the 
population,  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century  is  a  time  of  rela- 
tive prosperity:  incomes  generally  keep  pace  with  inflation  and 
jobs  may  still  be  obtained  through  family  connections.  The 
increase  in  consumer  goods,  such  as  washing  machines  and 
electric  kitchen  appliances,  makes  life  easier  and  reduces 
dependence  on  lower-class  (and  low-caste)  servants.  For  the 
industrial  working  class,  the  1990s  are  a  period  of  transition  as 
dynamic  new  industries  grow,  mostly  in  the  private  sector,  while 
many  large  government-sponsored  plants  are  in  jeopardy.  The 
trade  union  movement,  closely  connected  in  some  states  with 
communist  parties,  finds  itself  under  considerable  pressure 
during  a  period  of  structural  change  in  the  economy.  For  large 
numbers  of  peasants  and  dwellers  in  urban  slums,  a  way  out  of 
poverty  remains  as  elusive  as  it  had  seemed  for  their  grandpar- 
ents at  independence. 

The  political  system  responsible  for  these  gigantic  successes 
and  failures  has  been  democratic;  India  has  called  itself  "the 
world's  largest  democracy."  Paradoxically,  it  was  the  autocratic 
rule  of  the  British  that  gave  birth  to  the  rule  of  the  people. 
Democratization  started  when  a  group  of  concerned  British  cit- 
izens in  India  and  well-to-do  Indian  professionals  gathered  in 
Bombay  in  1885  to  form  a  political  debating  society,  the  Indian 
National  Congress  (Congress — see  Glossary).  Originally  con- 
ceived as  a  lobbying  group,  the  Congress  after  1900  became 
radicalized  and  took  the  forefront  in  a  drive  for  home  rule  that 
encompassed  elected  assemblies  and  parliamentary  procedure. 
In  the  face  of  British  intransigence,  the  Congress  soon  became 
the  leading  organization  within  a  broad-based  freedom  strug- 
gle that  finally  forced  the  British  out  in  1947.  Mohandas 
Karamchand  Gandhi  (the  Mahatma  or  Great  Soul)  was  a  cen- 
tral figure  in  this  struggle  because  he  was  able  to  turn  the  Con- 
gress from  an  elite  pressure  group  into  a  mass  movement  that 
mobilized  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  against  the  immoral- 
ity of  a  foreign,  nondemocratic  system. 

Gandhi  perfected  nonviolent  techniques  for  general  strikes 
and  civil  disobedience,  and  coordinated  demonstrations  with 
mass  publicity;  the  techniques  that  he  popularized  have  played 
a  part  in  later  Indian  and  world  politics  (including  the  United 
States  civil  rights  movement).  He  evolved  a  philosophy  of  polit- 
ical involvement  as  sacrifice  for  the  good  of  the  world  and 
played  the  role  of  a  holy  man  who  was  also  a  cagey  politician — 


xli 


an  image  that  remained  important  for  Indian  political  figures 
after  independence. 

In  a  move  to  undercut  British  industrial  superiority,  Gandhi 
encouraged  a  return  to  a  communal,  rustic  life  and  village 
handicrafts  as  the  most  humane  way  of  life.  Finally,  he  railed 
against  the  segregation  of  the  caste  system  and  religious  big- 
otry that  reduced  large  minorities  within  India  to  second-class 
citizenship.  Gandhi  was  thus  able  to  unite  European  humanis- 
tic and  democratic  ideas  with  Indian  concepts  of  an  interde- 
pendent, responsible  community  to  create  a  unique  political 
philosophy  complete  with  action  plan.  In  the  last  years  before 
his  assassination  in  1948,  Gandhi's  idiosyncratic  program  fell 
out  of  step  with  the  modernization  paradigm  of  Nehru  and  the 
leadership  of  an  independent  India,  and  his  ideas  became  a 
background  theme  within  Indian  political  economy.  On  a  regu- 
lar basis,  however,  Indian  leaders  continue  to  hearken  back  to 
his  message  and  employ  his  organizational  and  media  tactics 
on  the  independent  Indian  political  scene. 

The  Congress  remained  the  most  important  political  organi- 
zation in  India  after  independence.  Except  for  brief  periods  in 
the  late  1970s  and  late  1980s  and  until  the  mid-1990s,  the  Con- 
gress always  controlled  Parliament  and  chose  the  prime  minis- 
ter. The  political  dynasty  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  (1947-64),  his 
daughter  Indira  Gandhi  (1965-77,  1980-84),  and  her  son  Rajiv 
Gandhi  (1984-89)  was  crucial  in  keeping  the  Congress  in 
power  and  also  providing  continuity  in  leadership  for  the  coun- 
try. The  party  was  able  to  appeal  to  a  wide  segment  of  the  poor 
(including  low  castes  and  Muslims)  through  its  ideology  of 
social  equality  and  welfare  programs,  while  appealing  to  the 
more  prosperous  voters — usually  from  upper  castes — by  pre- 
serving private  property  and  supporting  village  community 
leadership.  Because  it  stayed  in  power  so  long,  the  Congress 
was  able  to  dispense  government  benefits  to  a  wide  range  of 
constituencies,  which  prompted  charges  of  corruption  and  led 
to  Congress  reversals  in  the  late  1980s.  Because  it  affected  a 
type  of  socialist  policy,  the  Congress  diffused  or  incorporated 
left-wing  political  rhetoric  and  prevented  the  growth  of  a 
communist-led  insurrection  that  might  have  been  expected 
under  the  difficult  social  conditions  existing  in  India. 

Although  a  vibrant  communist  movement  remains  a  force  in 
Indian  politics,  it  manifests  itself  at  the  state  level  of  govern- 
ment rather  than  in  national  political  power  or  large-scale  revo- 
lutionary turmoil.  Challenges  from  the  right  were  small  as  well 


xlii 


until  the  early  1990s,  when  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP — 
Indian  People's  Party)  emerged  as  a  serious  contender  for 
national  leadership.  The  BJP  advocated  a  blend  of  Hindu 
nationalism  that  inserted  religious  issues  into  the  heart  of 
national  political  debates,  unlike  the  secular  ideology  that  offi- 
cially dominated  Indian  political  thought  after  independence. 
In  the  early  1990s,  however,  the  Congress,  after  having  entered 
its  second  century  of  dominance  over  the  Indian  political  land- 
scape, continued  to  hold  on  to  power  with  a  middle-of-the-road 
message  and  smaller  majorities. 

The  federal  structure  of  India,  embodied  in  the  constitution 
of  1951,  attempts  to  strike  a  balance  between  a  strong  central 
government  and  the  autonomous  governments  of  the 
nation-sized  states,  each  with  a  distinct  culture  and  deep  histor- 
ical roots,  that  make  up  the  union.  A  formidable  array  of  pow- 
ers at  the  center  makes  it  possible  for  the  central  government 
to  intervene  in  state  issues;  these  powers  include  control  over 
the  military,  the  presence  of  an  appointed  governor  to  monitor 
affairs  within  each  state,  and  the  ability  of  the  president  to  sus- 
pend state-level  legislatures  in  times  of  internal  disorder  and 
declare  direct  President's  Rule.  In  theory,  these  powers  should 
come  into  play  rarely  because  the  regular  administration  of  the 
states  resides  with  elected  assemblies  and  chief  ministers 
appointed  through  parliamentary  procedures.  State  govern- 
ments have  extensive  powers  over  almost  all  of  their  internal 
affairs.  The  framers  of  the  national  constitution  constructed  a 
series  of  checks  and  balances  among  the  legislative,  executive, 
and  judicial  branches  at  the  center,  and  between  the  center 
and  the  states,  designed  to  provide  national  security  while 
allowing  a  maximum  of  state  autonomy  within  the  diversified 
union. 

The  Indian  political  system  has  proven  to  be  flexible  and 
durable,  but  major  internal  conflicts  have  threatened  the  con- 
stitution. In  practice,  the  elected  office  of  the  nation's  presi- 
dent has  gravitated  toward  the  formal  and  ritual  aspects  of 
executive  power,  while  the  office  of  the  prime  minister,  backed 
up  by  a  majority  in  Parliament,  the  cabinet,  national  security 
forces,  and  the  bureaucracy  of  the  Indian  Administrative  Ser- 
vice, has  wielded  the  actual  power.  The  national  Parliament  has 
not  developed  an  independent  committee  structure  and  criti- 
cal tradition  that  could  stand  against  the  force  of  the  executive 
branch.  The  judiciary,  while  remaining  independent  and  at 
times  crucial  in  determining  national  policy,  has  stayed  in  the 


xliii 


background  and  is  subject  to  future  change  through  constitu- 
tional amendments.  The  constitution  itself  has  been  subject  to 
numerous  amendments  since  its  adoption  in  1950.  By  August 
1996,  the  constitution  had  been  amended  eighty  times. 

National  politics  have  become  contests  to  set  up  the  appoint- 
ment of  the  prime  minister,  who  then  has  considerable  power 
to  interfere  directly  or  through  a  cooperative  president  in  all 
aspects  of  national  life.  The  most  drastic  example  of  this  power 
occurred  in  1975,  when  Indira  Gandhi  implemented  the  con- 
stitutional provision  for  a  declaration  of  Emergency,  suspend- 
ing civil  rights  for  eighteen  months,  using  Parliament  as  a  tool 
for  eliminating  opposition,  and  ruling  with  the  aid  of  a  small 
circle  of  advisers.  The  more  common  form  of  executive  inter- 
ference has  been  the  suspension  of  state  legislatures  under  a 
variety  of  pretexts  and  the  implementation  of  President's  Rule. 
This  typically  has  occurred  when  opposition  parties  have  cap- 
tured state  legislatures  and  set  in  motion  policies  unfavorable 
to  the  prime  minister's  party.  After  Indira  Gandhi's  assassina- 
tion in  1984,  her  successors  engaged  in  such  overt  acts  of  inter- 
ference less  often. 

The  main  opposition  to  the  national  executive  comes  from 
the  states,  in  a  variety  of  legal  and  extralegal  struggles  for 
regional  autonomy.  Most  of  the  states  have  developed  specific 
political  identities  based  on  forms  of  ethnicity  that  claim  a  long 
historical  past.  The  most  common  identifying  characteristic  is 
language.  Agitation  in  what  became  the  state  of  Andhra 
Pradesh  led  the  way  in  the  1950s,  resulting  in  the  reorganiza- 
tion of  state  boundaries  along  linguistic  lines.  Agitations  in  the 
state  of  Tamil  Nadu  in  the  1960s  resulted  in  domination  of  the 
state  by  parties  dedicated  officially  to  Tamil  nationalism. 

In  the  northeast,  regional  struggles  have  coalesced  around 
tribal  identities,  leading  to  the  formation  of  a  number  of  small 
states  based  on  dominant  tribal  groupings.  Farther  south,  in 
Kerala  and  West  Bengal,  communist  parties  have  upheld  the 
banner  of  regionalism  by  capturing  state  assemblies  and  imple- 
menting radical  socialist  programs  against  the  wishes  of  the 
central  government. 

The  regional  movements  most  threatening  to  national  inte- 
gration have  occurred  in  the  northwest.  The  state  of  Punjab 
was  divided  by  the  Indian  government  twice  after  indepen- 
dence— Haryana  and  Himachal  Pradesh  were  sliced  off — 
before  it  achieved  a  Sikh  majority  population  in  what  remained 
of  Punjab.  That  majority  allowed  the  Sikh-led  Akali  Dal  (Eter- 


xliv 


nal  Party)  to  capture  the  state  assembly  in  the  early  1980s.  By 
then  radical  separatist  elements  were  determined  to  fight  for 
an  independent  Sikh  Punjab.  The  result  was  an  army  attack  on 
Sikh  militants  occupying  the  Golden  Temple  in  Amritsar, 
Indira  Gandhi's  assassination  by  her  Sikh  bodyguards,  both  in 
1984,  and  a  ten-year  internal  security  struggle  that  has  killed 
thousands.  In  India's  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (often 
referred  to  as  Kashmir),  where  Muslims  constitute  the  majority 
of  the  population,  regional  struggle  takes  a  different  religious 
form  and  has  created  intense  security  problems  that  keep  bilat- 
eral relations  with  Pakistan,  which  also  lays  claim  to  Kashmir,  in 
a  tense  mode. 

The  central  government  usually  has  been  able  to  defuse 
regional  agitations  by  agreeing  to  redefinition  of  state  bound- 
aries or  by  guaranteeing  differing  degrees  of  regional  auton- 
omy, including  acquiescence  in  the  control  of  the  state 
government  by  regional  political  parties.  This  strategy  defused 
the  original  linguistic  agitations  through  the  1970s,  and  led  to 
the  resolution  of  the  destructive  political  and  ethnic  crises  in 
Assam  in  the  mid-1980s.  When  national  security  interests  came 
into  play,  however,  as  in  Punjab  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  the 
central  government  did  not  hesitate  to  use  force. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  India  remains  a  strong  unified  nation,  with 
a  long  history  of  constitutional  government  and  democracy, 
but  at  any  moment  there  are  half  a  dozen  regional  political  agi- 
tations underway  and  a  dozen  guerrilla  movements  in  different 
parts  of  the  country  advocating  various  types  of  official  recogni- 
tion or  outright  independence  based  on  ethnic  affiliation.  The 
unity  of  the  country  as  a  whole  has  never  been  seriously  threat- 
ened by  these  movements.  Because  the  benefits  of  union 
within  India  have  outweighed  the  advantages  of  independence 
for  most  people  within  each  state,  there  have  always  been  mod- 
erate elements  within  the  states  willing  to  make  deals  with  the 
central  government,  and  security  forces  have  proven  capable  of 
repressing  any  armed  struggle  at  the  regional  level.  In  addi- 
tion, state-level  opposition,  whether  in  the  legislatures  or  in  the 
streets,  has  been  an  effective  means  of  preventing  massive 
interference  from  New  Delhi  in  the  day-to-day  lives  of  citizens, 
and  thus  has  provided  a  crucial  check  that  has  preserved  the 
democratic  system  and  the  constitution. 

One  of  the  most  serious  challenges  to  India's  internal  secu- 
rity and  democratic  traditions  has  come  from  so-called  commu- 
nal disorders,  or  riots,  based  on  ethnic  cleavages.  The  most 


xlv 


typical  form  is  a  religious  riot,  mostly  between  Hindus  and 
Muslims,  although  some  of  these  disturbances  also  occur 
between  different  castes  or  linguistic  groups.  Most  of  these 
struggles  start  with  neighborhood  squabbles  of  little  signifi- 
cance, but  rapidly  escalate  into  mob  looting  and  burning, 
street  fighting,  and  violent  intervention  by  the  police  or  para- 
military forces. 

Religious  ideology  has  played  only  a  small  part  in  these 
events.  Instead,  the  pressures  of  urban  life  in  overcrowded, 
poorer  neighborhoods,  combined  with  competition  for  limited 
economic  opportunities,  create  an  environment  in  which  eth- 
nic differences  become  convenient  labels  for  defining  enemies, 
and  criminal  behavior  becomes  commonplace.  Whether 
ignited  by  a  street  accident  or  a  major  political  event,  passions 
in  these  areas  may  be  directed  into  mob  action.  However,  after 
the  catastrophe  of  independence  (when  hundreds  of  thou- 
sands in  North  India  died  during  the  partition  of  India  and 
Pakistan  and  at  least  12  million  became  refugees),  and  because 
the  pattern  of  rioting  has  continued  annually  in  various  cities,  a 
culture  of  distrust  has  grown  up  among  a  sizable  minority  of 
Hindus  and  Muslims.  This  distrust  has  manifested  itself  in  the 
nationwide  agitations  fomented  by  elements  of  the  BJP  and 
communal  Hindu  parties  in  the  early  1990s.  It  reached  a  peak 
in  December  1992  with  the  dramatic  destruction  of  the  Babri 
Masjid,  a  mosque  in  Ayodhya  (in  Uttar  Pradesh),  and  commu- 
nal riots  and  bombings  in  major  cities  throughout  India  in 
early  1993.  In  this  manner,  the  frictions  of  daily  life  in  an  over- 
crowded, poor  nation  have  had  a  major  impact  on  the  national 
political  agenda. 

The  internal  conflict  between  Hindus  and  Muslims  has 
received  some  of  its  stimulus  since  1947  from  the  international 
conflict  between  India  and  Pakistan.  One  of  the  great  tragedies 
of  the  freedom  struggle  was  the  relentless  polarization  of  opin- 
ion between  the  Congress,  which  came  to  represent  mostly 
Hindus,  and  the  All-India  Muslim  League  (Muslim  League — 
see  Glossary),  which  eventually  stood  behind  a  demand  for  a 
separate  homeland  for  a  Muslim  majority.  This  division, 
encouraged  under  British  rule  by  provisions  for  separate  elec- 
torates for  Muslims,  led  to  the  partition  of  Pakistan  from  India 
and  the  outbreak  of  hostilities  over  Kashmir.  Warfare  between 
India  and  Pakistan  occurred  in  1947,  1965,  and  1971;  the  last 
conflict  led  to  the  independence  of  Bangladesh  (formerly  East 
Pakistan)  and  a  major  strategic  victory  by  India.

The  perception  of  Pakistan  as  an  enemy  nation  has  over- 
shadowed all  other  Indian  foreign  policy  considerations 
because  neither  country  has  relinquished  claims  over  Kashmir, 
and  a  series  of  border  irritations  continue  to  bedevil  attempts 
at  rapprochement.  In  the  late  1980s,  tensions  over  large-scale 
military  maneuvers  almost  led  to  war,  and  regular  fighting  over 
glacial  wastelands  in  Kashmir  continues  to  keep  the  pressure 
high.  An  added  dimension  emerged  in  1987  when  Pakistan 
publicly  admitted  that  it  possessed  nuclear  weapons  capability, 
matching  Indian  nuclear  capabilities  demonstrated  in  1974.  In 
the  mid-1990s,  both  nations  continue  to  devote  a  large  percent- 
age of  their  military  budgets  to  developing  or  to  purchasing 
advanced  weaponry,  which  is  mostly  aimed  at  each  other — a 
serious  drain  of  resources  needed  for  economic  growth. 

Nehru  and  the  early  leadership  of  independent  India  had 
envisioned  a  nation  at  peace  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  in  keep- 
ing with  Gandhian  ideals  and  socialist  goals.  Under  Nehru's 
guidance,  India  distanced  itself  from  Cold  War  politics  and 
played  a  major  part  in  the  Nonaligned  Movement  (see  Glos- 
sary). Until  the  early  1960s,  India  spent  relatively  little  on 
national  defense  and  enjoyed  an  excellent  relationship  with 
the  United  States,  a  relationship  that  peaked  in  John  F. 
Kennedy's  presidency.  India's  strategic  position  changed  after 
China  defeated  the  Indian  army  in  the  border  war  of  1962  and 
war  with  Pakistan  occurred  in  1965.  During  this  period,  the  sit- 
uation became  more  precarious  because  India  had  opponents 
on  two  fronts.  In  addition,  Pakistan  began  to  receive  substantial 
amounts  of  military  assistance  from  the  United  States,  ostensi- 
bly to  support  anticommunism,  but  it  was  no  secret  that  most 
of  the  weapons  purchased  with  United  States  aid  were  a  deter- 
rent projected  against  India.  Under  these  circumstances,  India 
began  to  move  closer  to  the  Soviet  Union,  purchasing  outright 
large  amounts  of  military  hardware  or  making  agreements  to 
produce  it  indigenously. 

Relations  between  the  United  States  and  India  reached  a  low 
point  in  1971  during  the  Bangladesh  war  of  independence, 
when  a  United  States  naval  force  entered  the  Bay  of  Bengal  to 
show  support  for  Pakistan  although  doing  nothing  to  forestall 
its  defeat.  This  display  of  force,  which  could  not  be  opposed  by 
India  or  the  Soviet  Union,  served  only  to  strain  the  relationship 
between  India  and  the  United  States  and  heightened  Cold  War 
tensions  in  South  Asia.  During  the  1970s,  as  the  United  States 
and  China  improved  relations  and  China  became  closer  in 


xlvii 


turn  to  Pakistan,  India's  strategic  position  became  more 
entwined  with  Cold  War  issues,  and  the  Soviet  connection 
became  even  more  important.  These  international  postures 
contrasted  dramatically  with  the  increasing  importance  to 
India  of  American  scientific  and  economic  links,  which  were 
strengthened  by  the  increasing  emigration  of  Indian  citizens  to 
North  America.  The  overall  result,  however,  was  India's  weaker 
international  situation  in  the  view  of  some  Americans. 

During  the  1980s,  then,  India  was  still  officially  a  nonaligned 
nation  but  in  fact  found  itself  deeply  embedded  in  Cold  War 
strategy.  India's  reaction  to  the  Soviet  occupation  of  Afghani- 
stan was  a  disquieting  feature  of  Indian  foreign  policy,  in  that 
India  decried  the  Soviet  military  presence  but  did  nothing 
against  it.  Continued  United  States  support  for  Pakistan,  plus 
the  buildup  of  United  States  strike  forces  on  the  small  island  of 
Diego  Garcia  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  heightened  tensions.  It  was 
no  coincidence,  therefore,  that  the  1980s  witnessed  a  major 
expansion  of  Indian  naval  forces,  with  the  addition  of  two  air- 
craft carriers,  a  submarine  fleet,  and  major  surface  ships, 
including  transport  craft.  But  although  the  Indian  buildup 
made  the  United  States  unhappy,  India's  technological  capaci- 
ties remained  inferior  to  those  of  the  United  States  Navy,  and 
the  Indian  navy  was  never  a  large  threat  to  United  States  inter- 
ests. Instead,  the  growth  of  the  Indian  navy  had  major  implica- 
tions for  the  regional  balance  of  power  within  South  Asia.  The 
Indian  navy  could  potentially  create  a  second  front  against 
Pakistan  should  major  hostilities  recur. 

India's  military  buildup  allowed  it  to  intervene  in  low-inten- 
sity conflicts  throughout  South  Asia.  From  1987  to  1990,  the 
Indian  Peace  Keeping  Force  of  more  than  60,000  personnel 
was  active  in  Sri  Lanka  and  became  embroiled  in  a  fruitless  war 
against  Tamil  separatist  guerrillas.  And,  in  1988  Indian  forces 
briefly  intervened  in  Maldives  to  prevent  a  coup.  Regular  bor- 
der problems  with  Bangladesh  after  1971,  the  Indian  annex- 
ation of  Sikkim  in  1975,  and  the  1989  closure  of  the  border 
with  Nepal  over  economic  disagreements  all  added  up  to  the 
picture  of  a  big  country  bullying  its  smaller  neighbors,  a  vision 
Indian  leaders  took  great  pains  to  dispel.  Thus,  even  though 
the  country  officially  remained  at  peace  during  the  1980s, 
India's  growing  military  power  and  the  intersecting  problems 
of  regional  dominance  and  Cold  War  ambivalence  drove  an 
ambitious  foreign  policy.

The  Indian  strategic  position  changed  dramatically  in  the 
early  1990s.  The  end  of  the  Cold  War,  and  then  the  disintegra- 
tion of  the  Soviet  Union  itself,  deprived  India  of  a  great  ally  but 
also  put  a  stop  to  many  of  the  worldwide  tensions  that  had 
relentlessly  pulled  India  into  global  alignments.  When  the 
United  States  cut  off  military  aid  to  Pakistan  in  1990,  it  defused 
one  of  the  most  intractable  barriers  to  good  relations  with 
India.  Then,  in  1992,  the  Persian  Gulf  War  against  Iraq 
brought  India  grudgingly  into  an  alignment  with  both  Pakistan 
and  the  United  States,  a  connection  strengthened  in  1994 
when  troops  from  all  three  nations  cooperated  in  Somalia 
under  the  aegis  of  the  United  Nations. 

The  possession  of  nuclear  weapons  by  Pakistan  and  India 
immersed  them  in  a  familiar  scenario  of  mutually  assured 
destruction  and  made  it  more  problematic  for  India,  despite  its 
military  superiority,  to  overrun  Pakistan.  Thus,  in  the  mid- 
1990s,  despite  continuing  hostility  over  Kashmir,  which  intensi- 
fied as  the  internal  situation  there  disintegrated  in  the  1990s, 
the  long-term  possibilities  for  official  peace  between  the  two 
countries  remained  good.  Threats  from  other  South  Asian 
nations  were  negligible.  Issues  with  China  were  unresolved  but 
not  very  significant.  No  other  country  in  the  world  presented  a 
strategic  threat.  As  budgetary  problems  beset  the  government 
in  the  mid-1990s,  therefore,  the  Indian  military  began  cut- 
backs. The  military  also  expanded  contacts  with  a  variety  of 
other  nations,  including  Russia  and  the  United  States.  India 
hence  has  entered  a  period  of  relative  security  and  multilateral 
contacts  quite  different  from  its  twenty-five-year  Cold  War 
immersion. 

India  is  a  complex  geographic,  historical,  religious,  social, 
economic,  and  political  entity.  India  is  one  of  the  oldest  human 
civilizations  and  yet  displays  no  cultural  features  common  to  all 
its  members.  It  is  one  of  the  richest  nations  in  history,  but  most 
of  its  people  are  among  the  poorest  in  the  world.  Its  ideology 
rests  on  some  of  the  most  sublime  concepts  of  humanism  and 
nonviolence,  but  deep-seated  discrimination  and  violent 
responses  are  daily  news.  It  has  one  of  the  world's  most  stable 
political  structures,  but  that  structure  is  constantly  in  crisis. 
The  nation  is  seeking  a  type  of  great  power  status,  but  no  one  is 
sure  what  that  involves.  India,  in  the  end,  defies  easy  analysis.

The  most  notable  event  that  occurred  in  India  after  the 
manuscript  for  this  book  was  completed  in  the  summer  of  1995 
was  the  nationwide  general  elections  for  the  Lok  Sabha,  the 
lower  house  of  Parliament,  held  in  April  and  May  1996.  The 
elections  were  held  in  the  wake  of  a  US$18  million  bribery 
scandal  and  resignations  involving  seven  cabinet  members  and 
numerous  others.  Prime  Minister  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao,  leader 
of  the  ruling  Congress  (I),  was  accused  of  accepting  substantial 
bribes.  Lai  Krishna  Advani,  head  of  the  BJP,  the  leading  opposi- 
tion party,  was  arrested  for  his  alleged  acceptance  of  bribes.  For 
many  voters,  this  scandal  was  the  culmination  of  scandals  and 
corruption  associated  for  years  with  old-guard  politicians. 

The  world's  largest  democracy  went  to  the  polls,  except  in 
Jammu  and  Kashmir,  over  three  days  between  April  27  and  May 
7  with  nearly  14,700  candidates  from  522  parties  running  for 
543  of  the  545  Lok  Sabha  seats  (the  other  two  seats  are  filled 
with  Anglo-Indians  appointed  by  the  president).  Some  16,900 
others  vied  for  914  seats  in  six  state  and  union  territory  assem- 
bly elections.  The  candidates  were  as  diverse  as  ever,  with  a 
plethora  of  Backward  Class  candidates  rising  to  challenge  high- 
caste  hopefuls.  Prominent  among  them  was  Janata  Dal  Party 
candidate  Laloo  Prasad  Yadev,  the  chief  minister  of  Bihar,  who 
ran  on  an  anti-Brahman  caste  platform.  Phoolan  Devi,  a 
former  convicted  outlaw,  who  became  world-famous  as  India's 
"Bandit  Queen,"  also  successfully  ran  for  office.  One  highly 
favored  potential  candidate  who  decided  not  to  run  was  Sonia 
Gandhi,  widow  of  Rajiv  Gandhi,  daughter-in-law  of  Indira  Gan- 
dhi, and  granddaughter-in-law  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru.  She 
resisted  the  honor  amidst  tensions  between  herself  and  Rao 
and,  in  the  minds  of  some  observers,  ended  the  Nehru-Gandhi 
dynasty  while  sealing  the  fate  of  the  Congress  (I) . 

Some  60  percent  of  India's  590  million  voters  turned  out, 
but  failed  to  elect  a  majority  government.  The  BJP,  which  had 
tried  to  tone  down  its  Hindu  nationalist  rhetoric,  won  with  its 
allies  194,  or  37  percent,  of  the  seats  announced  on  May  10. 
The  Congress  (I)  won  136,  or  25  percent,  of  the  seats.  The 
National  Front-Left  Front  won  110  seats  (21  percent),  with  the 
remaining  ninety-four  seats  (17  percent)  going  to  unaligned 
regional  parties,  independents,  and  others.  The  Congress, 
which  had  held  national  power  for  all  but  four  years  since 
1947,  received  the  lowest  votes  ever  as  many  of  its  traditional 
Muslim  and  low-caste  constituents  defected  to  other  parties 
and  high-caste  voters  sided  with  the  BJP.

After  thirteen  days  in  office  as  the  head  of  a  BJP  minority 
government,  Prime  Minister  Atal  Bihari  Vajpayee  resigned  on 
May  28,  three  days  before  a  vote  of  no  confidence  would  have 
brought  down  his  government.  He  was  succeeded  as  India's 
eleventh  prime  minister  by  the  chief  minister  of  Karnataka,  the 
Janata  Dai's  Haradanahalli  (H.D.)  Deve  Gowda,  who  headed  a 
minority  coalition  with  thirteen  parties — the  United  Front — 
made  up  of  some  members  of  the  National  Front,  the  Left 
Front,  and  regional  parties.  Deve  Gowda,  a  sixty-three-year-old 
civil  engineer  of  middle-class,  lower-caste  farmer  background, 
proclaimed  the  United  Front  as  representative  of  India's  great 
diversity  and  reaffirmed  his  commitment  to  modern  India's 
secular  heritage. 

Although  the  Congress  is  not  part  of  the  left-center  coali- 
tion, the  United  Front  is  dependent  on  it  for  survival.  The 
United  Front  sought  Congress  and  bipartisan  support  by 
declaring  that  the  economic  reforms  started  by  the  Congress 
were  "irreversible"  and  committing  itself  to  continued  reforms 
and  attracting  foreign  investment.  Despite  the  Congress's  elec- 
toral debacle,  the  party  continued  to  be  an  important  behind- 
the-scenes  force  in  the  new  government.  Former  Prime  Minis- 
ter Rao's  legal  problems  led  him  to  resign  as  president  of  the 
Congress  in  September  1996.  His  successor,  Sitaram  Kesri, 
pledged  to  continue  backing  the  coalition. 

Because  of  continuing  unrest  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  long- 
awaited  special  elections  for  six  Lok  Sabha  seats  were  held 
under  tight  security  between  May  7  and  30.  The  central  govern- 
ment's Election  Commission  proclaimed  that  the  elections 
were  "relatively  free  and  fair"  despite  the  efforts  of  militants 
and  separatists  to  sabotage  them.  There  were  widespread 
reports,  however,  that  Indian  security  forces  had  coerced  peo- 
ple into  voting.  In  September  state-level  elections  were  held  in 
Jammu  and  Kashmir  for  the  first  time  in  nine  years.  Farooq 
Abdullah's  National  Conference  party  won  the  violence-prone 
contest. 

In  foreign  affairs,  India  and  Pakistan  continued  to  seek  ways 
to  reduce  tensions  between  the  two  nations.  Deve  Gowda 
offered  conciliatory  signs  to  Benazir  Bhutto,  his  counterpart  in 
Islamabad,  as  the  two  sides  moved  toward  high-level  talks. 
Despite  the  opposition  of  the  United  States  and  the  withdrawal 
of  technical  support  from  Russia,  in  April  1996  India  com- 
pleted its  own  design  of  a  7.5-ton  cryogenic  engine  capable  of 
launching  rockets  with  2,500-kilogram  payloads.  Such  a  devel- 


li 


opment  was  a  major  technological  advance  for  Indian  science 
and  gave  India  the  potential  to  move  into  the  company  of  the 
other  space-exploring  nations.  India  continued  to  maintain  its 
stand  in  regard  to  nuclear  weapons  proliferation  and  in  August 
1996  refused  to  ratify  the  United  Nations-sponsored  Compre- 
hensive Test  Ban  Treaty  unless  the  treaty  required  the  destruc- 
tion  of  the  world's  existing  nuclear  weapons  within  a 
prescribed  period.  To  concur  with  the  treaty  as  it  stood,  some 
Indian  observers  felt,  would  limit  the  country's  sovereignty. 
Meanwhile,  several  senior  active-duty  and  retired  military  and 
foreign  servicers  proposed  that  India  should  formally  declare 
itself  a  nuclear-weapons  state  and  give  a  "no-first-use"  assur- 
ance.

THOSE  "WHO  WEAR  COTTON  CLOTHES,  use  the  decimal 
system,  enjoy  the  taste  of  [curried]  chicken,  play  chess,  or  roll 
dice,  and  seek  peace  of  mind  or  tranquility  through  medita- 
tion," writes  historian  Stanley  Wolpert,  "are  indebted  to  India." 
India's  deep-rooted  civilization  may  appear  exotic  or  even 
inscrutable  to  casual  foreign  observers,  but  a  perceptive  indi- 
vidual can  see  its  evolution,  shaped  by  a  wide  range  of  factors: 
extreme  climatic  conditions,  a  bewildering  diversity  of  people, 
a  host  of  competing  political  overlords  (both  local  and  outsid- 
ers), enduring  religious  and  philosophical  beliefs,  and  com- 
plex linguistic  and  literary  developments  that  led  to  the 
flowering  of  regional  and  pan-Indian  culture  during  the  last 
three  millennia.  The  interplay  among  a  variety  of  political  and 
socioeconomic  forces  has  created  a  complex  amalgam  of  cul- 
tures that  continue  amidst  conflict;  compromise,  and  adapta- 
tion. "Wherever  we  turn,"  says  Wolpert,  "we  find  .  .  .  palaces, 
temples,  mosques,  Victorian  railroad  stations,  Buddhist  stupas, 
Mauryan  pillars;  each  century  has  its  unique  testaments,  often 
standing  incongruously  close  to  ruins  of  another  era,  some- 
times juxtaposed  one  atop  another,  much  like  the  ruins  of 
Rome,  or  Bath." 

India's  "great  cycle  of  history,"  as  Professor  Hugh  Tinker  put 
it,  entails  repeating  themes  that  continue  to  add  complexity 
and  diversity  to  the  cultural  matrix.  Throughout  its  history, 
India  has  undergone  innumerable  episodes  involving  military 
conquests  and  integration,  cultural  infusion  and  assimilation, 
political  unification  and  fragmentation,  religious  toleration 
and  conflict,  and  communal  harmony  and  violence.  A  few 
other  regions  in  the  world  also  can  claim  such  a  vast  and  differ- 
entiated historical  experience,  but  Indian  civilization  seems  to 
have  endured  the  trials  of  time  the  longest.  India  has  proven  its 
remarkable  resilience  and  its  innate  ability  to  reconcile  oppos- 
ing elements  from  many  indigenous  and  foreign  cultures. 
Unlike  the  West,  where  modern  political  developments  and 
industrialization  have  created  a  more  secular  worldview  with 
redefined  roles  and  values  for  individuals  and  families,  India 
remains  largely  a  traditional  society,  in  which  change  seems 
only  superficial.  Although  India  is  the  world's  largest  democ- 
racy and  the  seventh-most  industrialized  country  in  the  world, 
the  underpinnings  of  India's  civilization  stem  primarily  from  its

own  social  structure,  religious  beliefs,  philosophical  outlook, 
and  cultural  values.  The  continuity  of  those  time-honed  tradi- 
tional ways  of  life  has  provided  unique  and  fascinating  patterns 
in  the  tapestry  of  contemporary  Indian  civilization. 

Antecedents 

Harappan  Culture 

The  earliest  imprints  of  human  activities  in  India  go  back  to 
the  Paleolithic  Age,  roughly  between  400,000  and  200,000  B.C. 
Stone  implements  and  cave  paintings  from  this  period  have 
been  discovered  in  many  parts  of  the  South  Asia  (see  fig.  1). 
Evidence  of  domestication  of  animals,  the  adoption  of  agricul- 
ture, permanent  village  settlements,  and  wheel-turned  pottery 
dating  from  the  middle  of  the  sixth  millennium  B.C.  has  been 
found  in  the  foothills  of  Sindh  and  Baluchistan  (or  Balochistan 
in  current  Pakistani  usage),  both  in  present-day  Pakistan.  One 
of  the  first  great  civilizations — with  a  writing  system,  urban  cen- 
ters, and  a  diversified  social  and  economic  system — -appeared 
around  3,000  B.C.  along  the  Indus  River  valley  in  Punjab  (see 
Glossary)  and  Sindh.  It  covered  more  than  800,000  square  kilo- 
meters, from  the  borders  of  Baluchistan  to  the  deserts  of  Rajas- 
than,  from  the  Himalayan  foothills  to  the  southern  tip  of 
Gujarat  (see  fig.  2).  The  remnants  of  two  major  cities — 
Mohenjo-daro  and  Harappa — reveal  remarkable  engineering 
feats  of  uniform  urban  planning  and  carefully  executed  layout, 
water  supply,  and  drainage.  Excavations  at  these  sites  and  later 
archaeological  digs  at  about  seventy  other  locations  in  India 
and  Pakistan  provide  a  composite  picture  of  what  is  now  gener- 
ally known  as  Harappan  culture  (2500-1600  B.C.). 

The  major  cities  contained  a  few  large  buildings  including  a 
citadel,  a  large  bath — perhaps  for  personal  and  communal 
ablution — differentiated  living  quarters,  flat-roofed  brick 
houses,  and  fortified  administrative  or  religious  centers  enclos- 
ing meeting  halls  and  granaries.  Essentially  a  city  culture, 
Harappan  life  was  supported  by  extensive  agricultural  produc- 
tion and  by  commerce,  which  included  trade  with  Sumer  in 
southern  Mesopotamia  (modern  Iraq).  The  people  made  tools 
and  weapons  from  copper  and  bronze  but  not  iron.  Cotton  was 
woven  and  dyed  for  clothing;  wheat,  rice,  and  a  variety  of  vege- 
tables and  fruits  were  cultivated;  and  a  number  of  animals, 
including  the  humped  bull,  were  domesticated.  Harappan  cul- 
ture was  conservative  and  remained  relatively  unchanged  for 


4 


Historical  Setting 


centuries;  whenever  cities  were  rebuilt  after  periodic  flooding, 
the  new  level  of  construction  closely  followed  the  previous  pat- 
tern. Although  stability,  regularity,  and  conservatism  seem  to 
have  been  the  hallmarks  of  this  people,  it  is  unclear  who 
wielded  authority,  whether  an  aristocratic,  priestly,  or  commer- 
cial minority. 

By  far  the  most  exquisite  but  most  obscure  Harappan  arti- 
facts unearthed  to  date  are  steatite  seals  found  in  abundance  at 
Mohenjo-daro.  These  small,  flat,  and  mostly  square  objects  with 
human  or  animal  motifs  provide  the  most  accurate  picture 
there  is  of  Harappan  life.  They  also  have  inscriptions  generally 
thought  to  be  in  the  Harappan  script,  which  has  eluded  schol- 
arly attempts  at  deciphering  it.  Debate  abounds  as  to  whether 
the  script  represents  numbers  or  an  alphabet,  and,  if  an  alpha- 
bet, whether  it  is  proto-Dravidian  or  proto-Sanskrit  (see  Lan- 
guages of  India,  ch.  4). 

The  possible  reasons  for  the  decline  of  Harappan  civilization 
have  long  troubled  scholars.  Invaders  from  central  and  western 
Asia  are  considered  by  some  historians  to  have  been  the 
"destroyers"  of  Harappan  cities,  but  this  view  is  open  to  reinter- 
pretation.  More  plausible  explanations  are  recurrent  floods 
caused  by  tectonic  earth  movement,  soil  salinity,  and  desertifi- 
cation. 

Vedic  Aryans 

A  series  of  migrations  by  Indo-European-speaking  semino- 
mads  took  place  during  the  second  millennium  B.C.  Known  as 
Aryans,  these  preliterate  pastoralists  spoke  an  early  form  of 
Sanskrit,  which  has  close  philological  similarities  to  other  Indo- 
European  languages,  such  as  Avestan  in  Iran  and  ancient 
Greek  and  Latin.  The  term  Aryan  meant  pure  and  implied  the 
invaders'  conscious  attempts  at  retaining  their  tribal  identity 
and  roots  while  maintaining  a  social  distance  from  earlier 
inhabitants. 

Although  archaeology  has  not  yielded  proof  of  the  identity 
of  the  Aryans,  the  evolution  and  spread  of  their  culture  across 
the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  is  generally  undisputed  (see  Principal 
Regions,  ch.  2).  Modern  knowledge  of  the  early  stages  of  this 
process  rests  on  a  body  of  sacred  texts:  the  four  Vedas  (collec- 
tions of  hymns,  prayers,  and  liturgy),  the  Brahmanas  and  the 
Upanishads  (commentaries  on  Vedic  rituals  and  philosophical 
treatises),  and  the  Puranas  (traditional  mythic-historical 
works).  The  sanctity  accorded  to  these  texts  and  the  manner  of

their  preservation  over  several  millennia — by  an  unbroken  oral 
tradition — make  them  part  of  the  living  Hindu  tradition  (see 
Themes  in  Indian  Society,  ch.  5). 

These  sacred  texts  offer  guidance  in  piecing  together  Aryan 
beliefs  and  activities.  The  Aryans  were  a  pantheistic  people,  fol- 
lowing their  tribal  chieftain  or  raja,  engaging  in  wars  with  each 
other  or  with  other  alien  ethnic  groups,  and  slowly  becoming 
settled  agriculturalists  with  consolidated  territories  and  differ- 
entiated occupations.  Their  skills  in  using  horse-drawn  chariots 
and  their  knowledge  of  astronomy  and  mathematics  gave  them 
a  military  and  technological  advantage  that  led  others  to 
accept  their  social  customs  and  religious  beliefs  (see  Science 
and  Technology,  ch.  6).  By  around  1,000  B.C.,  Aryan  culture 
had  spread  over  most  of  India  north  of  the  Vindhya  Range  and 


6 


Historical  Setting 


in  the  process  assimilated  much  from  other  cultures  that  pre- 
ceded it  (see  The  Roots  of  Indian  Religion,  ch.  3). 

The  Aryans  brought  with  them  a  new  language,  a  new  pan- 
theon of  anthropomorphic  gods,  a  patrilineal  and  patriarchal 
family  system,  and  a  new  social  order,  built  on  the  religious  and 
philosophical  rationales  of  varnashramadharma.  Although  pre- 
cise translation  into  English  is  difficult,  the  concept  varnashra- 
madharma, the  bedrock  of  Indian  traditional  social 
organization,  is  built  on  three  fundamental  notions:  varna 
(originally,  "color,"  but  later  taken  to  mean  social  class — see 
Glossary),  ashrama  (stages  of  life  such  as  youth,  family  life, 
detachment  from  the  material  world,  and  renunciation),  and 
dharma  (duty,  righteousness,  or  sacred  cosmic  law).  The 
underlying  belief  is  that  present  happiness  and  future  salvation 
are  contingent  upon  one's  ethical  or  moral  conduct;  therefore, 
both  society  and  individuals  are  expected  to  pursue  a  diverse 
but  righteous  path  deemed  appropriate  for  everyone  based  on 
one's  birth,  age,  and  station  in  life  (see  Caste  and  Class,  ch.  5). 
The  original  three-tiered  society — Brahman  (priest;  see  Glos- 
sary), Kshatriya  (warrior),  and  Vaishya  (commoner) — eventu- 
ally expanded  into  four  in  order  to  absorb  the  subjugated 
people — Shudra  (servant) — or  even  five,  when  the  outcaste 
peoples  are  considered  (see  Varna,  Caste,  and  Other  Divisions, 
ch.  5). 

The  basic  unit  of  Aryan  society  was  the  extended  and  patriar- 
chal family.  A  cluster  of  related  families  constituted  a  village, 
while  several  villages  formed  a  tribal  unit.  Child  marriage,  as 
practiced  in  later  eras,  was  uncommon,  but  the  partners' 
involvement  in  the  selection  of  a  mate  and  dowry  and  bride- 
price  were  customary.  The  birth  of  a  son  was  welcome  because 
he  could  later  tend  the  herds,  bring  honor  in  battle,  offer  sacri- 
fices to  the  gods,  and  inherit  property  and  pass  on  the  family 
name.  Monogamy  was  widely  accepted  although  polygamy  was 
not  unknown,  and  even  polyandry  is  mentioned  in  later  writ- 
ings. Ritual  suicide  of  widows  was  expected  at  a  husband's 
death,  and  this  might  have  been  the  beginning  of  the  practice 
known  as  sati  in  later  centuries,  when  the  widow  actually  burnt 
herself  on  her  husband's  funeral  pyre. 

Permanent  settlements  and  agriculture  led  to  trade  and 
other  occupational  differentiation.  As  lands  along  the  Ganga 
(or  Ganges)  were  cleared,  the  river  became  a  trade  route,  the 
numerous  settlements  on  its  banks  acting  as  markets.  Trade  was 
restricted  initially  to  local  areas,  and  barter  was  an  essential 


7 


India:  A  Country  Study 

component  of  trade,  cattle  being  the  unit  of  value  in  large-scale 
transactions,  which  further  limited  the  geographical  reach  of 
the  trader.  Custom  was  law,  and  kings  and  chief  priests  were  the 
arbiters,  perhaps  advised  by  certain  elders  of  the  community. 
An  Aryan  raja,  or  king,  was  primarily  a  military  leader,  who 
took  a  share  from  the  booty  after  successful  cattle  raids  or  bat- 
tles. Although  the  rajas  had  managed  to  assert  their  authority, 
they  scrupulously  avoided  conflicts  with  priests  as  a  group, 
whose  knowledge  and  austere  religious  life  surpassed  others  in 
the  community,  and  the  rajas  compromised  their  own  interests 
with  those  of  the  priests. 

Kingdoms  and  Empires 

From  their  original  settlements  in  the  Punjab  region,  the 
Aryans  gradually  began  to  penetrate  eastward,  clearing  dense 
forests  and  establishing  "tribal"  settlements  along  the  Ganga 
and  Yamuna  (Jamuna)  plains  between  1500  and  ca.  800  B.C.  By 
around  500  B.C.,  most  of  northern  India  was  inhabited  and 
had  been  brought  under  cultivation,  facilitating  the  increasing 
knowledge  of  the  use  of  iron  implements,  including  ox-drawn 
plows,  and  spurred  by  the  growing  population  that  provided 
voluntary  and  forced  labor.  As  riverine  and  inland  trade  flour- 
ished, many  towns  along  the  Ganga  became  centers  of  trade, 
culture,  and  luxurious  living.  Increasing  population  and  sur- 
plus production  provided  the  bases  for  the  emergence  of  inde- 
pendent states  with  fluid  territorial  boundaries  over  which 
disputes  frequently  arose. 

The  rudimentary  administrative  system  headed  by  tribal 
chieftains  was  transformed  by  a  number  of  regional  republics 
or  hereditary  monarchies  that  devised  ways  to  appropriate  rev- 
enue and  to  conscript  labor  for  expanding  the  areas  of  settle- 
ment and  agriculture  farther  east  and  south,  beyond  the 
Narmada  River.  These  emergent  states  collected  revenue 
through  officials,  maintained  armies,  and  built  new  cities  and 
highways.  By  600  B.C.,  sixteen  such  territorial  powers — includ- 
ing the  Magadha,  Kosala,  Kuru,  and  Gandhara — stretched 
across  the  North  India  plains  from  modern-day  Afghanistan  to 
Bangladesh.  The  right  of  a  king  to  his  throne,  no  matter  how  it 
was  gained,  was  usually  legitimized  through  elaborate  sacrifice 
rituals  and  genealogies  concocted  by  priests  who  ascribed  to 
the  king  divine  or  superhuman  origins. 

The  victory  of  good  over  evil  is  epitomized  in  the  epic 
Ramayana  (The  Travels  of  Rama,  or  Ram  in  the  preferred  mod-

ern  form),  while  another  epic,  Mahabharata  (Great  Battle  of 
the  Descendants  of  Bharata),  spells  out  the  concept  of  dharma 
and  duty.  More  than  2,500  years  later,  Mohandas  Karamchand 
(Mahatma)  Gandhi,  the  father  of  modern  India,  used  these 
concepts  in  the  fight  for  independence  (see  Mahatma  Gandhi, 
this  ch.).  The  Mahabharata  records  the  feud  between  Aryan 
cousins  that  culminated  in  an  epic  battle  in  which  both  gods 
and  mortals  from  many  lands  allegedly  fought  to  the  death, 
and  the  Ramayana  recounts  the  kidnapping  of  Sita,  Rama's 
wife,  by  Ravana,  a  demonic  king  of  Lanka  (Sri  Lanka),  her  res- 
cue by  her  husband  (aided  by  his  animal  allies),  and  Rama's 
coronation,  leading  to  a  period  of  prosperity  and  justice.  In  the 
late  twentieth  century,  these  epics  remain  dear  to  the  hearts  of 
Hindus  and  are  commonly  read  and  enacted  in  many  settings. 
In  the  1980s  and  1990s,  Ram's  story  has  been  exploited  by 
Hindu  militants  and  politicians  to  gain  power,  and  the  much 
disputed  Ramjanmabhumi,  the  birth  site  of  Ram,  has  become 
an  extremely  sensitive  communal  issue,  potentially  pitting 
Hindu  majority  against  Muslim  minority  (see  Public  Worship, 
ch.  3;  Political  Issues,  ch.  8). 

The  Mauryan  Empire 

By  the  end  of  the  sixth  century  B.C.,  India's  northwest  was 
integrated  into  the  Persian  Achaemenid  Empire  and  became 
one  of  its  satrapies.  This  integration  marked  the  beginning  of 
administrative  contacts  between  Central  Asia  and  India. 

Although  Indian  accounts  to  a  large  extent  ignored  Alex- 
ander the  Great's  Indus  campaign  in  326  B.C.,  Greek  writers 
recorded  their  impressions  of  the  general  conditions  prevailing 
in  South  Asia  during  this  period.  Thus,  the  year  326  B.C.  pro- 
vides the  first  clear  and  historically  verifiable  date  in  Indian  his- 
tory. A  two-way  cultural  fusion  between  several  Indo-Greek 
elements — especially  in  art,  architecture,  and  coinage — 
occurred  in  the  next  several  hundred  years.  North  India's  polit- 
ical landscape  was  transformed  by  the  emergence  of  Magadha 
in  the  eastern  Indo-Gangetic  Plain.  In  322  B.C.,  Magadha, 
under  the  rule  of  Chandragupta  Maurya,  began  to  assert  its 
hegemony  over  neighboring  areas.  Chandragupta,  who  ruled 
from  324  to  301  B.C.,  was  the  architect  of  the  first  Indian  impe- 
rial power — the  Mauryan  Empire  (326-184  B.C.) — whose  capi- 
tal was  Pataliputra,  near  modern-day  Patna,  in  Bihar. 

Situated  on  rich  alluvial  soil  and  near  mineral  deposits,  espe- 
cially iron,  Magadha  was  at  the  center  of  bustling  commerce

and  trade.  The  capital  was  a  city  of  magnificent  palaces,  tem- 
ples, a  university,  a  library,  gardens,  and  parks,  as  reported  by 
Megasthenes,  the  third-century  B.C.  Greek  historian  and 
ambassador  to  the  Mauryan  court.  Legend  states  that  Chandra- 
gupta's  success  was  due  in  large  measure  to  his  adviser  Kautilya, 
the  Brahman  author  of  the  Arthashastra  (Science  of  Material 
Gain),  a  textbook  that  outlined  governmental  administration 
and  political  strategy.  There  was  a  highly  centralized  and  hier- 
archical government  with  a  large  staff,  which  regulated  tax  col- 
lection, trade  and  commerce,  industrial  arts,  mining,  vital 
statistics,  welfare  of  foreigners,  maintenance  of  public  places 
including  markets  and  temples,  and  prostitutes.  A  large  stand- 
ing army  and  a  well-developed  espionage  system  were  main- 
tained. The  empire  was  divided  into  provinces,  districts,  and 
villages  governed  by  a  host  of  centrally  appointed  local  offi- 
cials, who  replicated  the  functions  of  the  central  administra- 
tion. 

Ashoka,  grandson  of  Chandragupta,  ruled  from  269  to  232 
B.C.  and  was  one  of  India's  most  illustrious  rulers.  Ashoka's 
inscriptions  chiseled  on  rocks  and  stone  pillars  located  at  stra- 
tegic locations  throughout  his  empire — such  as  Lampaka 
(Laghman  in  modern  Afghanistan),  Mahastan  (in  modern 
Bangladesh),  and  Brahmagiri  (in  Karnataka) — constitute  the 
second  set  of  datable  historical  records.  According  to  some  of 
the  inscriptions,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  carnage  resulting  from 
his  campaign  against  the  powerful  kingdom  of  Kalinga  (mod- 
ern Orissa),  Ashoka  renounced  bloodshed  and  pursued  a  pol- 
icy of  nonviolence  or  ahimsa,  espousing  a  theory  of  rule  by 
righteousness.  His  toleration  for  different  religious  beliefs  and 
languages  reflected  the  realities  of  India's  regional  pluralism 
although  he  personally  seems  to  have  followed  Buddhism  (see 
Buddhism,  ch.  3).  Early  Buddhist  stories  assert  that  he  con- 
vened a  Buddhist  council  at  his  capital,  regularly  undertook 
tours  within  his  realm,  and  sent  Buddhist  missionary  ambassa- 
dors to  Sri  Lanka. 

Contacts  established  with  the  Hellenistic  world  during  the 
reign  of  Ashoka's  predecessors  served  him  well.  He  sent  diplo- 
matic-cum-religious  missions  to  the  rulers  of  Syria,  Macedonia, 
and  Epirus,  who  learned  about  India's  religious  traditions, 
especially  Buddhism.  India's  northwest  retained  many  Persian 
cultural  elements,  which  might  explain  Ashoka's  rock  inscrip- 
tions— such  inscriptions  were  commonly  associated  with  Per- 
sian rulers.  Ashoka's  Greek  and  Aramaic  inscriptions  found  in

Kandahar  in  Afghanistan  may  also  reveal  his  desire  to  maintain 
ties  with  people  outside  of  India. 

After  the  disintegration  of  the  Mauryan  Empire  in  the  sec- 
ond century  B.C.,  South  Asia  became  a  collage  of  regional  pow- 
ers with  overlapping  boundaries.  India's  unguarded 
northwestern  border  again  attracted  a  series  of  invaders 
between  200  B.C.  and  A.D.  300.  As  the  Aryans  had  done,  the 
invaders  became  "Indianized"  in  the  process  of  their  conquest 
and  settlement.  Also,  this  period  witnessed  remarkable  intellec- 
tual and  artistic  achievements  inspired  by  cultural  diffusion 
and  syncretism.  The  Indo-Greeks,  or  the  Bactrians,  of  the 
northwest  contributed  to  the  development  of  numismatics; 
they  were  followed  by  another  group,  the  Shakas  (or  Scyth- 
ians), from  the  steppes  of  Central  Asia,  who  settled  in  western 
India.  Still  other  nomadic  people,  the  Yuezhi,  who  were  forced 
out  of  the  Inner  Asian  steppes  of  Mongolia,  drove  the  Shakas 
out  of  northwestern  India  and  established  the  Kushana  King- 
dom (first  century  B.C. -third  century  A.D.) .  The  Kushana 
Kingdom  controlled  parts  of  Afghanistan  and  Iran,  and  in 
India  the  realm  stretched  from  Purushapura  (modern  Pesha- 
war, Pakistan)  in  the  northwest,  to  Varanasi  (Uttar  Pradesh)  in 
the  east,  and  to  Sanchi  (Madhya  Pradesh)  in  the  south.  For  a 
short  period,  the  kingdom  reached  still  farther  east,  to 
Pataliputra.  The  Kushana  Kingdom  was  the  crucible  of  trade 
among  the  Indian,  Persian,  Chinese,  and  Roman  empires  and 
controlled  a  critical  part  of  the  legendary  Silk  Road.  Kanishka, 
who  reigned  for  two  decades  starting  around  A.D.  78,  was  the 
most  noteworthy  Kushana  ruler.  He  converted  to  Buddhism 
and  convened  a  great  Buddhist  council  in  Kashmir.  The  Kusha- 
nas  were  patrons  of  Gandharan  art,  a  synthesis  between  Greek 
and  Indian  styles,  and  Sanskrit  literature.  They  initiated  a  new 
era  called  Shaka  in  A.D.  78,  and  their  calendar,  which  was  for- 
mally recognized  by  India  for  civil  purposes  starting  on  March 
22,  1957,  is  still  in  use. 

The  Deccan  and  the  South 

During  the  Kushana  Dynasty,  an  indigenous  power,  the  Sata- 
vahana  Kingdom  (first  century  B.C. -third  century  A.D. ),  rose 
in  the  Deccan  in  southern  India.  The  Satavahana,  or  Andhra, 
Kingdom  was  considerably  influenced  by  the  Mauryan  political 
model,  although  power  was  decentralized  in  the  hands  of  local 
chieftains,  who  used  the  symbols  of  Vedic  religion  and  upheld 
the  varnashramadharma.  The  rulers,  however,  were  eclectic  and 


11 


India:  A  Country  Study 

patronized  Buddhist  monuments,  such  as  those  in  Ellora 
(Maharashtra)  and  Amaravati  (Andhra  Pradesh).  Thus,  the 
Deccan  served  as  a  bridge  through  which  politics,  trade,  and 
religious  ideas  could  spread  from  the  north  to  the  south. 

Farther  south  were  three  ancient  Tamil  kingdoms — Chera 
(on  the  west),  Chola  (on  the  east),  and  Pandya  (in  the 
south) — frequently  involved  in  internecine  warfare  to  gain 
regional  supremacy.  They  are  mentioned  in  Greek  and  Asho- 
kan  sources  as  lying  at  the  fringes  of  the  Mauryan  Empire.  A 
corpus  of  ancient  Tamil  literature,  known  as  Sangam  (acad- 
emy) works,  including  Tolkappiam,  a  manual  of  Tamil  grammar 
by  Tolkappiyar,  provides  much  useful  information  about  their 
social  life  from  300  B.C.  to  A.D.  200.  There  is  clear  evidence  of 
encroachment  by  Aryan  traditions  from  the  north  into  a  pre- 
dominantly indigenous  Dravidian  culture  in  transition. 

Dravidian  social  order  was  based  on  different  ecoregions 
rather  than  on  the  Aryan  varna  paradigm,  although  the  Brah- 
mans  had  a  high  status  at  a  very  early  stage.  Segments  of  society 
were  characterized  by  matriarchy  and  matrilineal  succession — 
which  survived  well  into  the  nineteenth  century — cross-cousin 
marriage,  and  strong  regional  identity.  Tribal  chieftains 
emerged  as  "kings"  just  as  people  moved  from  pastoralism 
toward  agriculture,  sustained  by  irrigation  based  on  rivers, 
small-scale  tanks  (as  man-made  ponds  are  called  in  India)  and 
wells,  and  brisk  maritime  trade  with  Rome  and  Southeast  Asia. 

Discoveries  of  Roman  gold  coins  in  various  sites  attest  to 
extensive  South  Indian  links  with  the  outside  world.  As  with 
Pataliputra  in  the  northeast  and  Taxila  in  the  northwest  (in 
modern  Pakistan),  the  city  of  Madurai,  the  Pandyan  capital  (in 
modern  Tamil  Nadu),  was  the  center  of  intellectual  and  liter- 
ary activities.  Poets  and  bards  assembled  there  under  royal 
patronage  at  successive  concourses  and  composed  anthologies 
of  poems,  most  of  which  have  been  lost.  By  the  end  of  the  first 
century  B.C.,  South  Asia  was  crisscrossed  by  overland  trade 
routes,  which  facilitated  the  movements  of  Buddhist  and  Jain 
missionaries  and  other  travelers  and  opened  the  area  to  a  syn- 
thesis of  many  cultures  (seejainism,  ch.  3). 

The  Classical  Age 

Gupta  and  Harsha 

The  Classical  Age  refers  to  the  period  when  most  of  North 
India  was  reunited  under  the  Gupta  Empire  (ca.  A.D.  320- 


12 


Historical  Setting 


550).  Because  of  the  relative  peace,  law  and  order,  and  exten- 
sive cultural  achievements  during  this  period,  it  has  been 
described  as  a  "golden  age"  that  crystallized  the  elements  of 
what  is  generally  known  as  Hindu  culture  with  all  its  variety, 
contradiction,  and  synthesis.  The  golden  age  was  confined  to 
the  north,  and  the  classical  patterns  began  to  spread  south  only 
after  the  Gupta  Empire  had  vanished  from  the  historical  scene. 
The  military  exploits  of  the  first  three  rulers — Chandragupta  I 
(ca.  319-335),  Samudragupta  (ca.  335-376),  and  Chandra- 
gupta II  (ca.  376-415) — brought  all  of  North  India  under  their 
leadership.  From  Pataliputra,  their  capital,  they  sought  to 
retain  political  preeminence  as  much  by  pragmatism  and  judi- 
cious marriage  alliances  as  by  military  strength.  Despite  their 
self-conferred  titles,  their  overlordship  was  threatened  and  by 
500  ultimately  ruined  by  the  Hunas  (a  branch  of  the  White 
Huns  emanating  from  Central  Asia),  who  were  yet  another 
group  in  the  long  succession  of  ethnically  and  culturally  differ- 
ent outsiders  drawn  into  India  and  then  woven  into  the  hybrid 
Indian  fabric. 

Under  Harsha  Vardhana  (or  Harsha,  r.  606-47),  North  India 
was  reunited  briefly,  but  neither  the  Guptas  nor  Harsha  con- 
trolled a  centralized  state,  and  their  administrative  styles  rested 
on  the  collaboration  of  regional  and  local  officials  for  adminis- 
tering their  rule  rather  than  on  centrally  appointed  personnel. 
The  Gupta  period  marked  a  watershed  of  Indian  culture:  the 
Guptas  performed  Vedic  sacrifices  to  legitimize  their  rule,  but 
they  also  patronized  Buddhism,  which  continued  to  provide  an 
alternative  to  Brahmanical  orthodoxy. 

The  most  significant  achievements  of  this  period,  however, 
were  in  religion,  education,  mathematics,  art,  and  Sanskrit  lit- 
erature and  drama.  The  religion  that  later  developed  into 
modern  Hinduism  witnessed  a  crystallization  of  its  compo- 
nents: major  sectarian  deities,  image  worship,  devotionalism, 
and  the  importance  of  the  temple.  Education  included  gram- 
mar, composition,  logic,  metaphysics,  mathematics,  medicine, 
and  astronomy.  These  subjects  became  highly  specialized  and 
reached  an  advanced  level.  The  Indian  numeral  system — some- 
times erroneously  attributed  to  the  Arabs,  who  took  it  from 
India  to  Europe  where  it  replaced  the  Roman  system — and  the 
decimal  system  are  Indian  inventions  of  this  period.  Arya- 
bhatta's  expositions  on  astronomy  in  499,  moreover,  gave  calcu- 
lations of  the  solar  year  and  the  shape  and  movement  of  astral 
bodies  with  remarkable  accuracy.  In  medicine,  Charaka  and

Sushruta  wrote  about  a  fully  evolved  system,  resembling  those 
of  Hippocrates  and  Galen  in  Greece.  Although  progress  in 
physiology  and  biology  was  hindered  by  religious  injunctions 
against  contact  with  dead  bodies,  which  discouraged  dissection 
and  anatomy,  Indian  physicians  excelled  in  pharmacopoeia, 
caesarean  section,  bone  setting,  and  skin  grafting  (see  Science 
and  Technology,  ch.  6). 

The  Southern  Rivals 

When  Gupta  disintegration  was  complete,  the  classical  pat- 
terns of  civilization  continued  to  thrive  not  only  in  the  middle 
Ganga  Valley  and  the  kingdoms  that  emerged  on  the  heels  of 
Gupta  demise  but  also  in  the  Deccan  and  in  South  India,  which 
acquired  a  more  prominent  place  in  history.  In  fact,  from  the 
mid-seventh  to  the  mid-thirteenth  centuries,  regionalism  was 
the  dominant  theme  of  political  or  dynastic  history  of  South 
Asia.  Three  features,  as  political  scientist  Radha  Champakalak- 
shmi  has  noted,  commonly  characterize  the  sociopolitical  reali- 
ties of  this  period.  First,  the  spread  of  Brahmanical  religions 
was  a  two-way  process  of  Sanskritization  of  local  cults  and  local- 
ization of  Brahmanical  social  order.  Second  was  the  ascendancy 
of  the  Brahman  priestly  and  landowning  groups  that  later  dom- 
inated regional  institutions  and  political  developments.  Third, 
because  of  the  seesawing  of  numerous  dynasties  that  had  a 
remarkable  ability  to  survive  perennial  military  attacks, 
regional  kingdoms  faced  frequent  defeats  but  seldom  total 
annihilation. 

Peninsular  India  was  involved  in  an  eighth-century  tripartite 
power  struggle  among  the  Chalukyas  (556-757)  of  Vatapi,  the 
Pallavas  (300-888)  of  Kanchipuram,  and  the  Pandyas  (seventh 
through  the  tenth  centuries)  of  Madurai.  The  Chalukya  rulers 
were  overthrown  by  their  subordinates,  the  Rashtrakutas,  who 
ruled  from  753  to  973.  Although  both  the  Pallava  and  Pandya 
kingdoms  were  enemies,  the  real  struggle  for  political  domina- 
tion was  between  the  Pallava  and  Chalukya  realms. 

Despite  interregional  conflicts,  local  autonomy  was  pre- 
served to  a  far  greater  degree  in  the  south  where  it  had  pre- 
vailed for  centuries.  The  absence  of  a  highly  centralized 
government  was  associated  with  a  corresponding  local  auton- 
omy in  the  administration  of  villages  and  districts.  Extensive 
and  well-documented  overland  and  maritime  trade  flourished 
with  the  Arabs  on  the  west  coast  and  with  Southeast  Asia.  Trade 
facilitated  cultural  diffusion  in  Southeast  Asia,  where  local 


14 


Historical  Setting 


elites  selectively  but  willingly  adopted  Indian  art,  architecture, 
literature,  and  social  customs. 

The  interdynastic  rivalry  and  seasonal  raids  into  each  other's 
territory  notwithstanding,  the  rulers  in  the  Deccan  and  South 
India  patronized  all  three  religions — Buddhism,  Hinduism, 
and  Jainism.  The  religions  vied  with  each  other  for  royal  favor, 
expressed  in  land  grants  but  more  importantly  in  the  creation 
of  monumental  temples,  which  remain  architectural  wonders. 
The  cave  temples  of  Elephanta  Island  (near  Bombay,  or  Mum- 
bai  in  Marathi) ,  Ajanta,  and  Ellora  (in  Maharashtra),  and  struc- 
tural temples  of  Kanchipuram  (in  Tamil  Nadu)  are  enduring 
legacies  of  otherwise  warring  regional  rulers.  By  the  mid-sev- 
enth century,  Buddhism  and  Jainism  began  to  decline  as  sectar- 
ian Hindu  devotional  cults  of  Shiva  and  Vishnu  vigorously 
competed  for  popular  support. 

Although  Sanskrit  was  the  language  of  learning  and  theol- 
ogy in  South  India,  as  it  was  in  the  north,  the  growth  of  the 
bhakti  (devotional)  movements  enhanced  the  crystallization  of 
vernacular  literature  in  all  four  major  Dravidian  languages: 
Tamil,  Telugu,  Malayalam,  and  Kannada;  they  often  borrowed 
themes  and  vocabulary  from  Sanskrit  but  preserved  much  local 
cultural  lore.  Examples  of  Tamil  literature  include  two  major 
poems,  Cilappatikaram  (The  Jewelled  Anklet)  and  Manimekalai 
(The  Jewelled  Belt);  the  body  of  devotional  literature  of 
Shaivism  and  Vaishnavism — Hindu  devotional  movements;  and 
the  reworking  of  the  Ramayana  by  Kamban  in  the  twelfth  cen- 
tury. A  nationwide  cultural  synthesis  had  taken  place  with  a 
minimum  of  common  characteristics  in  the  various  regions  of 
South  Asia,  but  the  process  of  cultural  infusion  and  assimila- 
tion would  continue  to  shape  and  influence  India's  history 
through  the  centuries. 

The  Delhi  Sultanate 

The  Coming  of  Islam 

Islam  was  propagated  by  the  Prophet  Muhammad  during 
the  early  seventh  century  in  the  deserts  of  Arabia.  Less  than  a 
century  after  its  inception,  Islam's  presence  was  felt  through- 
out the  Middle  East,  North  Africa,  Spain,  Iran,  and  Central 
Asia.  Arab  military  forces  conquered  the  Indus  Delta  region  in 
Sindh  in  711  and  established  an  Indo-Muslim  state  there. 
Sindh  became  an  Islamic  outpost  where  Arabs  established 
trade  links  with  the  Middle  East  and  were  later  joined  by  teach-

ers  or  sufis  (see  Glossary),  but  Arab  influence  was  hardly  felt  in 
the  rest  of  South  Asia  (see  Islam,  ch.  3) .  By  the  end  of  the  tenth 
century,  dramatic  changes  took  place  when  the  Central  Asian 
Turkic  tribes  accepted  both  the  message  and  mission  of  Islam. 
These  warlike  people  first  began  to  move  into  Afghanistan  and 
Iran  and  later  into  India  through  the  northwest.  Mahmud  of 
Ghazni  (971-1030),  who  was  also  known  as  the  "Sword  of 
Islam,"  mounted  seventeen  plundering  expeditions  between 
997  and  1027  into  North  India,  annexing  Punjab  as  his  eastern 
province.  The  invaders'  effective  use  of  the  crossbow  while  at  a 
gallop  gave  them  a  decisive  advantage  over  their  Indian  oppo- 
nents, the  Rajputs.  Mahmud's  conquest  of  Punjab  foretold  omi- 
nous consequences  for  the  rest  of  India,  but  the  Rajputs  appear 
to  have  been  both  unprepared  and  unwilling  to  change  their 
military  tactics,  which  ultimately  collapsed  in  the  face  of  the 
swift  and  punitive  cavalry  of  the  Afghans  and  Turkic  peoples. 

In  the  thirteenth  century,  Shams-ud-Din  Iletmish  (or  Iltut- 
mish;  r.  1211-36),  a  former  slave-warrior,  established  a  Turkic 
kingdom  in  Delhi,  which  enabled  future  sultans  to  push  in 
every  direction;  within  the  next  100  years,  the  Delhi  Sultanate 
extended  its  sway  east  to  Bengal  and  south  to  the  Deccan,  while 
the  sultanate  itself  experienced  repeated  threats  from  the 
northwest  and  internal  revolts  from  displeased,  independent- 
minded  nobles.  The  sultanate  was  in  constant  flux  as  five  dynas- 
ties rose  and  fell:  Mamluk  or  Slave  (1206-90),  Khalji  (1290- 
1320),  Tughluq  (1320-1413),  Sayyid  (1414-51),  and  Lodi 
(1451-1526).  The  Khalji  Dynasty  under  Ala-ud-Din  (r.  1296- 
1315)  succeeded  in  bringing  most  of  South  India  under  its  con- 
trol for  a  time,  although  conquered  areas  broke  away  quickly. 
Power  in  Delhi  was  often  gained  by  violence — nineteen  of  the 
thirty-five  sultans  were  assassinated — and  was  legitimized  by 
reward  for  tribal  loyalty.  Factional  rivalries  and  court  intrigues 
were  as  numerous  as  they  were  treacherous;  territories  con- 
trolled by  the  sultan  expanded  and  shrank  depending  on  his 
personality  and  fortunes. 

Both  the  Quran  and  sharia  (Islamic  law)  provided  the  basis 
for  enforcing  Islamic  administration  over  the  independent 
Hindu  rulers,  but  the  sultanate  made  only  fitful  progress  in  the 
beginning,  when  many  campaigns  were  undertaken  for  plun- 
der and  temporary  reduction  of  fortresses.  The  effective  rule 
of  a  sultan  depended  largely  on  his  ability  to  control  the  strate- 
gic places  that  dominated  the  military  highways  and  trade 
routes,  extract  the  annual  land  tax,  and  maintain  personal

authority  over  military  and  provincial  governors.  Sultan  Ala-ud- 
Din  made  an  attempt  to  reassess,  systematize,  and  unify  land 
revenues  and  urban  taxes  and  to  institute  a  highly  centralized 
system  of  administration  over  his  realm,  but  his  efforts  were 
abortive.  Although  agriculture  in  North  India  improved  as  a 
result  of  new  canal  construction  and  irrigation  methods, 
including  what  came  to  be  known  as  the  Persian  wheel,  pro- 
longed political  instability  and  parasitic  methods  of  tax  collec- 
tion brutalized  the  peasantry.  Yet  trade  and  a  market  economy, 
encouraged  by  the  free-spending  habits  of  the  aristocracy, 
acquired  new  impetus  both  inland  and  overseas.  Experts  in 
metalwork,  stonework,  and  textile  manufacture  responded  to 
the  new  patronage  with  enthusiasm. 

Southern  Dynasties 

The  sultans'  failure  to  hold  securely  the  Deccan  and  South 
India  resulted  in  the  rise  of  competing  southern  dynasties:  the 
Muslim  Bahmani  Sultanate  (1347-1527)  and  the  Hindu  Vija- 
yanagar  Empire  (1336-1565).  Zafar  Khan,  a  former  provincial 
governor  under  the  Tughluqs,  revolted  against  his  Turkic  over- 
lord and  proclaimed  himself  sultan,  taking  the  title  Ala-ud-Din 
Bahman  Shah  in  1347.  The  Bahmani  Sultanate,  located  in  the 
northern  Deccan,  lasted  for  almost  two  centuries,  until  it  frag-

merited  into  five  smaller  states  in  1527.  The  Bahmani  Sultanate 
adopted  the  patterns  established  by  the  Delhi  overlords  in  tax 
collection  and  administration,  but  its  downfall  was  caused  in 
large  measure  by  the  competition  and  hatred  between  deccani 
(domiciled  Muslim  immigrants  and  local  converts)  and 
paradesi  (foreigners  or  officials  in  temporary  service).  The  Bah- 
mani Sultanate  initiated  a  process  of  cultural  synthesis  visible  in 
Hyderabad,  where  cultural  flowering  is  still  expressed  in  vigor- 
ous schools  of  deccani  architecture  and  painting. 

Founded  in  1336,  the  empire  of  Vijayanagar  (named  for  its 
capital  Vijayanagar,  "City  of  Victory,"  in  present-day  Karnataka) 
expanded  rapidly  toward  Madurai  in  the  south  and  Goa  in  the 
west  and  exerted  intermittent  control  over  the  east  coast  and 
the  extreme  southwest.  Vijayanagar  rulers  closely  followed 
Chola  precedents,  especially  in  collecting  agricultural  and 
trade  revenues,  in  giving  encouragement  to  commercial  guilds, 
and  in  honoring  temples  with  lavish  endowments.  Added  reve- 
nue needed  for  waging  war  against  the  Bahmani  sultans  was 
raised  by  introducing  a  set  of  taxes  on  commercial  enterprises, 
professions,  and  industries.  Political  rivalry  between  the  Bah- 
mani and  the  Vijayanagar  rulers  involved  control  over  the 
Krishna-Tunghabadhra  river  basin,  which  shifted  hands 
depending  on  whose  military  was  superior  at  any  given  time. 
The  Vijayanagar  rulers'  capacity  for  gaining  victory  over  their 
enemies  was  contingent  on  ensuring  a  constant  supply  of 
horses — initially  through  Arab  traders  but  later  through  the 
Portuguese — and  maintaining  internal  roads  and  communica- 
tion networks.  Merchant  guilds  enjoyed  a  wide  sphere  of  opera- 
tion  and  were  able  to  offset  the  power  of  landlords  and 
Brahmans  in  court  politics.  Commerce  and  shipping  eventually 
passed  largely  into  the  hands  of  foreigners,  and  special  facili- 
ties and  tax  concessions  were  provided  for  them  by  the  ruler. 
Arabs  and  Portuguese  competed  for  influence  and  control  of 
west  coast  ports,  and,  in  1510,  Goa  passed  into  Portuguese  pos- 
session. 

The  city  of  Vijayanagar  itself  contained  numerous  temples 
with  rich  ornamentation,  especially  the  gateways,  and  a  cluster 
of  shrines  for  the  deities.  Most  prominent  among  the  temples 
was  the  one  dedicated  to  Virupaksha,  a  manifestation  of  Shiva, 
the  patron-deity  of  the  Vijayanagar  rulers.  Temples  continued 
to  be  the  nuclei  of  diverse  cultural  and  intellectual  activities, 
but  these  activities  were  based  more  on  tradition  than  on  con- 
temporary political  realities.  (However,  the  first  Vijayanagar

ruler — Harihara  I — was  a  Hindu  who  converted  to  Islam  and 
then  reconverted  to  Hinduism  for  political  expediency.)  The 
temples  sponsored  no  intellectual  exchange  with  Islamic  theo- 
logians because  Muslims  were  generally  assigned  to  an 
"impure"  status  and  were  thus  excluded  from  entering  temples. 
When  the  five  rulers  of  what  was  once  the  Bahmani  Sultanate 
combined  their  forces  and  attacked  Vijayanagar  in  1565,  the 
empire  crumbled  at  the  Battle  of  Talikot. 

The  Mughal  Era 
The  Mughals 

In  the  early  sixteenth  century,  descendants  of  the  Mongol,

India:  A  Country  Study 


Turkish,  Iranian,  and  Afghan  invaders  of  South  Asia — the 
Mughals — invaded  India  under  the  leadership  of  Zahir-ud-Din 
Babur.  Babur  was  the  great-grandson  of  Timur  Lenk  (Timur 
the  Lame,  from  which  the  Western  name  Tamerlane  is 
derived),  who  had  invaded  India  and  plundered  Delhi  in  1398 
and  then  led  a  short-lived  empire  based  in  Samarkand  (in  mod- 
ern-day  Uzbekistan)  that  united  Persian-based  Mongols 
(Babur's  maternal  ancestors)  and  other  West  Asian  peoples. 
Babur  was  driven  from  Samarkand  and  initially  established  his 
rule  in  Kabul  in  1504;  he  later  became  the  first  Mughal  ruler 
(1526-30).  His  determination  was  to  expand  eastward  into 
Punjab,  where  he  had  made  a  number  of  forays.  Then  an  invi- 
tation from  an  opportunistic  Afghan  chief  in  Punjab  brought 
him  to  the  very  heart  of  the  Delhi  Sultanate,  ruled  by  Ibrahim 
Lodi  (1517-26).  Babur,  a  seasoned  military  commander, 
entered  India  in  1526  with  his  well-trained  veteran  army  of 
12,000  to  meet  the  sultan's  huge  but  unwieldy  and  disunited 
force  of  more  than  100,000  men.  Babur  defeated  the  Lodi  sul- 
tan decisively  at  Panipat  (in  modern-day  Haryana,  about  ninety 
kilometers  north  of  Delhi).  Employing  gun  carts,  moveable 
artillery,  and  superior  cavalry  tactics,  Babur  achieved  a 
resounding  victory.  A  year  later,  he  decisively  defeated  a  Rajput 
confederacy  led  by  Rana  Sangha.  In  1529  Babur  routed  the 
joint  forces  of  Afghans  and  the  sultan  of  Bengal  but  died  in 
1530  before  he  could  consolidate  his  military  gains.  He  left 
behind  as  legacies  his  memoirs  {Babur  N amah) ,  several  beauti- 
ful gardens  in  Kabul,  Lahore,  and  Agra,  and  descendants  who 
would  fulfill  his  dream  of  establishing  an  empire  in  Hindustan. 

When  Babur  died,  his  son  Humayun  (1530-56),  also  a  sol- 
dier, inherited  a  difficult  task.  He  was  pressed  from  all  sides  by 
a  reassertion  of  Afghan  claims  to  the  Delhi  throne,  by  disputes 
over  his  own  succession,  and  by  the  Afghan-Rajput  march  into 
Delhi  in  1540.  He  fled  to  Persia,  where  he  spent  nearly  ten 
years  as  an  embarrassed  guest  at  the  Safavid  court.  In  1545  he 
gained  a  foothold  in  Kabul,  reasserted  his  Indian  claim, 
defeated  Sher  Khan  Sur,  the  most  powerful  Afghan  ruler,  and 
took  control  of  Delhi  in  1555. 

Humayun's  untimely  death  in  1556  left  the  task  of  further 
imperial  conquest  and  consolidation  to  his  thirteen-year-old 
son,  Jalal-ud-Din  Akbar  (r.  1556-1605).  Following  a  decisive 
military  victory  at  the  Second  Battle  of  Panipat  in  1556,  the 
regent  Bayram  Khan  pursued  a  vigorous  policy  of  expansion 
on  Akbar's  behalf.  As  soon  as  Akbar  came  of  age,  he  began  to 


20 


Historical  Setting 


free  himself  from  the  influences  of  overbearing  ministers, 
court  factions,  and  harem  intrigues,  and  demonstrated  his  own 
capacity  for  judgment  and  leadership.  A  "workaholic"  who  sel- 
dom slept  more  than  three  hours  a  night,  he  personally  over- 
saw the  implementation  of  his  administrative  policies,  which 
were  to  form  the  backbone  of  the  Mughal  Empire  for  more 
than  200  years.  He  continued  to  conquer,  annex,  and  consoli- 
date a  far-flung  territory  bounded  by  Kabul  in  the  northwest, 
Kashmir  in  the  north,  Bengal  in  the  east,  and  beyond  the  Nar- 
mada  River  in  the  south — an  area  comparable  in  size  to  the 
Mauryan  territory  some  1,800  years  earlier  (see  fig.  3). 

Akbar  built  a  walled  capital  called  Fatehpur  Sikri  (Fatehpur 
means  Fortress  of  Victory)  near  Agra,  starting  in  1571.  Palaces 
for  each  of  Akbar's  senior  queens,  a  huge  artificial  lake,  and 
sumptuous  water-filled  courtyards  were  built  there.  The  city, 
however,  proved  short-lived,  perhaps  because  the  water  supply 
was  insufficient  or  of  poor  quality,  or,  as  some  historians 
believe,  Akbar  had  to  attend  to  the  northwest  areas  of  his 
empire  and  simply  moved  his  capital  for  political  reasons. 
Whatever  the  reason,  in  1585  the  capital  was  relocated  to 
Lahore  and  in  1599  to  Agra. 

Akbar  adopted  two  distinct  but  effective  approaches  in 
administering  a  large  territory  and  incorporating  various  eth- 
nic groups  into  the  service  of  his  realm.  In  1580  he  obtained 
local  revenue  statistics  for  the  previous  decade  in  order  to 
understand  details  of  productivity  and  price  fluctuation  of  dif- 
ferent crops.  Aided  by  Todar  Mai,  a  Rajput  king,  Akbar  issued  a 
revenue  schedule  that  the  peasantry  could  tolerate  while  pro- 
viding maximum  profit  for  the  state.  Revenue  demands,  fixed 
according  to  local  conventions  of  cultivation  and  quality  of  soil, 
ranged  from  one-third  to  one-half  of  the  crop  and  were  paid  in 
cash.  Akbar  relied  heavily  on  land-holding  zamindars  (see  Glos- 
sary) .  They  used  their  considerable  local  knowledge  and  influ- 
ence to  collect  revenue  and  to  transfer  it  to  the  treasury, 
keeping  a  portion  in  return  for  services  rendered.  Within  his 
administrative  system,  the  warrior  aristocracy  (mansabdars) 
held  ranks  (mansabs)  expressed  in  numbers  of  troops,  and  indi- 
cating pay,  armed  contingents,  and  obligations.  The  warrior 
aristocracy  was  generally  paid  from  revenues  of  nonhereditary 
and  transferrable  jagirs  (revenue  villages). 

An  astute  ruler  who  genuinely  appreciated  the  challenges  of 
administering  so  vast  an  empire,  Akbar  introduced  a  policy  of 
reconciliation  and  assimilation  of  Hindus  (including  Maryam

government;  encouraged  intermarriages  between  Mughal  and 
Rajput  aristocracy;  allowed  new  temples  to  be  built;  personally

participated  in  celebrating  Hindu  festivals  such  as  Dipavali,  or 
Diwali,  the  festival  of  lights;  and  abolished  the  jizya  (poll  tax) 
imposed  on  non-Muslims.  Akbar  came  up  with  his  own  theory 
of  "rulership  as  a  divine  illumination,"  enshrined  in  his  new 
religion  Din-i-Ilahi  (Divine  Faith),  incorporating  the  principle 
of  acceptance  of  all  religions  and  sects.  He  encouraged  widow 
marriage,  discouraged  child  marriage,  outlawed  the  practice  of 
sati,  and  persuaded  Delhi  merchants  to  set  up  special  market 
days  for  women,  who  otherwise  were  secluded  at  home  (see 
Veiling  and  the  Seclusion  of  Women,  ch.  5).  By  the  end  of 
Akbar's  reign,  the  Mughal  Empire  extended  throughout  most 
of  India  north  of  the  Godavari  River.  The  exceptions  were 
Gondwana  in  central  India,  which  paid  tribute  to  the  Mughals, 
and  Assam,  in  the  northeast. 

Mughal  rule  under  Jahangir  (1605-27)  and  Shah  Jahan 
(1628-58)  was  noted  for  political  stability,  brisk  economic  activ- 
ity, beautiful  paintings,  and  monumental  buildings.  Jahangir 
married  the  Persian  princess  whom  he  renamed  Nur  Jahan 
(Light  of  the  World),  who  emerged  as  the  most  powerful  indi- 
vidual in  the  court  besides  the  emperor.  As  a  result,  Persian 
poets,  artists,  scholars,  and  officers — including  her  own  family 
members — lured  by  the  Mughal  court's  brilliance  and  luxury, 
found  asylum  in  India.  The  number  of  unproductive,  time- 
serving officers  mushroomed,  as  did  corruption,  while  the 
excessive  Persian  representation  upset  the  delicate  balance  of 
impartiality  at  the  court.  Jahangir  liked  Hindu  festivals  but  pro- 
moted mass  conversion  to  Islam;  he  persecuted  the  followers  of 
Jainism  and  even  executed  Guru  (see  Glossary)  Arjun  Das,  the 
fifth  saint-teacher  of  the  Sikhs  (see  Sikhism,  ch.  3).  Nurjahan's 
abortive  schemes  to  secure  the  throne  for  the  prince  of  her 
choice  led  Shah  Jahan  to  rebel  in  1622.  In  that  same  year,  the 
Persians  took  over  Kandahar  in  southern  Afghanistan,  an  event 
that  struck  a  serious  blow  to  Mughal  prestige. 

Between  1636  and  1646,  Shah  Jahan  sent  Mughal  armies  to 
conquer  the  Deccan  and  the  northwest  beyond  the  Khyber 
Pass.  Even  though  they  demonstrated  Mughal  military 
strength,  these  campaigns  consumed  the  imperial  treasury.  As 
the  state  became  a  huge  military  machine,  whose  nobles  and 
their  contingents  multiplied  almost  fourfold,  so  did  its 
demands  for  more  revenue  from  the  peasantry.  Political  unifi- 
cation and  maintenance  of  law  and  order  over  wide  areas 
encouraged  the  emergence  of  large  centers  of  commerce  and 
crafts — such  as  Lahore,  Delhi,  Agra,  and  Ahmadabad — linked

by  roads  and  waterways  to  distant  places  and  ports.  The  world- 
famous  Taj  Mahal  was  built  in  Agra  during  Shah  Jahan's  reign 
as  a  tomb  for  his  beloved  wife,  Mumtaz  Mahal.  It  symbolizes 
both  Mughal  artistic  achievement  and  excessive  financial 
expenditures  when  resources  were  shrinking.  The  economic 
position  of  peasants  and  artisans  did  not  improve  because  the 
administration  failed  to  produce  any  lasting  change  in  the 
existing  social  structure.  There  was  no  incentive  for  the  reve- 
nue officials,  whose  concerns  primarily  were  personal  or  famil- 
ial gain,  to  generate  resources  independent  of  dominant 
Hindu  zamindars  and  village  leaders,  whose  self-interest  and 
local  dominance  prevented  them  from  handing  over  the  full 
amount  of  revenue  to  the  imperial  treasury.  In  their  ever- 
greater  dependence  on  land  revenue,  the  Mughals  unwittingly 
nurtured  forces  that  eventually  led  to  the  break-up  of  their 
empire. 

The  last  of  the  great  Mughals  was  Aurangzeb  (r.  1658-1707), 
who  seized  the  throne  by  killing  all  his  brothers  and  imprison- 
ing his  own  father.  During  his  fifty-year  reign,  the  empire 
reached  its  utmost  physical  limit  but  also  witnessed  the  unmis- 
takable symptoms  of  decline.  The  bureaucracy  had  grown 
bloated  and  excessively  corrupt,  and  the  huge  and  unwieldy 
army  demonstrated  outdated  weaponry  and  tactics.  Aurangzeb 
was  not  the  ruler  to  restore  the  dynasty's  declining  fortunes  or 
glory.  Awe-inspiring  but  lacking  in  the  charisma  needed  to 
attract  outstanding  lieutenants,  he  was  driven  to  extend 
Mughal  rule  over  most  of  South  Asia  and  to  reestablish  Islamic 
orthodoxy  by  adopting  a  reactionary  attitude  toward  those 
Muslims  whom  he  had  suspected  of  compromising  their  faith. 

Aurangzeb  was  involved  in  a  series  of  protracted  wars — 
against  the  Pathans  in  Afghanistan,  the  sultans  of  Bijapur  and 
Golkonda  in  the  Deccan,  and  the  Marathas  in  Maharashtra. 
Peasant  uprisings  and  revolts  by  local  leaders  became  all  too 
common,  as  did  the  conniving  of  the  nobles  to  preserve  their 
own  status  at  the  expense  of  a  steadily  weakening  empire.  The 
increasing  association  of  his  government  with  Islam  further 
drove  a  wedge  between  the  ruler  and  his  Hindu  subjects. 
Aurangzeb  forbade  the  building  of  new  temples,  destroyed  a 
number  of  them,  and  reimposed  the  jizya.  A  puritan  and  a  cen- 
sor of  morals,  he  banned  music  at  court,  abolished  ceremonies, 
and  persecuted  the  Sikhs  in  Punjab.  These  measures  alienated 
so  many  that  even  before  he  died  challenges  for  power  had 
already  begun  to  escalate.  Contenders  for  the  Mughal  throne

fought  each  other,  and  the  short-lived  reigns  of  Aurangzeb's 
successors  were  strife-filled.  The  Mughal  Empire  experienced 
dramatic  reverses  as  regional  governors  broke  away  and 
founded  independent  kingdoms.  The  Mughals  had  to  make 
peace  with  Maratha  rebels,  and  Persian  and  Afghan  armies 
invaded  Delhi,  carrying  away  many  treasures,  including  the 
Peacock  Throne  in  1739.

India:  A  Country  Study 
The  Marathas 

The  tale  of  the  Marathas'  rise  to  power  and  their  eventual 
fall  contains  all  the  elements  of  a  thriller:  adventure,  intrigue, 
and  romanticism.  Maratha  chieftains  were  originally  in  the  ser- 
vice of  Bijapur  sultans  in  the  western  Deccan,  which  was  under 
siege  by  the  Mughals.  Shivaji  Bhonsle  (1627-80),  a  tenacious 
and  fierce  fighter  recognized  as  the  "father  of  the  Maratha 
nation,"  took  advantage  of  this  conflict  and  carved  out  his  own 
principality  near  Pune,  which  later  became  the  Maratha  capi- 
tal. Adopting  guerrilla  tactics,  he  waylaid  caravans  in  order  to 
sustain  and  expand  his  army,  which  soon  had  money,  arms,  and 
horses.  Shivaji  led  a  series  of  successful  assaults  in  the  1660s 
against  Mughal  strongholds,  including  the  major  port  of  Surat. 
In  1674  he  assumed  the  title  of  "Lord  of  the  Universe"  at  his 
elaborate  coronation,  which  signaled  his  determination  to 
challenge  the  Mughal  forces  as  well  as  to  reestablish  a  Hindu 
kingdom  in  Maharashtra,  the  land  of  his  origin.  Shivaji's  battle 
cries  were  swaraj  (translated  variously  as  freedom,  self-rule, 
independence),  swadharma  (religious  freedom),  and  goraksha 
(cow  protection).  Aurangzeb  relentlessly  pursued  Shivaji's  suc- 
cessors between  1681  and  1705  but  eventually  retreated  to  the 
north  as  his  treasury  became  depleted  and  as  thousands  of  lives 
had  been  lost  either  on  the  battlefield  or  to  natural  calamines. 
In  1717  a  Mughal  emissary  signed  a  treaty  with  the  Marathas 
confirming  their  claims  to  rule  in  the  Deccan  in  return  for 
acknowledging  the  fictional  Mughal  suzerainty  and  remission 
of  annual  taxes.  Yet  the  Marathas  soon  captured  Malwa  from 
Mughal  control  and  later  moved  east  into  Orrisa  and  Bengal; 
southern  India  also  came  under  their  domain.  Recognition  of 
their  political  power  finally  came  when  the  Mughal  emperor 
invited  them  to  act  as  auxiliaries  in  the  internal  affairs  of  the 
empire  and  still  later  to  help  the  emperor  in  driving  the 
Afghans  out  of  Punjab. 

The  Marathas,  despite  their  military  prowess  and  leadership, 
were  not  equipped  to  administer  the  state  or  to  undertake 
socioeconomic  reform.  Pursuing  a  policy  characterized  by 
plunder  and  indiscriminate  raids,  they  antagonized  the  peas- 
ants. They  were  primarily  suited  for  stirring  the  Maharashtrian 
regional  pride  rather  than  for  attracting  loyalty  to  an  all-India 
confederacy.  They  were  left  virtually  alone  before  the  invading 
Afghan  forces,  headed  by  Ahmad  Shah  Abdali  (later  called

hastened  the  break-up  of  their  loosely  knit  confederacy  into 
five  independent  states  and  extinguished  the  hope  of  Maratha 
dominance  in  India. 

The  Sikhs 

The  Afghan  defeat  of  the  Maratha  armies  accelerated  the 
breakaway  of  Punjab  from  Delhi  and  helped  the  founding  of 
Sikh  overlordship  in  the  northwest.  Rooted  in  the  bhakti  move- 
ments that  developed  in  the  second  century  B.C.  but  swept 
across  North  India  during  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  centu- 
ries, the  Sikh  religion  appealed  to  the  hard-working  peasants. 
The  Sikh  khalsa  (army  of  the  pure)  rose  up  against  the  eco- 
nomic and  political  repressions  in  Punjab  toward  the  end  of 
Aurangzeb's  rule.  Guerrilla  fighters  took  advantage  of  the 
political  instability  created  by  the  Persian  and  Afghan 
onslaught  against  Delhi,  enriching  themselves  and  expanding 
territorial  control.  By  the  1770s,  Sikh  hegemony  extended 
from  the  Indus  in  the  west  to  the  Yamuna  in  the  east,  from  Mul- 
tan  in  the  south  to  Jammu  in  the  north.  But  the  Sikhs,  like  the 
Marathas,  were  a  loose,  disunited,  and  quarrelsome  conglom- 
erate of  twelve  kin-groups.  It  took  Ranjit  Singh  (1780-1839), 
an  individual  with  modernizing  vision  and  leadership,  to 
achieve  supremacy  over  the  other  kin-groups  and  establish  his 
kingdom  in  which  Sikhs,  Hindus,  and  Muslims  lived  together 
in  comparative  equality  and  increasing  prosperity.  Ranjit  Singh 
employed  European  officers  and  introduced  strict  military  dis- 
cipline into  his  army  before  expanding  into  Afghanistan,  Kash- 
mir, and  Ladakh. 

The  Coming  of  the  Europeans 

The  quest  for  wealth  and  power  brought  Europeans  to 
Indian  shores  in  1498  when  Vasco  da  Gama,  the  Portuguese 
voyager,  arrived  in  Calicut  (modern  Kozhikode,  Kerala)  on  the 
west  coast.  In  their  search  for  spices  and  Christian  converts,  the 
Portuguese  challenged  Arab  supremacy  in  the  Indian  Ocean, 
and,  with  their  galleons  fitted  with  powerful  cannons,  set  up  a 
network  of  strategic  trading  posts  along  the  Arabian  Sea  and 
the  Persian  Gulf.  In  1510  the  Portuguese  took  over  the  enclave 
of  Goa,  which  became  the  center  of  their  commercial  and 
political  power  in  India  and  which  they  controlled  for  nearly 
four  and  a  half  centuries. 

Economic  competition  among  the  European  nations  led  to 
the  founding  of  commercial  companies  in  England  (the  East 


27 


India:  A  Country  Study 


India  Company,  founded  in  1600)  and  in  the  Netherlands 
(Verenigde  Oost-Indische  Compagnie — the  United  East  India 
Company,  founded  in  1602),  whose  primary  aim  was  to  capture 
the  spice  trade  by  breaking  the  Portuguese  monopoly  in  Asia. 
Although  the  Dutch,  with  a  large  supply  of  capital  and  support 
from  their  government,  preempted  and  ultimately  excluded 
the  British  from  the  heartland  of  spices  in  the  East  Indies 
(modern-day  Indonesia),  both  companies  managed  to  estab- 
lish trading  "factories"  (actually  warehouses)  along  the  Indian 
coast.  The  Dutch,  for  example,  used  various  ports  on  the  Coro- 
mandel  Coast  in  South  India,  especially  Pulicat  (about  twenty 
kilometers  north  of  Madras),  as  major  sources  for  slaves  for 
their  plantations  in  the  East  Indies  and  for  cotton  cloth  as  early 
as  1609.  (The  English,  however,  established  their  first  factory  at 
what  today  is  known  as  Madras  only  in  1639.)  Indian  rulers 
enthusiastically  accommodated  the  newcomers  in  hopes  of  pit- 
ting them  against  the  Portuguese.  In  1619  Jahangir  granted 
them  permission  to  trade  in  his  territories  at  Surat  (in  Gujarat) 
on  the  west  coast  and  Hughli  (in  West  Bengal)  in  the  east. 
These  and  other  locations  on  the  peninsula  became  centers  of 
international  trade  in  spices,  cotton,  sugar,  raw  silk,  saltpeter, 
calico,  and  indigo. 

English  company  agents  became  familiar  with  Indian  cus- 
toms and  languages,  including  Persian,  the  unifying  official 
language  under  the  Mughals.  In  many  ways,  the  English  agents 
of  that  period  lived  like  Indians,  intermarried  willingly,  and  a 
large  number  of  them  never  returned  to  their  home  country. 
The  knowledge  of  India  thus  acquired  and  the  mutual  ties 
forged  with  Indian  trading  groups  gave  the  English  a  competi- 
tive edge  over  other  Europeans.  The  French  commercial  inter- 
est— Compagnie  des  Indes  Orientales  (East  India  Company, 
founded  in  1664) — came  late,  but  the  French  also  established 
themselves  in  India,  emulating  the  precedents  set  by  their  com- 
petitors as  they  founded  their  enclave  at  Pondicherry  (Puduch- 
cheri)  on  the  Coramandel  Coast. 

In  1 71 7  the  Mughal  emperor,  Farrukh-siyar  (r.  1713-19), 
gave  the  British — who  by  then  had  already  established  them- 
selves in  the  south  and  the  west — a  grant  of  thirty-eight  villages 
near  Calcutta,  acknowledging  their  importance  to  the  continu- 
ity of  international  trade  in  the  Bengal  economy.  As  did  the 
Dutch  and  the  French,  the  British  brought  silver  bullion  and 
copper  to  pay  for  transactions,  helping  the  smooth  functioning 
of  the  Mughal  revenue  system  and  increasing  the  benefits  to

local  artisans  and  traders.  The  fortified  warehouses  of  the  Brit- 
ish brought  extraterritorial  status,  which  enabled  them  to 
administer  their  own  civil  and  criminal  laws  and  offered 
numerous  employment  opportunities  as  well  as  asylum  to  for- 
eigners and  Indians.  The  British  factories  successfully  com- 
peted with  their  rivals  as  their  size  and  population  grew.  The 
original  clusters  of  fishing  villages  (Madras  and  Calcutta)  or 
series  of  islands  (Bombay)  became  headquarters  of  the  British 
administrative  zones,  or  presidencies  as  they  generally  came  to 
be  known.  The  factories  and  their  immediate  environs,  known 
as  the  White-town,  represented  the  actual  and  symbolic  preem- 
inence of  the  British — in  terms  of  their  political  power — as  well 
as  their  cultural  values  and  social  practices;  meanwhile,  their 
Indian  collaborators  lived  in  the  Black-town,  separated  from 
the  factories  by  several  kilometers. 

The  British  company  employed  sepoys — European-trained 
and  European-led  Indian  soldiers — to  protect  its  trade,  but 
local  rulers  sought  their  services  to  settle  scores  in  regional 
power  struggles.  South  India  witnessed  the  first  open  confron- 
tation between  the  British  and  the  French,  whose  forces  were 
led  by  Robert  Clive  and  Francois  Dupleix,  respectively.  Both 
companies  desired  to  place  their  own  candidate  as  the  nawab, 
or  ruler,  of  Arcot,  the  area  around  Madras.  At  the  end  of  a  pro- 
tracted struggle  between  1744  and  1763,  when  the  Peace  of 
Paris  was  signed,  the  British  gained  an  upper  hand  over  the 
French  and  installed  their  man  in  power,  supporting  him  fur- 
ther with  arms  and  lending  large  sums  as  well.  The  French  and 
the  British  also  backed  different  factions  in  the  succession 
struggle  for  Mughal  viceroyalty  in  Bengal,  but  Clive  intervened 
successfully  and  defeated  Nawab  Siraj-ud-daula  in  the  Battle  of 
Plassey  (Palashi,  about  150  kilometers  north  of  Calcutta)  in 
1757.  Clive  found  help  from  a  combination  of  vested  interests 
that  opposed  the  existing  nawab:  disgruntled  soldiers,  land- 
holders, and  influential  merchants  whose  commercial  profits 
were  closely  linked  to  British  fortunes. 

Later,  Clive  defeated  the  Mughal  forces  at  Buxar  (Baksar, 
west  of  Patna  in  Bihar)  in  1765,  and  the  Mughal  emperor 
(Shah  Alam,  r.  1759-1806)  conferred  on  the  company  adminis- 
trative rights  over  Bengal,  Bihar,  and  Orissa,  a  region  of 
roughly  25  million  people  with  an  annual  revenue  of  40  million 
rupees  (for  current  value  of  the  rupee — see  Glossary).  The 
imperial  grant  virtually  established  the  company  as  a  sovereign 
power,  and  Clive  became  the  first  British  governor  of  Bengal.

Besides  the  presence  of  the  Portuguese,  Dutch,  British,  and 
French,  there  were  two  lesser  but  noteworthy  colonial  groups. 
Danish  entrepreneurs  established  themselves  at  several  ports 
on  the  Malabar  and  Coromandel  coasts,  in  the  vicinity  of  Cal- 
cutta and  inland  at  Patna  between  1695  and  1740.  Austrian 
enterprises  were  set  up  in  the  1720s  on  the  vicinity  of  Surat  in 
modern-day  southeastern  Gujarat.  As  with  the  other  non-Brit- 
ish enterprises,  the  Danish  and  Austrian  enclaves  were  taken 
over  by  the  British  between  1765  and  1815. 

The  British  Empire  in  India 

Company  Rule,  1 757-1857 

A  multiplicity  of  motives  underlay  the  British  penetration 
into  India:  commerce,  security,  and  a  purported  moral  uplift  of 
the  people.  The  "expansive  force"  of  private  and  company 
trade  eventually  led  to  the  conquest  or  annexation  of  territo- 
ries in  which  spices,  cotton,  and  opium  were  produced.  British 
investors  ventured  into  the  unfamiliar  interior  landscape  in 
search  of  opportunities  that  promised  substantial  profits.  Brit- 
ish economic  penetration  was  aided  by  Indian  collaborators, 
such  as  the  bankers  and  merchants  who  controlled  intricate 
credit  networks.  British  rule  in  India  would  have  been  a  frus- 
trated or  half-realized  dream  had  not  Indian  counterparts  pro- 
vided connections  between  rural  and  urban  centers.  External 
threats,  both  real  and  imagined,  such  as  the  Napoleonic  Wars 
(1796-1815)  and  Russian  expansion  toward  Afghanistan  (in 
the  1830s),  as  well  as  the  desire  for  internal  stability,  led  to  the 
annexation  of  more  territory  in  India.  Political  analysts  in  Brit- 
ain wavered  initially  as  they  were  uncertain  of  the  costs  or  the 
advantages  in  undertaking  wars  in  India,  but  by  the  1810s,  as 
the  territorial  aggrandizement  eventually  paid  off,  opinion  in 
London  welcomed  the  absorption  of  new  areas.  Occasionally 
the  British  Parliament  witnessed  heated  debates  against  expan- 
sion, but  arguments  justifying  military  operations  for  security 
reasons  always  won  over  even  the  most  vehement  critics. 

The  British  soon  forgot  their  own  rivalry  with  the  Portu- 
guese and  the  French  and  permitted  them  to  stay  in  their 
coastal  enclaves,  which  they  kept  even  after  independence  in 
1947  (see  National  Integration,  this  ch.).  The  British,  however, 
continued  to  expand  vigorously  well  into  the  1850s.  A  number 
of  aggressive  governors-general  undertook  relentless  cam- 
paigns against  several  Hindu  and  Muslim  rulers.  Among  them

were  Richard  Colley  Wellesley  (1798-1805),  William  Pitt 
Amherst  (1823-28),  George  Eden  (1836-42),  Edward  Law 
(1842-44),  and  James  Andrew  Brown  Ramsay  (1848-56;  also 
known  as  the  Marquess  of  Dalhousie) .  Despite  desperate 
efforts  at  salvaging  their  tottering  power  and  keeping  the  Brit- 
ish at  bay,  many  Hindu  and  Muslim  rulers  lost  their  territories: 
Mysore  (1799,  but  later  restored),  the  Maratha  Confederacy 
(1818),  and  Punjab  (1849).  The  British  success  in  large  mea- 
sure was  the  result  not  only  of  their  superiority  in  tactics  and 
weapons  but  also  of  their  ingenious  relations  with  Indian  rulers 
through  the  "subsidiary  alliance"  system,  introduced  in  the 
early  nineteenth  century.  Many  rulers  bartered  away  their  real 
responsibilities  by  agreeing  to  uphold  British  paramountcy  in 
India,  while  they  retained  a  fictional  sovereignty  under  the 
rubric  of  Pax  Britannica.  Later,  Dalhousie  espoused  the  "doc-

India:  A  Country  Study 

trine  of  lapse"  and  annexed  outright  the  estates  of  deceased 
princes  of  Satara  (1848),  Udaipur  (1852),  Jhansi  (1853),  Tan- 
jore  (1853),  Nagpur  (1854),  and  Oudh  (1856). 

European  perceptions  of  India,  and  those  of  the  British 
especially,  shifted  from  unequivocal  appreciation  to  sweeping 
condemnation  of  India's  past  achievements  and  customs. 
Imbued  with  an  ethnocentric  sense  of  superiority,  British  intel- 
lectuals, including  Christian  missionaries,  spearheaded  a  move- 
ment  that  sought  to  bring  Western  intellectual  and 
technological  innovations  to  Indians.  Interpretations  of  the 
causes  of  India's  cultural  and  spiritual  "backwardness"  varied, 
as  did  the  solutions.  Many  argued  that  it  was  Europe's  mission 
to  civilize  India  and  hold  it  as  a  trust  until  Indians  proved 
themselves  competent  for  self-rule. 

The  immediate  consequence  of  this  sense  of  superiority  was 
to  open  India  to  more  aggressive  missionary  activity.  The  con- 
tributions of  three  missionaries  based  in  Serampore  (a  Danish 
enclave  in  Bengal) — William  Carey,  Joshua  Marshman,  and 
William  Ward — remained  unequaled  and  have  provided  inspi- 
ration for  future  generations  of  their  successors.  The  mission- 
aries translated  the  Bible  into  the  vernaculars,  taught  company 
officials  local  languages,  and,  after  1813,  gained  permission  to 
proselytize  in  the  company's  territories.  Although  the  actual 
number  of  converts  remained  negligible,  except  in  rare 
instances  when  entire  groups  embraced  Christianity,  such  as 
the  Nayars  in  the  south  or  the  Nagas  in  the  northeast,  the  mis- 
sionary impact  on  India  through  publishing,  schools,  orphan- 
ages, vocational  institutions,  dispensaries,  and  hospitals  was 
unmistakable. 

The  British  Parliament  enacted  a  series  of  laws,  among 
which  the  Regulating  Act  of  1773  stood  first,  to  curb  the  com- 
pany traders'  unrestrained  commercial  activities  and  to  bring 
about  some  order  in  territories  under  company  control.  Limit- 
ing the  company  charter  to  periods  of  twenty  years,  subject  to 
review  upon  renewal,  the  1773  act  gave  the  British  government 
supervisory  rights  over  the  Bengal,  Bombay,  and  Madras  presi- 
dencies. Bengal  was  given  preeminence  over  the  rest  because 
of  its  enormous  commercial  vitality  and  because  it  was  the  seat 
of  British  power  in  India  (at  Calcutta),  whose  governor  was  ele- 
vated to  the  new  position  of  governor-general.  Warren  Hastings 
was  the  first  incumbent  (1773-85).  The  India  Act  of  1784, 
sometimes  described  as  the  "half-loaf  system,"  as  it  sought  to 
mediate  between  Parliament  and  the  company  directors, 


32 


Historical  Setting 


enhanced  Parliament's  control  by  establishing  the  Board  of 
Control,  whose  members  were  selected  from  the  cabinet.  The 
Charter  Act  of  1813  recognized  British  moral  responsibility  by 
introducing  just  and  humane  laws  in  India,  foreshadowing 
future  social  legislation,  and  outlawing  a  number  of  traditional 
practices  such  as  sati  and  thagi  (or  thugee,  robbery  coupled 
with  ritual  murder). 

As  governor-general  from  1786  to  1793,  Charles  Cornwallis 
(the  Marquis  of  Cornwallis),  professionalized,  bureau cratized, 
and  Europeanized  the  company's  administration.  He  also  out- 
lawed private  trade  by  company  employees,  separated  the  com- 
mercial and  administrative  functions,  and  remunerated 
company  servants  with  generous  graduated  salaries.  Because 
revenue  collection  became  the  company's  most  essential 
administrative  function,  Cornwallis  made  a  compact  with  Ben- 
gali zamindars,  who  were  perceived  as  the  Indian  counterparts 
to  the  British  landed  gentry.  The  Permanent  Settlement  sys- 
tem, also  known  as  the  zamindari  system,  fixed  taxes  in  perpe- 
tuity in  return  for  ownership  of  large  estates;  but  the  state  was 
excluded  from  agricultural  expansion,  which  came  under  the 
purview  of  the  zamindars.  In  Madras  and  Bombay,  however,  the 
ryotwari  (peasant)  settlement  system  was  set  in  motion,  in 
which  peasant  cultivators  had  to  pay  annual  taxes  directly  to 
the  government. 

Neither  the  zamindari  nor  the  ryotwari  systems  proved  effec- 
tive in  the  long  run  because  India  was  integrated  into  an  inter- 
national economic  and  pricing  system  over  which  it  had  no 
control,  while  increasing  numbers  of  people  subsisted  on  agri- 
culture for  lack  of  other  employment.  Millions  of  people 
involved  in  the  heavily  taxed  Indian  textile  industry  also  lost 
their  markets,  as  they  were  unable  to  compete  successfully  with 
cheaper  textiles  produced  in  Lancashire's  mills  from  Indian 
raw  materials. 

Beginning  with  the  Mayor's  Court,  established  in  1727  for 
civil  litigation  in  Bombay,  Calcutta,  and  Madras,  justice  in  the 
interior  came  under  the  company's  jurisdiction.  In  1772  an 
elaborate  judicial  system,  known  as  adalat,  established  civil  and 
criminal  jurisdictions  along  with  a  corrfplex  set  of  codes  or 
rules  of  procedure  and  evidence.  Both  Hindu  pandits  (see 
Glossary)  and  Muslim  qazis  (sharia  court  judges)  were 
recruited  to  aid  the  presiding  judges  in  interpreting  their  cus- 
tomary laws,  but  in  other  instances,  British  common  and  statu- 
tory laws  became  applicable.  In  extraordinary  situations  where 


33 


India:  A  Country  Study 


none  of  these  systems  was  applicable.,  the  judges  were  enjoined 
to  adjudicate  on  the  basis  of  'justice.,  equity,  and  good  con- 
science." The  legal  profession  provided  numerous  opportuni- 
ties for  educated  and  talented  Indians  who  were  unable  to 
secure  positions  in  the  company,  and.,  as  a  result..  Indian  law- 
yers later  dominated  nationalist  politics  and  reform  move- 
ments. 

Education  for  the  most  part  was  left  to  the  charge  of  Indians 
or  to  private  agents  who  imparted  instruction  in  the  vernacu- 
lars. But  in  1813..  the  British  became  convinced  of  their  "duty" 
to  awaken  the  Indians  from  intellectual  slumber  bv  exposing 
them  to  British  literary  traditions.,  earmarking  a  paltry  sum  for 
the  cause.  Controversy  between  two  groups  of  Europeans — the 
"Orientalists"  and  "Anglicists" — over  how  the  monev  was  to  be 
spent  prevented  them  from  formulating  anv  consistent  policv 
until  1S35  when  William  Cavendish  Bentinck.  the  governor- 
general  from  1S2S  to  1S35.  finally  broke  the  impasse  bv  resolv- 
ing to  introduce  the  English  language  as  the  medium  of 
instruction.  English  replaced  Persian  in  public  administration 
and  education. 

The  company's  education  policies  in  the  1830s  tended  to 
reinforce  existing  lines  of  socioeconomic  division  in  society 
rather  than  bringing  general  liberation  from  ignorance  and 
superstition.  Whereas  the  Hindu  English-educated  minority 
spearheaded  manv  social  and  religious  reforms  either  in  direct 
response  to  government  policies  or  in  reaction  to  them.  Mus- 
lims as  a  group  initially  failed  to  do  so,  a  position  they  endeav- 
ored to  reverse.  Western-educated  Hindu  elites  sought  to  rid 
Hinduism  of  its  much  criticized  social  evils:  idolatry  the  caste 
svstem.  child  marriage,  and  sati.  Religious  and  social  activist 
Ram  Mohan  Rov  (1772-1833).  who  founded  the  Brahmo 
Samaj  (Society  of  Brahma)  in  1828,  displayed  a  readiness  to 
synthesize  themes  taken  from  Christianity*.  Deism,  and  Indian 
monism,  while  other  individuals  in  Bombay  and  Madras  initi- 
ated literary  and  debatine;  societies  that  grave  them  a  forum  for 
open  discourse.  The  exemplary  educational  attainments  and 
skillful  use  of  the  press  bv  these  early  reformers  enhanced  the 
possibility  of  effecting  broad  reforms  without  compromising 
societal  values  or  religious  practices. 

The  1850s  witnessed  the  introduction  of  the  three  "engines 
of  social  improvement"  that  heightened  the  British  illusion  of 
permanence  in  India.  Thev  were  the  railroads,  the  telegraph, 
and  the  uniform  postal  service,  inaugurated  during  the  tenure 


34 


Historical  Setting 


of  Dalhousie  as  governor-general.  The  first  railroad  lines  were 
built  in  1850  from  Howrah  (Haora,  across  the  Hughli  River 
from  Calcutta)  inland  to  the  coalfields  at  Raniganj,  Bihar,  a  dis- 
tance of  240  kilometers.  In  1851  the  first  electric  telegraph  line 
was  laid  in  Bengal  and  soon  linked  Agra,  Bombay,  Calcutta, 
Lahore,  Varanasi,  and  other  cities.  The  three  different  presi- 
dency or  regional  postal  systems  merged  in  1854  to  facilitate 
uniform  methods  of  communication  at  an  all-India  level.  With 
uniform  postal  rates  for  letters  and  newspapers — one-half  anna 
and  one  anna,  respectively  (sixteen  annas  equalled  one 
rupee) — communication  between  the  rural  and  the  metropoli- 
tan areas  became  easier  and  faster.  The  increased  ease  of  com- 
munication and  the  opening  of  highways  and  waterways 
accelerated  the  movement  of  troops,  the  transportation  of  raw 
materials  and  goods  to  and  from  the  interior,  and  the 
exchange  of  commercial  information. 

The  railroads  did  not  break  down  the  social  or  cultural  dis- 
tances between  various  groups  but  tended  to  create  new  cate- 
gories in  travel.  Separate  compartments  in  the  trains  were 
reserved  exclusively  for  the  ruling  class,  separating  the  edu- 
cated and  wealthy  from  ordinary  people.  Similarly,  when  the 
Sepoy  Rebellion  was  quelled  in  1858,  a  British  official 
exclaimed  that  "the  telegraph  saved  India."  He  envisaged,  of 
course,  that  British  interests  in  India  would  continue  indefi- 
nitely. 

The  British  Raj,  1 858-1 947 

Sepoy  Rebellion,  1857-59 

On  May  10,  1857,  Indian  soldiers  of  the  British  Indian  Army, 
drawn  mostly  from  Muslim  units  from  Bengal,  mutinied  in 
Meerut,  a  cantonment  eighty  kilometers  northeast  of  Delhi. 
The  rebels  marched  to  Delhi  to  offer  their  services  to  the 
Mughal  emperor,  and  soon  much  of  north  and  central  India 
was  plunged  into  a  year-long  insurrection  against  the  British. 

The  uprising,  which  seriously  threatened  British  rule  in 
India,  has  been  called  many  names  by  historians,  including  the 
Sepoy  Rebellion,  the  Great  Mutiny,  and  the  Revolt  of  1857; 
many  people  in  South  Asia,  however,  prefer  to  call  it  India's 
first  war  of  independence.  Undoubtedly,  it  was  the  culmination 
of  mounting  Indian  resentment  toward  British  economic  and 
social  policies  over  many  decades.  Until  the  rebellion,  the  Brit- 
ish had  succeeded  in  suppressing  numerous  riots  and  "tribal"

wars  or  in  accommodating  them  through  concessions,  but  two 
events  triggered  the  violent  explosion  of  wrath  in  1857.  First, 
was  the  annexation  in  1856  of  Oudh,  a  wealthv  princelv  state 
that  generated  huge  revenue  and  represented  a  vestige  of 
Mughal  authority.  The  second  was  the  British  blunder  in  using 
cartridges  for  the  Lee-Enfield  rifle  that  were  allegedly  greased 
with  animal  fat.  which  was  offensive  to  the  religious  beliefs  of 
Muslim  and  Hindu  sepoys.  The  rebellion  soon  engulfed  much 
of  North  India,  including  Oudh  and  various  areas  once  under 
the  control  of  Maratha  princes.  Isolated  mutinies  also  occurred 
at  military  posts  in  the  center  of  the  subcontinent.  Initially,  the 
rebels,  although  divided  and  uncoordinated,  gained  the  upper 
hand,  while  the  unprepared  British  were  terrified,  and  even 
paralvzed,  without  replacements  for  the  casualties.  The  civil 
war  inflicted  havoc  on  both  Indians  and  British  as  each  vented 
its  fury  on  the  other:  each  community  suffered  humiliation 
and  triumph  in  battle  as  well,  although  the  final  outcome  was 
victory  for  the  British.  The  last  major  sepoy  rebels  surrendered 
on  June  21.  1858,  at  Gwalior  (Madhva  Pradesh)  ,  one  of  the 
principal  centers  of  the  revolt.  A  final  battle  was  fought  at  Sirwa 
Pass  on  May  21,  1859,  and  the  defeated  rebels  fled  into  Nepal. 

The  spontaneous  and  widespread  rebellion  later  fired  the 
imagination  of  the  nationalists  who  would  debate  the  most 
effective  method  of  protest  against  British  rule.  For  them,  the 
rebellion  represented  the  first  Indian  attempt  at  gaining  inde- 
pendence. This  interpretation,  however,  is  open  to  serious 
question. 

Post-Rebellion  Developments 

The  civil  war  was  a  major  turning  point  in  the  history  of 
modern  India.  In  May  1858,  the  British  exiled  Emperor  Baha- 
dur Shah  II  (r.  1837-57)  to  Burma,  thus  formally  liquidating 
the  Mughal  Empire.  At  the  same  time,  thev  abolished  the  Brit- 
ish East  India  Company  and  replaced  it  with  direct  rule  under 
the  British  crown.  In  proclaiming  the  new  direct-rule  policy  to 
"the  Princes.  Chiefs,  and  Peoples  of  India."  Queen  Victoria 
(who  was  given  the  title  Empress  of  India  in  1877)  promised 
equal  treatment  under  British  law,  but  Indian  mistrust  of  Brit- 
ish rule  had  become  a  legacv  of  the  1857  rebellion.  Many  exist- 
ing economic  and  revenue  policies  remained  virtually 
unchanged  in  the  post-1857  period,  but  several  administrative 
modifications  were  introduced,  beginning  with  the  creation  in 
London  of  a  cabinet  post,  the  secretary  of  state  for  India.  The 


36 


Historical  Setting 


governor-general  (called  viceroy  when  acting  as  the  direct  rep- 
resentative of  the  British  crown),  headquartered  in  Calcutta, 
ran  the  administration  in  India,  assisted  by  executive  and  legis- 
lative councils.  Beneath  the  governor-general  were  the  provin- 
cial governors,  who  held  power  over  the  district  officials,  who 
formed  the  lower  rungs  of  the  Indian  Civil  Service.  For 
decades  the  Indian  Civil  Service  was  the  exclusive  preserve  of 
the  British-born,  as  were  the  superior  ranks  in  such  other  pro- 
fessions as  law  and  medicine.  The  British  administrators  were 
imbued  with  a  sense  of  duty  in  ruling  India  and  were  rewarded 
with  good  salaries,  high  status,  and  opportunities  for  promo- 
tion. Not  until  the  1910s  did  the  British  reluctantly  permit  a 
few  Indians  into  their  cadre  as  the  number  of  English-educated 
Indians  rose  steadily. 

The  viceroy  announced  in  1858  that  the  government  would 
honor  former  treaties  with  princely  states  and  renounced  the 
"doctrine  of  lapse,"  whereby  the  East  India  Company  had 
annexed  territories  of  rulers  who  died  without  male  heirs. 
About  40  percent  of  Indian  territory  and  between  20  and  25 
percent  of  the  population  remained  under  the  control  of  562 
princes  notable  for  their  religious  (Islamic,  Sikh,  Hindu,  and 
other)  and  ethnic  diversity.  Their  propensity  for  pomp  and  cer- 
emony became  proverbial,  while  their  domains,  varying  in  size 
and  wealth,  lagged  behind  sociopolitical  transformations  that 
took  place  elsewhere  in  British-controlled  India. 

A  more  thorough  reorganization  was  effected  in  the  consti- 
tution of  army  and  government  finances.  Shocked  by  the 
extent  of  solidarity  among  Indian  soldiers  during  the  rebellion, 
the  government  separated  the  army  into  the  three  presidencies 
(see  Company  Armies,  ch.  10). 

British  attitudes  toward  Indians  shifted  from  relative  open- 
ness to  insularity  and  xenophobia,  even  against  those  with  com- 
parable background  and  achievement  as  well  as  loyalty.  British 
families  and  their  servants  lived  in  cantonments  at  a  distance 
from  Indian  settlements.  Private  clubs  where  the  British  gath- 
ered for  social  interaction  became  symbols  of  exclusivity  and 
snobbery  that  refused  to  disappear  decades  after  the  British 
had  left  India.  In  1883  the  government  of  India  attempted  to 
remove  race  barriers  in  criminal  jurisdictions  by  introducing  a 
bill  empowering  Indian  judges  to  adjudicate  offenses  commit- 
ted by  Europeans.  Public  protests  and  editorials  in  the  British 
press,  however,  forced  the  viceroy,  George  Robinson,  Marquis 
of  Ripon  (who  served  from  1880  to  1884),  to  capitulate  and

modify  the  bill  drastically.  The  Bengali  Hindu  intelligentsia 
learned  a  valuable  political  lesson  from  this  "white  mutiny":  the 
effectiveness  of  well-orchestrated  agitation  through  demonstra- 
tions in  the  streets  and  publicity  in  the  media  when  seeking 
redress  for  real  and  imagined  grievances. 

The  Independence  Movement 

Origins  of  the  Congress  and  the  Muslim  League 

The  decades  following  the  Sepoy  Rebellion  were  a  period  of 
growing  political  awareness,  manifestation  of  Indian  public 
opinion,  and  emergence  of  Indian  leadership  at  national  and 
provincial  levels.  Ominous  economic  uncertainties  created  by 
British  colonial  rule  and  the  limited  opportunities  that  awaited 
the  ever-expanding  number  of  Western-educated  graduates 
began  to  dominate  the  rhetoric  of  leaders  who  had  begun  to 
think  of  themselves  as  a  "nation,"  despite  fissures  along  the 
lines  of  region,  religion,  language,  and  caste.  Inspired  by  the 
suggestion  made  by  A.O.  Hume,  a  retired  British  civil  servant, 
seventy-three  Indian  delegates  met  in  Bombay  in  1885  and 
founded  the  Indian  National  Congress  (Congress — see  Glos- 
sary) .  They  were  mostly  members  of  the  upwardly  mobile  and 
successful  Western-educated  provincial  elites,  engaged  in  pro- 
fessions such  as  law,  teaching,  and  journalism.  They  had 
acquired  political  experience  from  regional  competition  in  the 
professions  and  from  their  aspirations  in  securing  nomination 
to  various  positions  in  legislative  councils,  universities,  and  spe- 
cial commissions. 

At  its  inception,  the  Congress  had  no  well-defined  ideology 
and  commanded  few  of  the  resources  essential  to  a  political 
organization.  It  functioned  more  as  a  debating  society  that  met 
annually  to  express  its  loyalty  to  the  Raj  and  passed  numerous 
resolutions  on  less  controversial  issues  such  as  civil  rights  or 
opportunities  in  government,  especially  the  civil  service.  These 
resolutions  were  submitted  to  the  viceroy's  government  and, 
occasionally,  to  the  British  Parliament,  but  the  Congress's  early 
gains  were  meager.  Despite  its  claim  to  represent  all  India,  the 
Congress  voiced  the  interests  of  urban  elites;  the  number  of 
participants  from  other  economic  backgrounds  remained  neg- 
ligible. 

By  1900,  although  the  Congress  had  emerged  as  an  all-India 
political  organization,  its  achievement  was  undermined  by  its 
singular  failure  to  attract  Muslims,  who  had  by  then  begun  to 


38 


Historical  Setting 


realize  their  inadequate  education  and  underrepresentation  in 
government  service.  Muslim  leaders  saw  that  their  community 
had  fallen  behind  the  Hindus.  Attacks  by  Hindu  reformers 
against  religious  conversion,  cow  killing,  and  the  preservation 
of  Urdu  in  Arabic  script  deepened  their  fears  of  minority  status 
and  denial  of  their  rights  if  the  Congress  alone  were  to  repre- 
sent the  people  of  India.  For  many  Muslims,  loyalty  to  the  Brit- 
ish crown  seemed  preferable  to  cooperation  with  Congress 
leaders.  Sir  Sayyid  Ahmad  Khan  (1817-98)  launched  a  move- 
ment for  Muslim  regeneration  that  culminated  in  the  founding 
in  1875  of  the  Muhammadan  Anglo-Oriental  College  at  Ali- 
garh,  Uttar  Pradesh  (renamed  Aligarh  Muslim  University  in 
1921).  Its  objective  was  to  educate  wealthy  students  by  empha- 
sizing the  compatibility  of  Islam  with  modern  Western  knowl- 
edge. The  diversity  among  India's  Muslims,  however,  made  it 
impossible  to  bring  about  uniform  cultural  and  intellectual 
regeneration. 

Sir  George  Curzon,  the  governor-general  (1899-1905), 
ordered  the  partition  of  Bengal  in  1905.  He  wanted  to  improve 
administrative  efficiency  in  that  huge  and  populous  region, 
where  the  Bengali  Hindu  intelligentsia  exerted  considerable 
influence  on  local  and  national  politics.  The  partition  created 
two  provinces:  Eastern  Bengal  and  Assam,  with  its  capital  at 
Dhaka  (then  spelled  Dacca),  and  West  Bengal,  with  its  capital 
at  Calcutta  (which  also  served  as  the  capital  of  British  India). 
An  ill-conceived  and  hastily  implemented  action,  the  partition 
outraged  Bengalis.  Not  only  had  the  government  failed  to  con- 
sult Indian  public  opinion  but  the  action  appeared  to  reflect 
the  British  resolve  to  "divide  and  rule."  Widespread  agitation 
ensued  in  the  streets  and  in  the  press,  and  the  Congress  advo- 
cated boycotting  British  products  under  the  banner  of  swadeshi 
(home-made — see  Glossary). 

The  Congress-led  boycott  of  British  goods  was  so  successful 
that  it  unleashed  anti-British  forces  to  an  extent  unknown  since 
the  Sepoy  Rebellion.  A  cycle  of  violence,  terrorism,  and  repres- 
sion ensued  in  some  parts  of  the  country.  The  British  tried  to 
mitigate  the  situation  by  announcing  a  series  of  constitutional 
reforms  in  1909  and  by  appointing  a  few  moderates  to  the 
imperial  and  provincial  councils.  In  1906  a  Muslim  deputation 
met  with  the  viceroy,  Gilbert  John  Elliot  (1905-10),  seeking 
concessions  from  the  impending  constitutional  reforms, 
including  special  considerations  in  government  service  and 
electorates.  The  All-India  Muslim  League  (Muslim  League — 


39 


India:  A  Country  Study 

see  Glossary)  was  founded  the  same  year  to  promote  loyalty  to 
the  British  and  to  advance  Muslim  political  rights,  which  the 
British  recognized  bv  increasing  the  number  of  elective  offices 
reserved  for  Muslims  in  the  India  Councils  Act  of  1909.  The 
Muslim  League  insisted  on  its  separateness  from  the  Hindu- 
dominated  Congress,  as  the  voice  of  a  "nation  within  a  nation." 

In  what  the  British  saw  as  an  additional  goodwill  gesture,  in 
1911  King-Emperor  George  A'  (r  1910-36)  visited  India  for  a 
durbar  (  a  traditional  court  held  for  subjects  to  express  fealty  to 
their  ruler),  during  which  he  announced  the  reversal  of  the 
partition  of  Bengal  and  the  transfer  of  the  capital  from  Cal- 
cutta to  a  newly  planned  citv  to  be  built  immediately  south  of 
Delhi,  which  became  New  Delhi. 

War,  Reforms,  and  Agitation 

World  "War  I  began  with  an  unprecedented  outpouring  of 
lovaltv  and  goodwill  toward  the  British,  contrary  to  initial  Brit- 
ish fears  of  an  Indian  revolt.  India  contributed  generously  to 
the  British  war  effort,  by  providing  men  and  resources.  About 
1.3  million  Indian  soldiers  and  laborers  served  in  Europe. 
Africa,  and  the  Middle  East,  while  both  the  Indian  government 
and  the  princes  sent  large  supplies  of  food,  money  and  ammu- 
nition. But  disillusionment  set  in  earlv  High  casualty  rates,, 
soaring  inflation  compounded  bv  he  aw  taxation,  a  widespread 
influenza  epidemic,  and  the  disruption  of  trade  during  the  war 
escalated  human  suffering  in  India.  The  prewar  nationalist 
movement  revived  as  moderate  and  extremist  groups  within 
the  Congress  submerged  their  differences  in  order  to  stand  as 
a  unified  front.  The  Congress  even  succeeded  in  forging  a  tem- 
porarv  alliance  with  the  Muslim  League — the  Lucknow  Pact,  or 
Congress-League  Scheme  of  Reforms — in  1916.  over  the  issues 
of  devolution  of  political  power  and  the  future  of  Islam  in  the 
Middle  East. 

The  British  themselves  adopted  a  "carrot  and  stick" 
approach  in  recognition  of  India's  support  during  the  war  and 
in  response  to  renewed  nationalist  demands.  In  August  1917. 
Edwin  Montagu,  the  secretary  of  state  for  India,  made  the  his- 
toric announcement  in  Parliament  that  the  British  policy  for 
India  was  "increasing  association  of  Indians  in  every  branch  of 
the  administration  and  the  gradual  development  of  self-gov- 
erning institutions  with  a  view  to  the  progressive  realization  of 
responsible  government  in  India  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Brit- 
ish Empire.   The  means  of  achieving  the  proposed  measure 


40 


Historical  Setting 


were  later  enshrined  in  the  Government  of  India  Act  of  1919, 
which  introduced  the  principle  of  a  dual  mode  of  administra- 
tion, or  dyarchy,  in  which  both  elected  Indian  legislators  and 
appointed  British  officials  shared  power.  The  act  also 
expanded  the  central  and  provincial  legislatures  and  widened 
the  franchise  considerably.  Dyarchy  set  in  motion  certain  real 
changes  at  the  provincial  level:  a  number  of  noncontroversial 
or  "transferred"  portfolios — such  as  agriculture,  local  govern- 
ment, health,  education,  and  public  works — were  handed  over 
to  Indians,  while  more  sensitive  matters  such  as  finance,  taxa- 
tion, and  maintaining  law  and  order  were  retained  by  the  pro- 
vincial British  administrators. 

The  positive  impact  of  reform  was  seriously  undermined  in 
1919  by  the  Rowlatt  Acts,  named  after  the  recommendations 
made  the  previous  year  to  the  Imperial  Legislative  Council  by 
the  Rowlatt  Commission,  which  had  been  appointed  to  investi- 
gate "seditious  conspiracy."  The  Rowlatt  Acts,  also  known  as  the 
Black  Acts,  vested  the  viceroy's  government  with  extraordinary 
powers  to  quell  sedition  by  silencing  the  press,  detaining  politi- 
cal activists  without  trial,  and  arresting  any  suspected  individu- 
als without  a  warrant.  No  sooner  had  the  acts  come  into  force 
in  March  1919 — despite  opposition  by  Indian  members  on  the 
Imperial  Legislative  Council — than  a  nationwide  cessation  of 
work  {hartal)  was  called  by  Mohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi 
(1869-1948).  Others  took  up  his  call,  marking  the  beginning 
of  widespread — although  not  nationwide — popular  discontent. 
The  agitation  unleashed  by  the  acts  culminated  on  April  13, 
1919,  in  Amritsar,  Punjab.  The  British  military  commander, 
Brigadier  Reginald  E.H.  Dyer,  ordered  his  soldiers  to  fire  at 
point-blank  range  into  an  unarmed  and  unsuspecting  crowd  of 
some  10,000  men,  women,  and  children.  They  had  assembled 
at  Jallianwala  Bagh,  a  walled  garden,  to  celebrate  a  Hindu  festi- 
val without  prior  knowledge  of  the  imposition  of  martial  law.  A 
total  of  1,650  rounds  were  fired,  killing  379  persons  and 
wounding  1,137  in  the  episode,  which  dispelled  wartime  hopes 
and  goodwill  in  a  frenzy  of  postwar  reaction. 

Mahatma  Gandhi 

That  India  opted  for  an  entirely  original  path  to  solving  this 
crisis  and  obtaining  swaraj  (independence)  was  due  largely  to 
Gandhi,  commonly  known  as  "Mahatma"  (or  Great  Soul)  or,  as 
he  himself  preferred,  "Gandhiji"  (an  honorific  term  for  Gan- 
dhi). A  native  of  Gujarat  who  had  been  educated  in  Britain,  he 


41 


India:  A  Country  Study 

was  an  obscure  and  unsuccessful  provincial  lawyer.  Gandhi  had 
accepted  an  invitation  in  1893  to  represent  indentured  Indian 
laborers  in  South  Africa,  where  he  stayed  on  for  more  than 
twenty  years,  emerging  ultimately  as  the  voice  and  conscience 
of  thousands  who  had  been  subjected  to  blatant  racial  discrimi- 
nation. He  returned  to  India  in  1915,  virtually  a  stranger  to 
public  life  but  "fired  with  a  religious  vision  of  a  new  India, 
whose  swaraj  .  .  .  would  [be]  a  moral  reformation  of  a  whole 
people  which  would  either  convert  the  British  also  or  render 
their  Raj  impossible  by  Indian  withdrawal  of  support  for  it  and 
its  modern  values,"  according  to  historian  Judith  M.  Brown. 

Gandhi's  ideas  and  strategies  of  nonviolent  civil  disobedi- 
ence (satyagraha — see  Glossary),  first  applied  during  his  South 
Africa  days,  initially  appeared  impractical  to  many  educated 
Indians.  In  Gandhi's  own  words,  "Civil  disobedience  is  civil 
breach  of  unmoral  statutory  enactments,"  but  as  he  viewed  it,  it 
had  to  be  carried  out  nonviolently  by  withdrawing  cooperation 
with  the  corrupt  state.  Observers  realized  Gandhi's  political 
potential  when  he  used  the  satyagraha  during  the  anti-Rowlatt 
Acts  protests  in  Punjab.  In  1920,  under  Gandhi's  leadership, 
the  Congress  was  reorganized  and  given  a  new  constitution, 
whose  goal  was  swaraj.  Membership  in  the  party  was  opened  to 
anyone  prepared  to  pay  a  token  fee,  and  a  hierarchy  of  com- 
mittees— from  district,  to  province,  to  all-India — was  estab- 
lished and  made  responsible  for  discipline  and  control  over  a 
hitherto  amorphous  and  diffuse  movement.  During  his  first 
nationwide  satyagraha,  Gandhi  urged  the  people  to  boycott 
British  education  institutions,  law  courts,  and  products  (in 
favor  of  swadeshi);  to  resign  from  government  employment;  to 
refuse  to  pay  taxes;  and  to  forsake  British  titles  and  honors. 
The  party  was  transformed  from  an  elite  organization  to  one  of 
mass  national  appeal. 

Although  Gandhi's  first  nationwide  satyagraha  was  too  late 
to  influence  the  framing  of  the  new  Government  of  India  Act 
of  1919,  the  magnitude  of  disorder  resulting  from  the  move- 
ment was  unparalleled  and  presented  a  new  challenge  to  for- 
eign rule.  Gandhi  was  forced  to  call  off  the  campaign  in  1922 
because  of  atrocities  committed  against  police.  However,  the 
abortive  campaign  marked  a  milestone  in  India's  political 
development.  For  his  efforts,  Gandhi  was  imprisoned  until 
1924.  On  his  release  from  prison,  he  set  up  an  ashram  (a  rural 
commune),  established  a  newspaper,  and  inaugurated  a  series 
of  reforms  aimed  at  the  socially  disadvantaged  within  Hindu

society,  the  rural  poor,  and  the  Untouchables  (see  Changes  in 
the  Caste  System,  ch.  5).  His  popularity  soared  in  Indian  poli- 
tics as  he  reached  the  hearts  and  minds  of  ordinary  people, 
winning  support  for  his  causes  as  no  one  else  had  ever  done 
before.  By  his  personal  and  eclectic  piety,  his  asceticism,  his 
vegetarianism,  his  espousal  of  Hindu-Muslim  unity,  and  his 
firm  belief  in  ahimsa,  Gandhi  appealed  to  the  loftier  Hindu 
ideals.  For  Gandhi,  moral  regeneration,  social  progress,  and 
national  freedom  were  inseparable. 

Emerging  leaders  within  the  Congress — Jawaharlal  Nehru, 
Vallabhbhai  Patel,  Rajendra  Prasad,  C.  Rajagopalachari,  Mau- 
lana  Abdul  Kalam  Azad,  Subhas  Chandra  Bose,  and  Jaya- 
prakash  (J. P.)  Narayan — accepted  Gandhi's  leadership  in  artic- 
ulating nationalist  aspirations  but  disagreed  on  strategies  for 
wresting  more  concessions  from  the  British.  The  Indian  politi- 
cal spectrum  was  further  broadened  in  the  mid-1920s  by  the 


43

emergence  of  both  moderate  and  militant  parties,  such  as  the 
Swaraj  Party  (sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Swarajist  Party),  the 
Mahasabha  Party  (literally,  great  council;  an  orthodox  Hindu 
communal  party),  the  Unionist  Party,  the  Communist  Party  of 
India,  and  the  Socialist  Independence  for  India  League. 
Regional  political  organizations  also  continued  to  represent 
the  interests  of  non-Brahmans  in  Madras,  Mahars  in  Maharash- 
tra, and  Sikhs  in  Punjab. 

The  Congress,  however,  kept  itself  aloof  from  competing  in 
elections.  As  voices  inside  and  outside  the  Congress  became 
more  strident,  the  British  appointed  a  commission  in  1927, 
under  Sir  John  Simon,  to  recommend  further  measures  in  the 
constitutional  devolution  of  power.  The  British  failure  to 
appoint  an  Indian  member  to  the  commission  outraged  the 
Congress  and  others,  and,  as  a  result,  they  boycotted  it 
throughout  India,  carrying  placards  inscribed  "Simon,  Go 
Back."  In  1929  the  Congress  responded  by  drafting  its  own  con- 
stitution under  the  guidance  of  Motilal  Nehru  (Jawaharlal's 
father)  demanding  full  independence  (puma  swaraj)  by  1930; 
the  Congress  went  so  far  as  to  observe  January  26,  1930,  as  the 
first  anniversary  of  the  first  year  of  independence. 

Gandhi  reemerged  from  his  long  seclusion  by  undertaking 
his  most  inspired  campaign,  a  march  of  about  400  kilometers 
from  his  commune  in  Ahmadabad  to  Dandi,  on  the  coast  of 
Gujarat  between  March  12  and  April  6,  1930.  At  Dandi,  in  pro- 
test against  extortionate  British  taxes  on  salt,  he  and  thousands 
of  followers  illegally  but  symbolically  made  their  own  salt  from 
sea  water.  Their  defiance  reflected  India's  determination  to  be 
free,  despite  the  imprisonment  of  thousands  of  protesters.  For 
the  next  five  years,  the  Congress  and  government  were  locked 
in  conflict  and  negotiations  until  what  became  the  Govern- 
ment of  India  Act  of  1935  could  be  hammered  out.  But  by 
then,  the  rift  between  the  Congress  and  the  Muslim  League 
had  become  unbridgeable  as  each  pointed  the  finger  at  the 
other  acrimoniously.  The  Muslim  League  disputed  the  claim  by 
the  Congress  to  represent  all  people  of  India,  while  the  Con- 
gress disputed  the  Muslim  League's  claim  to  voice  the  aspira- 
tions of  all  Muslims. 

The  1935  act,  the  voluminous  and  final  constitutional  effort 
at  governing  British  India,  articulated  three  major  goals:  estab- 
lishing a  loose  federal  structure,  achieving  provincial  auton- 
omy, and  safeguarding  minority  interests  through  separate 
electorates.  The  federal  provisions,  intended  to  unite  princely

states  and  British  India  at  the  center,  were  not  implemented 
because  of  ambiguities  in  safeguarding  the  existing  privileges 
of  princes.  In  February  1937,  however,  provincial  autonomy 
became  a  reality  when  elections  were  held;  the  Congress 
emerged  as  the  dominant  party  with  a  clear  majority  in  five 
provinces  and  held  an  upper  hand  in  two,  while  the  Muslim 
League  performed  poorly. 

Political  Impasse  and  Independence 

The  Congress  neither  acknowledged  the  Muslim  League's 
performance,  albeit  poor,  in  the  elections  nor  deigned  to  form 
a  coalition  government  with  the  League,  a  situation  that  led  to 
the  collapse  of  negotiations  and  mutual  trust  between  the  lead- 
ers. Mohammad  Alijinnah,  a  Western-educated  Muslim  lawyer, 
took  over  the  presidency  of  the  moribund  Muslim  League  and 
galvanized  it  into  a  national  force  under  the  battle  cry  of  "Islam 
in  danger."  Jinnah  doubted  the  motives  of  Gandhi  and  Nehru 
and  accused  them  of  practicing  Hindu  chauvinism.  He  relent- 
lessly attacked  the  Congress-led  ministries,  accusing  them  of 
casteism,  corruption,  and  nepotism.  Skillfully,  he  succeeded  in 
unifying  various  regional  Islamic  organizations  and  factions  in 
Punjab  and  Bengal  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Muslim  League. 

Electoral  gains  by  the  Congress  in  1937  were  rendered 
ephemeral  as  its  leaders  ordered  provincial  ministries  to  resign 
in  November  1939,  when  the  viceroy  (Victor  Alexander  John 
Hope,  Marquis  of  Linlithgow — 1936-43)  declared  India's 
entrance  into  World  War  II  without  consulting  Indian  leaders. 
Jinnah  and  the  Muslim  League  welcomed  the  Congress  with- 
drawal from  government  as  a  timely  opportunity  and  observed 
a  day  of  thanksgiving  on  December  22,  1939.  Jinnah  persuaded 
the  participants  at  the  annual  Muslim  League  session  in 
Lahore  in  1940  to  adopt  what  later  came  to  be  known  as  the 
Pakistan  Resolution,  demanding  the  division  of  India  into  two 
separate  sovereign  states,  one  Muslim,  the  other  Hindu. 
Although  the  idea  of  Pakistan  had  been  introduced  as  early  as 
1930  at  Allahabad,  very  few  had  responded  to  it.  However,  the 
volatile  political  climate,  the  personal  hostilities  between  the 
leaders,  and  the  opportunism  of  Jinnah  transformed  the  idea 
of  Pakistan  into  a  popular  demand. 

Between  1940  and  1942,  the  Congress  launched  two  abortive 
agitations  against  the  British,  and  60,000  Congress  members 
were  arrested,  including  Gandhi  and  Nehru.  Unlike  the  unco- 
operative and  belligerent  Congress,  the  Muslim  League  sup-

ported  the  British  during  World  War  II  (see  The  Indian 
Military  under  the  British  Raj,  ch.  10).  Belated  but  perhaps  sin- 
cere British  attempts  to  accommodate  the  demands  of  the  two 
rival  parties,  while  preserving  the  unitary  state  in  India,  seemed 
unacceptable  to  both  as  they  alternately  rejected  whatever  pro- 
posal was  put  forward  during  the  war  years.  As  a  result,  a  three- 
way  impasse  settled  in:  the  Congress  and  the  Muslim  League 
doubted  British  motives  in  handing  over  power  to  Indians, 
while  the  British  struggled  to  retain  some  hold  on  India  while 
offering  to  give  greater  autonomy. 

The  Congress  wasted  precious  time  denouncing  the  British 
rather  than  allaying  Muslim  fears  during  the  highly  charged 
election  campaign  of  1946.  Even  the  more  mature  Congress 
leaders,  especially  Gandhi  and  Nehru,  failed  to  see  how  genu- 
inely afraid  the  Muslims  were  and  how  exhausted  and  weak  the 
British  had  become  in  the  aftermath  of  the  war.  When  it 
appeared  that  the  Congress  had  no  desire  to  share  power  with 
the  Muslim  League  at  the  center,  Jinnah  declared  August  16, 
1946,  Direct  Action  Day,  which  brought  communal  rioting  and 
massacre  in  many  places  in  the  north.  Partition  seemed  prefer- 
able to  civil  war.  On  June  3,  1947,  Viscount  Louis  Mountbatten, 
the  viceroy  (1947)  and  governor-general  (1947-48), 
announced  plans  for  partition  of  the  British  Indian  Empire 
into  the  nations  of  India  and  Pakistan,  which  itself  was  divided 
into  east  and  west  wings  on  either  side  of  India  (see  fig.  4).  At 
midnight,  on  August  15,  1947,  India  strode  to  freedom  amidst 
ecstatic  shouting  of  "Jai  Hind"  (roughly,  Long  Live  India), 
when  Nehru  delivered  a  memorable  and  moving  speech  on 
India's  "tryst  with  destiny." 

Independent  India 

National  Integration 

The  euphoria  of  independence  was  short-lived  as  partition 
brought  disastrous  consequences  for  India  in  the  wake  of  com- 
munal conflict.  Partition  unleashed  untold  misery  and  loss  of 
lives  and  property  as  millions  of  Hindu  and  Muslim  refugees 
fled  either  Pakistan  or  India.  Both  nations  were  also  caught  up 
in  a  number  of  conflicts  involving  the  allocation  of  assets, 
demarcation  of  boundaries,  equitable  sharing  of  water 
resources,  and  control  over  Kashmir.  At  the  same  time,  Indian 
leaders  were  faced  with  the  stupendous  task  of  national  integra- 
tion and  economic  development.

Historical  Setting 


When  the  British  relinquished  their  claims  to  paramountcy, 
the  562  independent  princely  states  were  given  the  option  to 
join  either  of  the  two  nations.  A  few  princely  states  readily 
joined  Pakistan,  but  the  rest — except  Hyderabad  (the  largest  of 
the  princely  states  with  132,000  square  kilometers  and  a  popu- 
lation of  more  than  14  million),  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (with  3 
million  inhabitants),  andjunagadh  (with  a  population  of 
545,000) — merged  with  India.  India  successfully  annexed 
Hyderabad  andjunagadh  after  "police  actions"  and  promises 
of  privileges  to  the  rulers.  The  Hindu  maharajah  of  predomi- 
nantly Muslim  Jammu  and  Kashmir  remained  uncommitted 
until  armed  tribesmen  and  regular  troops  from  Pakistan  infil- 
trated his  domain,  inducing  him  to  sign  the  Instrument  of 
Accession  to  India  on  October  27,  1947.  Pakistan  refused  to 
accept  the  legality  of  the  accession,  and,  as  a  result,  war  broke 
out  (see  The  Experience  of  Wars,  ch.  10).  Kashmir  remains  a 
source  of  friction  between  the  neighbors  (see  South  Asia,  ch. 
9).  The  assassination  of  Mahatma  Gandhi  on  January  30,  1948, 
in  New  Delhi,  by  a  Hindu  extremist  opposed  to  Gandhi's  open- 
ness to  Muslims  ended  the  tenuous  celebration  of  indepen- 
dence and  deepened  the  hatred  and  mutual  suspicion  in 
Hindu-Muslim  relations. 

Economic  backwardness  was  one  of  the  serious  challenges 
that  India  faced  at  independence.  Under  three  successive  five- 
year  plans,  inaugurated  between  1951  and  1964  under  Nehru's 
leadership,  India  produced  increasing  amounts  of  food. 
Although  food  production  did  not  allow  self-sufficiency  until 
fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1984,  India  has  emerged  as  the 
nation  with  the  seventh  largest  gross  national  product  (GNP — 
see  Glossary)  in  the  world  (see  Industry,  ch.  6;  Production,  ch. 
7). 

Linguistic  regionalism  eventually  reached  a  crisis  stage  and 
undermined  the  Congress'  attempts  at  nation  building. 
Whereas  in  the  early  1920s,  the  Congress  had  deemed  that  the 
use  of  regional  vernaculars  in  education  and  administration 
would  facilitate  the  governance  of  the  country,  partition  made 
the  leaders,  especially  Nehru,  realize  how  quickly  such  provin- 
cial or  subnational  interests  would  dismantle  India's  fragile 
unity  (see  Diversity,  Use,  and  Policy,  ch.  4).  However,  in  the 
face  of  widespread  agitation  for  linguistic  separation  of  states, 
beginning  with  the  Telangana  Movement  in  1953,  in  1956 
Nehru  reluctantly  accepted  the  recommendations  of  the  States 
Reorganisation  Commission,  and  the  number  of  states  grew  by

reorganization  along  linguistic  lines.  The  states  became  the 
loci  for  democratization  of  political  processes  at  district  levels, 
for  expression  of  regional  culture  and  popular  demands 
against  a  national  culture  and  unity  for  economic  develop- 
ment at  strategic  localities  in  the  rural  areas,  and  for  prolifera- 
tion of  opposition  parties  that  ended  the  possibility  of  a  pan- 
Indian  two-party  system  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8). 

Nehru's  Legacy 

Jawaharlal  Nehru  (1889-1964),  India's  first  prime  minister, 
was  the  chief  architect  of  domestic  and  foreign  policies 
between  1947  and  1964.  Born  into  a  wealthv  Kashmiri  Brah- 
man familv  and  educated  at  Oxford,  Xehru  embodied  a  syn- 
thesis of  ideals:  politicallv  an  ardent  nationalist,  ideologically  a 
pragmatic  socialist,  and  secular  in  religious  outlook,  Xehru 
possessed  a  rare  combination  of  intellect,  breadth  of  vision, 
and  personal  charisma  that  attracted  support  throughout 
India.  Nehru's  appreciation  for  parliamentarv  democracv  cou- 
pled with  concerns  for  the  poor  and  underprivileged  enabled 
him  to  formulate  policies  that  often  reflected  his  socialist  lean- 
ings. Both  as  prime  minister  and  as  Congress  president,  Xehru 
pushed  through  the  Indian  Parliament,  dominated  by  mem- 
bers of  his  own  partv,  a  series  of  legal  reforms  intended  to 
emancipate  Hindu  women  and  bring  equalitv.  These  reforms 
included  raising  the  minimum  marriageable  a^e  from  twelve  to 
fifteen,  empowering  women  to  divorce  their  husbands  and 
inherit  property  and  declaring  illegal  the  ruinous  dowrv  sys- 
tem (see  Life  Passages,  ch.  5). 

The  threat  of  escalating  violence  and  the  potential  for  "red 
revolution"  across  the  countrv  seemed  daunting  in  the  face  of 
the  countrv's  growing  population,  unemplovment,  and  eco- 
nomic inequalitv  Xehru  induced  Parliament  to  pass  a  number 
of  laws  abolishing  absentee  landlordism  and  conferring  titles 
to  land  on  the  actual  cultivators  who  could  document  their 
right  to  occupancv.  Under  his  direction,  the  central  Planning 
Commission  allocated  resources  to  heaw  industries,  such  as 
steel  plants  and  hvdroelectric  projects,  and  to  revitalizing  cot- 
tage industries.  Whether  producing  sophisticated  defense 
materiel  or  manufacturing  evervdav  consumer  goods,  indus- 
trial complexes  emerged  across  the  countrv,  accompanied  by 
the  expansion  of  scientific  research  and  teaching  at  universi- 
ties, institutes  of  technologv,  and  research  centers  (see  Educa- 
tion, ch.  2:  Science  and  Technologv  ch.  6).

Historical  Setting 


Nehru  demonstrated  tremendous  enthusiasm  for  India's 
moral  leadership,  especially  among  the  newly  independent 
Asian  and  African  nations,  in  a  world  polarized  by  Cold  War 
ideology  and  threatened  by  nuclear  weapons.  His  guiding  prin- 
ciples were  nationalism,  anucolonialism,  internationalism,  and 
nonalignment.  He  attained  international  prestige  during  his 
first  decade  in  office,  but  after  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Hungary 
in  1956 — when  New  Delhi  tilted  toward  Moscow — criticisms 
grew  against  his  inconsistency  in  condemning  Western  but  not 
communist  aggression.  In  dealing  with  Pakistan,  Nehru  failed 
to  formulate  a  consistent  policy  and  was  critical  of  the  improv- 
ing ties  between  Pakistan  and  the  United  States;  mutual  hostil- 
ity and  suspicion  persisted  as  a  result  (see  United  States,  ch.  9). 
Despite  attempts  at  improving  relations  with  China,  based  on 
his  much-publicized  five  principles  (Panch  Shila — see  Glos- 
sary)— territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty,  nonaggression, 
noninterference,  equality  and  cooperation,  and  peaceful  coex- 
istence— war  with  China  erupted  in  1962.  The  war  was  a  rude 
awakening  for  Nehru,  as  India  proved  ill-equipped  and  unpre- 
pared to  defend  its  northern  borders.  At  the  conclusion  of  the 
conflict,  the  Chinese  forces  were  partially  withdrawn  and  an 
unofficial  demilitarized  zone  was  established,  but  India's  pres- 
tige and  self-esteem  had  suffered.  Physically  debilitated  and 
mentally  exhausted,  Nehru  suffered  a  stroke  and  died  in  office 
in  May  1964.  His  legacy  of  a  democratic,  federal,  and  secular 
India  continues  to  survive  in  spite  of  attempts  by  later  leaders 
to  establish  either  an  autocratic  or  a  theocratic  state. 

The  Rise  of  Indira  Gandhi 

Nehru's  long  tenure  in  office  gave  continuity  and  cohesion 
to  India's  domestic  and  foreign  policies,  but  as  his  health  dete- 
riorated, concerns  over  who  might  inherit  his  mantle  or  what 
might  befall  India  after  he  left  office  frequently  surfaced  in 
political  circles.  After  his  death,  the  Congress  Caucus,  also 
known  as  the  Syndicate,  chose  Lai  Bahadur  Shastri  as  prime 
minister  in  June  1964.  A  mild-mannered  person,  Shastri 
adhered  to  Gandhian  principles  of  simplicity  of  life  and  dedica- 
tion to  the  service  of  the  country.  His  short  period  of  leader- 
ship was  beset  with  three  major  crises:  widespread  food 
shortages,  violent  anti-Hindi  demonstrations  in  the  state  of 
Madras  (as  Tamil  Nadu  was  then  called)  that  were  quelled  by 
the  army,  and  the  second  war  with  Pakistan  over  Kashmir.  Shas- 
tri's  premiership  was  cut  short  when  he  died  of  a  heart  attack

on  January  11,  1966,  the  day  after  having  signed  the  Soviet-bro- 
kered Tashkent  Declaration.  The  agreement  required  both 
sides  to  withdraw  all  armed  personnel  by  February  26,  1966,  to 
the  positions  they  had  held  prior  to  August  5,  1965,  and  to 
observe  the  cease-fire  line. 

Indira  Gandhi  held  a  cabinet  portfolio  as  minister  of  infor- 
mation and  broadcasting  in  Shastri's  government.  She  was  the 
only  child  of  Nehru,  who  was  also  her  mentor  in  the  nationalist 
movement.  The  Syndicate  selected  her  as  prime  minister  when 
Shastri  died  in  1966  even  though  her  eligibility  was  challenged 
by  Morarji  Desai,  a  veteran  nationalist  and  long-time  aspirant 
to  that  office.  The  Congress  "bosses"  were  apparently  looking 
for  a  leading  figure  acceptable  to  the  masses,  who  could  com- 
mand general  support  during  the  next  general  election  but 
who  would  also  acquiesce  to  their  guidance.  Hardly  had  Indira 
Gandhi  begun  in  office  than  she  encountered  a  series  of  prob- 
lems that  defied  easy  solutions:  Mizo  tribal  uprisings  in  the 
northeast;  famine,  labor  unrest,  and  misery  among  the  poor  in 
the  wake  of  rupee  devaluation;  and  agitation  in  Punjab  for  lin- 
guistic and  religious  separatism. 

In  the  fourth  general  election  in  February  1967,  the  Con- 
gress majority  was  greatly  reduced  when  it  secured  only  54  per- 
cent of  the  parliamentary  seats,  and  non-Congress  ministries 
were  established  in  Bihar,  Kerala,  Orissa,  Madras,  Punjab,  and 
West  Bengal  the  next  month.  A  Congress-led  coalition  govern- 
ment collapsed  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  while  in  April  Rajasthan  was 
brought  under  President's  Rule — direct  central  government 
rule  (see  The  Executive,  ch.  8).  Seeking  to  eradicate  poverty, 
Mrs.  Gandhi  pursued  a  vigorous  policy  in  1969  of  land  reform 
and  placed  a  ceiling  on  personal  income,  private  property,  and 
corporate  profits.  She  also  nationalized  the  major  banks,  a  bold 
step  amidst  a  growing  rift  between  herself  and  the  party  elders. 
The  Congress  expelled  her  for  "indiscipline"  on  November  12, 
1969,  an  action  that  split  the  party  into  two  factions:  the  Con- 
gress (O) — for  Organisation — under  Desai,  and  the  Congress 
(R) — for  Requisition — under  Gandhi.  She  continued  as  prime 
minister  with  support  from  communists,  Sikhs,  and  regional 
parties. 

Gandhi  campaigned  fiercely  on  the  platform  "eliminate  pov- 
erty" (garibi  hatao)  during  the  fifth  general  election  in  March 
1971,  and  the  Congress  (R)  gained  a  large  majority  in  Parlia- 
ment against  her  former  party  leaders  whose  slogan  was  "elimi- 
nate Indira"  (Indira  hatao).  India's  decisive  victory  over

Pakistan  in  the  third  war  over  Kashmir  in  December  1971,  and 
Gandhi's  insistence  that  the  10  million  refugees  from  Ban- 
gladesh be  sent  back  to  their  country  generated  a  national 
surge  in  her  popularity,  later  confirmed  by  her  party's  gains  in 
state  elections  in  1972.  She  had  firmly  established  herself  at  the 
pinnacle  of  power,  overcoming  challenges  from  the  Congress 
(O),  the  Supreme  Court,  and  the  state  chief  ministers  in  the 
early  1970s.  The  more  solidified  her  monopoly  of  power 
became,  the  more  egregious  was  her  intolerance  of  criticisms, 
even  when  they  were  deserved.  As  head  of  her  party  and  the 
government,  Gandhi  nominated  and  removed  the  chief  minis- 
ters at  will  and  frequently  reshuffled  the  portfolios  of  her  own 
cabinet  members.  Ignoring  their  obligations  to  their  constitu- 
encies, party  members  competed  with  each  other  in  parading 
their  loyalty  to  Gandhi,  whose  personal  approval  alone  seemed 
crucial  to  their  survival.  In  August  1971,  Gandhi  signed  the 
twenty-year  Treaty  of  Peace,  Friendship,  and  Cooperation  with 
the  Soviet  Union  because  ties  with  the  United  States,  which 
had  improved  in  Nehru's  later  years,  had  eroded  (see  Russia, 
ch.  9). 

Neither  Gandhi's  consolidation  of  power,  nor  her  imperious 
style  of  administration,  nor  even  her  rhetoric  of  radical  reforms 
was  enough  to  meet  the  deepening  economic  crisis  spawned  by 
the  enormous  cost  of  the  1971  war.  A  huge  additional  outlay 


53

was  needed  to  manage  the  refugees,  the  crop  failures  in  1972 
and  1973,  the  skyrocketing  world  oil  prices  in  1973-74,  and  the 
overall  drop  in  industrial  output  despite  a  surplus  of  scientifi- 
cally and  technically  trained  personnel.  No  immediate  sign  of 
economic  recovery  or  equity  was  visible  despite  a  loan  obtained 
from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  in 
1974.  Both  Gandhi's  office  and  character  came  under  severe 
tests,  beginning  with  railroad  employee  strikes,  national  civil 
disobedience  advocated  by  J. P.  Narayan,  defeat  of  her  party  in 
Gujarat  by  a  coalition  of  parties  calling  itself  the  Janata  Morcha 
(People's  Front),  an  all-party,  no-confidence  motion  in  Parlia- 
ment, and,  finally,  a  writ  issued  by  the  Allahabad  High  Court 
invalidating  her  1971  election  and  making  her  ineligible  to 
occupy  her  seat  for  six  years. 

What  had  once  seemed  a  remote  possibility  took  place  on 
June  25,  1975:  the  president  declared  an  Emergency  and  the 
government  suspended  civil  rights.  Because  the  nation's  presi- 
dent, Fakhruddin  Ali  Ahmed  (1974-77),  and  Gandhi's  own 
party  members  in  Parliament  were  amenable  to  her  personal 
influence,  Gandhi  had  little  trouble  in  pushing  through 
amendments  to  the  constitution  that  exonerated  her  from  any 
culpability,  declaring  President's  Rule  in  Gujarat  and  Tamil 
Nadu  where  anti-Indira  parties  ruled,  and  jailing  thousands  of 
her  opponents.  In  her  need  to  trust  and  confide  in  someone 
during  this  extremely  trying  period,  she  turned  to  her  younger 
son,  Sanjay,  who  became  an  enthusiastic  advocate  of  the  Emer- 
gency. Under  his  watchful  eyes,  forced  sterilization  as  a  means 
of  birth  control  was  imposed  on  the  poor,  increased  numbers 
of  urban  squatters  and  slum  dwellers  in  Delhi  were  evicted  in 
the  name  of  beautification  projects,  and  disgruntled  workers 
were  either  disciplined  or  their  wages  frozen.  The  Reign  of  Ter- 
ror, as  some  called  it,  continued  until  January  18,  1977,  when 
Gandhi  suddenly  relaxed  the  Emergency,  announced  the  next 
general  election  in  March,  and  released  her  opponents  from 
prison. 

With  elections  only  two  months  away,  both  J. P.  Narayan  and 
Morarji  Desai  reactivated  the  multiparty  front,  which  cam- 
paigned as  the  Janata  Party  and  rode  anti-Emergency  senti- 
ment to  secure  a  clear  majority  in  the  Lok  Sabha  (House  of  the 
People),  the  lower  house  of  Parliament  (see  The  Legislature, 
ch.  8).  Desai,  a  conservative  Brahman,  became  India's  fourth 
prime  minister  (1977-79),  but  his  government,  from  its  incep- 
tion, became  notorious  for  its  factionalism  and  furious  internal

competition.  As  it  promised,  the  Janata  government  restored 
freedom  and  democracy,  but  its  inability  to  effect  sound 
reforms  or  ameliorate  poverty  left  people  disillusioned.  Desai 
lost  the  support  of  Janata's  left-wing  parties  by  the  early  sum- 
mer of  1979,  and  several  secular  and  liberal  politicians  aban- 
doned him  altogether,  leaving  him  without  a  parliamentary 
majority.  A  no-confidence  motion  was  about  to  be  introduced 
in  Parliament  in  July  1979,  but  he  resigned  his  office;  Desai's 
government  was  replaced  by  a  coalition  led  by  Chaudhury  Cha- 
ran  Singh  (prime  minister  in  1979-80).  Although  Singh's  life- 
long ambition  had  been  to  become  prime  minister,  his  age  and 
inefficiency  were  used  against  him,  and  his  attempts  at  govern- 
ing India  proved  futile;  new  elections  were  announced  in  Janu- 
ary 1980. 

Gandhi  and  her  party,  renamed  Congress  (I) — I  for  Indira — 
campaigned  on  the  slogan  "Elect  a  Government  That  Works!" 
and  regained  power.  Sanjay  Gandhi  was  elected  to  the  Lok 
Sabha.  Unlike  during  the  Emergency,  when  India  registered 
significant  economic  and  industrial  progress,  Gandhi's  return 
to  power  was  hindered  by  a  series  of  woes  and  tragedies,  begin- 
ning with  Sanjay's  death  in  June  1980  while  attempting  to  per- 
form stunts  in  his  private  airplane.  Secessionist  forces  in 
Punjab  and  in  the  northeast  and  the  Soviet  occupation  of 
Afghanistan  in  December  1979  consumed  her  energy.  She 
began  to  involve  the  armed  forces  in  resolving  violent  domestic 
conflicts  between  1980  and  1984.  In  May  1984,  Sikh  extremists 
occupied  the  Golden  Temple  in  Amritsar,  converting  it  into  a 
haven  for  terrorists.  Gandhi  responded  in  early  June  when  she 
launched  Operation  Bluestar,  which  killed  and  wounded  hun- 
dreds of  soldiers,  insurgents,  and  civilians  (see  Insurgent  Move- 
ments and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10).  Guarding  against 
further  challenges  to  her  power,  she  removed  the  chief  minis- 
ters of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  Andhra  Pradesh  just  months 
before  her  assassination  by  her  Sikh  bodyguards  on  October 
31,  1984.  The  news  of  Indira  Gandhi's  assassination  plunged 
New  Delhi  and  other  parts  of  India  into  anti-Sikh  riots  for  three 
days;  several  thousand  Sikhs  were  killed. 

Rajiv  Gandhi 

When  Rajiv  Gandhi,  Indira's  eldest  son,  reluctantly  con- 
sented to  run  for  his  brother's  vacant  Lok  Sabha  seat  in  1980, 
and  when  he  later  took  over  the  leadership  of  the  Congress 
youth  wing,  becoming  prime  minister  was  the  last  thing  on  his 


55 


India:  A  Country  Study 


mind;  equally,  his  mother  had  her  own  misgivings  about 
whether  Rajiv  would  bravely  "take  the  brutalities  and  the  ruth- 
lessness  of  politics."  Yet  on  the  day  Indira  was  assassinated,  Rajiv 
was  sworn  in  as  prime  minister  at  the  age  of  forty.  He  brought 
into  politics  energy,  enthusiasm,  and  vision — qualities  badly 
needed  to  lead  the  divided  country.  Moreover,  his  looks,  per- 
sonal charm,  and  reputation  as  "Mr.  Clean"  were  assets  that 
won  him  many  friends  in  India  and  abroad,  especially  in  the 
United  States.  Rajiv  also  had  a  clear  mandate  to  rule  the  coun- 
try with  an  overwhelming  majority  in  Parliament. 

Rajiv  seemed  to  have  understood  the  magnitude  of  the  most 
critical  and  urgent  problems  that  faced  the  nation  when  he 
assumed  office.  As  Paul  H.  Kreisberg,  a  former  United  States 
foreign  service  officer,  put  it,  Rajiv  was  faced  with  an  unenvi- 
able four-pronged  challenge:  resolving  political  and  religious 
violence  in  Punjab  and  the  northeast;  reforming  the  demoral- 
ized Congress  (I),  which  was  often  identified  with  the  interests 
of  the  upper  and  upper-middle  classes;  reenergizing  the  sag- 
ging economy  in  terms  of  productivity  and  budget  control;  and 
reducing  tensions  with  neighbors,  especially  Pakistan  and  Sri 
Lanka.  As  Rajiv  tackled  these  issues  with  singular  determina- 
tion, there  was  optimism  and  hope  about  the  future  of  India. 
Between  1985  and  1987,  temporary  calm  was  restored  by 
accommodating  demands  for  regional  control  in  the  northeast 
and  by  granting  more  concessions  to  Punjab.  Although  Rajiv 
acknowledged  the  gradual  attrition  of  the  Congress,  he  was 
unwilling  to  relinquish  control  of  the  leadership,  tolerate 
"cliques,"  or  conduct  new  elections  for  offices  at  the  state  and 
district  levels. 

Economic  reforms  and  incentives  to  private  investors  were 
introduced  by  easing  government  tax  rates  and  licensing 
requirements,  but  officials  manipulated  the  rules  and  fre- 
quently accepted  bribes.  These  innovative  measures  also  came 
under  attack  from  business  leaders,  who  for  many  years  had 
controlled  both  markets  and  prices  with  little  regard  for  qual- 
ity When  the  Ministry  of  Finance  began  its  own  investigation  of 
tax  and  foreign-exchange  evasion  amounting  to  millions  of  dol- 
lars, many  of  India's  leading  families,  including  Rajiv's  political 
allies,  were  found  culpable.  Despite  these  hindrances,  Rajiv's 
fascination  with  electronics  and  telecommunications  resulted 
in  revamping  the  antiquated  telephone  systems  to  meet  public 
demands.  Collaboration  with  the  United  States  and  several 


56 


Historical  Setting 


European  governments  and  corporations  brought  more  invest- 
ment in  research  in  electronics  and  computer  software. 

India's  perennial,  see-sawing  tensions  with  Pakistan,  whose 
potential  nuclear-weapons  capacity  escalated  concerns  in  the 
region,  were  ameliorated  when  the  South  Asian  Association  for 
Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC — see  Glossary)  was  inaugu- 
rated in  December  1985.  Both  nations  signed  an  agreement  in 
1986  promising  that  neither  would  launch  a  first  strike  at  the 
other's  nuclear  facilities.  However,  sporadic  conflicts  persist 
along  the  cease-fire  line  in  Kashmir  (see  South  Asia,  ch.  9). 

Relations  with  Sri  Lanka  degenerated  because  of  unresolved 
Sinhalese-Tamil  controversies  and  continued  guerrilla  warfare 
by  Tamil  militants,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Liberation 
Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam,  who  had  bases  in  Tamil  Nadu.  Begin- 
ning in  1987,  India's  attempt  to  disarm  and  subdue  the  Tigers 
through  intervention  of  the  Indian  Peace  Keeping  Force 
proved  disastrous  as  thousands  of  Indian  soldiers  and  Tamil 
militants  were  killed  or  wounded  (see  Peacekeeping  Opera- 
tions, ch.  10). 

Rajiv  Gandhi's  performance  in  the  middle  of  his  term  in 
office  was  best  summed  up,  as  Kreisberg  put  it,  as  "good  inten- 
tions, some  progress,  frequently  weak  implementation,  and 
poor  politics."  Two  major  scandals,  the  "Spy"  and  the  "Bofors" 
affairs,  tarnished  his  reputation.  In  January  1985,  Gandhi  con- 
firmed in  Parliament  the  involvement  of  top  government  offi- 
cials, their  assistants,  and  businessmen  in  "a  wide-ranging 
espionage  network."  The  ring  reportedly  infiltrated  the  prime 
minister's  office  as  early  as  1982  when  Indira  was  in  power  and 
sold  defense  and  economic  intelligence  to  foreign  diplomats  at 
the  embassies  of  France,  Poland  and  other  East  European 
countries,  and  the  Soviet  Union.  Although  more  than  twenty- 
four  arrests  were  made  and  the  diplomats  involved  were 
expelled,  the  Spy  scandal  remained  a  lingering  embarrassment 
to  Rajiv's  administration. 

In  1986  India  purchased  US$1.3  billion  worth  of  artillery 
pieces  from  the  Swedish  manufacturer  A.B.  Bofors,  and 
months  later  a  Swedish  radio  report  remarked  that  Bofors  had 
won  the  "biggest"  export  order  by  bribing  Indian  politicians 
and  defense  personnel.  The  revelation  caught  the  nation's 
attention  immediately  because  of  the  allegations  that  somehow 
Rajiv  Gandhi  and  his  friends  were  connected  with  the  deal. 
When  Vishwanath  Pratap  (V.P.)  Singh,  as  minister  of  defence, 
investigated  the  alleged  kickbacks,  he  was  forced  to  resign,  and 


57

he  became  Rajiv's  Janata  political  rival.  Despite  relentless 
attacks  and  criticisms  in  the  media  as  well  as  protests  and  resig- 
nations from  cabinet  members,  Rajiv  adamantly  denied  any 
role  in  the  affair.  But  when  he  called  parliamentary  elections  in 
November  1989,  two  months  ahead  of  schedule,  the  opposition 
alliance,  the  National  Front,  vigorously  campaigned  on  "remov- 
ing corruption  and  restoring  the  dignity  of  national  institu- 
tions," as  did  another  opposition  party,  Janata  Dal.  Rajiv  and  his 
party  won  more  seats  in  the  election  than  any  other  party,  but, 
being  unable  to  form  a  government  with  a  clear  majority  or  a 
mandate,  he  resigned  on  November  29.  Rajiv  Gandhi  was  assas- 
sinated by  Sri  Lankan  terrorists  on  May  21,  1991,  near  Madras. 
The  Gandhi  era,  as  future  events  would  prove,  was  over,  at  least 
for  the  near  term  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8).

The  literature  on  Indian  history  in  the  English  language 
alone  is  exhaustive  as  demonstrated  in  South  Asian  Civilizations: 
A  Bibliographic  Synthesis  by  Maureen  L.P.  Patterson.  The  most 
commonly  used  text  is  the  two-volume  A  History  of  India  by 
Romila  Thapar  (volume  1)  and  Percival  Spear  (volume  2). 
Monographs,  such  as  Stanley  Wolpert's  A  New  History  of  India 
and  Hermann  Kulke  and  Dietmar  Rothermund's  A  History  of 
India,  cover  major  epochs. 

Critical  works  by  Gregory  L.  Possehl  ( The  Harappan  Civiliza- 
tion), A.L.  Basham  (The  Wonder  That  Was  India),  Kallidaikurchi 
Aiyah  Nilakanta  Sastri  (History  of  South  India  from  Prehistoric 
Times  to  theFallofVijayanagar),  and  Burton  Stein  (Peasant,  State, 
and  Society  in  Medieval  South  India)  offer  valuable  insights  as  well 
as  theoretical  foundations  for  understanding  India  prior  to 
Mughal  rule.  Essays  in  The  Cambridge  Economic  History  of  India, 
edited  by  Tapan  Raychaudhuri  and  Irfan  Habib,  provide  a  full 
account  of  life  in  India  from  the  twelfth  to  the  eighteenth  cen- 
turies. The  Mughal  Empire,  by  John  Richards,  a  volume  in  The 
New  Cambridge  History  of  India,  reflects  the  current  discussion 
on  the  dynamic  nature  and  quality  of  the  rulers;  Irfan  Habib's 
An  Atlas  of  Mughal  Empire  and  The  Agrarian  System  of  Mughal 
India,  1556-1707  focus  on  the  administrative  and  economic 
aspects  of  the  empire.  Bamber  Gascoigne's  The  Great  Mughals 
has  photographs  along  with  texts  from  original  sources.

rated  new  data  garnered  from  various  state  archives  and  family 
histories  as  well  as  vernacular  sources;  their  works  reflect  a  devi- 
ation from  the  conventional  approach  of  focusing  on  gover- 
nor-generals or  viceroys.  They  include  C.A.  Bayly's  Rulers, 
Townsmen,  and  Bazaars,  Robin  Jeffrey's  People,  Princes,  and  Para- 
mount Power,  Judith  M.  Brown's  Modern  India:  The  Origins  of  an 
Asian  Democracy,  and  Sumit  Sarkar's  Modern  India,  1885-1947. 

The  nationalist  movement  also  has  generated  numerous  his- 
tories, both  authoritative  and  controversial.  Anil  Seal's  The 
Emergence  of  Indian  Nationalism  was  followed  by  a  group  repre- 
senting the  "Cambridge  School"  whose  critical  examination  of 
the  background  of  personalities  and  the  issues  that  dominated 
Indian  politics  has  spawned  much  discussion.  The  literature  on 
Mahatma  Gandhi  has  increased  over  the  decades.  His  An  Auto- 
biography: The  Story  of  My  Experiments  with  Truth  is  a  leading 
source  for  the  first  half  of  his  life,  while  Joan  V.  Bondurant's 
The  Conquest  of  Violence  and  Erick  H.  Erikson's  Gandhi's  Truth 
offer  probing  insights  into  his  strategies  and  personality. 

Postindependence  India  has  been  portrayed  variously 
depending  on  the  writer's  ideology,  use  of  sources,  and  analy- 
sis. Sarvepalli  Gopal's  Jawaharlal  Nehru  and  Zaheer  Masani's 
Indira  Gandhi  provide  lucid  accounts  of  the  period  from  the 
perspectives  of  the  prime  ministers.  Scathing  criticism  from  the 
view  of  the  common  man  is  found  in  Dilip  Hiro's  Inside  India 
Today  and  Arun  Shourie's  Symptoms  of  Fascism.  Pupul  Jayakar's 
Indira  Gandhi:  A  Biography  presents  a  balanced  view.  Although  a 
critical  biography  on  Rajiv  Gandhi  has  yet  to  appear,  a  number 
of  works,  such  as  Rajiv  Gandhi:  Life  and  Message  by  Arun  Bhatta- 
charjee  and  Rajiv  Gandhi  and  Parliament  edited  by  C.K.  Jain, 
provide  valuable  insights.  (For  further  information  and  com-

INDIA  IS  A  COUNTRY  of  great  diversity  with  a  wide  range  of 
landform  types,  including  major  mountain  ranges,  deserts,  rich 
agricultural  plains,  and  hilly  jungle  regions.  Indeed,  the  term 
Indian  subcontinent  aptly  describes  the  enormous  extent  of  the 
earth's  surface  that  India  occupies,  and  any  attempt  to  general- 
ize about  its  physiography  is  inaccurate.  Diversity  is  also  evident 
in  the  geographical  distribution  of  India's  ethnic  and  linguistic 
groups.  In  ancient  times,  the  major  river  valleys  of  the  Indo- 
Gangetic  Plain  of  South  Asia  were  among  the  great  cradles  of 
civilization  in  Asia,  as  were  the  valleys  of  the  Tigris  and  Euphra- 
tes rivers  in  West  Asia  and  the  Huang  He  (Yellow  River)  in  East 
Asia.  As  a  result  of  thousands  of  years  of  cultural  and  political 
expansion  and  amalgamation,  contemporary  India  has  come 
to  include  many  different  natural  and  cultural  regions. 

The  Himalayas  (and  the  nations  of  Nepal  and  Bhutan)  form 
India's  northern  frontier  with  China.  Pakistan  borders  India  to 
the  west  and  Bangladesh  (formerly  East  Pakistan)  to  the  east. 
Although  both  were  formerly  part  of  the  British  Indian 
Empire,  India  and  Pakistan  became  separate  countries  in  1947 
and  East  Pakistan  became  independent  Bangladesh  in  1971. 
The  boundaries  of  the  Indian  polity  are  not  fully  demarcated 
because  of  regional  ethnic  and  political  disputes  and  are  the 
source  of  occasional  tensions. 

When  the  1991  national  census  was  taken,  India's  popula- 
tion was  approximately  846.3  million.  The  annual  population 
growth  rate  from  1981  to  1991  was  2  percent.  Accounting  for 
only  2.4  percent  of  the  world's  landmass,  India  is  home  to  16 
percent  of  the  world's  population.  Every  sixth  person  in  the 
world  in  the  early  1990s  was  an  Indian.  It  is  generally  assumed 
that  India's  population  will  surpass  the  1  billion  mark  some 
time  before  the  next  census  in  2001.  In  July  1995,  the  popula- 
tion was  estimated  at  936.5  million. 

Some  38  percent  of  all  Indians  were  officially  listed  as  living 
below  the  poverty  line  in  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1991. 
This  number  represented  an  increase  from  the  low  mark  of  26 
percent  in  FY  1989,  but  the  rise  was  believed  to  be  only  tempo- 
rary by  some  observers.  Although  government-sponsored 
health  clinics  are  widely  available  in  the  mid-1990s,  their 
emphasis  is  on  curative  techniques  rather  than  preventive  med- 
icine. However,  the  lack  of  such  basic  amenities  as  safe,  potable 


63 


India:  A  Country  Study 

water  for  much  of  the  population  is  indicative  of  the  severity  of 
health  problems.  This  situation  has  traditionally  led  most  Indi- 
ans to  have  large  families  as  their  only  form  of  insurance 
against  sickness  and  for  their  care  in  old  age.  Although  family 
planning  programs  are  becoming  integrated  with  the  programs 
of  urban  and  rural  health  clinics,  no  official  birth  control  pro- 
grams have  widespread  support.  The  severity  of  the  acquired 
immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  epidemic  in  India  has 
become  increasingly  apparent  to  health  specialists,  but  local 
awareness  of  the  causes  of  and  ways  to  prevent  the  spread  of 
AIDS  is  growing  slowly. 

Although  many  public  schools  are  inadequate,  improve- 
ments to  the  education  system  overall  have  been  substantial 
since  1947.  In  the  mid-1990s,  however,  only  about  50  percent  of 
children  between  the  ages  of  six  and  fourteen  are  enrolled  in 
schools.  The  goal  of  compulsory  and  free  primary  and  middle 
school  education  is  embodied  in  the  Indian  constitution  but 
has  been  elusive.  The  National  Policy  on  Education  of  1986 
sought  to  institutionalize  universal  primary  education  by  set- 
ting 1990  as  a  target  date  for  the  education  of  all  children  up  to 
eleven  years  of  age.  The  ability  of  India's  education  system  to 
meet  this  goal  has  been  constrained  by  lack  of  adequate  finan- 
cial resources.  Important  achievements  have  been  made,  how- 
ever, with  implementation  of  the  nonformal  education  system 
and  adult  education  programs.  Whereas  public  education  is 
generally  below  standard,  education  standards  in  private 
schools  are  very  high.  There  also  are  high  standards  among  the 
elite  institutions  in  the  higher  education  system. 

Geography 

Principal  Regions 

India's  total  land  mass  is  2,973,190  square  kilometers  and  is 
divided  into  three  main  geological  regions:  the  Indo-Gangetic 
Plain,  the  Himalayas,  and  the  Peninsula  region  (see  fig.  5).  The 
Indo-Gangetic  Plain  and  those  portions  of  the  Himalayas 
within  India  are  collectively  known  as  North  India.  South  India 
consists  of  the  peninsular  region,  often  termed  simply  the  Pen- 
insula. On  the  basis  of  its  physiography,  India  is  divided  into 
ten  regions:  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain,  the  northern  mountains 
of  the  Himalayas,  the  Central  Highlands,  the  Deccan  or  Penin- 
sular Plateau,  the  East  Coast  (Coromandel  Coast  in  the  south), 
the  West  Coast  (Konkan,  Kankara,  and  Malabar  coasts),  the

Great  Indian  Desert  (a  geographic  feature  known  as  the  Thar 
Desert  in  Pakistan)  and  the  Rann  of  Kutch,  the  valley  of  the 
Brahmaputra  in  Assam,  the  northeastern  hill  ranges  surround- 
ing the  Assam  Valley,  and  the  islands  of  the  Arabian  Sea  and 
the  Bay  of  Bengal. 

Indo-Gangetic  Plain 

In  social  and  economic  terms,  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  is  the 
most  important  region  of  India.  The  plain  is  a  great  alluvial 
crescent  stretching  from  the  Indus  River  system  in  Pakistan  to 
the  Punjab  Plain  (in  both  Pakistan  and  India)  and  the  Haryana 
Plain  to  the  delta  of  the  Ganga  (or  Ganges)  in  Bangladesh 
(where  it  is  called  the  Padma).  Topographically  the  plain  is 
homogeneous,  with  only  floodplain  bluffs  and  other  related 
features  of  river  erosion  and  changes  in  river  channels  forming 
important  natural  features. 

Two  narrow  terrain  belts,  collectively  known  as  the  Terai, 
constitute  the  northern  boundary  of  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain. 
Where  the  foothills  of  the  Himalayas  encounter  the  plain, 
small  hills  known  locally  as  ghar  (meaning  house  in  Hindi) 
have  been  formed  by  coarse  sands  and  pebbles  deposited  by 
mountain  streams.  Groundwater  from  these  areas  flows  on  the 
surface  where  the  plains  begin  and  converts  large  areas  along 
the  rivers  into  swamps.  The  southern  boundary  of  the  plain 
begins  along  the  edge  of  the  Great  Indian  Desert  in  the  state  of 
Rajasthan  and  continues  east  along  the  base  of  the  hills  of  the 
Central  Highlands  to  the  Bay  of  Bengal  (see  fig.  1).  The  hills, 
varying  in  elevation  from  300  to  1,200  meters,  lie  on  a  general 
east-west  axis.  The  Central  Highlands  are  divided  into  north- 
ern and  southern  parts.  The  northern  part  is  centered  on  the 
Aravalli  Range  of  eastern  Rajasthan.  In  the  northern  part  of 
the  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  the  Malwa  Plateau  comprises  the 
southern  part  of  the  Central  Highlands  and  merges  with  the 
Vindhya  Range  to  the  south.  The  main  rivers  that  flow  through 
the  southern  part  of  the  plain — the  Narmada,  the  Tapti,  and 
the  Mahanadi — delineate  North  India  from  South  India  (see 
Rivers,  this  ch.). 

Some  geographers  subdivide  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  into 
three  parts:  the  Indus  Valley  (mostly  in  Pakistan),  the  Punjab 
(divided  between  India  and  Pakistan)  and  Haryana  plains,  and 
the  middle  and  lower  Ganga.  These  regional  distinctions  are 
based  primarily  on  the  availability  of  water.  By  another  defini- 
tion, the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  is  divided  into  two  drainage 


67 


India:  A  Country  Study 

basins  by  the  Delhi  Ridge;  the  western  part  consists  of  the  Pun- 
jab Plain  and  the  Haryana  Plain,  and  the  eastern  part  consists 
of  the  Ganga-Brahmaputra  drainage  systems.  This  divide  is  only 
300  meters  above  sea  level,  contributing  to  the  perception  that 
the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  appears  to  be  continuous  between  the 
two  drainage  basins.  The  Punjab  Plain  is  centered  in  the  land 
between  five  rivers:  the  Jhelum,  the  Chenab,  the  Ravi,  the  Beas, 
and  the  Sutlej.  (The  name  Punjab  comes  from  the  Sanskrit  pan- 
cha  ab,  meaning  five  waters  or  rivers.) 

Both  the  Punjab  and  Haryana  plains  are  irrigated  with  water 
from  the  Ravi,  Beas,  and  Sutlej  rivers.  The  irrigation  projects 
emanating  from  these  rivers  have  led  to  a  decrease  in  the  flow 
of  water  reaching  the  lower  drainage  areas  in  the  state  of  Pun- 
jab in  India  and  the  Indus  Valley  in  Pakistan.  The  benefits  that 
increased  irrigation  has  brought  to  farmers  in  the  state  of 
Haryana  are  controversial  in  light  of  the  effects  that  irrigation 
has  had  on  agricultural  life  in  the  Punjab  areas  of  both  India 
and  Pakistan. 

The  middle  Ganga  extends  from  the  Yamuna  River  in  the 
west  to  the  state  of  West  Bengal  in  the  east.  The  lower  Ganga 
and  the  Assam  Valley  are  more  lush  and  verdant  than  the  mid- 
dle Ganga.  The  lower  Ganga  is  centered  in  West  Bengal  from 
which  it  flows  into  Bangladesh  and,  after  joining  the  Jamuna 
(as  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Brahmaputra  are  known  in  Ban- 
gladesh), forms  the  delta  of  the  Ganga.  The  Brahmaputra 
(meaning  son  of  Brahma)  rises  in  Tibet  (China's  Xizang 
Autonomous  Region)  as  the  Yarlung  Zangbo  River,  flows 
through  Arunachal  Pradesh  and  Assam,  and  then  crosses  into 
Bangladesh.  Average  annual  rainfall  increases  moving  west  to 
east  from  approximately  600  millimeters  in  the  Punjab  Plain  to 
1,500  millimeters  around  the  lower  Ganga  and  Brahmaputra. 

The  Himalayas 

The  Himalayas,  the  highest  mountain  range  in  the  world, 
extend  along  the  northern  frontiers  of  Pakistan,  India,  Nepal, 
Bhutan,  and  Burma.  They  were  formed  geologically  as  a  result 
of  the  collision  of  the  Indian  subcontinent  with  Asia.  This  pro- 
cess of  plate  tectonics  is  ongoing,  and  the  gradual  northward 
drift  of  the  Indian  subcontinent  still  causes  earthquakes  (see 
Earthquakes,  this  ch.).  Lesser  ranges  jut  southward  from  the 
main  body  of  the  Himalayas  at  both  the  eastern  and  western 
ends.  The  Himalayan  system,  about  2,400  kilometers  in  length 
and  varying  in  width  from  240  to  330  kilometers,  is  made  up  of 


68 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

three  parallel  ranges — the  Greater  Himalayas,  the  Lesser 
Himalayas,  and  the  Outer  Himalayas — sometimes  collectively 
called  the  Great  Himalayan  Range.  The  Greater  Himalayas,  or 
northern  range,  average  approximately  6,000  meters  in  height 
and  contain  the  three  highest  mountains  on  earth:  Mount 
Everest  (8,796  meters)  on  the  China-Nepal  border;  K2  (8,611 
meters,  also  known  as  Mount  Godwin-Austen,  and  in  China  as 
Qogir  Feng)  in  an  area  claimed  by  India,  Pakistan,  and  China; 
and  Kanchenjunga  (8,598  meters)  on  the  India-Nepal  border. 
Many  major  mountains  are  located  entirely  within  India,  such 
as  Nanda  Devi  (7,817  meters)  in  the  state  of  Uttar  Pradesh. 
The  snow  line  averages  4,500  to  6,000  meters  on  the  southern 
side  of  the  Greater  Himalayas  and  5,500  to  6,000  on  the  north- 
ern side.  Because  of  climatic  conditions,  the  snow  line  in  the 
eastern  Himalayas  averages  4,300  meters,  while  in  the  western 
Himalayas  it  averages  5,800  meters. 

The  Lesser  Himalayas,  located  in  northwestern  India  in  the 
states  of  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  in  north-central 
India  in  the  state  of  Sikkim,  and  in  northeastern  India  in  the 
state  of  Arunachal  Pradesh,  range  from  1,500  to  5,000  meters 
in  height.  Located  in  the  Lesser  Himalayas  are  the  hill  stations 
of  Shimla  (Simla)  and  Darjiling  (Darjeeling).  During  the  colo- 
nial period,  these  and  other  hill  stations  were  used  by  the  Brit- 
ish as  summer  retreats  to  escape  the  intense  heat  of  the  plains. 
It  is  in  this  transitional  vegetation  zone  that  the  contrasts 
between  the  bare  southern  slopes  and  the  forested  northern 
slopes  become  most  noticeable. 

The  Outer  or  Southern  Himalayas,  averaging  900  to  1,200 
meters  in  elevation,  lie  between  the  Lesser  Himalayas  and  the 
Indo-Gangetic  Plain.  In  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh, 
this  southernmost  range  is  often  referred  to  as  the  Siwalik 
Hills.  It  is  possible  to  identify  a  fourth,  and  northernmost 
range,  known  as  the  Trans-Himalaya.  This  range  is  located 
entirely  on  the  Qinghai-Xizang  Plateau,  north  of  the  great  west- 
to-east  trending  valley  of  the  Yarlung  Zangbo  River.  Although 
the  Trans-Himalaya  Range  is  divided  from  the  Great  Hima- 
layan Range  for  most  of  its  length,  it  merges  with  the  Great 
Himalayan  Range  in  the  western  section — the  Karakoram 
Range — where  India,  Pakistan,  and  China  meet. 

The  southern  slopes  of  each  of  the  Himalayan  ranges  are  too 
steep  to  accumulate  snow  or  support  much  tree  life;  the  north- 
ern slopes  generally  are  forested  below  the  snow  line.  Between 
the  ranges  are  extensive  high  plateaus,  deep  gorges,  and  fertile 


69

valleys,  such  as  the  vales  of  Kashmir  and  Kulu.  The  Himalayas 
serve  a  very  important  purpose.  They  provide  a  physical  screen 
within  which  the  monsoon  system  operates  and  are  the  source 
of  the  great  river  systems  that  water  the  alluvial  plains  below 
(see  Climate,  this  ch.).  As  a  result  of  erosion,  the  rivers  coming 
from  the  mountains  carry  vast  quantities  of  silt  that  enrich  the 
plains. 

The  area  of  northeastern  India  adjacent  to  Burma  and  Ban- 
gladesh consists  of  numerous  hill  tracts,  averaging  between 
1,000  and  2,000  meters  in  elevation,  that  are  not  associated 
with  the  eastern  part  of  the  Himalayas  in  Arunachal  Pradesh. 
The  Naga  Hills,  rising  to  heights  of  more  than  3,000  meters, 
form  the  watershed  between  India  and  Burma.  The  Mizo  Hills 
are  the  southern  part  of  the  northeastern  ranges  in  India.  The 
Garo,  Khasi,  and  Jaintia  hills  are  centered  in  the  state  of 
Meghalaya  and,  isolated  from  the  northeastern  ranges,  divide 
the  Assam  Valley  from  Bangladesh  to  the  south  and  west. 

The  Peninsula 

The  Peninsula  proper  is  an  old,  geologically  stable  region 
with  an  average  elevation  between  300  and  1,800  meters.  The 
Vindhya  Range  constitutes  the  main  dividing  line  between  the 
geological  regions  of  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  and  the  Penin- 
sula. This  range  lies  north  of  the  Narmada  River,  and  when 
viewed  from  there,  it  is  possible  to  discern  the  prominent 
escarpments  that  rise  between  800  and  1,400  meters.  The 
Vindhya  Range  defines  the  north-central  and  northwestern 
boundary  of  the  Peninsula,  and  the  Chota  Nagpur  Plateau  of 
southern  Bihar  forms  the  northeastern  boundary.  The  uplift- 
ing of  the  plateau  of  the  central  Peninsula  and  its  eastward  tilt 
formed  the  Western  Ghats,  a  line  of  hills  running  from  the 
Tapti  River  south  to  the  up  of  the  Peninsula.  The  Eastern  Ghats 
mark  the  eastern  end  of  the  plateau;  they  begin  in  the  hills  of 
the  Mahanadi  River  basin  and  converge  with  the  Western 
Ghats  at  the  Peninsula's  southern  tip. 

The  interior  of  the  Peninsula,  south  of  the  Narmada  River, 
often  termed  the  Deccan  Plateau  or  simply  the  Deccan  (from 
the  Sanskrit  daksina,  meaning  south),  is  a  series  of  plateaus 
topped  by  rolling  hills  and  intersected  by  many  rivers.  The  pla- 
teau averages  roughly  300  to  750  meters  in  elevation.  Its  major 
rivers — the  Godavari,  the  Krishna,  and  the  Kaveri — rise  in  the 
Western  Ghats  and  flow  eastward  into  the  Bay  of  Bengal. 


70 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

The  coastal  plain  borders  the  plateau.  On  the  northwestern 
side,  it  is  characterized  by  tidal  marshes,  drowned  valleys,  and 
estuaries;  and  in  the  south  by  lagoons,  marshes,  and  beach 
ridges.  Coastal  plains  on  the  eastern  side  are  wider  than  those 
in  the  west;  they  are  focused  on  large  river  deltas  that  serve  as 
the  centers  of  human  settlement. 

Offshore  Islands 

India's  offshore  islands,  constituting  roughly  one-quarter  of 
1  percent  of  the  nation's  territory,  lie  in  two  groups  located  off 
the  east  and  west  coasts.  The  northernmost  point  of  the  union 
territory  of  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands  lies  1,100  kilo- 
meters southeast  of  Calcutta.  Situated  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  in  a 
chain  stretching  some  800  kilometers,  the  Andaman  Islands 
comprise  204  islands  and  islets,  and  their  topography  is  charac- 
terized by  hills  and  narrow  valleys.  Although  their  location  is 
tropical,  the  climate  of  the  islands  is  tempered  by  sea  breezes; 
rainfall  is  irregular.  The  Nicobar  Islands,  which  are  south  of  the 
Andaman  Islands,  comprise  nineteen  islands,  some  with  flat, 
coral-covered  surfaces  and  others  with  hills.  The  islands  have  a 
nearly  equatorial  climate,  heavy  rainfall,  and  high  tempera- 
tures. The  union  territory  of  Lakshadweep  (the  name  means 
100,000  islands)  in  the  Arabian  Sea,  comprises — from  north  to 
south — the  Amindivi,  Laccadive,  Cannanore,  and  Minicoy 
islands.  The  islands,  only  ten  of  which  are  inhabited,  are  spread 
throughout  an  area  of  approximately  77,000  square  kilometers. 
The  islands  are  low-lying  coral-based  formations  capable  of  lim- 
ited cultivation. 

Coasts  and  Borders 

India  has  7,000  kilometers  of  seacoast  and  shares  14,000  kilo- 
meters of  land  frontier  with  six  nations:  Pakistan,  China,  Nepal, 
Bhutan,  Bangladesh,  and  Burma.  India  claims  a  twelve-nauti- 
cal-mile territorial  sea  and  an  exclusive  economic  zone  of  200 
nautical  miles.  The  territorial  seas  total  314,400  square  kilome- 
ters. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  India  had  boundary  disagreements  with 
Pakistan,  China,  and  Bangladesh;  border  distances  are  there- 
fore approximations.  The  partition  of  India  in  1947  established 
two  India-Pakistan  frontiers:  one  on  the  west  and  one  on  the 
east  (East  Pakistan  became  Bangladesh  in  1971). 

Disputes  over  the  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  led  to  hostili- 
ties between  India  and  Pakistan  in  1947.  The  January  1,  1949, 


71 


India:  A  Country  Study 

cease-fire  arranged  by  the  United  Nations  (UN)  divided  con- 
trol of  Kashmir.  India  controls  Jammu,  the  Vale  of  Kashmir, 
and  the  capital,  Srinagar,  while  Pakistan  controls  the  mountain- 
ous area  to  the  northwest.  Neither  side  accepts  a  divided  Kash- 
mir as  a  permanent  solution.  India  regards  as  illegal  the  1963 
China-Pakistan  border  agreement,  which  ceded  to  China  a  por- 
tion of  Pakistani-controlled  Kashmir.  The  two  sides  also  dispute 
the  Siachen  Glacier  near  the  Karakoram  Pass.  Further  India- 
Pakistan  hostilities  in  the  1965  war  were  settled  through  the 
Soviet-brokered  Tashkent  Declaration. 

In  1968  an  international  tribunal  settled  the  dispute  over  the 
Rann  of  Kutch,  a  region  of  salt  flats  that  is  submerged  for  six 
months  of  the  year  in  the  state  of  Gujarat.  The  following  year,  a 
new  border  was  demarcated  that  recognized  Pakistan's  claim  to 
about  10  percent  of  the  area. 

In  1992  India  completed  fencing  most  of  the  547-kilometer- 
long  section  of  the  boundary  between  the  Indian  state  of  Pun- 
jab and  the  Pakistani  province  of  Punjab.  This  measure  was 
undertaken  because  of  the  continuing  unrest  in  the  region 
caused  by  both  ethnic  and  religious  disputes  among  the  local 
Indian  population  and  infiltrators  from  both  sides  of  the  fron- 
tier. The  more  rugged  terrain  north  of  Punjab  along  the  entire 
cease-fire  line  between  India  and  Pakistan  in  Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir continues  to  be  subject  to  infiltration  and  local  strife  (see 
Political  Issues,  ch.  8:  South  Asia,  ch.  9;  Insurgent  Movements 
and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10). 

The  2,000-kilometer-long  border  with  China  has  eastern, 
central,  and  western  sections.  In  the  western  section,  the  bor- 
der regions  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  have  been  the  scene  of  con- 
flicting claims  since  the  nineteenth  century.  China  has  not 
accepted  India's  definitions  of  the  boundary  and  has  carried 
out  defense  and  economic  activities  in  parts  of  eastern  Kashmir 
since  the  1950s.  In  the  1960s,  China  finished  construction  of  a 
motor  road  across  Aksai  Chin  (a  region  under  dispute  between 
India  and  China),  the  main  transportation  route  linking 
China's  Xinjiang-Uygur  Autonomous  Region  and  Tibet. 

In  the  eastern  section,  the  China-India  boundary  follows  the 
McMahon  Line  laid  down  in  1914  by  Sir  Arthur  Henry  McMa- 
hon,  the  British  plenipotentiary  to  a  conference  of  Indian,  Brit- 
ish, and  Chinese  representatives  at  Simla  (now  known  as 
Shimla,  Himachal  Pradesh).  The  Simla  Convention,  as  the 
agreement  is  known,  set  the  boundary  between  India  and 
Tibet.  Although  the  British  and  Tibetan  representatives  signed

the  agreement  on  July  3,  1914,  the  Chinese  delegate  declined 
to  sign.  The  line  agreed  to  by  Britain  and  Tibet  generally  fol- 
lows the  crest  of  the  eastern  Himalayas  from  Bhutan  to  Burma. 
It  serves  as  a  legal  boundary,  although  the  Chinese  have  never 
formally  accepted  it.  China  continued  to  claim  roughly  the 
entire  area  of  Arunachal  Pradesh  south  of  the  McMahon  Line 
in  the  early  1990s.  In  1962  China  and  India  fought  a  brief  bor- 
der war  in  this  region,  and  China  occupied  certain  areas  south 
of  the  line  for  several  months  (see  Nehru's  Legacy,  ch  1;  The 
Experience  of  Wars,  ch.  10).  India  and  China  took  a  major  step 
toward  resolving  their  border  disputes  in  1981  by  opening 
negotiations  on  the  issue.  Agreements  and  talks  held  in  1993 
and  1995  eased  tensions  along  the  India-China  border  (see 
China,  ch.  9).  Sikkim,  which  became  an  Indian  state  in  1975, 
forms  the  small  central  section  of  India's  northern  border  and 
lies  between  Nepal  and  Bhutan. 

India's  border  with  Bangladesh  is  essentially  the  same  as  it 
was  before  East  Pakistan  became  Bangladesh  in  1971.  Some 
minor  disputes  continued  to  occur  over  the  size  and  number  of 
the  numerous  enclaves  each  country  had  on  either  side  of  the 


73 


India:  A  Country  Study 


border.  These  enclaves  were  established  during  the  period 
from  1661  to  1712  during  righting  between  the  Mughal  Empire 
and  the  principality  of  Cooch  Behar.  This  complex  pattern  of 
enclaves  was  preserved  by  the  British  administration  and 
passed  on  intact  to  India  and  Pakistan. 

The  1,300-kilometer  frontier  with  Burma  has  been  delimited 
but  not  completely  demarcated.  On  March  10,  1967,  the 
Indian  and  Burmese  governments  signed  a  bilateral  treaty 
delimiting  the  boundary  in  detail.  India  also  has  a  maritime 
boundary  with  Burma  in  the  area  of  the  northern  Andaman 
Islands  and  Burma's  Coco  Islands  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  India's 
borders  with  Nepal  and  Bhutan  have  remained  unchanged 
since  the  days  of  British  rule.  In  1977  India  signed  an  accord 
with  Indonesia  demarcating  the  entire  maritime  boundary 
between  the  two  countries.  One  year  earlier,  a  similar  accord 
was  signed  with  the  Maldives. 

Rivers 

The  country's  rivers  are  classified  as  Himalayan,  peninsular, 
coastal,  and  inland-drainage  basin  rivers.  Himalayan  rivers  are 
snow  fed  and  maintain  a  high  to  medium  rate  of  flow  through- 
out the  year.  The  heavy  annual  average  rainfall  levels  in  the 
Himalayan  catchment  areas  further  add  to  their  rates  of  flow. 
During  the  monsoon  months  of  June  to  September,  the  catch- 
ment areas  are  prone  to  flooding.  The  volume  of  the  rain-fed 
peninsular  rivers  also  increases.  Coastal  streams,  especially  in 
the  west,  are  short  and  episodic.  Rivers  of  the  inland  system, 
centered  in  western  Rajasthan  state,  are  few  and  frequently  dis- 
appear in  years  of  scant  rainfall.  The  majority  of  the  South 
Asia's  major  rivers  flow  through  broad,  shallow  valleys  and 
drain  into  the  Bay  of  Bengal. 

The  Ganga  River  basin,  India's  largest,  includes  approxi- 
mately 25  percent  of  the  nation's  area;  it  is  bounded  by  the 
Himalayas  in  the  north  and  the  Vindhya  Range  to  the  south. 
The  Ganga  has  its  source  in  the  glaciers  of  the  Greater  Himala- 
yas, which  form  the  frontier  between  India  and  Tibet  in  north- 
western  Uttar  Pradesh.  Many  Indians  believe  that  the 
legendary  source  of  the  Ganga,  and  several  other  important 
Asian  rivers,  lies  in  the  sacred  Mapam  Yumco  Lake  (known  to 
the  Indians  as  Manasarowar  Lake)  of  western  Tibet  located 
approximately  75  kilometers  northeast  of  the  India-China- 
Xepal  tripoint.  In  the  northern  part  of  the  Ganga  River  basin, 
practically  all  of  the  tributaries  of  the  Ganga  are  perennial 


74 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

streams.  However,  in  the  southern  part,  located  in  the  states  of 
Rajasthan  and  Madhya  Pradesh,  many  of  the  tributaries  are  not 
perennial. 

The  Brahmaputra  has  the  greatest  volume  of  water  of  all  the 
rivers  in  India  because  of  heavy  annual  rainfall  levels  in  its 
catchment  basin.  At  Dibrugarh  the  annual  rainfall  averages 
2,800  millimeters,  and  at  Shillong  it  averages  2,430  millimeters. 
Rising  in  Tibet,  the  Brahmaputra  flows  south  into  Arunachal 
Pradesh  after  breaking  through  the  Great  Himalayan  Range 
and  dropping  rapidly  in  elevation.  It  continues  to  fall  through 
gorges  impassable  by  man  in  Arunachal  Pradesh  until  finally 
entering  the  Assam  Valley  where  it  meanders  westward  on  its 
way  to  joining  the  Ganga  in  Bangladesh. 

The  Mahanadi,  rising  in  the  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  is  an 
important  river  in  the  state  of  Orissa.  In  the  upper  drainage 
basin  of  the  Mahanadi,  which  is  centered  on  the  Chhattisgarh 
Plain,  periodic  droughts  contrast  with  the  situation  in  the  delta 
region  where  floods  may  damage  the  crops  in  what  is  known  as 
the  rice  bowl  of  Orissa.  Hirakud  Dam,  constructed  in  the  mid- 
dle reaches  of  the  Mahanadi,  has  helped  in  alleviating  these 
adverse  effects  by  creating  a  reservoir. 

The  source  of  the  Godavari  is  northeast  of  Bombay  (Mumbai 
in  the  local  Marathi  language)  in  the  state  of  Maharashtra,  and 
the  river  follows  a  southeasterly  course  for  1,400  kilometers  to 
its  mouth  on  the  Andhra  Pradesh  coast.  The  Godavari  River 
basin  area  is  second  in  size  only  to  the  Ganga;  its  delta  on  the 
east  coast  is  also  one  of  the  country's  main  rice-growing  areas. 
It  is  known  as  the  "Ganga  of  the  South,"  but  its  discharge, 
despite  the  large  catchment  area,  is  moderate  because  of  the 
medium  levels  of  annual  rainfall,  for  example,  about  700  milli- 
meters at  Nasik  and  1,000  millimeters  at  Nizamabad. 

The  Krishna  rises  in  the  Western  Ghats  and  flows  east  into 
the  Bay  of  Bengal.  It  has  a  poor  flow  because  of  low  levels  of 
rainfall  in  its  catchment  area — 660  millimeters  annually  at 
Pune.  Despite  its  low  discharge,  the  Krishna  is  the  third  longest 
river  in  India. 

The  source  of  the  Kaveri  is  in  the  state  of  Karnataka,  and  the 
river  flows  southeastward.  The  waters  of  the  river  have  been  a 
source  of  irrigation  since  antiquity;  in  the  early  1990s,  an  esti- 
mated 95  percent  of  the  Kaveri  was  diverted  for  agricultural  use 
before  emptying  into  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  delta  of  the  Kaveri 
is  so  mature  that  the  main  river  has  almost  lost  its  link  with  the 


75 


India:  A  Country  Study 


sea,  as  the  Kollidam,  the  distributary  of  the  Kaveri,  bears  most 
of  the  flow. 

The  Narmada  and  the  Tapti  are  the  only  major  rivers  that 
flow  into  the  Arabian  Sea.  The  Narmada  rises  in  Madhya 
Pradesh  and  crosses  the  state,  passing  swiftly  through  a  narrow 
valley  between  the  Vindhya  Range  and  spurs  of  the  Satpura 
Range.  It  flows  into  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat  (or  Cambay).  The 
shorter  Tapti  follows  a  generally  parallel  course,  between 
eighty  kilometers  and  160  kilometers  to  the  south  of  the  Nar- 
mada, flowing  through  the  states  of  Maharashtra  and  Gujarat 
on  its  way  into  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat. 

Harnessing  the  waters  of  the  major  rivers  that  flow  from  the 
Himalayas  is  an  issue  of  great  concern  in  Nepal,  India,  and 
Bangladesh.  Issues  of  flood  control,  drought  prevention, 
hydroelectric  power  generation,  job  creation,  and  environmen- 
tal quality — but  also  traditional  lifestyles  and  cultural  continu- 
ities— are  at  stake  as  these  countries  grapple  with  the  political 
realities,  both  domestic  and  international,  of  altering  the  flow 
of  the  Ganga  and  Brahmaputra.  Although  India,  Nepal,  and 
Bangladesh  seek  to  alleviate  problems  through  cooperation 
over  Himalayan  rivers,  irrigation  projects  altering  the  flow  of 
Punjab-area  rivers  are  likely  to  continue  to  be  an  irritant 
between  India  and  Pakistan — countries  between  which  cooper- 
ation is  less  likely  to  occur — in  the  second  half  of  the  1990s. 
Internally,  large  dam  projects,  such  as  one  on  the  Narmada 
River,  are  also  controversial  (see  Development  Programs,  ch. 
7). 

Climate 

The  Himalayas  isolate  South  Asia  from  the  rest  of  Asia. 
South  of  these  mountains,  the  climate,  like  the  terrain,  is 
highly  diverse,  but  some  geographers  give  it  an  overall,  one- 
word  characterization — violent.  What  geographers  have  in 
mind  is  the  abruptness  of  change  and  the  intensity  of  effect 
when  change  occurs — the  onset  of  the  monsoon  rains,  sudden 
flooding,  rapid  erosion,  extremes  of  temperature,  tropical 
storms,  and  unpredictable  fluctuations  in  rainfall.  Broadly 
speaking,  agriculture  in  India  is  constantly  challenged  by 
weather  uncertainty. 

It  is  possible  to  identify  seasons,  although  these  do  not  occur 
uniformly  throughout  South  Asia.  The  Indian  Meteorological 
Service  divides  the  year  into  four  seasons:  the  relatively  dry, 
cool  winter  from  December  through  February;  the  dry,  hot 


76 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

summer  from  March  through  May;  the  southwest  monsoon 
from  June  through  September  when  the  predominating  south- 
west maritime  winds  bring  rains  to  most  of  the  country;  and  the 
northeast,  or  retreating,  monsoon  of  October  and  November. 

The  southwest  monsoon  blows  in  from  sea  to  land.  The 
southwest  monsoon  usually  breaks  on  the  west  coast  early  in 
June  and  reaches  most  of  South  Asia  by  the  first  week  in  July 
(see  fig.  6).  Because  of  the  critical  importance  of  monsoon 
rainfall  to  agricultural  production,  predictions  of  the  mon- 
soon's arrival  date  are  eagerly  watched  by  government  planners 
and  agronomists  who  need  to  determine  the  optimal  dates  for 
plantings. 

Theories  about  why  monsoons  occur  vary.  Conventionally, 
scientists  have  attributed  monsoons  to  thermal  changes  in  the 
Asian  landmass.  Contemporary  theory  cites  other  factors — the 
barrier  of  the  Himalayas  and  the  sun's  northward  tilt  (which 
shifts  the  jet  stream  north).  The  hot  air  that  rises  over  South 
Asia  during  April  and  May  creates  low-pressure  areas  into 
which  the  cooler,  moisture-bearing  winds  from  the  Indian 
Ocean  flow. These  circumstances  set  off  a  rush  of  moisture-rich 
air  from  the  southern  seas  over  South  Asia. 

The  southwest  monsoon  occurs  in  two  branches.  After 
breaking  on  the  southern  part  of  the  Peninsula  in  early  June, 
the  branch  known  as  the  Arabian  Sea  monsoon  reaches  Bom- 
bay around  June  10,  and  it  has  settled  over  most  of  South  Asia 
by  late  June,  bringing  cooler  but  more  humid  weather.  The 
other  branch,  known  as  the  Bay  of  Bengal  monsoon,  moves 
northward  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  and  spreads  over  most  of 
Assam  by  the  first  week  of  June.  On  encountering  the  barrier 
of  the  Great  Himalayan  Range,  it  is  deflected  westward  along 
the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  toward  New  Delhi.  Thereafter  the  two 
branches  merge  as  a  single  current  bringing  rains  to  the 
remaining  parts  of  North  India  in  July. 

The  withdrawal  of  the  monsoon  is  a  far  more  gradual  pro- 
cess than  its  onset.  It  usually  withdraws  from  northwest  India  by 
the  beginning  of  October  and  from  the  remaining  parts  of  the 
country  by  the  end  of  November.  During  this  period,  the 
northeast  winds  contribute  to  the  formation  of  the  northeast 
monsoon  over  the  southern  half  of  the  Peninsula  in  October.  It 
is  also  known  as  the  retreating  monsoon  because  it  follows  in 
the  wake  of  the  southwest  monsoon.  The  states  of  Tamil  Nadu, 
Karnataka,  and  Kerala  receive  most  of  their  rainfall  from  the 
northeast  monsoon  during  November  and  December.  How-

India:  A  Country  Study 


ever,  80  percent  of  the  country  receives  most  of  its  rainfall  from 
the  southwest  monsoon  from  June  to  September. 

South  Asia  is  subject  to  a  wide  range  of  climates — from  the 
subfreezing  Himalayan  winters  to  the  tropical  climate  of  the 
Coromandel  Coast  and  from  the  damp,  rainy  climate  in  the 
states  of  Assam  and  West  Bengal  to  the  arid  Great  Indian 
Desert.  Based  on  precipitation  and  temperature,  experts 
define  seven  climatic  regions:  the  Himalayas,  Assam  and  West 
Bengal,  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain,  the  Western  Ghats  and  coast, 
the  Deccan  (the  interior  of  the  Peninsula  south  of  the  Xar- 
mada  River),  and  the  Eastern  Ghats  and  coast  (see  fig.  7). 

In  the  Himalayan  region,  climate  varies  with  altitude.  At 
about  2,000  meters,  the  average  summer  temperature  is  near 
18°C;  at  4,500  meters,  it  is  rarely  above  0°C.  In  the  valleys,  sum- 
mer temperatures  reach  between  32°C  and  38°C.  The  eastern 
Himalayas  receive  as  much  as  1,000  to  2,000  millimeters  more 
precipitation  than  do  the  Western  Himalayas,  and  floods  are 
common. 

Assam  and  West  Bengal  are  extremely  wet  and  humid.  The 
southeastern  part  of  the  state  of  Meghalaya  has  the  world's 
highest  average  annual  rainfall,  some  10,900  millimeters. 

The  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  has  a  varied  climatic  pattern.  Rain- 
fall and  temperature  ranges  vary  significantly  between  the  east- 
ern and  western  extremes  (see  table  2,  Appendix).  In  the 
Peninsula  region,  the  Western  Ghats  and  the  adjoining  coast 
receive  heavy  rains  during  the  southwest  monsoon.  Rainfall  in 
the  peninsular  interior  averages  about  650  millimeters  a  year, 
although  there  is  considerable  variation  in  different  localities 
and  from  year  to  vear.  The  Eastern  Ghats  receive  less  rainfall 
than  the  western  coast.  Rainfall  there  ranges  between  900  and 
1,300  millimeters  annually. 

The  northern  Deccan  region,  bounded  by  the  Western 
Ghats,  the  Vindhya  Range  and  the  Narmada  River  to  the  north, 
and  the  Eastern  Ghats,  receives  most  of  its  annual  rainfall  dur- 
ing the  summer  monsoon  season.  The  southern  Deccan  area  is 
in  a  "rain  shadow"  and  receives  only  fifty  to  1,000  millimeters  of 
rainfall  a  year.  Temperature  ranges  are  wide — from  some  15°C 
to  38°C — making  this  one  of  India's  most  comfortable  climatic 
areas. 

Throughout  most  of  non-Himalayan  India,  the  heat  can  be 
oppressive  and  sometimes,  such  as  was  experienced  in  1994 
and  1995,  literally  can  be  a  killer.  Hot,  relatively  dry  weather  is 
the  norm  before  the  southwest  monsoons,  which,  along  with 


78 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

heavy  rains  and  high  humidity,  bring  cloud  cover  that  lowers 
temperatures  slightly.  Temperatures  reach  the  upper  30s°C 
and  can  reach  as  high  as  48°C  during  the  day  in  the  premon- 
soon  months. 

Earthquakes 

India  has  experienced  some  of  the  world's  most  devastating 
earthquakes.  Some  19,000  people  died  in  Kangra  District, 
northeastern  Himachal  Pradesh,  in  April  1905,  and  more  than 
30,000  died  in  Maharashtra  and  Andhra  Pradesh  in  September 
1993.  Although  resulting  in  less  extensive  loss  of  life,  major 
earthquakes  occurred  in  Assam  in  1950  (more  than  1,500 
killed)  and  in  Uttarkashi  District,  Uttar  Pradesh,  in  1991  (1,600 
killed). 

Population 

Structure  and  Dynamics 

The  1991  final  census  count  gave  India  a  total  population  of 
846,302,688.  However,  estimates  of  India's  population  vary 
widely.  According  to  the  Population  Division  of  the  United 
Nations  Department  of  International  Economic  and  Social 
Affairs,  the  population  had  already  reached  866  million  in 
1991.  The  Population  Division  of  the  United  Nations  Eco- 
nomic and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific 
(ESGAP)  projected  896.5  million  by  mid-1993  with  a  1.9  per- 
cent annual  growth  rate.  The  United  States  Bureau  of  the  Cen- 
sus, assuming  an  annual  population  growth  rate  of  1.8  percent, 
put  India's  population  in  July  1995  at  936,545,814.  These 
higher  projections  merit  attention  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the 
Planning  Commission  had  estimated  a  figure  of  844  million  for 
1991  while  preparing  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1992-96; 
see  Population  Projections,  this  ch.). 

India  accounts  for  some  2.4  percent  of  the  world's  landmass 
but  is  home  to  about  16  percent  of  the  global  population.  The 
magnitude  of  the  annual  increase  in  population  can  be  seen  in 
the  fact  that  India  adds  almost  the  total  population  of  Australia 
or  Sri  Lanka  every  year.  A  1992  study  of  India's  population 
notes  that  India  has  more  people  than  all  of  Africa  and  also 
more  than  North  America  and  South  America  together. 
Between  1947  and  1991,  India's  population  more  than  dou- 
bled.

India:  A  Country  Study 


Throughout  the  twentieth  century,  India  has  been  in  the 
midst  of  a  demographic  transition.  At  the  beginning  of  the  cen- 
tury, endemic  disease,  periodic  epidemics,  and  famines  kept 
the  death  rate  high  enough  to  balance  out  the  high  birth  rate. 
Between  1911  and  1920,  the  birth  and  death  rates  were  virtu- 
ally equal — about  forty-eight  births  and  forty-eight  deaths  per 
1,000  population.  The  increasing  impact  of  curative  and  pre- 
ventive medicine  (especially  mass  inoculations)  brought  a 
steady  decline  in  the  death  rate.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the  esti- 
mated birth  rate  had  fallen  to  twenty-eight  per  1,000,  and  the 
estimated  death  rate  had  fallen  to  ten  per  1,000.  Clearly,  the 
future  configuration  of  India's  population  (indeed  the  future 
of  India  itself)  depends  on  what  happens  to  the  birth  rate  (see 
fig.  8).  Even  the  most  optimistic  projections  do  not  suggest  that 
the  birth  rate  could  drop  below  twenty  per  1,000  before  the 
year  2000.  India's  population  is  likely  to  exceed  the  1  billion 
mark  before  the  2001  census. 

The  upward  population  spiral  began  in  the  1920s  and  is 
reflected  in  intercensal  growth  increments.  South  Asia's  popu- 
lation increased  roughly  5  percent  between  1901  and  1911  and 
actually  declined  slightly  in  the  next  decade.  Population 
increased  some  10  percent  in  the  period  from  1921  to  1931 
and  13  to  14  percent  in  the  1930s  and  1940s.  Between  1951  and 
1961,  the  population  rose  21.5  percent.  Between  1961  and 
1971,  the  country's  population  increased  by  24.8  percent. 
Thereafter  a  slight  slowing  of  the  increase  was  experienced: 
from  1971  to  1981,  the  population  increased  by  24.7  percent, 
and  from  1981  to  1991,  by  23.9  percent  (see  table  3,  Appen- 
dix). 

Population  density  has  risen  concomitantly  with  the  massive 
increases  in  population.  In  1901  India  counted  some  seventy- 
seven  persons  per  square  kilometer;  in  1981  there  were  216 
persons  per  square  kilometer;  by  1991  there  were  267  persons 
per  square  kilometer — up  almost  25  percent  from  the  1981 
population  density  (see  table  4,  Appendix).  India's  average 
population  density  is  higher  than  that  of  any  other  nation  of 
comparable  size.  The  highest  densities  are  not  only  in  heavily 
urbanized  regions  but  also  in  areas  that  are  mostly  agricultural. 

Population  growth  in  the  years  between  1950  and  1970  cen- 
tered on  areas  of  new  irrigation  projects,  areas  subject  to  refu- 
gee resettlement,  and  regions  of  urban  expansion.  Areas  where 
population  did  not  increase  at  a  rate  approaching  the  national 
average  were  those  facing  the  most  severe  economic  hardships,

overpopulated  rural  areas,  and  regions  with  low  levels  of  urban- 
ization. 

The  1991  census,  which  was  carried  out  under  the  direction 
of  the  Registrar  General  and  Census  Commissioner  of  India 
(part  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs),  in  keeping  with  the  pre- 
vious two  censuses,  used  the  term  urban  agglomerations.  An 
urban  agglomeration  forms  a  continuous  urban  spread  and 
consists  of  a  city  or  town  and  its  urban  outgrowth  outside  the 
statutory  limits.  Or,  an  urban  agglomerate  may  be  two  or  more 
adjoining  cities  or  towns  and  their  outgrowths.  A  university 
campus  or  military  base  located  on  the  outskirts  of  a  city  or 
town,  which  often  increases  the  actual  urban  area  of  that  city  or 
town,  is  an  example  of  an  urban  agglomeration.  In  India  urban 
agglomerations  with  a  population  of  1  million  or  more — there 
were  twenty-four  in  1991 — are  referred  to  as  metropolitan 
areas.  Places  with  a  population  of  100,000  or  more  are  termed 
"cities"  as  compared  with  "towns,"  which  have  a  population  of 
less  than  100,000.  Including  the  metropolitan  areas,  there  were 
299  urban  agglomerations  with  more  than  100,000  population 
in  1991.  These  large  urban  agglomerations  are  designated  as 
Class  I  urban  units.  There  were  five  other  classes  of  urban 
agglomerations,  towns,  and  villages  based  on  the  size  of  their 
populations:  Class  II  (50,000  to  99,999),  Class  III  (20,000  to 
49,999),  Class  IV  (10,000  to  19,999),  Class  V  (5,000  to  9,999), 
and  Class  VI  (villages  of  less  than  5,000;  see  table  5,  Appendix). 

The  results  of  the  1991  census  revealed  that  around  221  mil- 
lion, or  26.1  percent,  of  Indian's  population  lived  in  urban 
areas.  Of  this  total,  about  138  million  people,  or  16  percent, 
lived  in  the  299  urban  agglomerations.  In  1991  the  twenty-four 
metropolitan  cities  accounted  for  51  percent  of  India's  total 
population  living  in  Class  I  urban  centers,  with  Bombay  and 
Calcutta  the  largest  at  12.6  million  and  10.9  million,  respec- 
tively (see  table  6,  Appendix). 

In  the  early  1990s,  growth  was  the  most  dramatic  in  the  cities 
of  central  and  southern  India.  About  twenty  cities  in  those  two 
regions  experienced  a  growth  rate  of  more  than  100  percent 
between  1981  and  1991.  Areas  subject  to  an  influx  of  refugees 
also  experienced  noticeable  demographic  changes.  Refugees 
from  Bangladesh,  Burma,  and  Sri  Lanka  contributed  substan- 
tially to  population  growth  in  the  regions  in  which  they  settled. 
Less  dramatic  population  increases  occurred  in  areas  where 
Tibetan  refugee  settlements  were  founded  after  the  Chinese 
annexation  of  Tibet  in  the  1950s.

The  majority  of  districts  had  urban  populations  ranging  on 
average  from  15  to  40  percent  in  1991.  According  to  the  1991 
census,  urban  clusters  predominated  in  the  upper  part  of  the 
Indo-Gangetic  Plain:  in  the  Punjab  and  Haryana  plains,  and  in 
part  of  western  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  lower  part  of  the  Indo- 
Gangetic  Plain  in  southeastern  Bihar,  southern  West  Bengal, 
and  northern  Orissa  also  experienced  increased  urbanization. 
Similar  increases  occurred  in  the  western  coastal  state  of 
Gujarat  and  the  union  territory  of  Daman  and  Diu.  In  the  Cen- 
tral Highlands  in  Madhva  Pradesh  and  Maharashtra,  urbaniza- 
tion  was  most  noticeable  in  the  river  basins  and  adjacent 
plateau  regions  of  the  Mahanadi,  Narmada,  and  Tapti  rivers.

The  coastal  plains  and  river  deltas  of  the  east  and  west  coasts 
also  showed  increased  levels  of  urbanization. 

The  hilly,  inaccessible  regions  of  the  Peninsular  Plateau,  the 
northeast,  and  the  Himalayas  remain  sparsely  settled.  As  a  gen- 
eral rule,  the  lower  the  population  density  and  the  more 
remote  the  region,  the  more  likely  it  is  to  count  a  substantial 
portion  of  tribal  (see  Glossary)  people  among  its  population 
(see  Tribes,  ch.  4).  Urbanization  in  some  sparsely  settled 
regions  is  more  developed  than  would  seem  warranted  at  first 
glance  at  their  limited  natural  resources.  Areas  of  western 
India  that  were  formerly  princely  states  (in  Gujarat  and  the 
desert  regions  of  Rajasthan)  have  substantial  urban  centers 
that  originated  as  political-administrative  centers  and  since 
independence  have  continued  to  exercise  hegemony  over  their 
hinterlands. 

The  vast  majority  of  Indians,  nearly  625  million,  or  73.9  per- 
cent, in  1991  lived  in  what  are  called  villages  of  less  than  5,000 


87 


India:  A  Country  Study 

people  or  in  scattered  hamlets  and  other  rural  settlements  (see 
The  Village  Community,  ch.  5) .  The  states  with  proportionately 
the  greatest  rural  populations  in  1991  were  the  states  of  Assam 
(88.9  percent),  Sikkim  (90.9  percent)  and  Himachal  Pradesh 
(91.3  percent),  and  the  tiny  union  territory  of  Dadra  and 
Nagar  Haveli  (91.5  percent).  Those  with  the  smallest  rural  pop- 
ulations proportionately  were  the  states  of  Gujarat  (65.5  per- 
cent), Maharashtra  (61.3  percent),  Goa  (58.9  percent),  and 
Mizoram  (53.9  percent) .  Most  of  the  other  states  and  the  union 
territory  of  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands  were  near  the 
national  average. 

Two  other  categories  of  population  that  are  closely  scruti- 
nized by  the  national  census  are  the  Scheduled  Castes  (see 
Glossary)  and  Scheduled  Tribes  (see  Glossary).  The  greatest 
concentrations  of  Scheduled  Caste  members  in  1991  lived  in 
the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh  (10.5  million,  or  nearly  16  per- 
cent of  the  state's  population),  Tamil  Nadu  (10.7  million,  or  19 
percent),  Bihar  (12.5  million,  or  14  percent),  West  Bengal  (16 
million,  or  24  percent),  and  Uttar  Pradesh  (29.3  million,  or  21 
percent).  Together,  these  and  other  Scheduled  Caste  members 
comprised  about  139  million  people,  or  more  than  16  percent 
of  the  total  population  of  India.  Scheduled  Tribe  members  rep- 
resented only  8  percent  of  the  total  population  (about  68  mil- 
lion). They  were  found  in  1991  in  the  greatest  numbers  in 
Orissa  (7  million,  or  23  percent  of  the  state's  population), 
Maharashtra  (7.3  million,  or  9  percent),  and  Madhya  Pradesh 
(15.3  million,  or  23  percent).  In  proportion,  however,  the  pop- 
ulations of  states  in  the  northeast  had  the  greatest  concentra- 
tions of  Scheduled  Tribe  members.  For  example,  31  percent  of 
the  population  of  Tripura,  34  percent  of  Manipur,  64  percent 
of  Arunachal  Pradesh,  86  percent  of  Meghalaya,  88  percent  of 
Nagaland,  and  95  percent  of  Mizoram  were  Scheduled  Tribe 
members.  Other  heavy  concentrations  were  found  in  Dadra 
and  Nagar  Haveli,  79  per  cent  of  which  was  composed  of  Sched- 
uled Tribe  members,  and  Lakshadweep,  with  94  percent  of  its 
population  being  Scheduled  Tribe  members. 

Population  Projections 

The  Registrar  General  and  Census  Commissioner  of  India 
(both  positions  are  held  by  the  same  person)  oversees  an  ongo- 
ing intercensal  effort  to  help  maintain  accurate  annual  esti- 
mates of  population.  The  projection  method  used  in  the  mid- 
1980s  to  predict  the  1991  population,  which  was  accurate

enough  to  come  within  3  million  (843  million)  of  the  official, 
final  census  count  in  1991  (846  million),  was  based  on  the  Sam- 
ple Registration  System.  The  system  employed  birth  and  death 
rates  from  each  of  the  twenty-five  states,  six  union  territories, 
and  one  national  capital  territory  plus  statistical  data  on  effec- 
tive contraceptive  use.  Assuming  a  1.7  percent  error  rate, 
India's  projection  for  1991  was  close  to  those  made  by  the 
World  Bank  and  the  UN. 

Projections  of  future  population  growth  prepared  by  the 
Registrar  General,  assuming  the  highest  level  of  fertility,  show 
decreasing  growth  rates:  1.8  percent  by  2001,  1.3  percent  by 
2011,  and  0.9  percent  by  2021.  These  rates  of  growth,  however, 
will  put  India's  population  above  1.0  billion  in  2001,  at  1.2  bil- 
lion in  2011,  and  at  1.3  billion  in  2021.  ESGAP  projections  pub- 
lished in  1993  were  close  to  those  made  by  India:  nearly  1.2 
billion  by  2010,  still  considerably  less  than  the  2010  population 
projection  for  China  of  1.4  billion.  In  1992  the  Washington- 
based  Population  Reference  Bureau  had  a  similar  projection  to 
ESCAP's  for  India's  population  in  2010  and  projected  nearly 
1.4  billion  by  2025  (nearly  the  same  as  projected  for  2025  by 
the  United  Nations  Department  of  International  Economic 
and  Social  Affairs).  According  to  other  UN  projections,  India's 
population  may  stabilize  at  around  1.7  billion  by  2060. 

Such  projections  also  show  an  increasingly  aging  population, 
with  76  million  (8  percent  of  the  population)  age  sixty  and 
above  in  2001,  102  million  (9  percent)  in  2011,  and  137  million 
(11  percent)  in  2021.  These  figures  coincide  closely  with  those 
estimated  by  the  United  States  Bureau  of  the  Census,  which 
also  projected  that  whereas  the  median  age  was  twenty-two  in 
1992,  it  was  expected  to  increase  to  twenty-nine  by  2020,  plac- 
ing the  median  age  in  India  well  above  all  of  its  South  Asian 
neighbors  except  Sri  Lanka. 

Population  and  Family  Planning  Policy 

Population  growth  has  long  been  a  concern  of  the  govern- 
ment, and  India  has  a  lengthy  history  of  explicit  population 
policy.  In  the  1950s,  the  government  began,  in  a  modest  way, 
one  of  the  earliest  national,  government-sponsored  family 
planning  efforts  in  the  developing  world.  The  annual  popula- 
tion growth  rate  in  the  previous  decade  (1941  to  1951)  had 
been  below  1.3  percent,  and  government  planners  optimisti- 
cally believed  that  the  population  would  continue  to  grow  at 
roughly  the  same  rate. 


89 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Implicitly,  the  government  believed  that  India  could  repeat 
the  experience  of  the  developed  nations  where  industrializa- 
tion and  a  rise  in  the  standard  of  living  had  been  accompanied 
by  a  drop  in  the  population  growth  rate.  In  the  1950s,  existing 
hospitals  and  health  care  facilities  made  birth  control  informa- 
tion available,  but  there  was  no  aggressive  effort  to  encourage 
the  use  of  contraceptives  and  limitation  of  family  size.  By  the 
late  1960s,  many  policy  makers  believed  that  the  high  rate  of 
population  growth  was  the  greatest  obstacle  to  economic  devel- 
opment. The  government  began  a  massive  program  to  lower 
the  birth  rate  from  forty-one  per  1,000  to  a  target  of  twenty  to 
twenty-five  per  1,000  by  the  mid-1970s.  The  National  Popula- 
tion Policy  adopted  in  1976  reflected  the  growing  consensus 
among  policy  makers  that  family  planning  would  enjoy  only 
limited  success  unless  it  was  part  of  an  integrated  program 
aimed  at  improving  the  general  welfare  of  the  population.  The 
policy  makers  assumed  that  excessive  family  size  was  part  and 
parcel  of  poverty  and  had  to  be  dealt  with  as  integral  to  a  gen- 
eral development  strategy.  Education  about  the  population 
problem  became  part  of  school  curriculum  under  the  Fifth 
Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1974-78).  Cases  of  government-enforced 
sterilization  made  many  question  the  propriety  of  state-spon- 
sored birth  control  measures,  however. 

During  the  1980s,  an  increased  number  of  family  planning 
programs  were  implemented  through  the  state  governments 
with  financial  assistance  from  the  central  government.  In  rural 
areas,  the  programs  were  further  extended  through  a  network 
of  primary  health  centers  and  subcenters.  By  1991,  India  had 
more  than  150,000  public  health  facilities  through  which  fam- 
ily planning  programs  were  offered  (see  Health  Care,  this  ch.). 
Four  special  family  planning  projects  were  implemented  under 
the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1985-89).  One  was  the  All-India 
Hospitals  Post-partum  Programme  at  district-  and  subdistrict- 
level  hospitals.  Another  program  involved  the  reorganization 
of  primary  health  care  facilities  in  urban  slum  areas,  while 
another  project  reserved  a  specified  number  of  hospital  beds 
for  tubal  ligature  operations.  The  final  program  called  for  the 
renovation  or  remodelling  of  intrauterine  device  (IUD)  rooms 
in  rural  family  welfare  centers  attached  to  primary  health  care 
facilities. 

Despite  these  developments  in  promoting  family  planning, 
the  1991  census  results  showed  that  India  continued  to  have 
one  of  the  most  rapidly  growing  populations  in  the  world.

Between  1981  and  1991,  the  annual  rate  of  population  growth 
was  estimated  at  about  2  percent.  The  crude  birth  rate  in  1992 
was  thirty  per  1,000,  only  a  small  change  over  the  1981  level  of 
thirty-four  per  1,000.  However,  some  demographers  credit  this 
slight  lowering  of  the  1981-91  population  growth  rate  to  mod- 
erate successes  of  the  family  planning  program.  In  FY  1986,  the 
number  of  reproductive-age  couples  was  132.6  million,  of 
whom  only  37.5  percent  were  estimated  to  be  protected  effec- 
tively by  some  form  of  contraception.  A  goal  of  the  seventh 
plan  was  to  achieve  an  effective  couple  protection  rate  of  42 
percent,  requiring  an  annual  increase  of  2  percent  in  effective 
use  of  contraceptives. 

The  heavy  centralization  of  India's  family  planning  pro- 
grams often  prevents  due  consideration  from  being  given  to 
regional  differences.  Centralization  is  encouraged  to  a  large 
extent  by  reliance  on  central  government  funding.  As  a  result, 
many  of  the  goals  and  assumptions  of  national  population  con- 
trol programs  do  not  correspond  exactly  with  local  attitudes 
toward  birth  control.  At  the  Jamkhed  Project  in  Maharashtra, 
which  has  been  in  operation  since  the  late  1970s  and  covers 
approximately  175  villages,  the  local  project  directors  noted 
that  it  required  three  to  four  years  of  education  through  direct

contact  with  a  couple  for  the  idea  of  family  planning  to  gain 
acceptance.  Such  a  timetable  was  not  compatible  with  targets. 
However,  much  was  learned  about  policy  and  practice  from  the 
Jamkhed  Project.  The  successful  use  of  women's  clubs  as  a 
means  of  involving  women  in  community-wide  family  planning 
activities  impressed  the  state  government  to  the  degree  that  it 
set  about  organizing  such  clubs  in  every  village  in  the  state. 
The  project  also  serves  as  a  pilot  to  test  ideas  that  the  govern- 
ment wants  to  incorporate  into  its  programs.  Government 
medical  staff  members  have  been  sent  to  Jamkhed  for  training, 
and  the  government  has  proposed  that  the  project  assume  the 
task  of  selecting  and  training  government  health  workers  for 
an  area  of  2.5  million  people. 

Another  important  family  planning  program  is  the  Project 
for  Community  Action  in  Family  Planning.  Located  in  Karna- 
taka,  the  project  operates  in  154  project  villages  and  255  con- 
trol villages.  All  project  villages  are  of  sufficient  size  to  have  a 
health  subcenter,  although  this  advantage  is  offset  by  the  fact 
that  those  villages  are  the  most  distant  from  the  area's  primary 
health  centers.  As  at  Jamkhed,  the  project  is  much  assisted  by 
local  voluntary  groups,  such  as  the  women's  clubs.  The  local 
voluntary  groups  either  provide  or  secure  sites  suitable  as  dis- 
tribution depots  for  condoms  and  birth  control  pills  and  also 
make  arrangements  for  the  operation  of  sterilization  camps. 
Data  provided  by  the  Project  for  Community  Action  in  Family 
Planning  show  that  important  achievements  have  been  realized 
in  the  field  of  population  control.  By  the  mid-1980s,  for  exam- 
ple, 43  percent  of  couples  were  using  family  planning,  a  full  14 
percent  above  the  state  average.  The  project  has  significantly 
improved  the  status  of  women,  involving  them  and  empower- 
ing them  to  bring  about  change  in  their  communities.  This 
contribution  is  important  because  of  the  way  in  which  the 
deeply  entrenched  inferior  status  of  women  in  many  communi- 
ties in  India  negates  official  efforts  to  decrease  the  fertility  rate. 

Studies  have  found  that  most  couples  in  fact  regard  family 
planning  positively.  However,  the  common  fertility  pattern  in 
India  diverges  from  the  two-child  family  that  policy  makers 
hold  as  ideal.  Women  continue  to  marry  young;  in  the  mid- 
1990s,  they  average  just  over  eighteen  years  of  age  at  marriage. 
When  women  choose  to  be  sterilized,  financial  inducements, 
although  helpful,  are  not  the  principal  incentives.  On  average, 
those  accepting  sterilization  already  have  four  living  children, 
of  whom  two  are  sons. 


92 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

The  strong  preference  for  sons  is  a  deeply  held  cultural  ideal 
based  on  economic  roots.  Sons  not  only  assist  with  farm  labor 
as  they  are  growing  up  (as  do  daughters)  but  they  provide 
labor  in  times  of  illness  and  unemployment  and  serve  as  their 
parents'  only  security  in  old  age.  Surveys  done  by  the  New 
Delhi  Operations  Research  Group  in  1991  indicated  that  as 
many  as  72  percent  of  rural  parents  continue  to  have  children 
until  at  least  two  sons  are  born;  the  preference  for  more  than 
one  son  among  urban  parents  was  tabulated  at  53  percent. 
Once  these  goals  have  been  achieved,  birth  control  may  be 
used  or,  especially  in  agricultural  areas,  it  may  not  if  additional 
child  labor,  later  adult  labor  for  the  family,  is  deemed  desir- 
able. 

A  significant  result  of  this  eagerness  for  sons  is  that  the 
Indian  population  has  a  deficiency  of  females.  Slightly  higher 
female  infant  mortality  rates  (seventy-nine  per  1,000  versus  sev- 
enty-eight per  1,000  for  males)  can  be  attributed  to  poor  health 
care,  abortions  of  female  fetuses,  and  female  infanticide. 
Human  rights  activists  have  estimated  that  there  are  at  least 
10,000  cases  of  female  infanticide  annually  throughout  India. 
The  cost  of  theoretically  illegal  dowries  and  the  loss  of  daugh- 
ters to  their  in-laws'  families  are  further  disincentives  for  some 
parents  to  have  daughters.  Sons,  of  course  continue  to  carry  on 
the  family  line  (see  Family  Ideals,  ch.  5).  The  1991  census 
revealed  that  the  national  sex  ratio  had  declined  from  934 
females  to  1,000  males  in  1981  to  927  to  1,000  in  1991.  In  only 
one  state — Kerala,  a  state  with  low  fertility  and  mortality  rates 
and  the  nation's  highest  literacy — did  females  exceed  males. 
The  census  found,  however,  that  female  life  expectancy  at  birth 
had  for  the  first  time  exceeded  that  for  males. 

India's  high  infant  mortality  and  elevated  mortality  in  early 
childhood  remain  significant  stumbling  blocks  to  population 
control  (see  Health  Conditions,  this  ch.).  India's  fertility  rate  is 
decreasing,  however,  and,  at  3.4  in  1994,  it  is  lower  than  those 
of  its  immediate  neighbors  (Bangladesh  had  a  rate  of  4.5  and 
Pakistan  had  6.7).  The  rate  is  projected  to  decrease  to  3.0  by 
2000,  2.6  by  2010,  and  2.3  by  2020. 

During  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s,  the  growth  rate  had 
formed  a  sort  of  plateau.  Some  states,  such  as  Kerala,  Tamil 
Nadu,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  Punjab,  Maharashtra,  and  Karna- 
taka,  had  made  progress  in  lowering  their  growth  rates,  but 
most  did  not.  Under  such  conditions,  India's  population  may 
not  stabilize  until  2060.

Life  Expectancy  and  Mortality 

The  average  Indian  male  born  in  the  1990s  can  expect  to 
live  58.5  years;  women  can  expect  to  live  onlv  slightlv  longer 
(59.6  years),  according  to  1995  estimates.  Life  expectancv  has 
risen  dramatically  throughout  the  centurv  from  a  scant  twenty 
vears  in  the  1911-20  period.  Although  men  enjoved  a  slightlv 
longer  life  expectancv  throughout  the  first  part  of  the  twenti- 
eth centurv,  by  1990  women  had  slightlv  surpassed  men.  The 
death  rate  declined  from  48.6  per  1.000  in  the  1910-20  period 
to  fifteen  per  1.000  in  the  1970s,  and  improved  thereafter, 
reaching  ten  per  1.000  by  1990,.  a  rate  that  held  steady  through 
the  mid-1990s.  India's  high  infant  mortality  rate  was  estimated 
to  exceed  76  per  1.000  live  births  in  1995  (see  table  7.  Appen- 
dix). Thirtv  percent  of  infants  had  low  birth  weights.,  and  the 
death  rate  for  children  aged  one  to  four  years  was  around  ten 
per  1.000  of  the  population. 

According  to  a  1989  National  Nutrition  Monitoring  Bureau 
report.,  less  than  15  percent  of  the  population  was  adequately 
nourished,  although  96  percent  received  an  adequate  number 
of  calories  per  dav.  In  1986  dailv  average  intake  was  2.238  calo- 
ries as  compared  with  2.630  calories  in  China.  According  to  UN 
findings,  caloric  intake  per  dav  in  India  had  fallen  slightlv  to 
2.229  in  1989.  lending  credence  to  the  concerns  of  some 
experts  who  claimed  that  annual  nutritional  standards  statistics 
cannot  be  relied  on  to  show  whether  poverty  is  actually  being 
reduced.  Instead.,  such  studies  may  actually  pick  up  short-term 
amelioration  of  poverty  as  the  result  of  a  period  of  good  crops 
rather  than  a  long-term  trend. 

Official  Indian  estimates  of  the  poverty  level  are  based  on  a 
person's  income  and  corresponding  access  to  minimum  nutri- 
tional needs  (see  Growth  since  1980.  ch.  6).  There  were  332 
million  people  at  or  below  the  poverty  level  in  FY  1991.  most  of 
whom  lived  in  rural  areas. 

Communicable  and  Noncommunicable  Diseases 

A  number  of  endemic  communicable  diseases  present  a  seri- 
ous public  health  hazard  in  India.  Over  the  years,  the  govern- 
ment has  set  up  a  variety  of  national  programs  aimed  at 
controlling  or  eradicating  these  diseases,  including  the 


94 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

National  Malaria  Eradication  Programme  and  the  National 
Filaria  Control  Programme.  Other  initiatives  seek  to  limit  the 
incidence  of  respiratory  infections,  cholera,  diarrheal  diseases, 
trachoma,  goiter,  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases. 

Smallpox,  formerly  a  significant  source  of  mortality,  was 
eradicated  as  part  of  the  worldwide  effort  to  eliminate  that  dis- 
ease. India  was  declared  smallpox-free  in  1975.  Malaria 
remains  a  serious  health  hazard;  although  the  incidence  of  the 
disease  declined  sharply  in  the  postindependence  period, 
India  remains  one  of  the  most  heavily  malarial  countries  in  the 
world.  Only  the  Himalaya  region  above  1,500  meters  is  spared. 
In  1965  government  sources  registered  only  150,000  cases,  a 
notable  drop  from  the  75  million  cases  in  the  early  postinde- 
pendence years.  This  success  was  short-lived,  however,  as  the 
malarial  parasites  became  increasingly  resistant  to  the  insecti- 
cides and  drugs  used  to  combat  the  disease.  By  the  mid-1970s, 
there  were  nearly  6.5  million  cases  on  record.  The  situation 
again  improved  because  of  more  conscientious  efforts;  by  1982 
the  number  of  cases  had  fallen  by  roughly  two-thirds.  This 
downward  trend  continued,  and  in  1987  slightly  fewer  than  1.7 
million  cases  of  malaria  were  reported. 

In  the  early  1990s,  about  389  million  people  were  at  risk  of 
infection  from  filaria  parasites;  19  million  showed  symptoms  of 
filariasis,  and  25  million  were  deemed  to  be  hosts  to  the  para- 
sites. Efforts  at  control,  under  the  National  Filaria  Control  Pro- 
gramme, which  was  established  in  1955,  have  focused  on 
eliminating  the  filaria  larvae  in  urban  locales,  and  by  the  early 
1990s  there  were  more  than  200  filaria  control  units  in  opera- 
tion. 

Leprosy,  a  major  public  health  and  social  problem,  is 
endemic,  with  all  the  states  and  union  territories  reporting 
cases.  However,  the  prevalence  of  the  disease  varies.  About  3 
million  leprosy  cases  are  estimated  to  exist  nationally,  of  which 
15  to  20  percent  are  infectious.  The  National  Leprosy  Control 
Programme  was  started  in  1955,  but  it  only  received  high  prior- 
ity after  1980.  In  FY  1982,  it  was  redesignated  as  the  National 
Leprosy  Eradication  Programme.  Its  goal  was  to  achieve  eradi- 
cation of  the  disease  by  2000.  To  that  end,  758  leprosy  control 
units,  900  urban  leprosy  centers,  291  temporary  hospitalization 
wards,  285  district  leprosy  units,  and  some  6,000  lower-level 
centers  had  been  established  by  March  1990.  By  March  1992, 
nearly  1.7  million  patients  were  receiving  regular  multidrug

treatment,  which  is  more  effective  than  the  standard  single 
drug  therapy  (Dapsone  monotherapy) . 

India  is  subject  to  outbreaks  of  various  diseases.  Among 
them  is  pneumonic  plague,  an  episode  of  which  spread  quickly 
throughout  India  in  1994  killing  hundreds  before  being 
brought  under  control.  Tuberculosis,  trachoma,  and  goiter  are 
endemic.  In  the  early  1980s,  there  were  an  estimated  10  million 
cases  of  tuberculosis,  of  which  about  25  percent  were  infec- 
tious. During  1991  nearly  1.6  million  new  tuberculosis  cases 
were  detected.  The  functions  of  the  Trachoma  Control  Pro- 
gramme, which  started  in  1968,  have  been  subsumed  by  the 
National  Programme  for  the  Control  of  Blindness.  Approxi- 
mately 45  million  Indians  are  vision-impaired;  roughly  12  mil- 
lion are  blind.  The  incidence  of  goiter  is  dominant  throughout 
the  sub-Himalayan  states  from  Jammu  and  Kashmir  to  the 
northeast.  There  are  some  170  million  people  who  are  exposed 
to  iodine  deficiency  disorders.  Starting  in  the  late  1980s,  the 
central  government  began  a  salt  iodinization  program  for  all 
edible  salt,  and  by  1991  record  production — 2.5  million  tons — 
of  iodized  salt  had  been  achieved.  There  are  as  well  anemias 
related  to  poor  nutrition,  a  variety  of  diseases  caused  by  vitamin 
and  mineral  deficiencies — beriberi,  scurvy,  osteomalacia,  and 
rickets — and  a  high  incidence  of  parasitic  infection. 

Diarrheal  diseases,  the  primary  cause  of  early  childhood 
mortality,  are  linked  to  inadequate  sewage  disposal  and  lack  of 
safe  drinking  water.  Roughly  50  percent  of  all  illness  is  attrib- 
uted to  poor  sanitation;  in  rural  areas,  about  80  percent  of  all 
children  are  infected  by  parasitic  worms.  Estimates  in  the  early 
1980s  suggested  that  although  more  than  80  percent  of  the 
urban  population  had  access  to  reasonably  safe  water,  fewer 
than  5  percent  of  rural  dwellers  did.  Waterborne  sewage  sys- 
tems were  woefully  overburdened;  only  around  30  percent  of 
urban  populations  had  adequate  sewage  disposal,  but  scarcely 
any  populations  outside  cities  did.  In  1990,  according  to 
United  States  sources,  only  3  percent  of  the  rural  population 
and  44  percent  of  the  urban  population  had  access  to  sanita- 
tion services,  a  level  relatively  low  by  developing  nation  stan- 
dards. There  were  better  findings  for  access  to  potable  water: 
69  percent  in  the  rural  areas  and  86  percent  in  urban  areas,  rel- 
atively high  percentages  by  developing  nation  standards.  In  the 
mid-1990s,  about  1  million  people  die  each  year  of  diseases 
associated  with  diarrhea.

India  has  an  estimated  1.5  million  to  2  million  cases  of  can- 
cer, with  500,000  new  cases  added  each  year.  Annual  deaths 
from  cancer  total  around  300,000.  The  most  common  malig- 
nancies are  cancer  of  the  oral  cavity  (mostly  relating  to  tobacco 
use  and  pan  chewing — about  35  percent  of  all  cases),  cervix, 
and  breast.  Cardiovascular  diseases  are  a  major  health  prob- 
lem; men  and  women  suffer  from  them  in  almost  equal  num- 
bers (14  million  versus  13  million  in  FY  1990). 

Acquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome 

The  incidence  of  AIDS  cases  in  India  is  steadily  rising  amidst 
concerns  that  the  nation  faces  the  prospect  of  an  AIDS  epi- 
demic. By  June  1991,  out  of  a  total  of  more  than  900,000 
screened,  some  5,130  people  tested  positive  for  the  human 
immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV).  However,  the  total  number 
infected  with  HIV  in  1992  was  estimated  by  a  New  Delhi-based 
official  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  at  500,000, 
and  more  pessimistic  estimates  by  the  World  Bank  in  1995  sug- 
gested a  figure  of  2  million,  the  highest  in  Asia.  Confirmed 
cases  of  AIDS  numbered  only  102  by  1991  but  had  jumped  to 
885  by  1994,  the  second  highest  reported  number  in  Asia  after 
Thailand.  Suspected  AIDS  cases,  according  to  WHO  and  the 
Indian  government,  may  be  in  the  area  of  80,000  in  1995.

India:  A  Country  Study 

The  main  factors  cited  in  the  spread  of  the  virus  are  hetero- 
sexual transmission,  primarily  by  urban  prostitutes  and  migrant 
workers,  such  as  long-distance  truck  drivers;  the  use  of  unsteril- 
ized  needles  and  syringes  by  physicians  and  intravenous  drug 
users;  and  transfusions  of  blood  from  infected  donors.  Based 
on  the  HIV  infection  rate  in  1991,  and  India's  position  as  the 
second  most  populated  country  in  the  world,  it  was  projected 
that  by  1995  India  would  have  more  HIV  and  AIDS  cases  than 
any  other  country  in  the  world.  This  prediction  appeared  true. 
By  mid-1995  India  had  been  labeled  by  the  media  as  "ground 
zero"  in  the  global  AIDS  epidemic,  and  new  predictions  for 
2000  were  that  India  would  have  1  million  AIDS  cases  and  5 
million  HIV-positive. 

In  1987  the  newly  formed  National  AIDS  Control  Pro- 
gramme began  limited  screening  of  the  blood  supply  and  mon- 
itoring of  high-risk  groups.  A  national  education  program 
aimed  at  AIDS  prevention  and  control  began  in  1990.  The  first 
AIDS  prevention  television  campaign  began  in  1991.  By  the 
mid-1990s,  AIDS  awareness  signs  on  public  streets,  condoms 
for  sale  near  brothels,  and  media  announcements  were  more 
in  evidence.  There  was  very  negative  publicity  as  well.  Posters 
with  the  names  and  photographs  of  known  HIV-positive  per- 
sons have  been  seen  in  New  Delhi,  and  there  have  been  reports 
of  HIV  patients  chained  in  medical  facilities  and  deprived  of 
treatment. 

Fear  and  ignorance  have  continued  to  compound  the  diffi- 
culty of  controlling  the  spread  of  the  virus,  and  discrimination 
against  AIDS  sufferers  has  surfaced.  For  example,  in  1990  the 
All-India  Institute  of  Medical  Sciences,  New  Delhi's  leading 
medical  facility,  reportedly  turned  away  two  people  infected 
with  HIV  because  its  staff  were  too  scared  to  treat  them. 

A  new  program  to  control  the  spread  of  AIDS  was  launched 
in  1991  by  the  Indian  Council  of  Medical  Research.  The  coun- 
cil looked  to  ancient  scriptures  and  religious  books  for  tradi- 
tional messages  that  preach  moderation  in  sex  and  describe 
prostitution  as  a  sin.  The  council  considered  that  the  great 
extent  to  which  Indian  life-styles  are  shaped  by  religion  rather 
than  by  science  would  cause  many  people  to  be  confused  by 
foreign-modeled  educational  campaigns  relying  on  television 
and  printed  booklets. 

The  severity  of  the  growing  AIDS  crisis  in  India  is  clear, 
according  to  statistics  compiled  during  the  mid-1990s.  In  Bom- 
bay, a  city  of  12.6  million  inhabitants  in  1991,  the  HIV  infection 


98 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

rate  among  the  estimated  80,000  prostitutes  jumped  from  1 
percent  in  1987  to  30  percent  in  1991  to  53  percent  in  1993. 
Migrant  workers  engaging  in  promiscuous  and  unprotected 
sexual  relations  in  the  big  city  carry  the  infection  to  other  sex- 
ual partners  on  the  road  and  then  to  their  homes  and  families. 

India's  blood  supply,  despite  official  blood  screening  efforts, 
continues  to  become  infected.  In  1991  donated  blood  was 
screened  for  HIV  in  only  four  major  cities:  New  Delhi,  Calcutta, 
Madras,  and  Bombay.  One  of  the  leading  factors  in  the  contam- 
ination of  the  blood  supply  is  that  30  percent  of  the  blood 
required  comes  from  private,  profit-making  banks  whose  prac- 
tices are  difficult  to  regulate.  Furthermore,  professional 
donors  are  an  integral  part  of  the  Indian  blood  supply  network, 
providing  about  30  percent  of  the  annual  requirement  nation- 
ally. These  donors  are  generally  poor  and  tend  to  engage  in 
high-risk  sex  and  use  intravenous  drugs  more  than  the  general 
population.  Professional  donors  also  tend  to  donate  frequently 
at  different  centers  and,  in  many  cases,  under  different  names. 
Reuse  of  improperly  sterilized  needles  in  health  care  and 
blood-collection  facilities  also  is  a  factor.  India's  minister  of 
health  and  family  welfare  reported  in  1992  that  only  138  out  of 
608  blood  banks  were  equipped  for  HIV  screening.  A  1992 
study  conducted  by  the  Indian  Health  Organisation  revealed 
that  86  percent  of  commercial  blood  donors  surveyed  were 
HIV-positive. 

Health  Care 

Role  of  the  Government 

The  Indian  constitution  charges  the  states  with  "the  raising 
of  the  level  of  nutrition  and  the  standard  of  living  of  its  people 
and  the  improvement  of  public  health"  (see  The  Constitu- 
tional Framework,  ch.  8).  However,  many  critics  of  India's 
National  Health  Policy,  endorsed  by  Parliament  in  1983,  point 
out  that  the  policy  lacks  specific  measures  to  achieve  broad 
stated  goals.  Particular  problems  include  the  failure  to  inte- 
grate health  services  with  wider  economic  and  social  develop- 
ment, the  lack  of  nutritional  support  and  sanitation,  and  the 
poor  participatory  involvement  at  the  local  level. 

Central  government  efforts  at  influencing  public  health 
have  focused  on  the  five-year  plans,  on  coordinated  planning 
with  the  states,  and  on  sponsoring  major  health  programs.  Gov- 
ernment expenditures  are  jointly  shared  by  the  central  and 


99 


India:  A  Country  Study 

state  governments.  Goals  and  strategies  are  set  through  central- 
state  government  consultations  of  the  Central  Council  of 
Health  and  Family  Welfare.  Central  government  efforts  are 
administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare, 
which  provides  both  administrative  and  technical  services  and 
manages  medical  education.  States  provide  public  services  and 
health  education. 

The  1983  National  Health  Policy  is  committed  to  providing 
health  services  to  all  by  2000  (see  table  8,  Appendix;  The  Legis- 
lature, ch.  8).  In  1983  health  care  expenditures  varied  greatly 
among  the  states  and  union  territories,  from  Rsl3  per  capita  in 
Bihar  to  Rs60  per  capita  in  Himachal  Pradesh  (for  value  of  the 
rupee — see  Glossary),  and  Indian  per  capita  expenditure  was 
low  when  compared  with  other  Asian  countries  outside  of 
South  Asia.  Although  government  health  care  spending  pro- 
gressively grew  throughout  the  1980s,  such  spending  as  a  per- 
centage of  the  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary) 
remained  fairly  constant.  In  the  meantime,  health  care  spend- 
ing as  a  share  of  total  government  spending  decreased.  During 
the  same  period,  private-sector  spending  on  health  care  was 
about  1.5  times  as  much  as  government  spending. 

Expenditures 

In  the  mid-1990s,  health  spending  amounts  to  6  percent  of 
GDP,  one  of  the  highest  levels  among  developing  nations.  The 
established  per  capita  spending  is  around  Rs320  per  year  with 
the  major  input  from  private  households  (75  percent).  State 
governments  contribute  15.2  percent,  the  central  government 
5.2  percent,  third-party  insurance  and  employers  3.3  percent, 
and  municipal  government  and  foreign  donors  about  1.3, 
according  to  a  1995  World  Bank  study.  Of  these  proportions, 
58.7  percent  goes  toward  primary  health  care  (curative,  pre- 
ventive, and  promotive)  and  38.8  percent  is  spent  on  second- 
ary and  tertiary  inpatient  care.  The  rest  goes  for  nonservice 
costs. 

The  fifth  and  sixth  five-year  plans  (FY  1974-78  and  FY  1980- 
84,  respectively)  included  programs  to  assist  delivery  of  preven- 
tive medicine  and  improve  the  health  status  of  the  rural  popu- 
lation. Supplemental  nutrition  programs  and  increasing  the 
supply  of  safe  drinking  water  were  high  priorities.  The  sixth 
plan  aimed  at  training  more  community  health  workers  and 
increasing  efforts  to  control  communicable  diseases.  There 


100

were  also  efforts  to  improve  regional  imbalances  in  the  distri- 
bution of  health  care  resources. 

The  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1985-89)  budgeted  Rs33.9 
billion  for  health,  an  amount  roughly  double  the  outlay  of  the 
sixth  plan.  Health  spending  as  a  portion  of  total  plan  outlays, 
however,  had  declined  over  the  years  since  the  first  plan  in 
1951,  from  a  high  of  3.3  percent  of  the  total  plan  spending  in 
FY  1951-55  to  1.9  percent  of  the  total  for  the  seventh  plan. 
Mid-way  through  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1992-96),  how- 
ever, health  and  family  welfare  was  budgeted  at  Rs20  billion,  or 
4.3  percent  of  the  total  plan  spending  for  FY  1994,  with  an 
additional  Rs3.6  billion  in  the  nonplan  budget. 

Primary  Services 

Health  care  facilities  and  personnel  increased  substantially 
between  the  early  1950s  and  early  1980s,  but  because  of  fast 
population  growth,  the  number  of  licensed  medical  practitio- 
ners per  10,000  individuals  had  fallen  by  the  late  1980s  to  three 
per  10,000  from  the  1981  level  of  four  per  10,000.  In  1991 
there  were  approximately  ten  hospital  beds  per  10,000  individ- 
uals. 

Primary  health  centers  are  the  cornerstone  of  the  rural 
health  care  system.  By  1991,  India  had  about  22,400  primary 


101 


India:  A  Country  Study 

health  centers,  11,200  hospitals,  and  27,400  dispensaries. 
These  facilities  are  part  of  a  tiered  health  care  system  that  fun- 
nels more  difficult  cases  into  urban  hospitals  while  attempting 
to  provide  routine  medical  care  to  the  vast  majority  in  the 
countryside.  Primary  health  centers  and  subcenters  rely  on 
trained  paramedics  to  meet  most  of  their  needs.  The  main 
problems  affecting  the  success  of  primary  health  centers  are 
the  predominance  of  clinical  and  curative  concerns  over  the 
intended  emphasis  on  preventive  work  and  the  reluctance  of 
staff  to  work  in  rural  areas.  In  addition,  the  integration  of 
health  services  with  family  planning  programs  often  causes  the 
local  population  to  perceive  the  primary  health  centers  as  hos- 
tile to  their  traditional  preference  for  large  families.  Therefore, 
primary  health  centers  often  play  an  adversarial  role  in  local 
efforts  to  implement  national  health  policies. 

According  to  data  provided  in  1989  by  the  Ministry  of 
Health  and  Family  Welfare,  the  total  number  of  civilian  hospi- 
tals for  all  states  and  union  territories  combined  was  10,157.  In 
1991  there  was  a  total  of  811,000  hospital  and  health  care  facili- 
ties beds.  The  geographical  distribution  of  hospitals  varied 
according  to  local  socioeconomic  conditions.  In  India's  most 
populous  state,  Uttar  Pradesh,  with  a  1991  population  of  more 
than  139  million,  there  were  735  hospitals  as  of  1990.  In  Kerala, 
with  a  1991  population  of  29  million  occupying  an  area  only 
one-seventh  the  size  of  Uttar  Pradesh,  there  were  2,053  hospi- 
tals. In  light  of  the  central  government's  goal  of  health  care  for 
all  by  2000,  the  uneven  distribution  of  hospitals  needs  to  be 
reexamined.  Private  studies  of  India's  total  number  of  hospitals 
in  the  early  1990s  were  more  conservative  than  official  Indian 
data,  estimating  that  in  1992  there  were  7,300  hospitals.  Of  this 
total,  nearly  4,000  were  owned  and  managed  by  central,  state, 
or  local  governments.  Another  2,000,  owned  and  managed  by 
charitable  trusts,  received  partial  support  from  the  govern- 
ment, and  the  remaining  1,300  hospitals,  many  of  which  were 
relatively  small  facilities,  were  owned  and  managed  by  the  pri- 
vate sector.  The  use  of  state-of-the-art  medical  equipment, 
often  imported  from  Western  countries,  was  primarily  limited 
to  urban  centers  in  the  early  1990s.  A  network  of  regional  can- 
cer diagnostic  and  treatment  facilities  was  being  established  in 
the  early  1990s  in  major  hospitals  that  were  part  of  government 
medical  colleges.  By  1992  twenty-two  such  centers  were  in  oper- 
ation. Most  of  the  1,300  private  hospitals  lacked  sophisticated 
medical  facilities,  although  in  1992  approximately  12  percent 


102 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

possessed  state-of-the-art  equipment  for  diagnosis  and  treat- 
ment of  all  major  diseases,  including  cancer.  The  fast  pace  of 
development  of  the  private  medical  sector  and  the  burgeoning 
middle  class  in  the  1990s  have  led  to  the  emergence  of  the  new 
concept  in  India  of  establishing  hospitals  and  health  care  facili- 
ties on  a  for-profit  basis. 

By  the  late  1980s,  there  were  approximately  128  medical  col- 
leges— roughly  three  times  more  than  in  1950.  These  medical 
colleges  in  1987  accepted  a  combined  annual  class  of  14,166 
students.  Data  for  1987  show  that  there  were  320,000  registered 
medical  practitioners  and  219,300  registered  nurses.  Various 
studies  have  shown  that  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  people 
preferred  to  pay  and  seek  the  more  sophisticated  services  pro- 
vided by  private  physicians  rather  than  use  free  treatment  at 
public  health  centers. 

Indigenous  or  traditional  medical  practitioners  continue  to 
practice  throughout  the  country.  The  two  main  forms  of  tradi- 
tional medicine  practiced  are  the  ayurvedic  (meaning  science 
of  life)  system,  which  deals  with  causes,  symptoms,  diagnoses, 
and  treatment  based  on  all  aspects  of  well-being  (mental,  phys- 
ical, and  spiritual),  and  the  unani  (so-called  Galenic  medicine) 
herbal  medical  practice.  A  vaidya  is  a  practitioner  of  the 
ayurvedic  tradition,  and  a  hakim  (Arabic  for  a  Muslim  physi- 
cian) is  a  practitioner  of  the  unani  tradition.  These  professions 
are  frequently  hereditary.  A  variety  of  institutions  offer  training 
in  indigenous  medical  practice.  Only  in  the  late  1970s  did  offi- 
cial health  policy  refer  to  any  form  of  integration  between 
Western-oriented  medical  personnel  and  indigenous  medical 
practitioners.  In  the  early  1990s,  there  were  ninety-eight 
ayurvedic  colleges  and  seventeen  unani  colleges  operating  in 
both  the  governmental  and  nongovernmental  sectors. 

Education 

Administration  and  Funding 

Education  is  divided  into  preprimary,  primary,  middle  (or 
intermediate),  secondary  (or  high  school),  and  higher  levels. 
Primary  school  includes  children  of  ages  six  to  eleven,  orga- 
nized into  classes  one  through  five.  Middle  school  pupils  aged 
eleven  through  fourteen  are  organized  into  classes  six  through 
eight,  and  high  school  students  ages  fourteen  through  seven- 
teen are  enrolled  in  classes  nine  through  twelve.  Higher  educa- 
tion includes  technical  schools,  colleges,  and  universities. 


103 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Article  42  of  the  constitution,  an  amendment  added  in  1976, 
transferred  education  from  the  state  list  of  responsibilities  to 
the  central  government.  Prior  to  this  assumption  of  direct 
responsibility  for  promoting  educational  facilities  for  all  parts 
of  society,  the  central  government  had  responsibility  only  for 
the  education  of  minorities.  Article  43  of  the  constitution  set 
the  goal  of  free  and  compulsory  education  for  all  children 
through  age  fourteen  and  gave  the  states  the  power  to  set  stan- 
dards for  education  within  their  jurisdictions.  Despite  this  joint 
responsibility  for  education  by  state  and  central  governments, 
the  central  government  has  the  preponderant  role  because  it 
drafts  the  five-year  plans,  which  include  education  policy  and 
some  funding  for  education.  Moreover,  in  1986  the  implemen- 
tation of  the  National  Policy  on  Education  initiated  a  long-term 
series  of  programs  aimed  at  improving  India's  education  system 
by  ensuring  that  all  children  through  the  primary  level  have 
access  to  education  of  comparable  quality  irrespective  of  caste, 
creed,  location,  or  sex.  The  1986  policy  set  a  goal  that,  by  1990, 
all  children  by  age  eleven  were  to  have  five  years  of  schooling 
or  its  equivalent  in  nonformal  education.  By  1995  all  children 
up  to  age  fourteen  were  to  have  been  provided  free  and  com- 
pulsory education.  The  1990  target  was  not  achieved,  but  by 
setting  such  goals,  the  central  government  was  seen  as  express- 
ing its  commitment  to  the  ideal  of  universal  education. 

The  Department  of  Education,  part  of  the  Ministry  of 
Human  Resource  Development,  implements  the  central  gov- 
ernment's responsibilities  in  educational  matters.  The  ministry 
coordinates  planning  with  the  states,  provides  funding  for 
experimental  programs,  and  acts  through  the  University 
Grants  Commission  and  the  National  Council  of  Educational 
Research  and  Training.  These  organizations  seek  to  improve 
education  standards,  develop  and  introduce  instructional 
materials,  and  design  textbooks  in  the  country's  numerous  lan- 
guages (see  The  Social  Context  of  Language,  ch.  4).  The 
National  Council  of  Educational  Research  and  Training  col- 
lects data  about  education  and  conducts  educational  research. 

State-level  ministries  of  education  coordinate  education  pro- 
grams at  local  levels.  City  school  boards  are  under  the  supervi- 
sion of  both  the  state  education  ministry  and  the  municipal 
government.  In  rural  areas,  either  the  district  board  or  the  pan- 
chayat  (village  council — see  Glossary)  oversees  the  school 
board  (see  Local  Government,  ch.  8).  The  significant  role  the 
panchayats  play  in  education  often  means  the  politicization  of 


104

elementary  education  because  the  appointment  and  transfer 
of  teachers  often  become  emotional  political  issues. 

State  governments  provide  most  educational  funding, 
although  since  independence  the  central  government  increas- 
ingly has  assumed  the  cost  of  educational  development  as  out- 
lined under  the  five-year  plans.  India  spends  an  average  3 
percent  of  its  GNP  on  education.  Spending  for  education 
ranged  between  4.6  and  7.7  percent  of  total  central  govern- 
ment expenditures  from  the  1950s  through  the  1970s.  In  the 
early  1980s,  about  10  percent  of  central  and  state  funds  went  to 
education,  a  proportion  well  below  the  average  of  seventy-nine 
other  developing  countries.  More  than  90  percent  of  the 
expenditure  was  for  teachers'  salaries  and  administration.  Per 
capita  budget  expenditures  increased  from  Rs36.5  in  FY  1977 
to  Rsll2.7  in  FY  1986,  with  highest  expenditures  found  in  the 
union  territories.  Nevertheless,  total  expenditure  per  student 
per  year  by  the  central  and  state  governments  declined  in  real 
terms. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Education 

Several  factors  work  against  universal  education  in  India. 
Although  Indian  law  prohibits  the  employment  of  children  in 


105 


India:  A  Country  Study 


factories,  the  law  allows  them  to  work  in  cottage  industries, 
family  households,  restaurants,  or  in  agriculture.  Primary  and 
middle  school  education  is  compulsory.  However,  only  slightly 
more  than  50  percent  of  children  between  the  ages  of  six  and 
fourteen  actually  attend  school,  although  a  far  higher  percent- 
age is  enrolled.  School  attendance  patterns  for  children  vary 
from  region  to  region  and  according  to  gender.  But  it  is  note- 
worthy that  national  literacy  rates  increased  from  43.7  percent 
in  1981  to  52.2  percent  in  1991  (male  63.9  percent,  female  39.4 
percent),  passing  the  50  percent  mark  for  the  first  time.  There 
are  wide  regional  and  gender  variations  in  the  literacy  rates, 
however;  for  example,  the  southern  state  of  Kerala,  with  a  1991 
literacy  rate  of  about  89.8  percent,  ranked  first  in  India  in 
terms  of  both  male  and  female  literacy.  Bihar,  a  northern  state, 
ranked  lowest  with  a  literacy  rate  of  only  39  percent  (53  per- 
cent for  males  and  23  percent  for  females).  School  enrollment 
rates  also  vary  greatly  according  to  age  (see  table  9,  Appendix). 

To  improve  national  literacy,  the  central  government 
launched  a  wide-reaching  literacy  campaign  in  July  1993.  Using 
a  volunteer  teaching  force  of  some  10  million  people,  the  gov- 
ernment hoped  to  have  reached  around  100  million  Indians  by 
1997.  A  special  focus  was  placed  on  improving  literacy  among 
women. 

A  report  in  1985  by  the  Ministry  of  Education,  entitled  Chal- 
lenge of  Education:  A  Policy  Perspective,  showed  that  nearly  60  per- 
cent of  children  dropped  out  between  grades  one  and  five. 
(The  Ministry  of  Education  was  incorporated  into  the  Ministry 
of  Human  Resources  in  1985  as  the  Department  of  Education. 
In  1988  the  Ministry  of  Human  Resources  was  renamed  the 
Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development.)  Of  100  children 
enrolled  in  grade  one,  only  twenty-three  reached  grade  eight. 
Although  many  children  lived  within  one  kilometer  of  a  pri- 
mary school,  nearly  20  percent  of  all  habitations  did  not  have 
schools  nearby.  Forty  percent  of  primary  schools  were  not  of 
masonry  construction.  Sixty  percent  had  no  drinking  water 
facilities,  70  percent  had  no  library  facilities,  and  89  percent 
lacked  toilet  facilities.  Single-teacher  primary  schools  were 
commonplace,  and  it  was  not  unusual  for  the  teacher  to  be 
absent  or  even  to  subcontract  the  teaching  work  to  unqualified 
substitutes  (see  table  10,  Appendix). 

The  improvements  that  India  has  made  in  education  since 
independence  are  nevertheless  substantial.  From  the  first  plan 
until  the  beginning  of  the  sixth  (1951-80),  the  percentage  of 


106 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

the  primary  school-age  population  attending  classes  more  than 
doubled.  The  number  of  schools  and  teachers  increased  dra- 
matically. Middle  schools  and  high  schools  registered  the  steep- 
est rates  of  growth.  The  number  of  primary  schools  increased 
by  more  than  230  percent  between  1951  and  1980.  During  the 
same  period,  however,  the  number  of  middle  schools  increased 
about  tenfold.  The  numbers  of  teachers  showed  similar  rates  of 
increase.  The  proportion  of  trained  teachers  among  those 
working  in  primary  and  middle  schools,  fewer  than  60  percent 
in  1950,  was  more  than  90  percent  in  1987  (see  table  11, 
Appendix).  However,  there  was  considerable  variation  in  the 
geographical  distribution  of  trained  teachers  in  the  states  and 
union  territories  in  the  1986-87  school  year.  Arunachal 
Pradesh  had  the  highest  percentage  (60  percent)  of  untrained 
teachers  in  primary  schools,  and  Assam  had  the  highest  per- 
centage (72  percent)  of  untrained  teachers  in  middle  schools. 
Gujarat,  Tamil  Nadu,  Chandigarh,  and  Pondicherry  (Puduch- 
cheri)  reportedly  had  no  untrained  teachers  at  either  kind  of 
school. 

Various  forms  of  private  schooling  are  common;  many 
schools  are  strictly  private,  whereas  others  enjoy  government 
grants-in-aid  but  are  run  privately.  Schools  run  by  church  and 
missionary  societies  are  common  forms  of  private  schools. 
Among  India's  Muslim  population,  the  madrasa,  a  school 
attached  to  a  mosque,  plays  an  important  role  in  education 
(see  Islamic  Traditions  in  South  Asia,  ch.  3).  Some  10  percent 
of  all  children  who  enter  the  first  grade  are  enrolled  in  private 
schools.  The  dropout  rate  in  these  schools  is  practically  nonex- 
istent. 

Traditional  notions  of  social  rank  and  hierarchy  have  greatly 
influenced  India's  primary  school  system.  A  dual  system  existed 
in  the  early  1990s,  in  which  middle-class  families  sent  their  chil- 
dren to  private  schools  while  lower-class  families  sent  their  chil- 
dren to  underfinanced  and  underequipped  municipal  and 
village  schools.  Evolving  middle-class  values  have  made  even 
nursery  school  education  in  the  private  sector  a  stressful  event 
for  children  and  parents  alike.  Tough  entrance  interviews  for 
admission,  long  classroom  hours,  heavy  homework  assign- 
ments, and  high  tuition  rates  in  the  mid-1990s  led  to  charges  of 
"lost  childhood"  for  preschool  children  and  acknowledgment 
of  both  the  social  costs  and  enhanced  social  benefits  for  the 
families  involved.

India:  A  Country  Study 

The  government  encourages  the  study  of  classical,  modern, 
and  tribal  languages  with  a  view  toward  the  gradual  switch  from 
English  to  regional  languages  and  to  teaching  Hindi  in  non- 
Hindi  speaking  states.  As  a  result,  there  are  schools  conducted 
in  various  languages  at  all  levels.  Classical  and  foreign  language 
training  most  commonly  occurs  at  the  postsecondary  level, 
although  English  is  also  taught  at  the  lower  levels  (see  Diversity, 
Use,  and  Policy;  Hindi  and  English,  ch.  4). 

Colleges  and  Universities 

Receiving  higher  education,  once  the  nearly  exclusive 
domain  of  the  wealthy  and  privileged,  since  independence  has 
become  the  aspiration  of  almost  every  student  completing  high 
school.  In  the  1950-51  school  year,  there  were  some  360,000 
students  enrolled  in  colleges  and  universities;  by  the  1990-91 
school  year,  the  number  had  risen  to  nearly  4  million,  a  more 
than  tenfold  increase  in  four  decades.  At  that  time,  there  were 
177  universities  and  university-level  institutions  (more  than  six 
times  the  number  at  independence),  some  500  teacher  train- 
ing colleges,  and  several  thousand  other  colleges. 

There  are  three  kinds  of  colleges  in  India.  The  first  type, 
government  colleges,  are  found  only  in  those  states  where  pri- 
vate enterprise  is  weak  or  which  were  at  one  time  controlled  by 
princes  (see  Company  Rule,  1757-1857,  ch.  1).  The  second 
kind  are  colleges  managed  by  religious  organizations  and  the 
private  sector.  Many  of  the  latter  institutions  were  founded 
after  1947  by  wealthy  business  owners  and  politicians  wishing 
to  gain  local  fame  and  importance.  Professional  colleges  com- 
prise the  third  kind  and  consist  mostly  of  medical,  teacher- 
training,  engineering,  law,  and  agricultural  colleges.  More  than 
50  percent  of  them  are  sponsored  and  managed  by  the  govern- 
ment. However,  about  5  percent  of  these  colleges  are  privately 
run  without  government  grant  support.  They  charge  fees  of 
ten  to  twelve  times  the  amount  of  the  government-run  col- 
leges. The  profusion  of  new  engineering  colleges  in  India  in 
the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  caused  concern  in  official  educa- 
tion circles  that  the  overall  quality  and  reputation  of  India's 
higher  education  system  would  be  threatened  by  these  new 
schools,  which  operated  mainly  on  a  for-profit  basis.  As  the  gov- 
ernment tightened  its  support  to  higher  education  in  the  early 
1990s,  colleges  and  universities  came  under  considerable  finan- 
cial stress. 


108 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

The  All-India  Council  of  Technical  Education  is  empowered 
to  regulate  the  establishment  of  any  new  private  professional 
colleges  to  limit  their  proliferation.  In  1992  the  Karnataka 
High  Court  directed  the  state  government  to  rescind  permis- 
sion to  nine  organizations  to  start  new  engineering  and  medi- 
cal colleges  in  the  state. 

Gaining  admission  to  a  nonprofessional  college  is  not 
unduly  difficult  except  in  the  case  of  some  select  colleges  that 
are  particularly  competitive.  Students  encounter  greater  diffi- 
culties in  gaining  admission  to  professional  colleges  in  such 
fields  as  architecture,  business,  medicine,  and  dentistry. 

There  are  four  categories  of  universities.  The  largest  num- 
ber are  teaching  universities  that  maintain  and  run  a  large 
number  of  colleges.  Unitary  institutions,  such  as  Allahabad 
University  and  Lucknow  University,  make  up  the  second  kind. 
The  third  kind  are  the  twenty-six  agricultural  universities,  each 
managed  by  the  state  in  which  it  is  located.  Technical  universi- 
ties constitute  the  fourth  kind.  In  the  late  1980s,  more  techni- 
cal universities,  such  as  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  Technological 
University  in  the  state  of  Hyderabad,  were  founded.  There 
were  also  proposals  to  found  medical  universities  in  some 
states.  By  1990  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Tamil  Nadu  already  had 
established  such  universities.  Out  of  the  177  universities  in  the 
country,  only  ten  are  funded  by  the  central  government.  The 
majority  of  universities  are  managed  by  the  states,  which  estab- 
lish them  and  provide  funding. 

There  was  a  high  rate  of  attrition  among  students  in  higher 
education  in  the  1980s.  A  substantial  portion  failed  their  exam- 
inations more  than  once,  and  large  numbers  dropped  out;  only 
about  one  out  of  four  students  successfully  completed  the  full 
course  of  studies.  Even  those  students  who  were  successful 
could  not  count  on  a  university  degree  to  assure  them  employ- 
ment. In  the  early  postindependence  years,  a  bachelor's  degree 
often  provided  entrance  to  the  elite,  but  in  contemporary 
India,  it  provides  a  chance  to  become  a  white-collar  worker  at  a 
relatively  modest  salary.  The  government  traditionally  has  been 
the  principal  employer  of  educated  manpower. 

State  governments  play  a  powerful  role  in  the  running  of  all 
but  the  national  universities.  Political  considerations,  if  not 
outright  political  patronage,  play  a  significant  part  in  appoint- 
ments. The  state  governor  is  usually  the  university  chancellor, 
and  the  vice  chancellor,  who  actually  runs  the  institution,  is 
usually  a  political  appointee.  Appointments  are  subject  to  polit- 


109 


India:  A  Country  Study 

ical  jockeying,  and  state  governments  have  control  over  grants 
and  other  forms  of  recognition.  Caste  affiliation  and  regional 
background  are  recognized  criteria  for  admission  and  appoint- 
ments in  many  colleges.  To  offset  the  inequities  implicit  in 
such  practices,  a  certain  number  of  places  are  reserved  for 
members  of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes. 

Education  and  Society 

Historically,  Indian  education  has  been  elitist.  Traditional 
Hindu  education  was  tailored  to  the  needs  of  Brahman  (see 
Glossary)  boys  who  were  taught  to  read  and  write  by  a  Brah- 
man teacher  (see  The  Roots  of  Indian  Religion,  ch.  3).  During 
Mughal  rule  (1526-1858),  Muslim  education  was  similarly  elit- 
ist, although  its  orientation  reflected  economic  factors  rather 
than  those  of  caste  background.  Under  British  company  and 
crown  rule  (1757-1947),  official  education  policies  reinforced 
the  preexisting  elitist  tendencies  of  South  Asian  education.  By 
tying  entrance  and  advancement  in  government  service  to  aca- 
demic education,  colonial  rule  contributed  to  the  legacy  of  an 
education  system  geared  to  preserving  the  position  and  prerog- 
atives of  the  more  privileged.  Education  served  as  a  "gate- 
keeper," permitting  an  avenue  of  upward  mobility  to  those  few 
able  to  muster  sufficient  resources. 

Even  the  efforts  of  the  nationalistic  Indian  National  Con- 
gress (the  Congress — see  Glossary)  faltered  in  the  face  of  the 
entrenched  interests  defending  the  existing  system  of  educa- 
tion (see  Origins  of  the  Congress  and  the  Muslim  League,  ch. 
1).  Early  in  the  1900s,  the  Congress  called  for  national  educa- 
tion, placing  an  emphasis  on  technical  and  vocational  training. 
In  1920  the  Congress  initiated  a  boycott  of  government-aided 
and  government-controlled  schools;  it  founded  several 
"national"  schools  and  colleges,  but  to  little  avail.  The  rewards 
of  British-style  education  were  so  great  that  the  boycott  was 
largely  ignored,  and  the  Congress  schools  temporarily  disap- 
peared. 

Postprimary  education  has  traditionally  catered  to  the  inter- 
ests of  the  higher  and  upwardly  mobile  castes  (see  Changes  in 
the  Caste  System,  ch.  5).  Despite  substantial  increases  in  the 
spread  of  middle  schools  and  high  schools'  growth  in  enroll- 
ment, secondary  schooling  is  necessary  for  those  bent  on  social 
status  and  mobility  through  acquisition  of  an  office  job. 

In  the  nineteenth  century,  postprimary  students  were  dis- 
proportionately Brahmans;  their  traditional  concern  with 


110 


learning  gave  them  an  advantage  under  British  education  poli- 
cies. By  the  early  twentieth  century,  several  powerful  cultivator 
castes  had  realized  the  advantages  of  education  as  a  passport  to 
political  power  and  had  organized  to  acquire  formal  learning. 
"Backward"  castes  (usually  economically  disadvantaged  Shu- 
dras)  who  had  acquired  some  wealth  took  advantage  of  their 
status  to  secure  educational  privilege.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the 
vast  majority  of  students  making  it  through  middle  school  to 
high  school  continued  to  be  from  high-level  castes  and  middle- 
to  upper-class  families  living  in  urban  areas  (see  Varna,  Caste, 
and  Other  Divisions,  ch.  5).  A  region's  three  or  four  most  pow- 
erful castes  typically  dominated  the  school  system.  In  addition, 
the  widespread  role  of  private  education  and  the  payment  of 
fees  even  at  government-run  schools  discriminated  against  the 
poor. 

The  goals  of  the  1986  National  Policy  on  Education 
demanded  vastly  increased  enrollment.  In  order  to  have 
attained  universal  elementary  education  in  1995,  the  1981 
enrollment  level  of  72.7  million  would  have  had  to  increase  to 
160  million  in  1995.  Although  the  seventh  plan  suggested  the 
adoption  of  new  education  methods  to  meet  these  goals,  such 
as  the  promotion  of  television  and  correspondence  courses 
(often  referred  to  as  "distance  learning")  and  open  school  sys- 
tems, the  actual  extended  coverage  of  children  was  not  very 


111 


India:  A  Country  Study 


great.  Many  critics  of  India's  education  policy  argue  that  total 
school  enrollment  is  not  actually  a  goal  of  the  government  con- 
sidering the  extent  of  society's  vested  interest  in  child  labor.  In 
this  context,  education  can  be  seen  as  a  tool  that  one  social 
class  uses  to  prevent  the  rise  of  another.  Middle-class  Indians 
frequently  distinguish  between  the  children  of  the  poor  as 
"hands,"  or  children  who  must  be  taught  to  work,  and  their 
own  children  as  "minds,"  or  children  who  must  be  taught  to 
learn.  The  upgraded  curriculum  with  increased  requirements 
in  English  and  in  the  sciences  appears  to  be  causing  difficulties 
for  many  children.  Although  all  the  states  have  recognized  that 
curriculum  reform  is  needed,  no  comprehensive  plan  to  link 
curricular  changes  with  new  ways  of  teaching,  learning,  teacher 
training,  and  examination  methods  has  been  implemented. 

The  government  instituted  an  important  program  for 
improving  physical  facilities  through  a  phased  drive  in  all  pri- 
mary schools  in  the  country  called  Operation  Blackboard. 
Under  Operation  Blackboard,  Rsl  billion  was  allocated — but 
not  spent — in  1987  to  pay  for  basic  amenities  for  village 
schools,  such  as  toys  and  games,  classroom  materials,  black- 
boards, and  maps.  This  financial  allotment  averaged  Rs2,200 
for  each  government-run  primary  school.  Additional  goals  of 
Operation  Blackboard  included  construction  of  classrooms 
that  would  be  usable  in  all  weather,  and  an  additional  teacher, 
preferably  a  woman,  in  all  single-teacher  schools. 

The  nonformal  education  system  implemented  in  1979  was 
the  major  government  effort  to  educate  dropouts  and  other 
unenrolled  children.  Special  emphasis  was  given  to  the  nonfor- 
mal education  system  in  the  nine  states  regarded  by  the  gov- 
ernment as  having  deficient  education  systems:  Andhra 
Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Madhya  Pradesh, 
Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West  Bengal.  A  large 
number  of  children  who  resided  in  these  states  could  not 
attend  formal  schools  because  they  were  employed,  either  with 
or  without  wages.  Seventy-five  percent  of  the  country's  children 
who  were  not  enrolled  in  school  resided  in  these  states  in  the 
1980s. 

The  1986  National  Policy  on  Education  gave  new  impetus  to 
the  nonformal  education  system.  Revised  and  expanded  pro- 
grams focused  on  involving  voluntary  organizations  and  train- 
ing talented  and  dedicated  young  men  and  women  in  local 
communities  as  instructors.  The  results  of  a  late  1980s  inte- 
grated pilot  project  for  nonformal  and  adult  education  for

women  and  girls  in  the  Lucknow  district  of  Uttar  Pradesh  pro- 
vide important  data  for  analyzing  recent  implementation 
trends  and  initial  results  of  both  the  nonformal  education  sys- 
tem and  adult  education  in  India.  Under  this  project,  300  cen- 
ters were  opened  in  rural  parts  of  the  district  with  the  approval 
of  the  Department  of  Education,  the  central  government,  and 
the  state  government  of  Uttar  Pradesh  with  financial  and  advi- 
sory support  from  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific, 
and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO). 

Because  of  the  shortage  of  women  teachers  in  rural  areas  of 
Uttar  Pradesh,  in  the  pilot  project  nonformal  education  for 
girls  aged  six  to  fourteen  was  integrated  with  the  adult  educa- 
tion program  for  women  aged  fifteen  to  thirty-five,  so  that  the 
same  staff  and  infrastructure  could  be  used.  Most  of  the  fami- 
lies of  the  project  participants  were  in  subsistence  farming  or 
engaged  as  farmhands,  clerical  workers,  and  petty  merchants. 
Often  the  brothers  of  female  participants  attended  a  formal 
school  situated  about  one  or  two  kilometers  from  their  homes. 
Most  of  the  300  instructors  for  the  300  centers  were  young 
women  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and  thirty-five.  Each  cen- 
ter averaged  twenty-five  women  and  twenty  girl  participants. 
The  physical  facilities  of  the  centers  varied  from  village  to  vil- 
lage. Classes  might  be  held  on  the  balcony  of  a  brick  house, 
within  a  temple,  in  a  room  of  a  mud-walled  house,  or  under 
open  thatch-roof  structures.  Besides  focusing  on  the  acquisi- 
tion of  literacy  skills,  the  project  increased  participant  motiva- 
tion by  also  offering  instruction  in  household  work,  such  as 
sewing,  knitting,  and  preserving  food.  In  1987  a  UNESCO  mis- 
sion to  evaluate  progress  in  this  project  in  the  areas  of  func- 
tional literacy,  vocational  skills,  and  civic  awareness  observed 
that  randomly  chosen  participants  in  both  nonformal  and 
adult  education  classes  effectively  demonstrated  their  reading 
and  writing  skills  at  appropriate  levels.  As  a  result  of  many  such 
local  programs,  literacy  rates  improved  between  1981  and 
1991.  Male  literacy  increased  from  56.5  percent  in  1981  to  64.2 
percent  in  1991  while  women's  literacy  rate  increased  from 
29.9  percent  in  1981  to  39.2  percent  in  1991. 

Understanding  India's  health  care  and  education  systems 
contributes  to  the  larger  understanding  of  this  complex 
nation's  diverse  society.  General  trends  and  averages  concern- 
ing social  conditions  on  a  national  level  may  not  adequately 
describe  how  human  activity  is  expressed  spatially  and  tempo- 
rally in  specific  areas.  The  great  variations  in  local  environmen- 


114 


Geographic  and  Demographic  Setting 

tal  and  social  conditions  require  that  national  and  state  or 
union  territory  programs  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  life 
not  adhere  too  strictly  to  any  one  standard  plan.  Local  climate, 
topography,  and  drainage  patterns  all  need  to  be  considered  in 
terms  of  how  they  relate  to  local  forms  of  land  use  and  ethnic 
and  linguistic  groupings.  Increasing  urbanization  in  India  also 
complicates  efforts  at  monitoring  local  conditions.  Only  with 
the  full  support  and  understanding  of  India's  many  rural  and 
urban  residents  will  new  ways  of  focusing  India's  immense 
human  resources  toward  the  goals  of  developing  and  conserv- 
ing renewable  natural  resources,  limiting  population  growth, 
providing  increased  health  care,  and  achieving  education  for 
all  be  successful.

Chapter  3.  Religious  Life

IT  IS  IMPOSSIBLE  TO  KNOW  INDIA  without  understanding 
its  religious  beliefs  and  practices,  which  have  a  large  impact  on 
the  personal  lives  of  most  Indians  and  influence  public  life  on 
a  daily  basis.  Indian  religions  have  deep  historical  roots  that  are 
recollected  by  contemporary  Indians.  The  ancient  culture  of 
South  Asia,  going  back  at  least  4,500  years,  has  come  down  to 
India  primarily  in  the  form  of  religious  texts.  The  artistic  heri- 
tage, as  well  as  intellectual  and  philosophical  contributions,  has 
always  owed  much  to  religious  thought  and  symbolism.  Con- 
tacts between  India  and  other  cultures  have  led  to  the  spread 
of  Indian  religions  throughout  the  world,  resulting  in  the 
extensive  influence  of  Indian  thought  and  practice  on  South- 
east and  East  Asia  in  ancient  times  and,  more  recently,  in  the 
diffusion  of  Indian  religions  to  Europe  and  North  America. 
Within  India,  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  the  vast  majority  of  people 
engage  in  ritual  actions  that  are  motivated  by  religious  systems 
that  owe  much  to  the  past  but  are  continuously  evolving.  Reli- 
gion, then,  is  one  of  the  most  important  facets  of  Indian  his- 
tory and  contemporary  life. 

A  number  of  world  religions  originated  in  India,  and  others 
that  started  elsewhere  found  fertile  ground  for  growth  there. 
Devotees  of  Hinduism,  a  varied  grouping  of  philosophical  and 
devotional  traditions,  officially  numbered  687.6  million  peo- 
ple, or  82  percent  of  the  population  in  the  1991  census  (see 
table  13,  Appendix).  Buddhism  andjainism,  ancient  monastic 
traditions,  have  had  a  major  influence  on  Indian  art,  philoso- 
phy, and  society  and  remain  important  minority  religions  in 
the  late  twentieth  century.  Buddhists  represented  0.8  percent 
of  the  total  population  while  Jains  represented  0.4  percent  in 
1991. 

Islam  spread  from  the  West  throughout  South  Asia,  from  the 
early  eighth  century,  to  become  the  largest  minority  religion  in 
India.  In  fact,  with  101.5  million  Muslims  (12.1  percent  of  the 
population),  India  has  at  least  the  fourth  largest  Muslim  popu- 
lation in  the  world  (after  Indonesia  with  174.3  million,  Pakistan 
with  124  million,  and  Bangladesh  with  103  million;  some  ana- 
lysts put  the  number  of  Indian  Muslims  even  higher — 128  mil- 
lion in  1994,  which  would  give  India  the  second  largest  Muslim 
population  in  the  world).

India:  A  Country  Study 

Sikhism,  which  started  in  Punjab  in  the  sixteenth  century, 
has  spread  throughout  India  and  the  world  since  the  mid-nine- 
teenth century.  With  nearly  16.3  million  adherents,  Sikhs  rep- 
resent 1.9  percent  of  India's  population. 

Christianity,  represented  by  almost  all  denominations,  traces 
its  history  in  India  back  to  the  time  of  the  apostles  and  counted 
19.6  million  members  in  India  in  1991.  Judaism  and  Zoroastri- 
anism,  arriving  originally  with  traders  and  exiles  from  the  West, 
are  represented  by  small  populations,  mostly  concentrated  on 
India's  west  coast.  A  variety  of  independent  tribal  religious 
groups  also  are  lively  carriers  of  unique  ethnic  traditions. 

The  listing  of  the  major  belief  systems  only  scratches  the  sur- 
face of  the  remarkable  diversity  in  Indian  religious  life.  The 
complex  doctrines  and  institutions  of  the  great  traditions,  pre- 
served through  written  documents,  are  divided  into  numerous 
schools  of  thought,  sects,  and  paths  of  devotion.  In  many  cases, 
these  divisions  stem  from  the  teachings  of  great  masters,  who 
arise  continually  to  lead  bands  of  followers  with  a  new  revela- 
tion or  path  to  salvation.  In  contemporary  India,  the  migration 
of  large  numbers  of  people  to  urban  centers  and  the  impact  of 
modernization  have  led  to  the  emergence  of  new  religions, 
revivals,  and  reforms  within  the  great  traditions  that  create 
original  bodies  of  teaching  and  kinds  of  practice.  In  other 
cases,  diversity  appears  through  the  integration  or  accultura- 
tion of  entire  social  groups — each  with  its  own  vision  of  the 
divine — within  the  world  of  village  farming  communities  that 
base  their  culture  on  literary  and  ritual  traditions  preserved  in 
Sanskrit  or  in  regional  languages.  The  local  interaction 
between  great  traditions  and  local  forms  of  worship  and  belief, 
based  on  village,  caste,  tribal,  and  linguistic  differences,  creates 
a  range  of  ritual  forms  and  mythology  that  varies  widely 
throughout  the  country.  Within  this  range  of  differences, 
Indian  religions  have  demonstrated  for  many  centuries  a  con- 
siderable degree  of  tolerance  for  alternate  visions  of  the  divine 
and  of  salvation. 

Religious  tolerance  in  India  finds  expression  in  the  defini- 
tion of  the  nation  as  a  secular  state,  within  which  the  govern- 
ment since  independence  has  officially  remained  separate 
from  any  one  religion,  allowing  all  forms  of  belief  equal  status 
before  the  law.  In  practice  it  has  proven  difficult  to  divide  reli- 
gious affiliation  from  public  life.  In  states  where  the  majority  of 
the  population  embrace  one  religion,  the  boundary  between 
government  and  religion  becomes  permeable;  in  Tamil  Nadu, 


120

for  example,  the  state  government  manages  Hindu  temples, 
while  in  Punjab  an  avowedly  Sikh  political  party  usually  con- 
trols the  state  assembly.  One  of  the  most  notable  features  of 
Indian  politics,  particularly  since  the  1960s,  has  been  the  steady 
growth  of  militant  ideologies  that  see  in  only  one  religious  tra- 
dition the  way  toward  salvation  and  demand  that  public  institu- 
tions conform  to  their  interpretations  of  scripture.  The  vitality 
of  religious  fundamentalism  and  its  impact  on  public  life  in  the 
form  of  riots  and  religion-based  political  parties  have  been 
among  the  greatest  challenges  to  Indian  political  institutions  in 
the  1990s. 

The  Roots  of  Indian  Religion 

The  Vedas  and  Polytheism 

Hinduism  in  India  traces  its  source  to  the  Vedas,  ancient 
hymns  composed  and  recited  in  Punjab  as  early  as  1500  B.C. 
Three  main  collections  of  the  Vedas — the  Rig,  Sama,  and 
Yajur — consist  of  chants  that  were  originally  recited  by  priests 
while  offering  plant  and  animal  sacrifices  in  sacred  fires.  A 
fourth  collection,  the  Atharva  Veda,  contains  a  number  of  for- 
mulas for  requirements  as  varied  as  medical  cures  and  love 
magic.  The  majority  of  modern  Hindus  revere  these  hymns  as 
sacred  sounds  passed  down  to  humanity  from  the  greatest 
antiquity  and  as  the  source  of  Hindu  tradition. 

The  vast  majority  of  Vedic  hymns  are  addressed  to  a  pan- 
theon of  deities  who  are  attracted,  generated,  and  nourished 
by  the  offerings  into  the  sacred  flames  and  the  precisely 
chanted  mantras  (mystical  formulas  of  invocation)  based  on 
the  hymns.  Each  of  these  deities  may  appear  to  be  the  supreme 
god  in  his  or  her  own  hymns,  but  some  gods  stand  out  as  most 
significant.  Indra,  god  of  the  firmament  and  lord  of  the 
weather,  is  the  supreme  deity  of  the  Vedas.  Indra  also  is  a  god  of 
war  who,  accompanied  by  a  host  of  storm  gods,  uses  thunder- 
bolts as  weapons  to  slay  the  serpent  demon  Vritra  (the  name 
means  storm  cloud),  thus  releasing  the  rains  for  the  earth. 
Agni,  the  god  of  fire,  accepts  the  sacrificial  offerings  and  trans- 
mits them  to  all  the  gods.  Varuna  passes  judgment,  lays  down 
the  law,  and  protects  the  cosmic  order.  Yama,  the  god  of  death, 
sends  earthly  dwellers  signs  of  old  age,  sickness,  and  approach- 
ing mortality  as  exhortations  to  lead  a  moral  life.  Surya  is  the 
sun  god,  Chandra  the  moon  god,  Vayu  the  wind  god,  and  Usha 
the  dawn  goddess.

India:  A  Country  Study 

Some  of  the  later  hymns  of  the  Rig  Veda  contain  specula- 
tions that  form  the  basis  for  much  of  Indian  religious  and 
philosophical  thought.  From  one  perspective,  the  universe 
originates  through  the  evolution  of  an  impersonal  force  mani- 
fested as  male  and  female  principles.  Other  hymns  describe  a 
personal  creator,  Prajapati,  the  Lord  of  creatures,  from  whom 
came  the  heavens  and  the  earth  and  all  the  other  gods.  One 
hymn  describes  the  universe  as  emerging  from  the  sacrifice  of  a 
cosmic  man  (purusha)  who  was  the  source  of  all  things  but  who 
was  in  turn  offered  into  the  fire  by  gods.  Within  the  Vedic 
accounts  of  the  origin  of  things,  there  is  a  tension  between 
visions  of  the  highest  reality  as  an  impersonal  force,  or  as  a  cre- 
ator god,  or  as  a  group  of  gods  with  different  jobs  to  do  in  the 
universe.  Much  of  Hinduism  tends  to  accept  all  these  visions 
simultaneously,  claiming  that  they  are  all  valid  as  different  fac- 
ets of  a  single  truth,  or  ranks  them  as  explanations  with  differ- 
ent levels  of  sophistication.  It  is  possible,  however,  to  follow 
only  one  of  these  explanations,  such  as  believing  in  a  single 
personal  god  while  rejecting  all  others,  and  still  claim  to  be  fol- 
lowing the  Vedas.  In  sum,  Hinduism  does  not  exist  as  a  single 
belief  system  with  one  textual  explanation  of  the  origin  of  the 
universe  or  the  nature  of  God,  and  a  wide  range  of  philoso- 
phies and  practices  can  trace  their  beginnings  somewhere  in 
the  hymns  of  the  Vedas. 

By  the  sixth  century  B.C.,  the  Vedic  gods  were  in  decline 
among  the  people,  and  few  people  care  much  for  Indra,  Agni, 
or  Varuna  in  contemporary  India.  These  gods  might  appear  as 
background  characters  in  myths  and  stories  about  more  impor- 
tant deities,  such  as  Shiva  or  Vishnu;  in  some  Hindu  temples, 
there  also  are  small  statues  of  Vedic  deities.  Sacrificial  fire, 
which  once  accompanied  major  political  activities,  such  as  the 
crowning  of  kings  or  the  conquest  of  territory,  still  forms  the 
heart  of  household  rituals  for  many  Hindus,  and  some  Brah- 
man (see  Glossary)  families  pass  down  the  skill  of  memorizing 
the  hymns  and  make  a  living  as  professional  reciters  of  the 
Vedas  (see  Domestic  Worship,  this  ch.).  One  of  the  main  lega- 
cies of  Brahmanical  sacrifice,  seen  even  among  traditions  that 
later  denied  its  usefulness,  was  a  concentration  on  precise  rit- 
ual actions  and  a  belief  in  sacred  sound  as  a  powerful  tool  for 
manifesting  the  sacred  in  daily  life. 

Karma  and  Liberation 

The  Upanishads,  originating  as  commentaries  on  the  Vedas

between  about  800  and  200  B.C.,  contain  speculations  on  the 
meaning  of  existence  that  have  greatly  influenced  Indian  reli- 
gious traditions.  Most  important  is  the  concept  of  atman  (the 
human  soul),  which  is  an  individual  manifestation  of  brahman 
(see  Glossary) .  Atman  is  of  the  same  nature  as  brahman,  charac- 
terized either  as  an  impersonal  force  or  as  God,  and  has  as  its 
goal  the  recognition  of  identity  with  brahman.  This  fusion  is  not 
possible,  however,  as  long  as  the  individual  remains  bound  to 
the  world  of  the  flesh  and  desires.  In  fact,  the  deathless  atman 
that  is  so  bound  will  not  join  with  brahman  after  the  death  of 
the  body  but  will  experience  continuous  rebirth.  This  funda- 
mental concept  of  the  transmigration  of  atman,  or  reincarna- 
tion after  death,  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  religions  emerging 
from  India. 

Indian  religious  tradition  sees  karma  (see  Glossary)  as  the 
source  of  the  problem  of  transmigration.  While  associated  with 


123 


India:  A  Country  Study 

physical  form,  for  example,  in  a  human  body,  beings  experi- 
ence the  universe  through  their  senses  and  their  minds  and 
attach  themselves  to  the  people  and  things  around  them  and 
constantly  lose  sight  of  their  true  existence  as  atman,  which  is  of 
the  same  nature  as  brahman.  As  the  time  comes  for  the  drop- 
ping of  the  body,  the  fruits  of  good  and  evil  actions  in  the  past 
remain  with  atman,  clinging  to  it,  causing  a  tendency  to  con- 
tinue experience  in  other  existences  after  death.  Good  deeds 
in  this  life  may  lead  to  a  happy  rebirth  in  a  better  life,  and  evil 
deeds  may  lead  to  a  lower  existence,  but  eventually  the  conse- 
quences of  past  deeds  will  be  worked  out,  and  the  individual 
will  seek  more  experiences  in  a  physical  world.  In  this  manner, 
the  bound  or  ignorant  atman  wanders  from  life  to  life,  in  heav- 
ens and  hells  and  in  many  different  bodies.  The  universe  may 
expand  and  be  destroyed  numerous  times,  but  the  bound 
atman  vAW  not  achieve  release. 

The  true  goal  of  atman  is  liberation,  or  release  (moksha), 
from  the  limited  world  of  experience  and  realization  of  one- 
ness with  God  or  the  cosmos.  In  order  to  achieve  release,  the 
individual  must  pursue  a  kind  of  discipline  (yoga,  a  "tying," 
related  to  the  English  word  yoke)  that  is  appropriate  to  one's 
abilities  and  station  in  life.  For  most  people,  this  goal  means  a 
course  of  action  that  keeps  them  rather  closely  tied  to  the 
world  and  its  ways,  including  the  enjoyment  of  love  (kama),  the 
attainment  of  wealth  and  power  (artha),  and  the  following  of 
socially  acceptable  ethical  principles  (dharma — see  Glossary). 
From  this  perspective,  even  manuals  on  sexual  love,  such  as  the 
Kama  Sutra  (Book  of  Love),  or  collections  of  ideas  on  politics 
and  governance,  such  as  the  Arthashastra  (Science  of  Material 
Gain),  are  part  of  a  religious  tradition  that  values  action  in  the 
world  as  long  as  it  is  performed  with  understanding,  a  karma- 
yoga  or  selfless  discipline  of  action  in  which  every  action  is 
offered  as  a  sacrifice  to  God.  Some  people,  however,  may  be 
interested  in  breaking  the  cycle  of  rebirth  in  this  life  or  soon 
thereafter.  For  them,  a  wide  range  of  techniques  has  evolved 
over  the  thousands  of  years  that  gives  Indian  religion  its  great 
diversity.  The  discipline  that  involves  physical  positioning  of 
the  body  (hatha-yoga),  which  is  most  commonly  equated  with 
yoga  outside  of  India,  sees  the  human  body  as  a  series  of  spiri- 
tual centers  that  can  be  awakened  through  meditation  and 
exercise,  leading  eventually  to  a  oneness  with  the  universe. 
Tantrism  is  the  belief  in  the  Tantra  (from  the  Sanskrit,  context 
or  continuum),  a  collection  of  texts  that  stress  the  usefulness  of 


124 


Religious  Life 


rituals,  carried  out  with  a  strict  discipline,  as  a  means  for  attain- 
ing understanding  and  spiritual  awakening.  These  rituals 
include  chanting  powerful  mantras;  meditating  on  compli- 
cated or  auspicious  diagrams  (mandalas);  and,  for  one  school 
of  advanced  practitioners,  deliberately  violating  social  norms 
on  food,  drink,  and  sexual  relations. 

A  central  aspect  of  all  religious  discipline,  regardless  of  its 
emphasis,  is  the  importance  of  the  guru,  or  teacher.  Indian 
religion  may  accept  the  sacredness  of  specific  texts  and  rituals 
but  stresses  interpretation  by  a  living  practitioner  who  has  per- 
sonal experience  of  liberation  and  can  pass  down  successful 
techniques  to  devoted  followers.  In  fact,  since  Vedic  times,  it 
has  never  been  possible,  and  has  rarely  been  desired,  to  unite 
all  people  in  India  under  one  concept  of  orthodoxy  with  a  sin- 
gle authority  that  could  be  presented  to  everyone.  Instead, 
there  has  been  a  tendency  to  accept  religious  innovation  and 
diversity  as  the  natural  result  of  personal  experience  by  succes- 
sive generations  of  gurus,  who  have  tailored  their  messages  to 
particular  times,  places,  and  peoples,  and  then  passed  down 
their  knowledge  to  lines  of  disciples  and  social  groups.  As  a 
result,  Indian  religion  is  a  mass  of  ancient  and  modern  tradi- 
tions, some  always  preserved  and  some  constantly  changing, 
and  the  individual  is  relatively  free  to  stress  in  his  or  her  life  the 
beliefs  and  religious  behaviors  that  seem  most  effective  on  the 
path  to  deliverance. 

The  Monastic  Path 

By  about  500  B.C.,  some  teachers  had  moved  so  far  down  the 
path  of  liberation  that  they  no  longer  viewed  the  standard  per- 
ception of  life  in  the  social  world  as  valid  for  the  dedicated  spir- 
itual  devotee.  They  formed  communities  of  religious 
renunciants  (shramanas)  who  withdrew  from  the  world  and 
evolved  a  full-time  monastic  discipline.  The  most  successful  of 
these  early  communities,  the  Jains  (or,  in  Sanskrit,  Jaina)  and 
the  Buddhists,  rejected  the  value  of  the  Vedas  and  created  inde- 
pendent textual  traditions  based  on  the  words  and  examples  of 
their  early  teachers,  eventually  evolving  entirely  new  ways  for 
interacting  with  the  lay  community. 

Jainism 

The  oldest  continuous  monastic  tradition  in  India  is  Jainism, 
the  path  of  the  Jinas,  or  victors.  This  tradition  is  traced  to  Var- 


125 


India:  A  Country  Study 

dhamana  Mahavira  (The  Great  Hero;  ca.  599-527  B.C.),  the 
twenty-fourth  and  last  of  the  Tirthankaras  (Sanskrit  for  ford- 
makers).  According  to  legend,  Mahavira  was  born  to  a  ruling 
family  in  the  town  of  Vaishali,  located  in  the  modern  state  of 
Bihar.  At  the  age  of  thirty,  he  renounced  his  wealthy  life  and 
devoted  himself  to  fasting  and  self-mortification  in  order  to 
purify  his  consciousness  and  discover  the  meaning  of  exist- 
ence. He  never  again  dwelt  in  a  house,  owned  property,  or 
wore  clothing  of  any  sort.  Following  the  example  of  the  teacher 
Parshvanatha  (ninth  century  B.C.),  he  attained  enlightenment 
and  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  meditating  and  teaching  a  dedi- 
cated group  of  disciples  who  formed  a  monastic  order  follow- 
ing rules  he  laid  down.  His  life's  work  complete,  he  entered  a 
final  fast  and  deliberately  died  of  starvation. 

The  ancient  belief  system  of  the  Jains  rests  on  a  concrete 
understanding  of  the  working  of  karma,  its  effects  on  the  living 
soul  (jiva),  and  the  conditions  for  extinguishing  action  and  the 
soul's  release.  According  to  the  Jain  view,  the  soul  is  a  living 
substance  that  combines  with  various  kinds  of  nonliving  matter 
and  through  action  accumulates  particles  of  matter  that  adhere 
to  it  and  determine  its  fate.  Most  of  the  matter  perceptible  to 
human  senses,  including  all  animals  and  plants,  is  attached  in 
various  degrees  to  living  souls  and  is  in  this  sense  alive.  Any 
action  has  consequences  that  necessarily  follow  the  embodied 
soul,  but  the  worst  accumulations  of  matter  come  from  vio- 
lence against  other  living  beings.  The  ultimate  Jain  discipline, 
therefore,  rests  on  complete  inactivity  and  absolute  nonvio- 
lence (ahimsa)  against  any  living  beings.  Some  Jain  monks  and 
nuns  wear  face  masks  to  avoid  accidently  inhaling  small  organ- 
isms, and  all  practicing  believers  try  to  remain  vegetarians. 
Extreme  renunciation,  including  the  refusal  of  all  food,  lies  at 
the  heart  of  a  discipline  that  purges  the  mind  and  body  of  all 
desires  and  actions  and,  in  the  process,  burns  off  the  conse- 
quences of  actions  performed  in  the  past.  In  this  sense,  Jain 
renunciants  may  recognize  or  revere  deities,  but  they  do  not 
view  the  Vedas  as  sacred  texts  and  instead  concentrate  on  the 
atheistic,  individual  quest  for  purification  and  removal  of 
karma.  The  final  goal  is  the  extinguishing  of  self,  a  "blowing 
out"  (nirvana)  of  the  individual  self. 

By  the  first  century  A.D.,  the  Jain  community  evolved  into 
two  main  divisions  based  on  monastic  discipline:  the  Digam- 
bara  or  "sky-clad"  monks  who  wear  no  clothes,  own  nothing, 
and  collect  donated  food  in  their  hands;  and  the  Svetambara

or  "white-clad"  monks  and  nuns  who  wear  white  robes  and 
carry  bowls  for  donated  food.  The  Digambara  do  not  accept 
the  possibility  of  women  achieving  liberation,  while  the  Svetam- 
bara  do.  Western  and  southern  India  have  been  Jain  strong- 
holds for  many  centuries;  laypersons  have  typically  formed 
minority  communities  concentrated  primarily  in  urban  areas 
and  in  mercantile  occupations.  In  the  mid-1990s,  there  were 
about  7  million  Jains,  the  majority  of  whom  live  in  the  states  of 
Maharashtra  (mostly  the  city  of  Bombay,  or  Mumbai  in 
Marathi),  Rajasthan,  and  Gujarat  (see  Structure  and  Dynamics, 
ch.  2).  Karnataka,  traditionally  a  stronghold  of  Digambaras, 
has  a  sizable  Jain  community. 

The  Jain  laity  engage  in  a  number  of  ritual  activities  that 
resemble  those  of  the  Hindus  around  them  (see  The  Ceremo- 
nies of  Hinduism,  this  ch.).  Special  shrines  in  residences  or  in 
public  temples  include  images  of  the  Tirthankaras,  who  are  not

worshiped  but  remembered  and  revered;  other  shrines  house 
the  gods  who  are  more  properly  invoked  to  intercede  with 
worldly  problems.  Daily  rituals  may  include  meditation  and 
bathing;  bathing  the  images;  offering  food,  flowers,  and 
lighted  lamps  for  the  images;  and  reciting  mantras  in 
Ardhamagadhi,  an  ancient  language  of  northeast  India  related 
to  Sanskrit.  Many  Jain  laity  engage  in  sacramental  ceremonies 
during  life-cycle  rituals,  such  as  the  first  taking  of  solid  food, 
marriage,  and  death,  resembling  those  enacted  by  Hindus. 
Jains  may  also  worship  local  gods  and  participate  in  local 
Hindu  or  Muslim  celebrations  without  compromising  their 
fundamental  devotion  to  the  path  of  the  Jinas.  The  most 
important  festivals  of  Jainism  celebrate  the  five  major  events  in 
the  life  of  Mahavira:  conception,  birth,  renunciation,  enlight- 
enment, and  final  release  at  death. 

At  a  number  of  pilgrimage  sites  associated  with  great  teach- 
ers of  Jainism,  the  gifts  of  wealthy  donors  made  possible  the 
building  of  architectural  wonders.  Shatrunjaya  Hills  (Siddha- 
giri)  in  Gujarat  is  a  major  Svetambara  site,  an  entire  city  of 
about  3,500  temples.  Mount  Abu  in  Rajasthan,  with  one  Digam- 
bara  and  five  Svetambara  temples,  is  the  site  of  some  of  India's 
greatest  architecture,  dating  from  the  eleventh  through  thir- 
teenth centuries  A.D.  In  Karnataka,  on  the  hill  of  Sravana  Bel- 
gola,  stands  the  monolithic  seventeen-meter-high  statue  of  the 
naked  Bhagwan  Bahubali  (Gomateshvara),  the  first  person  in 
the  world  believed  by  the  faithful  to  have  attained  enlighten- 
ment, so  deep  in  meditation  that  vines  are  growing  around  his 
legs.  At  this  site  every  twelve  years,  a  major  concourse  of  Jain 
ascetics  and  laity  participate  in  a  purification  ceremony  in 
which  the  statue  is  anointed  from  head  to  toe.  Carved  in  981, 
the  statue  is  considered  the  holiest  Jain  shrine.  In  addition  to 
its  lavish  patronage  of  shrines,  the  Jain  community,  with  its 
long  scriptural  tradition  and  wealth  gained  from  trade,  has 
always  been  known  for  its  philanthropy  and  especially  for  its 
support  of  education  and  learning.  Prestigious  Jain  schools  are 
located  in  most  major  cities.  The  largest  concentrations  of  Jains 
are  in  Maharashtra  (more  than  965,000)  and  Rajasthan  (nearly 
563,000),  with  sizable  numbers  also  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya 
Pradesh. 

Buddhism 

Buddhism  began  with  the  life  of  Siddhartha  Gautama  (ca. 
563-483  B.C.),  a  prince  from  the  small  Shakya  Kingdom 


128

located  in  the  foothills  of  the  Himalayas  in  Nepal.  Brought  up 
in  luxury,  the  prince  abandoned  his  home  and  wandered  forth 
as  a  religious  beggar,  searching  for  the  meaning  of  existence. 
The  stories  of  his  search  presuppose  the  Jain  tradition,  as 
Gautama  was  for  a  time  a  practitioner  of  intense  austerity,  at 
one  point  almost  starving  himself  to  death.  He  decided,  how- 
ever, that  self-torture  weakened  his  mind  while  failing  to 
advance  him  to  enlightenment  and  therefore  turned  to  a 
milder  style  of  renunciation  and  concentrated  on  advanced 
meditation  techniques.  Eventually,  under  a  tree  in  the  forests 
of  Gaya  (in  modern  Bihar),  he  resolved  to  stir  no  farther  until 
he  had  solved  the  mystery  of  existence.  Breaking  through  the 
final  barriers,  he  achieved  the  knowledge  that  he  later 
expressed  as  the  Four  Noble  Truths:  all  of  life  is  suffering;  the 
cause  of  suffering  is  desire;  the  end  of  desire  leads  to  the  end  of 
suffering;  and  the  means  to  end  desire  is  a  path  of  discipline

and  meditation.  Gautama  was  now  the  Buddha,  or  the  awak- 
ened one,  and  he  spent  the  remainder  of  his  life  traveling 
about  northeast  India  converting  large  numbers  of  disciples.  At 
the  age  of  eighty,  the  Buddha  achieved  his  final  passing  away 
(parinirvana)  and  died,  leaving  a  thriving  monastic  order  and  a 
dedicated  lay  community  to  continue  his  work. 

By  the  third  century  B.C.,  the  still-young  religion  based  on 
the  Buddha's  teachings  was  being  spread  throughout  South 
Asia  through  the  agency  of  the  Mauryan  Empire  (ca.  326-184 
B.C.;  see  The  Mauryan  Empire,  ch.  1).  By  the  seventh  century 
A.D.,  having  spread  throughout  East  Asia  and  Southeast  Asia, 
Buddhism  probably  had  the  largest  religious  following  in  the 
world. 

For  centuries  Indian  royalty  and  merchants  patronized  Bud- 
dhist monasteries  and  raised  beautiful,  hemispherical  stone 
structures  called  stupas  over  the  relics  of  the  Buddha  in  rever- 
ence to  his  memory.  Since  the  1840s,  archaeology  has  revealed 
the  huge  impact  of  Buddhist  art,  iconography,  and  architecture 
in  India.  The  monastery  complex  at  Nalanda  in  Bihar,  in  ruins 
in  1993,  was  a  world  center  for  Buddhist  philosophy  and  reli- 
gion until  the  thirteenth  century.  But  by  the  thirteenth  cen- 
tury, when  Turkic  invaders  destroyed  the  remaining 
monasteries  on  the  plains,  Buddhism  as  an  organized  religion 
had  practically  disappeared  from  India.  It  survived  only  in  Bhu- 
tan and  Sikkim,  both  of  which  were  then  independent  Hima- 
layan kingdoms;  among  tribal  groups  in  the  mountains  of 
northeast  India;  and  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  reasons  for  this  disap- 
pearance are  unclear,  and  they  are  many:  shifts  in  royal  patron- 
age from  Buddhist  to  Hindu  religious  institutions;  a  constant 
intellectual  struggle  with  dynamic  Hindu  intellectual  schools, 
which  eventually  triumphed;  and  slow  adoption  of  popular  reli- 
gious forms  by  Buddhists  while  Hindu  monastic  communities 
grew  up  with  the  same  style  of  discipline  as  the  Buddhists,  lead- 
ing to  the  slow  but  steady  amalgamation  of  ideas  and  trends  in 
the  two  religions. 

Buddhism  began  a  steady  and  dramatic  comeback  in  India 
during  the  early  twentieth  century,  spurred  on  originally  by  a 
combination  of  European  antiquarian  and  philosophical  inter- 
est and  the  dedicated  activities  of  a  few  Indian  devotees.  The 
foundation  of  the  Mahabodhi  Society  (Society  of  Great 
Enlightenment)  in  1891,  originally  as  a  force  to  wrest  control 
of  the  Buddhist  shrine  at  Gaya  from  the  hands  of  Hindu  man- 


130 


Religious  Life 


agers,  gave  a  large  stimulus  to  the  popularization  of  Buddhist 
philosophy  and  the  importance  of  the  religion  in  India's  past. 

A  major  breakthrough  occurred  in  1956  after  some  thirty 
years  of  Untouchable,  or  Dalit  (see  Glossary),  agitation  when 
Bhimrao  Ramji  (B.R.)  Ambedkar,  leader  of  the  Untouchable 
wing  within  the  Congress  (see  Glossary),  announced  that  he 
was  converting  to  Buddhism  as  a  way  to  escape  from  the  imped- 
iments of  the  Hindu  caste  system  (see  Varna,  Caste,  and  Other 
Divisions,  ch.  5).  He  brought  with  him  masses  of  Untouch- 
ables— also  known  as  Harijans  (see  Glossary)  or  Dalits — and 
members  of  Scheduled  Castes  (see  Glossary),  who  mostly  came 
from  Maharashtra  and  border  areas  of  neighboring  states  and 
from  the  Agra  area  in  Uttar  Pradesh.  By  the  early  1990s,  there 
were  more  than  5  million  Buddhists  in  Maharashtra,  or  79  per- 
cent of  the  entire  Buddhist  community  in  India,  almost  all 
recent  converts  from  low  castes.  When  added  to  longtime  Bud- 
dhist populations  in  hill  areas  of  northeast  India  (West  Bengal, 
Assam,  Sikkim,  Mizoram,  and  Tripura)  and  high  Himalayan 
valleys  (Ladakh  District  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Himachal 
Pradesh,  and  northern  Uttar  Pradesh),  and  to  the  influx  of 
Tibetan  Buddhist  refugees  who  fled  from  Tibet  with  the  Dalai 
Lama  in  1959  and  thereafter,  the  recent  converts  raised  the 
number  of  Buddhists  in  India  to  6.4  million  by  1991.  This  was  a 
35.9  percent  increase  since  1981  and  made  Buddhism  the  fifth 
largest  religious  group  in  the  country. 

The  forms  of  Buddhism  practiced  by  Himalayan  communi- 
ties and  Tibetan  refugees  are  part  of  the  Vajrayana,  or  "Way  of 
the  Lightning  Bolt,"  that  developed  after  the  seventh  century 
A.D.  as  part  of  Mahayana  (Great  Path)  Buddhism.  Although 
retaining  the  fundamental  importance  of  individual  spiritual 
advancement,  the  Vajrayana  stresses  the  intercession  of  bodhi- 
sattvas,  or  enlightened  beings,  who  remain  in  this  world  to  aid 
others  on  the  path.  Until  the  twentieth  century,  the  Himalayan 
kingdoms  supported  a  hierarchy  in  which  Buddhist  monks, 
some  identified  from  birth  as  bodhisattvas,  occupied  the  high- 
est positions  in  society. 

Most  other  Buddhists  in  India  follow  Theravada  Buddhism, 
the  "Doctrine  of  the  Elders,"  which  traces  its  origin  through  Sri 
Lankan  and  Burmese  traditions  to  scriptures  in  the  Pali  lan- 
guage, a  Sanskritic  dialect  in  eastern  India.  Although  replete 
with  miraculous  events  and  legends,  these  scriptures  stress  a 
more  human  Buddha  and  a  democratic  path  toward  enlighten- 
ment for  everyone.  Ambedkar's  plan  for  the  expanding  Bud- 


131 


India:  A  Country  Study 

dhist  congregation  in  India  visualized  Buddhist  monks  and 
nuns  developing  themselves  through  service  to  others.  Convert 
communities,  by  embracing  Buddhism,  have  embarked  on 
social  transformations,  including  a  decline  in  alcoholism,  a 
simplification  of  marriage  ceremonies  and  abolition  of  ruinous 
marriage  expenses,  a  greater  emphasis  on  education,  and  a 
heightened  sense  of  identity  and  self-worth. 

The  Tradition  of  the  Enlightened  Master 

A  number  of  avowedly  Hindu  monastic  communities  have 
grown  up  over  time  and  adopted  some  of  the  characteristics 
associated  with  early  Buddhism  and  Jainism,  while  remaining 
dedicated  to  the  Hindu  philosophical  traditions.  One  of  the 
oldest  and  most  respected  of  the  Hindu  orders  traces  its  origin 
to  the  teacher  Shankara  (788-820),  believed  by  many  devotees 
to  have  lived  hundreds  of  years  earlier.  Shankara's  philosophy 
is  a  primary  source  of  Vedanta,  or  the  "End  of  the  Veda,"  the 
final  commentary  on  revealed  truth,  which  is  one  of  the  most 
influential  trends  in  modern  Hinduism.  His  interpretation  of 
the  Upanishads  portrays  brahman  as  absolutely  one  and  without 
qualities.  The  phenomenal  world  is  illusion  (maya),  which  the 
embodied  soul  must  transcend  in  order  to  achieve  oneness 
with  brahman.  As  a  wandering  monk,  Shankara  traveled 
throughout  India,  combating  Buddhist  atheism  and  founding 
five  seats  of  learning  at  Badrinath  (Uttar  Pradesh),  Dwaraka 
(Gujarat),  Puri  (Orissa),  Sringeri  (Karnataka),  and  Kan- 
chipuram  (Tamil  Nadu).  In  the  1990s,  those  seats  are  still  held 
by  successors  to  Shankara's  philosophy  (Shankara  Acharyas), 
who  head  an  order  of  orange-clad  monks  that  is  highly 
respected  by  the  Hindu  community  throughout  India.  Activi- 
ties of  the  acharyas,  including  their  periodic  trips  away  from 
their  home  monasteries  to  visit  and  preach  to  devotees,  receive 
exposure  in  regional  and  national  media.  Their  conservative 
viewpoints  and  pronouncements  on  a  variety  of  topics, 
although  not  binding  on  most  believers,  attract  considerable 
public  attention. 

The  initiation  of  a  renunciant  usually  depends  on  the  judg- 
ment of  an  acharya  who  determines  whether  a  candidate  is  ded- 
icated and  prepared  or  not;  he  then  gives  to  the  disciple 
training  and  instructions  including  the  initiate's  own  secret  for- 
mula or  mantra.  After  initiation,  the  disciple  may  remain  with 
his  teacher  or  in  a  monastery  for  an  indefinite  period  or  may 
wander  forth  in  a  variety  of  careers.  The  Ramanandi  order  in 


132 


Religious  Life 


North  India,  for  example,  includes  holy  men  (sadhus)  who 
practice  ascetic  disciplines,  militant  members  of  fortified  tem- 
ples, and  priests  in  charge  of  temple  administration  and  ritual. 

There  are  other  orders  of  renunciants  who  lead  still  more 
austere  existences,  including  naked  ascetics  who  wander  beg- 
ging for  their  food  and  assemble  for  spectacular  parades  at 
major  festivals.  A  few  dedicated  seekers  still  withdraw  to  the 
fastness  of  the  Himalayas  or  other  remote  spots  and  work  on 
their  meditation  and  yoga  in  total  obscurity.  Others  beg  in  pop- 
ulated areas,  sometimes  engaging  in  fierce  austerities  such  as 
piercing  their  bodies  with  pins  and  knives.  They  are  a  reminder 
to  all  people  that  the  path  of  renunciation  waits  for  anyone 
who  has  the  dedication  and  the  courage  to  leave  the  world 
behind. 

Another  kind  of  renunciation  appears  in  the  cult  of  Sai 
Baba,  who  achieved  national  and  international  fame  in  the 
twentieth  century.  The  first  person  known  by  this  name  was  a 
holy  man — Sai  Baba  (died  1918) — who  appeared  in  1872  in 
Maharashtra  and  lived  a  humble  life  that  blended  meditation 
and  devotional  techniques  from  a  variety  of  sources.  This  saint 
has  a  small  but  dedicated  following  throughout  India.  A  later 
incarnation  was  Satya  Sai  Baba  (satya  means  true),  born  in 
1926  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  At  age  thirteen,  he  experienced  the 
first  of  several  seizures  that  resulted  in  a  changed  personality 
and  intense  devotional  activity,  leading  to  his  statement  that  he 
is  the  second  incarnation  of  Sai  Baba.  By  1950  he  had  set  up  a 
retreat  at  Puttaparti  in  what  later  became  Andhra  Pradesh  and 
was  accepting  disciples.  His  fame  spread  along  with  numerous 
apocryphal  stories  of  his  ability  to  perform  miracles,  including 
the  manifestation  of  sacred  ash  and,  according  to  some 
accounts,  watches  or  other  objects,  from  thin  air  or  from  his 
own  body.  The  cult  has  expanded  to  include  publishing,  social 
service,  and  education  institutions  and  includes  an  interna- 
tional association  of  thousands  of  believers.  Devotion  to  Satya 
Sai  Baba  does  not  preclude  attachment  to  other  religious 
observances  but  concentrates  instead  on  worship  and  venera- 
tion of  the  holy  man  himself,  often  in  the  form  of  a  photo- 
graph. Thousands  of  pilgrims  have  traveled  to  his  retreat 
annually  to  participate  in  group  activities,  obtain  mementos, 
and  perhaps  a  view  of  the  teacher  himself. 

The  Worship  of  Personal  Gods 

For  the  vast  majority  of  Hindus,  the  most  important  religious 


133 


India:  A  Country  Study 

path  is  bhakti  (devotion)  to  personal  gods.  There  are  a  wide 
variety  of  gods  to  choose  from,  and  although  sectarian  adher- 
ence to  particular  deities  is  often  strong,  there  is  a  widespread 
acceptance  of  choice  in  the  desired  god  (ishta  devata)  as  the 
most  appropriate  focus  for  any  particular  person.  Most  devo- 
tees are  therefore  polytheists,  worshiping  all  or  part  of  the  vast 
pantheon  of  deities,  some  of  whom  have  come  down  from 
Vedic  times.  In  practice,  a  worshiper  tends  to  concentrate 
prayers  on  one  deity  or  on  a  small  group  of  deities  with  whom 
there  is  a  close  personal  relationship. 

Puja  (worship)  of  the  gods  consists  of  a  range  of  ritual  offer- 
ings and  prayers  typically  performed  either  daily  or  on  special 
days  before  an  image  of  the  deity,  which  may  be  in  the  form  of 
a  person  or  a  symbol  of  the  sacred  presence.  In  its  more  devel- 
oped forms,  puja  consists  of  a  series  of  ritual  stages  beginning 
with  personal  purification  and  invocation  of  the  god,  followed 
by  offerings  of  flowers,  food,  or  other  objects  such  as  clothing, 
accompanied  by  fervent  prayers.  Some  dedicated  worshipers 
perform  these  ceremonies  daily  at  their  home  shrines;  others 
travel  to  one  or  more  temples  to  perform  puja,  alone  or  with 
the  aid  of  temple  priests  who  receive  offerings  and  present 
these  offerings  to  the  gods.  The  gifts  given  to  the  gods  become 
sacred  through  contact  with  their  images  or  with  their  shrines, 
and  may  be  received  and  used  by  worshipers  as  the  grace  (pras- 
add)  of  the  divine.  Sacred  ash  or  saffron  powder,  for  example, 
is  often  distributed  after  puja  and  smeared  on  the  foreheads  of 
devotees.  In  the  absence  of  any  of  these  ritual  objects,  however, 
puja  may  take  the  form  of  a  simple  prayer  sent  toward  the 
image  of  the  divine,  and  it  is  common  to  see  people  stop  for  a 
moment  before  roadside  shrines  to  fold  their  hands  and  offer 
short  invocations  to  the  gods. 

Since  at  least  the  seventh  century  A.D.,  the  devotional  path 
has  spread  from  the  south  throughout  India  through  the  liter- 
ary and  musical  activities  of  saints  who  have  been  some  of  the 
most  important  representatives  of  regional  languages  and  tra- 
ditions. The  hymns  of  these  saints  and  their  successors,  mostly 
in  vernacular  forms,  are  memorized  and  performed  at  all  levels 
of  society.  Every  state  in  India  has  its  own  bhakti  tradition  and 
poets  who  are  studied  and  revered.  In  Tamil  Nadu,  groups 
called  Nayanmars  (devotees  of  Shiva)  and  Alvars  (devotees  of 
Vishnu)  were  composing  beautiful  poetry  in  the  Tamil  lan- 
guage as  early  as  the  sixth  century.  In  Bengal  one  of  the  great- 
est poets  was  Chaitanya  (1485-1536),  who  spent  much  of  his

life  in  a  state  of  mystical  ecstasy.  One  of  the  greatest  North 
Indian  saints  was  Kabir  (ca.  1440-1518),  a  common  leather- 
worker  who  stressed  faith  in  God  without  devotion  to  images, 
rituals,  or  scriptures.  Among  female  poets,  Princess  Mirabai 
(ca.  1498-1546)  from  Rajasthan  stands  out  as  one  whose  love 
for  Krishna  was  so  intense  that  she  suffered  persecution  for  her 
public  singing  and  dancing  for  the  lord. 

A  recurring  motif  that  emerges  from  the  poetry  and  the 
hagiographies  of  these  saints  is  the  equality  of  all  men  and 
women  before  God  and  the  ability  of  people  from  all  castes  and 
occupations  to  find  their  way  to  union  with  God  if  they  have 
enough  faith  and  devotion.  In  this  sense,  the  bhakti  tradition 
serves  as  one  of  the  equalizing  forces  in  Indian  society  and  cul- 
ture. 

Vishnu 

As  one  of  the  most  important  gods  in  the  Hindu  pantheon, 
Vishnu  is  surrounded  by  a  number  of  extremely  popular  and 
well-known  stories  and  is  the  focus  of  a  number  of  sects 
devoted  entirely  to  his  worship.  Vishnu  contains  a  number  of 
personalities,  often  represented  as  ten  major  descents  (avatars) 
in  which  the  god  has  taken  on  physical  forms  in  order  to  save 
earthly  creatures  from  destruction.  In  one  story,  the  earth  was 


135 


India:  A  Country  Study 

drowning  in  a  huge  flood,  so  to  save  it  Vishnu  took  on  the  body 
of  a  giant  turtle  and  lifted  the  earth  on  his  back  out  of  the 
waters.  A  tale  found  in  the  Vedas  describes  a  demon  who  could 
not  be  conquered.  Responding  to  the  pleas  of  the  gods,  Vishnu 
appeared  before  the  demon  as  a  dwarf.  The  demon,  in  a  classic 
instance  of  pride,  underestimated  this  dwarf  and  granted  him 
as  much  of  the  world  as  he  could  tread  in  three  steps.  Vishnu 
then  assumed  his  universal  form  and  in  three  strides  spanned 
the  entire  universe  and  beyond,  crushing  the  demon  in  the 
process. 

The  incarnation  of  Vishnu  known  to  almost  everyone  in 
India  is  his  life  as  Ram  (Rama  in  Sanskrit),  a  prince  from  the 
ancient  north  Indian  kingdom  of  Ayodhya,  in  the  cycle  of  sto- 
ries known  as  the  Ramayana  (The  Travels  of  Ram).  On  one 
level,  this  is  a  classic  adventure  story,  as  Ram  is  exiled  from  the 
kingdom  and  has  to  wander  in  the  forests  of  southern  India 
with  his  beautiful  wife  Sita  and  his  loyal  younger  brother  Lak- 
shman.  After  many  adventures,  during  which  Ram  befriends 
the  king  of  the  monkey  kingdom  and  joins  forces  with  the 
great  monkey  hero  Hanuman,  the  demon  king  Ravana  kidnaps 
Sita  and  takes  her  to  his  fortress  on  the  island  of  Lanka  (mod- 
ern Sri  Lanka).  A  huge  war  then  ensues,  as  Ram  with  his  ani- 
mal allies  attacks  the  demons,  destroys  them  all,  and  returns  in 
triumph  to  North  India  to  occupy  his  lawful  throne.  Village  sto- 
rytellers, street  theater  players,  the  movies,  and  the  national 
television  network  all  have  their  versions  of  this  story.  In  many 
parts  of  the  country,  but  especially  in  North  India,  the  annual 
festival  of  Dussehra  celebrates  Ram's  adventures  and  his  final 
triumph  and  includes  the  public  burning  of  huge  effigies  of 
Ravana  at  the  end  of  several  days  of  parties.  Everyone  knows 
that  Ram  is  really  Vishnu,  who  came  down  to  rid  the  earth  of 
the  demons  and  set  up  an  ideal  kingdom  of  righteousness — 
Ram  Raj — which  stands  as  an  ideal  in  contemporary  India.  Sita 
is  in  reality  his  consort,  the  goddess  Lakshmi,  the  ideal  of  femi- 
nine beauty  and  devotion  to  her  husband.  Lakshmi,  also 
known  as  Shri,  eventually  became  the  goddess  of  fortune,  sur- 
plus, and  happiness.  Hanuman,  as  the  faithful  sidekick  with 
great  physical  and  magical  powers,  is  one  of  the  most  beloved 
images  in  the  Hindu  pantheon  with  temples  of  his  own 
throughout  the  country. 

Another  widely  known  incarnation  is  Krishna.  In  the  Maha- 
bharata  (Great  Battle  of  the  Descendants  of  Bharata),  the 
gigantic,  multivolume  epic  of  ancient  North  Indian  kingdoms,

Religious  Life 


Krishna  appears  as  the  ruler  of  one  of  the  many  states  allied 
either  with  the  heroic  Pandava  brothers  or  with  their  treacher- 
ous cousins,  the  Kauravas.  Bharata  was  an  ancient  king  whose 
achievements  are  celebrated  in  the  Mahabharata  and  from 
whose  name  derives  one  of  the  names  for  modern  India,  that  is 
Bharat.  During  the  final  battle,  Krishna  serves  as  charioteer  for 
the  hero  Arjuna,  and  before  the  fighting  starts  he  bolsters 
Arjuna's  faltering  will  to  fight  against  his  kin.  Krishna  reveals 
himself  as  Vishnu,  the  supreme  godhead,  who  has  set  up  the 
entire  conflict  to  cleanse  the  earth  of  evildoers  according  to  his 
inscrutable  will.  This  section  of  the  epic,  the  Bhagavad  Gita,  or 
Song  of  the  Lord,  is  one  of  the  great  jewels  of  world  religious 
literature  and  of  central  importance  in  modern  Hinduism. 
One  of  its  main  themes  is  karma-yoga,  or  selfless  discipline  in 
offering  all  of  one's  allotted  tasks  in  life  as  a  devotion  to  God 
and  without  attachment  to  consequences.  The  true  reality  is 
the  soul  that  neither  slays  nor  is  slain  and  that  can  rejoin  God 
through  selfless  dedication  and  through  Krishna's  saving  grace. 

A  completely  different  cycle  of  stories  portrays  Krishna  as  a 
young  cowherd,  growing  up  in  the  country  after  he  was  saved 
from  an  evil  uncle  who  coveted  his  kingdom.  In  this  incarna- 
tion, Krishna  often  appears  as  a  happy,  roly-poly  infant,  well 
known  for  his  pranks  and  thefts  of  butter.  Although  his  ene- 
mies send  evil  agents  to  destroy  him,  the  baby  miraculously  sur- 
vives their  attacks  and  kills  his  demonic  assailants.  Later,  as  he 
grows  into  an  adolescent,  he  continues  to  perform  miracles 
such  as  saving  the  cowherds  and  their  flocks  from  a  dangerous 
storm  by  holding  up  a  mountain  over  their  heads  until  the 
weather  clears.  His  most  striking  exploits,  however,  are  his 
affairs  as  a  young  adult  with  the  gopis  (cowherding  maidens), 
all  of  whom  are  in  love  with  him  because  of  his  good  looks  and 
talent  with  the  flute. 

These  explicitly  sexual  activities,  including  stealing  the 
clothes  of  the  maidens  while  they  are  bathing,  are  the  basis  for 
a  wide  range  of  poetry  and  songs  to  Krishna  as  a  lover;  the  dev- 
otee of  the  god  takes  on  a  female  role  and  directs  toward  the 
beloved  lord  the  heartfelt  longing  for  union  with  the  divine. 
Krishna's  relationship  with  Radha,  his  favorite  among  the  gopis, 
has  served  as  a  model  for  male  and  female  love  in  a  variety  of 
art  forms,  and  since  the  sixteenth  century  appears  prominently 
as  a  motif  in  North  Indian  paintings.  Unlike  many  other  dei- 
ties, who  are  depicted  as  very  fair  in  color,  Krishna  appears  in 
all  these  adventures  as  a  dark  lord,  either  black  or  blue  in  color.

India:  A  Country  Study 

In  this  sense,  he  is  a  figure  who  constantly  overturns  accepted 
conventions  of  order,  hierarchy,  and  propriety,  and  introduces 
a  playful  and  mischievous  aspect  of  a  god  who  hides  from  his 
worshipers  but  saves  them  in  the  end.  The  festival  of  Holi  at  the 
spring  equinox,  in  which  people  of  all  backgrounds  play  in  the 
streets  and  squirt  each  other  with  colored  water,  is  associated 
with  Krishna. 

In  iconography  Vishnu  may  appear  as  any  of  his  ten  incarna- 
tions but  often  stands  in  sculpture  as  a  princely  male  with  four 
arms  that  bear  a  club,  discus,  conch,  and  lotus  flower.  He  may 
also  appear  lying  on  his  back  on  the  thousand-headed  king  of 
the  serpents,  Shesha-Naga,  in  the  milk  ocean  at  the  center  of 
time,  with  his  feet  massaged  by  Lakshmi,  and  with  a  lotus  grow- 
ing from  his  navel  giving  birth  to  the  god  Brahma,  a 
four-headed  representation  of  the  creative  principle.  Vishnu  in 
this  representation  is  the  ultimate  source  of  the  universe  that 
he  causes  to  expand  and  contract  at  regular  cosmic  intervals 
measuring  millions  of  years.  On  a  more  concrete  level,  Vishnu 
may  become  incarnate  at  any  moment  on  earth  in  order  to 
continue  to  bring  sentient  creatures  back  to  himself,  and  a 
number  of  great  religious  teachers  (including,  for  example, 
Chaitanya  in  Bengal)  are  identified  by  their  followers  as  incar- 
nations of  Vishnu. 

Shiva 

The  god  Shiva  is  the  other  great  figure  in  the  modern  pan- 
theon. In  contrast  to  the  regal  attributes  of  Vishnu,  Shiva  is  a 
figure  of  renunciation.  A  favorite  image  portrays  him  as  an 
ascetic,  performing  meditation  alone  in  the  fastness  of  the 
Himalayas.  There  he  sits  on  a  tiger  skin,  clad  only  in  a  loin- 
cloth, covered  with  sacred  ash  that  gives  his  skin  a  gray  color. 
His  trident  is  stuck  into  the  ground  next  to  him.  Around  his 
neck  is  a  snake.  From  his  matted  hair,  tied  in  a  topknot,  the 
river  Ganga  (Ganges)  descends  to  the  earth.  His  neck  is  blue,  a 
reminder  of  the  time  he  drank  the  poison  that  emerged  while 
gods  and  demons  competed  to  churn  the  milk  ocean.  Shiva 
often  appears  in  this  image  as  an  antisocial  being,  who  once 
burned  up  Kama,  the  god  of  love,  with  a  glance.  But  behind 
this  image  is  the  cosmic  lord  who,  through  the  very  power  of 
his  meditating  consciousness,  expands  the  entire  universe  and 
all  beings  in  it.  Although  he  appears  to  be  hard  to  attain,  in 
reality  Shiva  is  a  loving  deity  who  saves  those  devotees  who  are 
wholeheartedly  dedicated  to  him. 


138 


Religious  Life 


The  bhakti  literature  of  South  India,  where  Shiva  has  long 
been  important,  describes  the  numerous  instances  of 
pure-hearted  devotion  to  the  beautiful  lord  and  the  final  reve- 
lation of  himself  as  Shiva  after  testing  his  devotees.  Shiva  often 
appears  on  earth  in  disguise,  perhaps  as  a  wandering  Brahman 
priest,  to  challenge  the  charity  or  belief  of  a  suffering  servant, 
only  to  appear  eventually  in  his  true  nature.  Many  of  these 
divine  plays  are  connected  directly  with  specific  people  and 
specific  sites,  and  almost  every  ancient  Shiva  temple  can  claim 
a  famous  poem  or  a  famous  miracle  in  its  history.  The  hun- 
dreds of  medieval  temples  in  Tamil  Nadu,  almost  all  dedicated 
to  Shiva,  contain  sculptured  panels  depicting  the  god  in  a  vari- 
ety of  guises:  Bhikshatana,  the  begging  lord;  Bhairava,  a  horri- 
ble, destructive  image;  or  Nataraja,  the  lord  of  the  dance, 
beating  a  drum  that  keeps  time  while  he  manifests  the  uni- 
verse. 

Because  he  withholds  his  sexual  urges  and  controls  them, 
Shiva  is  able  to  transmute  sexual  energy  into  creative  power,  by 
generating  intense  heat.  It  is,  in  fact,  the  heat  generated  from 
discipline  and  austerity  (tapas)  that  is  seen  as  the  source  for  the 
generative  power  of  all  renunciants,  and  in  this  sense  Shiva  is 
often  connected  with  wandering  orders  of  monks  in  modern 
India.  For  the  average  worshiper,  the  sexual  power  of  Shiva  is 
seen  in  the  most  common  image  that  represents  him,  the  lin- 
gam.  This  is  typically  a  cylindrical  stone  several  feet  tall,  with  a 
rounded  top,  standing  in  a  circular  base.  On  one  level,  this  is 
the  most  basic  image  of  divinity,  providing  a  focus  for  worship 
with  a  minimum  of  artistic  embellishment,  attempting  to  repre- 
sent the  infinite.  The  addition  of  carved  anatomical  details  on 
many  lingams,  however,  leaves  no  doubt  for  the  worshiper  that 
this  is  an  erect  male  sexual  organ,  showing  the  procreative 
power  of  God  at  the  origin  of  all  things.  The  concept  of  reality 
as  the  complex  interplay  of  opposite  principles,  male  and 
female,  thus  finds  its  highest  form  in  the  mythology  of  Shiva 
and  his  consort  Parvati  (also  known  as  Shakti,  Kali,  or  Durga), 
the  daughter  of  the  mountains.  This  most  controlled  deity,  the 
meditating  Shiva,  then  has  still  another  form,  as  the  erotic 
lover  of  Parvati,  embracing  her  passionately. 

Shiva  and  Parvati  have  two  sons,  who  have  entire  cycles  of 
myths  and  legends  and  bhakti  cults  in  their  own  right.  One  son 
is  called  variously  Karttikeya  (identified  with  the  planet  Mars) 
or  Skanda  (the  god  of  war  or  Subrahmanya) .  He  is  extremely 
handsome,  carries  a  spear,  and  rides  a  peacock.  According  to 


139 


India:  A  Country  Study 

some  traditions,  he  emerged  motherless  from  Shiva  when  the 
gods  needed  a  great  warrior  to  conquer  an  indestructible 
demon.  In  southern  India,  where  he  is  called  Murugan,  he  is  a 
lord  of  mountain  places  and  a  great  friend  of  those  who  dedi- 
cate themselves  to  him.  Some  devotees  vow  to  carry  on  their 
shoulders  specially  carved  objects  of  wood  for  a  determined 
number  of  weeks,  never  putting  them  down  during  that  time. 
Others  may  go  further,  and  insert  knives  or  long  pins  into  their 
bodies  for  extended  periods. 

Another  son  of  Shiva  and  Parvati  is  Ganesh,  or  Ganapati,  the 
Lord  of  the  Ganas  (the  hosts  of  Shiva),  who  has  a  male 
human's  body  with  four  arms  and  the  head  of  an  elephant. 
One  myth  claims  that  he  originated  directly  from  Parvati's 
body  and  entered  into  a  quarrel  with  Shiva,  who  cut  off  his 
human  head  and  replaced  it  later  with  the  head  of  the  first  ani- 
mal he  found,  which  happened  to  be  an  elephant.  For  most 
worshipers,  Ganesh  is  the  first  deity  invoked  during  any  cere- 
mony because  he  is  the  god  of  wisdom  and  remover  of  obsta- 
cles. People  worship  Ganesh  when  beginning  anything,  for 
example,  at  the  start  of  a  trip  or  the  first  day  of  the  new  school 
year.  He  is  often  pictured  next  to  his  mount,  the  rat,  symbol  of 
the  ability  to  get  in  anywhere.  Ganesh  is  therefore  a  clever  fig- 
ure, a  trickster  in  many  stories,  who  presents  a  benevolent  and 
friendly  image  to  those  worshipers  who  placate  him.  His  image 
is  perhaps  the  most  widespread  and  public  in  India,  visible  in 
streets  and  transportation  terminals  everywhere.  The  antics  of 
Ganesh  and  Karttikeya  and  the  interactions  of  Shiva  and  Par- 
vati have  generated  a  series  of  entertaining  myths  of  Shiva  as  a 
henpecked  husband,  who  would  prefer  to  keep  meditating  but 
instead  is  drawn  into  family  problems,  providing  a  series  of 
morality  tales  in  households  throughout  India. 

Brahma  and  the  Hindu  Trinity 

It  is  often  said  that  the  Hindu  pantheon  has  three  gods  at  its 
head:  Brahma,  the  creator  of  the  universe;  Vishnu,  the  pre- 
server of  life;  and  Shiva,  the  destroyer  of  ignorance.  Brahma  is 
a  representation  of  the  impersonal  brahman  in  a  human  form, 
usually  with  four  faces  facing  the  cardinal  directions  and  four 
arms  (see  Karma  and  Liberation,  this  ch.).  In  reality,  Brahma 
receives  little  devotion  from  worshipers,  who  may  mention  him 
in  passing  while  giving  their  attention  to  the  other  main  gods. 
There  are  few  temples  in  India  dedicated  to  him;  instead,  his 
image  may  stand  in  niches  on  the  walls  of  temples  built  for

other  deities.  Religious  stories  usually  place  Brahma  as  an  inter- 
mediate authority  who  cannot  handle  a  problem  and  passes  it 
on  to  either  Vishnu  or  Shiva.  The  concept  of  the  trinity 
(trimurti),  expressed  in  beautiful  art  works  or  invoked  even  by 
believers,  is  in  practice  a  philosophical  construct  that  unites  all 
deistic  traditions  within  Hinduism  into  one  overarching  sym- 
bol. 

The  Goddess 

Philosophical  musings  as  far  back  as  the  Rig  Veda  contem- 
plated the  universe  as  the  result  of  an  interplay  between  the 
male  principle  (purusha) ,  the  prime  source  of  generative 
power  but  quiescent,  and  a  female  principle  that  came  to  be 
known  as  prakriti,  an  active  principle  that  manifests  reality,  or 
power  (shakti),  at  work  in  the  world.  On  a  philosophical  level, 
this  female  principle  ultimately  rests  in  the  oneness  of  the 
male,  but  on  a  practical  level  it  is  the  female  that  is  most  signifi- 
cant in  the  world.  The  vast  array  of  iconography  and  mythology 
that  surround  the  gods  such  as  Vishnu  and  Shiva  is  a  backdrop 
for  the  worship  of  their  female  consorts,  and  the  male  deities 
fade  into  the  background.  Thus  it  is  that  the  divine  is  often 
female  in  India. 

Vishnu's  consort,  Lakshmi,  has  a  number  of  well-known 
incarnations  that  are  the  center  of  cults  in  their  own  right.  In 


141 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  Ramayana,  for  example,  female  characters  are  responsible 
for  most  of  the  important  events,  and  the  dutiful  Sita,  who 
resists  the  advances  of  lustful  Ravana,  is  a  much  beloved  figure 
of  devotion.  Lakshmi  receives  direct  worship  along  with  Ram 
during  the  big  national  festival  of  Dipavali  (Diwali),  celebrated 
with  massive  fireworks  demonstrations,  when  people  pray  for 
success  and  wealth  during  the  coming  year.  The  Mahabharata  is 
equally  packed  with  tales  of  male  and  female  relationships  in 
which  women  hold  their  own,  and  the  beautiful  Draupadi,  wife 
of  the  five  Pandava  heroes,  has  her  own  cult  in  scattered  loca- 
tions throughout  India. 

Parvati,  in  a  variety  of  forms,  is  the  most  common  focus  of 
devotion  in  India.  She  presents  two  main  facets  to  her  worship- 
ers: a  benign  and  accepting  personality  that  provides  assistance 
and  a  powerful  and  dangerous  personality  that  must  be  pla- 
cated. The  benign  vision  exists  in  many  temples  to  Shiva 
throughout  the  country,  where  the  goddess  has  her  own  shrine 
that  is  in  practice  the  most  frequented  site  of  heartfelt  devo- 
tion. During  annual  festivals  in  which  the  god  and  goddess 
emerge  from  their  shrines  and  travel  in  processions,  it  is  often 
the  goddess  who  is  most  eagerly  anticipated.  In  North  India, 
for  example,  life-like  statues  of  the  loving  goddess  Kali,  who  is 
ultimately  a  manifestation  of  Parvati,  are  carried  through  huge 
crowds  that  line  village  and  city  streets.  In  South  India,  where 
gigantic  temples  are  the  physical  and  social  centers  of  town  life, 
the  shrines  and  their  annual  festivals  are  often  known  by  the 
names  of  their  goddesses.  One  of  the  more  famous  is  the  six- 
teenth- and  seventeenth-century  Minakshi  Temple  in  Madurai, 
Tamil  Nadu.  The  temple  is  named  after  the  "fish-eyed  goddess" 
Minakshi,  described  in  myths  as  a  dark  queen  born  with  three 
breasts,  who  set  out  to  conquer  the  universe.  After  overrunning 
the  world  and  vanquishing  the  gods,  Minakshi  finally  met  Shiva 
and,  when  her  third  breast  disappeared,  accepted  him  as  her 
lord.  This  motif  of  physical  power  and  energy  appears  in  many 
stories  where  the  goddess  is  a  warrior  or  conqueror  of  demons 
who  in  the  end  joins  with  Shiva. 

Alternative  visions,  however,  portray  a  goddess  on  the  loose, 
with  the  potential  for  causing  havoc  in  the  world  unless 
appeased.  The  goddess  Durga  is  a  great  warrior  who  carries 
swords  and  a  shield,  rides  a  tiger,  and  destroys  demons  when 
the  gods  prove  incapable;  in  this  incarnation,  she  never  sub- 
mits, but  remains  capable  of  terrible  deeds  of  war.  The  goddess 
Kali  often  appears  as  an  even  more  horrific  vision  of  the  divine, 


142 


Religious  Life 


with  garlands  of  human  skulls  around  her  neck  and  a  severed 
head  in  her  hand;  her  bloody  tongue  hangs  from  her  mouth, 
and  the  weapons  in  her  arms  drip  gore.  This  image  attempts  to 
capture  the  destructive  capacity  of  the  divine,  the  suffering  in 
the  world,  and  the  ultimate  return  of  all  things  to  the  goddess 
at  death. 

In  many  small  shrines  throughout  India,  in  marked  contrast 
to  the  large  and  ornate  temples  dominated  by  Brahmanical 
principles  and  the  philosophy  of  nonviolence,  the  female  divin- 
ity receives  regular  gifts  of  blood  sacrifices,  usually  chickens 
and  goats.  In  addition,  the  goddess  may  manifest  herself  as  the 
bearer  of  a  number  of  diseases.  The  goddess  of  smallpox, 
known  as  Shitala  in  North  India  and  Mariamman  in  South 
India,  remains  a  feared  and  worshiped  figure  even  after  the 
official  elimination  of  the  disease,  for  she  is  still  capable  of 
afflicting  people  with  a  number  of  fevers  and  poxes.  Many 
more  localized  forms  of  goddesses,  known  by  different  names 
in  different  regions,  are  the  focus  for  prayers  and  vows  that 
lead  worshipers  to  undertake  acts  of  austerity  and  pilgrimages 
in  return  for  favors. 

Local  Deities 

Along  many  paths  in  the  countryside,  and  in  some  urban 
neighborhoods,  there  are  sacred  spots  at  the  base  of  trees,  or 
small  stones  set  in  niches,  or  simply  made  statues  with  flowers 
or  a  small  flame  burning  in  front  of  them.  These  are  shrines 
for  deities  who  are  locally  honored  for  protecting  the  people 
from  harm  caused  by  natural  disasters  or  evil  influences.  Wor- 
shipers often  portray  these  protectors  as  warriors,  and,  in  some 
cases,  they  may  be  traced  back  to  great  human  fighters  who 
died  for  their  village  and  later  became  immortalized.  In  South 
India,  there  are  thousands  of  hero  stones,  simple  representa- 
tions of  warriors  on  slabs  of  stone,  found  in  and  around  agri- 
cultural settlements,  in  memory  of  nameless  local  fighters  who 
may  have  died  while  protecting  their  communities  hundreds  of 
years  ago.  At  one  time,  these  stones  may  have  received  regular 
signs  of  devotion,  but  they  are  mostly  ignored  in  contemporary 
India.  In  the  fields  on  the  outskirts  of  many  villages,  there  are 
large,  multicolored,  terra-cotta  figures  of  warriors  with  raised 
swords  or  figures  of  war  horses;  these  are  open-air  shrines  of 
the  god  Aiyanar,  who  serves  as  the  village  protector  and  who 
has  very  few  connections  with  the  great  tradition  of  Hinduism. 


143 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Local  deities  may  begin  to  attract  the  attention  of  worshipers 
from  a  wide  geographical  area,  which  may  include  many  vil- 
lages or  neighborhoods,  or  from  a  large  percentage  of  the 
members  of  particular  castes,  who  come  to  the  deity  seeking 
protection  or  boons.  These  deities  have  their  own  shrines, 
which  may  be  simple,  independent  enclosures  with  pillared 
halls  or  may  stand  as  separate  establishments  attached  to  tem- 
ples of  Shiva,  Vishnu,  or  any  other  great  god.  Deities  at  this 
level  attract  expressive  and  ecstatic  forms  of  worship  and  tend 
to  possess  special  devotees  on  a  regular  basis  or  enter  into  their 
believers  during  festivals.  People  who  are  possessed  by  the  god 
may  speak  to  their  families  and  friends  concerning  important 
personal  or  social  problems,  predicting  the  future  or  clarifying 
mysteries.  These  local  gods  often  expect  offerings  of  animals, 
usually  goats  or  chickens,  which  are  killed  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
shrines  and  then  consumed  in  communal  meals  by  families 
and  friends. 

In  the  twentieth  century,  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the 
number  of  new,  regional  gods  attracting  worshipers  from  many 
different  groups,  spurred  by  vast  improvements  in  transport 
and  communication.  For  example,  in  the  hills  bordering  the 
states  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  Kerala  is  a  shrine  for  the  god  Ayyap- 
pan,  whose  origin  is  uncertain  but  who  is  sometimes  called  the 
offspring  of  Shiva  and  Vishnu  in  his  female  form.  Ayyappan's 
annual  festival  is  a  time  of  pilgrimage  for  ever-growing  num- 
bers of  men  from  throughout  South  India.  These  devotees  fast 
and  engage  in  austerities  under  the  leadership  of  a  teacher  for 
weeks  beforehand  and  then  travel  in  groups  to  the  shrine  for  a 
glimpse  of  the  god.  Bus  tickets  are  hard  to  obtain  for  several 
weeks  as  masses  of  elated  men,  clad  in  distinctive  ritual  dhotis 
of  various  colors,  throng  public  transportation  during  their  trip 
to  the  shrine.  In  northwestern  India,  the  popularity  of  the  god- 
dess Vaishno  Devi  has  risen  meteorically  since  independence. 
Vaishno  Devi,  who  combines  elements  of  Lakshmi  and  Durga, 
is  an  extremely  benevolent  manifestation  of  the  eternal  virgin 
who  gives  material  well-being  to  her  worshipers.  One  million 
pilgrims  travel  annually  to  her  cave  shrine  in  the  foothills  of 
the  Himalayas,  about  fifty  kilometers  north  of  the  city  of 
Jammu. 

Since  the  1950s,  the  most  spectacular  example  of  a  deity's 
increasing  influence  throughout  northern  and  central  India  is 
the  cult  of  Santoshi  Ma  (Mother  of  Contentment).  Her  myths 
recount  the  sufferings  of  a  young  woman  left  alone  by  her 


144 


Religious  Life 


working  husband  and  abused  by  her  in-laws,  who  nevertheless 
remains  loving  and  faithful  to  her  man  and,  by  performing  sim- 
ple vows  to  the  goddess  (fasting  one  day  every  week),  eventu- 
ally sees  the  return  of  her  now-rich  husband  and  moves  with 
him  into  her  own  house.  Santoshi  Ma,  thought  to  be  the 
daughter  of  Ganesh,  is  worshiped  mostly  by  lower  middle-class 
women  who  also  pray  for  material  goods.  In  the  1980s  and  early 
1990s,  her  shrines  were  spreading  everywhere  and  even  taking 
over  older  temples,  aided  by  the  release  in  the  1970s  of  an 
extremely  popular  film  version  of  her  story,  Jay  Santoshi  Ma. 

The  Ceremonies  of  Hinduism 

The  ritual  world  of  Hinduism,  manifestations  of  which  differ 
greatly  among  regions,  villages,  and  individuals,  offers  a  num- 
ber of  common  features  that  link  all  Hindus  into  a  greater 
Indian  religious  system  and  influence  other  religions  as  well. 
The  most  notable  feature  in  religious  ritual  is  the  division 
between  purity  and  pollution.  Religious  acts  presuppose  some 
degree  of  impurity  or  defilement  for  the  practitioner,  which 
must  be  overcome  or  neutralized  before  or  during  ritual  proce- 
dures. Purification,  usually  with  water,  is  thus  a  typical  feature 
of  most  religious  action.  Avoidance  of  the  impure — taking  ani- 
mal life,  eating  flesh,  associating  with  dead  things,  or  body  flu- 
ids— is  another  feature  of  Hindu  ritual  and  is  important  for 
repressing  pollution.  In  a  social  context,  those  individuals  or 
groups  who  manage  to  avoid  the  impure  are  accorded 
increased  respect.  Still  another  feature  is  a  belief  in  the  efficacy 
of  sacrifice,  including  survivals  of  Vedic  sacrifice.  Thus,  sacri- 
fices may  include  the  performance  of  offerings  in  a  regulated 
manner,  with  the  preparation  of  sacred  space,  recitation  of 
texts,  and  manipulation  of  objects.  A  third  feature  is  the  con- 
cept of  merit,  gained  through  the  performance  of  charity  or 
good  works,  that  will  accumulate  over  time  and  reduce  suffer- 
ings in  the  next  world. 

Domestic  Worship 

The  home  is  the  place  where  most  Hindus  conduct  their 
worship  and  religious  rituals.  The  most  important  times  of  day 
for  performance  of  household  rituals  are  dawn  and  dusk, 
although  especially  devout  families  may  engage  in  devotion 
more  often.  For  many  households,  the  day  begins  when  the 
women  in  the  house  draw  auspicious  geometric  designs  in 


145 


India:  A  Country  Study 

chalk  or  rice  flour  on  the  floor  or  the  doorstep.  For  orthodox 
Hindus,  dawn  and  dusk  are  greeted  with  recitation  from  the 
Rig  Veda  of  the  Gayatri  Mantra  for  the  sun — for  many  people, 
the  only  Sanskrit  prayer  they  know.  After  a  bath,  there  is  per- 
sonal worship  of  the  gods  at  a  family  shrine,  which  typically 
includes  lighting  a  lamp  and  offering  foodstuffs  before  the 
images,  while  prayers  in  Sanskrit  or  a  regional  language  are 
recited.  In  the  evenings,  especially  in  rural  areas,  mostly  female 
devotees  may  gather  together  for  long  sessions  of  singing 
hymns  in  praise  of  one  or  more  of  the  gods. 

Minor  acts  of  charity  punctuate  the  day.  During  daily  baths, 
there  are  offerings  of  a  little  water  in  memory  of  the  ancestors. 
At  each  meal,  families  may  set  aside  a  handful  of  grain  to  be 
donated  to  beggars  or  needy  persons,  and  daily  gifts  of  small 
amounts  of  grain  to  birds  or  other  animals  serve  to  accumulate 
merit  for  the  family  through  their  self-sacrifice. 

Life-Cycle  Rituals 

A  detailed  series  of  life-cycle  rituals  (samskara,  or  refine- 
ments) mark  major  transitions  in  the  life  of  the  individual. 
Especially  orthodox  Hindu  families  may  invite  Brahman  priests 
to  their  homes  to  officiate  at  these  rituals,  complete  with  sacred 
fire  and  recitations  of  mantras.  Most  of  these  rituals,  however, 
do  not  occur  in  the  presence  of  such  priests,  and  among  many 
groups  who  do  not  revere  the  Vedas  or  respect  Brahmans, 
there  may  be  other  officiants  or  variations  in  the  rites. 

Ceremonies  may  be  performed  during  pregnancy  to  ensure 
the  health  of  the  mother  and  growing  child.  The  father  may 
part  the  hair  of  the  mother  three  times  upward  from  the  front 
to  the  back,  to  assure  the  ripening  of  the  embryo.  Charms  may 
serve  to  ward  off  the  evil  eye  and  witches  or  demons.  At  birth, 
before  the  umbilical  cord  is  severed,  the  father  may  touch  the 
baby's  lips  with  a  gold  spoon  or  ring  dipped  in  honey,  curds, 
and  ghee.  The  word  vak  (speech)  is  whispered  three  times  into 
the  right  ear,  and  mantras  are  chanted  to  ensure  a  long  life.  A 
number  of  rituals  for  the  infant  include  the  first  visit  outside  to 
a  temple,  the  first  feeding  with  solid  food  (usually  cooked 
rice),  an  ear-piercing  ceremony,  and  the  first  haircut  (shaving 
the  head)  that  often  occurs  at  a  temple  or  during  a  festival 
when  the  hair  is  offered  to  a  deity. 

A  crucial  event  in  the  life  of  the  orthodox,  upper-caste 
Hindu  male  is  an  initiation  (upanayana)  ceremony,  which  takes 
place  for  some  young  males  between  the  ages  of  six  and  twelve 


146 


Religious  Life 


to  mark  the  transition  to  awareness  and  adult  religious  respon- 
sibilities. At  the  ceremony  itself,  the  family  priest  invests  the 
boy  with  a  sacred  thread  to  be  worn  always  over  the  left  shoul- 
der, and  the  parents  instruct  him  in  pronouncing  the  Gayatri 
Mantra.  The  initiation  ceremony  is  seen  as  a  new  birth;  those 
groups  entitled  to  wear  the  sacred  thread  are  called  the  twice- 
born  (see  Glossary).  In  the  ancient  categorization  of  society 
associated  with  the  Vedas,  only  the  three  highest  groups — Brah- 
man, warrior  (Kshatriya),  and  commoner  or  merchant 
(Vaishya) — were  allowed  to  wear  the  thread,  to  make  them  dis- 
tinct from  the  fourth  group  of  servants  (Shudra).  Many  indi- 
viduals and  groups  who  are  only  hazily  associated  with  the  old 
"twice-born"  elites  perform  the  upanayana  ceremony  and  claim 
the  higher  status  it  bestows.  For  young  Hindu  women  in  South 
India,  a  different  ritual  and  celebration  occurs  at  the  first 
menses. 

The  next  important  transition  in  life  is  marriage.  For  most 
people  in  India,  the  betrothal  of  the  young  couple  and  the 
exact  date  and  time  of  the  wedding  are  matters  decided  by  the 
parents  in  consultation  with  astrologers.  At  Hindu  weddings, 
the  bride  and  bridegroom  represent  the  god  and  the  goddess, 
although  there  is  a  parallel  tradition  that  sees  the  groom  as  a 
prince  coming  to  wed  his  princess.  The  groom,  decked  in  all 
his  finery,  often  travels  to  the  wedding  site  on  a  caparisoned 
white  horse  or  in  an  open  limousine,  accompanied  by  a  proces- 
sion of  relatives,  musicians,  and  bearers  of  ornate  electrified 
lamps.  The  actual  ceremonies  in  many  cases  become  extremely 
elaborate,  but  orthodox  Hindu  marriages  typically  have  at  their 
center  the  recitation  of  mantras  by  priests.  In  a  crucial  rite,  the 
new  couple  take  seven  steps  northward  from  a  sacred  house- 
hold fire,  turn,  and  make  offerings  into  the  flames.  Indepen- 
dent traditions  in  regional  languages  and  among  different 
caste  groups  support  wide  variations  in  ritual  (see  Life  Pas- 
sages, ch.  5). 

After  the  death  of  a  family  member,  the  relatives  become 
involved  in  ceremonies  for  preparation  of  the  body  and  a  pro- 
cession to  the  burning  or  burial  ground.  For  most  Hindus,  cre- 
mation is  the  ideal  method  for  dealing  with  the  dead,  although 
many  groups  practice  burial  instead;  infants  are  buried  rather 
than  cremated.  At  the  funeral  site,  in  the  presence  of  the  male 
mourners,  the  closest  relative  of  the  deceased  (usually  the 
eldest  son)  takes  charge  of  the  final  rite  and,  if  it  is  cremation, 
lights  the  funeral  pyre.  After  a  cremation,  ashes  and  fragments 


147 


India:  A  Country  Study 

of  bone  are  collected  and  eventually  immersed  in  a  holy  river. 
After  a  funeral,  everyone  undergoes  a  purifying  bath.  The 
immediate  family  remains  in  a  state  of  intense  pollution  for  a 
set  number  of  days  (sometimes  ten,  eleven,  or  thirteen) .  At  the 
end  of  that  period,  close  family  members  meet  for  a  ceremo- 
nial meal  and  often  give  gifts  to  the  poor  or  to  charities.  A  par- 
ticular feature  of  the  Hindu  ritual  is  the  preparation  of  rice 
balls  (pinda)  offered  to  the  spirit  of  the  dead  person  during 
memorial  services.  In  part  these  ceremonies  are  seen  as  con- 
tributing to  the  merit  of  the  deceased,  but  they  also  pacify  the 
soul  so  that  it  will  not  linger  in  this  world  as  a  ghost  but  will  pass 
through  the  realm  of  Yama,  the  god  of  death. 

Public  Worship 

Temples 

The  basic  form  of  the  temple  in  India  is  a  square  cell,  ori- 
ented to  the  four  cardinal  directions,  containing  a  platform 
with  an  image  of  the  deity  in  the  center,  a  flat  roof  overhead, 
and  a  doorway  on  the  east  side.  In  front  of  the  doorway  is  a 
porch  or  platform,  shaded  by  a  roof  supported  by  pillars, 
where  worshipers  gather  before  and  after  approaching  the 
god.  At  the  founding  of  the  temple,  priests  establish  a  sancti- 
fied area  in  the  center  of  the  shrine  and,  while  praying  and  per- 
forming rituals,  set  up  the  image  of  the  god.  The  deity  is  then 
said  to  be  one  with  the  image,  which  contains  or  manifests  the 
power  of  the  god  on  earth.  Every  Hindu  temple  in  India,  then, 
exists  as  the  center  of  the  universe,  where  the  god  overlooks  his 
or  her  domain  and  aids  devotees. 

Worship  at  the  temple  is  not  congregational.  Instead,  indi- 
viduals or  small  groups  of  devotees  approach  the  sanctum  in 
order  to  obtain  a  vision  (darshana)  of  the  god,  say  prayers,  and 
perform  devotional  worship.  Because  the  god  exists  in  totality 
in  the  shrine,  any  objects  that  touch  the  image  or  even  enter 
the  sanctum  are  filled  with  power  and,  when  returned  to  their 
givers,  confer  the  grace  of  the  divine  on  the  human  world. 
Only  persons  of  requisite  purity  who  have  been  specially 
trained  are  able  to  handle  the  power  of  the  deity,  and  most 
temple  sanctums  are  operated  by  priests  who  take  the  offerings 
from  worshipers,  present  them  directly  to  the  image  of  the 
deity,  and  then  return  most  of  the  gifts  to  the  devotees  for  use 
or  consumption  later  at  home. 


148 


Religious  Life 


Since  the  sixth  century,  after  the  decline  of  Buddhism  as  the 
main  focus  of  religious  patronage,  temples  have  been  accumu- 
lating generous  donations  from  kings,  nobles,  and  the  wealthy. 
The  result  is  a  huge  number  of  shrines  throughout  the  coun- 
try, many  of  which,  especially  in  South  India,  date  back  hun- 
dreds of  years.  The  statuary  and  embellishment  in  some  of  the 
ancient  shrines  constitute  one  of  the  world's  greatest  artistic 
heritages.  The  layout  of  major  temples  has  expanded  into 
gigantic  architectural  complexes. 

Along  with  architectural  elaboration  has  come  a  complex 
administrative  system  to  manage  the  many  gifts  bestowed  by 
wealthy  donors  in  the  past  and  continually  replenished  by  the 
piety  of  devotees  in  the  present.  The  gods  are  legal  landholders 
and  command  substantial  investment  portfolios  throughout 
the  country.  The  management  of  these  fortunes  in  many  states 
lies  in  the  hands  of  private  religious  endowments,  although  in 
some  states,  such  as  Tamil  Nadu,  the  state  government  man- 
ages most  of  the  temples  directly.  Struggles  over  the  control  of 
temple  administration  have  clogged  the  courts  for  several  hun- 
dred years,  and  the  news  media  readily  report  on  the  drama  of 
these  battles.  Several  cases  have  had  an  impact  on  religious,  or 
communal,  affairs.  The  most  spectacular  case  involved  owner- 
ship of  a  site  in  Ayodhya,  Uttar  Pradesh,  claimed  by  Hindus  as 
the  site  of  Ram's  birth  but  taken  over  by  Muslims  as  the  site  for 
a  mosque,  the  Babri  Masjid,  built  in  1528.  After  much  postur- 
ing by  the  conservative  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP — Indian 
People's  Party)  and  its  nationalist  parent  organization,  the 
Rashtriya  Swayamsevak  Sangh  (RSS — National  Volunteer 
Organisation),  matters  came  to  a  head  in  December  1992  (see 
Modern  Transformations,  this  ch.;  Political  Parties,  ch.  8). 
Some  200,000  militant  Hindus,  under  the  direction  of  RSS 
marshals,  descended  on  Ayodhya,  razing  the  Babri  Masjid  to 
the  ground  on  December  6,  1992.  Reprisals  and  communal  vio- 
lence occurred  throughout  India  and  in  neighboring  Pakistan 
and  Bangladesh  (see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8). 

Pilgrimage 

India  is  covered  with  holy  sites  associated  with  the  exploits  of 
the  gods,  the  waters  of  a  sacred  river,  or  the  presence  of  holy 
men.  Texts  called  the  Puranas  (ancient  lore  in  Sanskrit)  con- 
tain lengthy  sections  that  describe  numerous  sacred  places  and 
the  merit  gained  by  traveling  to  them  in  a  devout  manner. 
Bathing  at  such  sites  is  a  specially  meritorious  act.  With  the

151 


India:  A  Country  Study 

expansion  of  public  transportation  in  the  twentieth  century, 
there  has  been  a  vast  increase  in  the  numbers  of  people  who 
visit  these  spots  to  partake  of  the  divine  and  visit  new  places.  In 
fact,  for  many  Indians  pilgrimage  is  the  preferred  form  of  tour- 
ism, involving  family  and  community  groups  in  enjoyable  and 
uplifting  vacations. 

Certain  important  sites  are  well-known  throughout  India 
and  attract  hundreds  of  thousands  of  pilgrims  annually.  Proba- 
bly the  most  significant  is  Varanasi  (also  known  as  Banaras, 
Benares,  or  Kashi)  in  southeastern  Uttar  Pradesh  on  the  north 
bank  of  the  Ganga.  It  is  sacred  to  Hindus,  Buddhists,  and  Jains, 
who  flock  to  the  ghats,  or  steps,  leading  from  temples  down  to 
the  banks  of  the  sacred  Ganga  in  their  search  for  an  auspicious 
site  for  death,  cremation,  or  immersion  of  ashes.  Hardwar,  in 
northwestern  Uttar  Pradesh,  far  up  the  Ganga  in  the  foothills 
of  the  Himalayas,  is  theVaranasi  of  northwest  India  for  Hindus 
living  there  and  is  a  favorite  spot  for  ritual  bathing.  There  are 
numerous  destinations  in  the  Himalayas,  including  Badrinath 
and  Kedarnath,  isolated  sites  in  northern  Uttar  Pradesh  that 
once  required  a  long  journey  on  foot.  In  southern  India,  the 
rivers  Kaveri,  Krishna,  and  Godavari  attract  pilgrims  to  a  large 
number  of  bathing  sites,  and  the  coastline  features  major  tem- 
ples such  as  the  Ramalingesvara  Temple  in  Ramesvaram,  Tamil 
Nadu,  where  Ram  and  his  army  crossed  over  to  Lanka  to  rescue 
Sita.  Pandharpur,  in  Maharashtra,  is  the  destination  for  many 
thousands  of  devotees  of  Vitthala,  an  incarnation  of  Vishnu, 
whose  tradition  goes  back  at  least  to  the  thirteenth  century  and 
was  written  about  by  the  great  Marathi  bhakti  poets  Namdev, 
Tukaram,  and  Eknath.  There  are  smaller  sites  near  almost 
every  river  or  scenic  hilltop. 

For  many  pilgrims,  the  process  of  getting  to  their  destination 
involves  preliminary  vows  and  fasting,  intensive  cooperative 
efforts  among  different  families  and  groups,  extensive  travel- 
ing on  foot,  and  the  constant  singing  of  devotional  songs.  On 
arrival,  groups  of  pilgrims  often  make  contact  with  priests  who 
specialize  in  the  pilgrim  trade  and  for  a  fee  plan  the  group's 
schedule  and  ritual  activity.  At  some  of  the  major  sites,  the  fam- 
ilies of  the  priests  have  served  as  hereditary  guides  for  groups 
of  pilgrims  over  many  generations.  Where  a  shrine  is  the  focus, 
the  devotee  may  circumambulate  the  buildings  and  wait  in  line 
for  long  hours  just  for  a  glimpse  of  the  deity's  image  as  security 
personnel  move  the  crowds  along.  At  auspicious  bathing  sites, 
pilgrims  may  have  to  wade  through  the  crush  of  other  devotees 


152 


Religious  Life 


to  dip  into  the  sacred  waters  of  a  river  or  a  tank.  Worshipers 
engaged  in  special  vows  or  in  praying  for  the  cure  of  a  loved 
one  may  purchase  shrine  amulets  to  give  to  the  god  (which  are 
circulated  back  to  the  shrine's  shop)  or  purchase  foodstuffs, 
sanctified  by  the  god's  presence,  to  take  to  friends  and  family. 
Nearby,  souvenir  hawkers  and  shopkeepers  and  sometimes 
even  amusement  parks  contribute  to  a  lively  atmosphere  that  is 
certainly  part  of  the  attraction  of  many  pilgrimage  sites. 

Festivals 

A  vast  number  of  local  Hindu  festivals  revolve  around  the 
worship  of  gods  at  the  neighborhood,  village,  or  caste  level.  All 
over  India,  at  least  once  a  year  the  images  of  the  gods  are  taken 
from  their  shrines  to  travel  in  processions  around  their 
domains.  The  images  are  carried  on  palanquins  that  require 
human  bearers  or  on  human-drawn,  large-wheeled  carts.  The 
images  may  be  intricately  made  up  in  order  for  the  stone  or 
wooden  statues  to  appear  lifelike.  They  may  wear  costly  vest- 
ments, and  flower  garlands  may  surround  their  necks  or  entire 
shrines.  The  gods  move  down  village  or  city  streets  in  parades 
that  may  include  multiple  palanquins  and,  at  sites  of  major 
temples,  even  elephants  decked  out  in  traditional  vestments.  As 
the  parade  passes,  throngs  of  worshipers  pray  and  make  vows  to 
the  gods  while  the  community  as  a  whole  looks  on  and  partici- 
pates in  the  spectacle.  In  many  locations,  these  public  parades 
go  on  for  a  number  of  days  and  include  special  events  where 
the  gods  engage  in  "play"  (lila)  that  may  include  mock  battles 
and  the  defeat  of  demons.  The  ceremonial  bathing  of  the 
images  and  displays  of  the  gods  in  all  their  finery  in  public  halls 
also  occur.  In  the  south,  where  temples  stand  at  the  geographic 
and  psychological  heart  of  village  and  town,  some  "chariots"  of 
the  gods  stand  many  stories  tall  and  require  the  concerted 
effort  of  dozens  of  men  to  pull  them  through  the  streets. 

There  are  a  number  of  Hindu  religious  festivals  that  are  offi- 
cially recognized  by  the  government  as  "closed  holidays,"  on 
which  work  stops  throughout  the  country.  The  biggest  of  these 
occur  within  two  blocks  of  time  after  the  end  of  the  southwest 
monsoon.  The  first  comes  at  the  end  of  the  ten-day  festival  of 
Dussehra,  late  in  the  month  of  Asvina  (September-October) 
according  to  the  Shaka  calendar,  India's  official  calendar  (see 
table  14,  Appendix).  This  festival  commemorates  Ram's  victory 
over  Ravana  and  the  rescue  of  his  wife  Sita  (see  Vishnu,  this 
ch.).  On  the  ninth  day  of  Dusshera,  people  bless  with  sandal- 


153 


India:  A  Country  Study 

wood  paste  the  "weapons"  of  their  business  life,  including 
everything  from  plows  to  computers.  On  the  final  day  of  Dusse- 
hra,  in  North  India  celebrating  crowds  set  fire  to  huge  paper 
effigies  of  Ravana.  Several  weeks  later  comes  Dipavali  (Diwali), 
or  the  Festival  of  Lights,  in  the  month  of  Kartika  (October- 
November).  This  is  officially  a  one-day  holiday,  but  in  reality  it 
becomes  a  week-long  event  when  many  people  take  vacations. 
One  tradition  links  this  festival  to  the  victory  of  Krishna  over 
the  demon  Naraka,  but  for  most  devotees  the  holiday  is  a  recre- 
ation of  Ram's  triumphant  return  with  Sita,  his  wife,  from  his 
adventures.  People  light  rows  of  lamps  and  place  them  on  sills 
around  their  houses,  set  off  gigantic  amounts  of  fireworks,  pray 
for  wealth  and  good  fortune,  distribute  sweets,  and  send  greet- 
ing cards  to  friends  and  business  associates. 

The  other  closed  holidays  associated  with  Hindu  festivals 
include  Mahashivaratri,  or  the  great  night  of  Shiva,  during  the 
month  of  Magha  (January-February).  This  festival  celebrates 
Shiva's  emanation  of  the  universe  through  his  cosmic  dance, 
and  is  a  day  of  fasting,  visiting  temples,  and  in  many  places  stay- 
ing up  all  night  to  sing  devotional  songs.  On  the  fourth  day  in 
the  month  of  Bhadra  (August-September)  comes  the  festival 
of  Ganesh  Chaturthi.  Families  and  businesses  prepare  for  this 
festival  by  purchasing  brightly  painted  images  of  Ganesh  and 
worshiping  them  for  a  number  of  days.  On  the  festival  itself, 
with  great  celebration,  participants  bathe  the  images  (and  in 
most  cases  permanently  dump  them)  in  nearby  rivers,  lakes,  or 
seas.  Janmashtami,  the  birthday  of  Krishna,  also  occurs  in  the 
month  of  Bhadra. 

There  are  a  large  number  of  "restricted  holidays"  celebrated 
by  the  vast  majority  of  the  population  and  resulting  in  closures 
of  business  establishments.  Major  Hindu  events  include 
Ramanavami,  the  birthday  of  Ram  in  the  month  of  Chaitra 
(March-April),  and  Holi,  celebrated  at  the  end  of  the  month 
of  Phalguna  (February-March),  when  people  engage  in  cross- 
dressing,  play  tricks  on  each  other,  and  squirt  colored  water  or 
powder  on  each  other.  These  primarily  northern  festivals 
receive  varying  amounts  of  attention  in  other  parts  of  the  coun- 
try. A  separate  series  of  restricted  holidays  allow  regional  cul- 
tures to  celebrate  their  own  feasts,  such  as  the  harvest  festival  of 
Pongal  in  Tamil  Nadu  in  midjanuary,  which  celebrates  the  har- 
vest and  the  sun's  entrance  into  Capricorn.

Islam 

Islam  is  India's  largest  minority  religion,  with  Muslims  offi- 
cially comprising  12.1  percent  of  the  country's  population,  or 
101.6  million  people  as  of  the  1991  census.  The  largest  concen- 
trations— about  52  percent  of  all  Muslims  in  India — live  in  the 
states  of  Bihar  (12  million),  West  Bengal  (16  million),  and 
Uttar  Pradesh  (24  million),  according  to  the  1991  census.  Mus- 
lims represent  a  majority  of  the  local  populations  only  in 
Jammu  and  Kashmir  (not  tabulated  in  1991  but  65  percent  in 
1981)  and  Lakshadweep  (94  percent).  As  a  faith  with  its  roots 
outside  South  Asia,  Islam  also  offers  some  striking  contrasts  to 
those  religions  that  originated  in  India. 

Origins  and  Tenets 

Islam  began  with  the  ministry  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad 
(570-632),  who  belonged  to  a  merchant  family  in  the  trading 
town  of  Mecca  in  Arabia.  In  his  middle  age,  Muhammad 
received  visions  in  which  the  Archangel  Gabriel  revealed  the 
word  of  God  to  him.  After  620  he  publicly  preached  the  mes- 
sage of  these  visions,  stressing  the  oneness  of  God  (Allah), 
denouncing  the  polytheism  of  his  fellow  Arabs,  and  calling  for 
moral  uplift  of  the  population.  He  attracted  a  dedicated  band 
of  followers,  but  there  was  intense  opposition  from  the  leaders 
of  the  city,  who  profited  from  pilgrimage  trade  to  the  shrine 
called  the  Kaaba.  In  622  Muhammad  and  his  closest  supporters 
migrated  to  the  town  of  Yathrib  (now  renamed  Medina)  to  the 
north  and  set  up  a  new  center  of  preaching  and  opposition  to 
the  leadership  of  Mecca.  This  move,  the  hijrah  or  hegira, 
marks  the  beginning  of  the  Islamic  calendar  and  the  origin  of 
the  new  religion  of  Islam.  After  a  series  of  military  engage- 
ments, Muhammad  and  his  followers  were  able  to  defeat  the 
authorities  in  Mecca  and  return  to  take  control  of  the  city. 
Before  his  death  in  632,  Muhammad  was  able  to  bring  most  of 
the  tribes  of  Arabia  into  the  fold  of  Islam.  Soon  after  his  death, 
the  united  Arabs  conquered  present-day  Syria,  Iraq,  Egypt,  and 
Iran,  making  Islam  into  a  world  religion  by  the  end  of  the  sev- 
enth century. 

Islam  means  submission  to  God,  and  a  Muslim  is  one  who 
has  submitted  to  the  will  of  God.  At  the  center  of  the  religion  is 
an  intense  concentration  on  the  unity  of  God  and  the  separa- 
tion between  God  and  his  creatures.  No  physical  representa- 
tion of  God  is  allowed.  There  are  no  other  gods.  The  duty  of 


155

humanity  is  to  profess  the  simple  testimony:  "There  is  no  god 
but  God  (Allah),  and  Muhammad  is  his  Prophet."  Obedience 
to  God's  will  rests  on  following  the  example  of  the  Prophet  in 
one's  own  life  and  faithfulness  to  the  revelations  collected  into 
the  most  sacred  text,  the  Quran.  The  Five  Pillars  of  Islam  are 
reciting  the  profession  of  faith;  praying  five  times  a  day;  alms- 
giving to  the  poor;  fasting  (abstaining  from  dawn  to  dusk  from 
food,  drink,  sexual  relations,  and  smoking)  during  the  month 
of  Ramazan  (the  ninth  month  of  the  Islamic  calendar,  known 
as  Ramadan  in  Arab  countries),  the  holy  month  when  God's 
revelations  were  received  by  Muhammad;  and  making  the  pil- 
grimage (hajj)  to  Mecca  at  least  once  during  one's  life  if  possi- 
ble. People  who  obey  God's  commandments  and  live  a  good 
life  will  go  to  heaven  after  death;  those  who  disobey  will  go  to 
hell.  All  souls  will  be  resurrected  for  a  last  judgment  at  the  end 
of  the  world.  Muslims  view  themselves  as  followers  of  the  same 
tradition  preserved  in  the  Judaic  and  Christian  scriptures, 
accept  the  prophetic  roles  of  Ibrahim  (Abraham),  Musa 
(Moses),  and  Isa  (Jesus),  and  view  Islam  as  the  final  statement 
of  revealed  truth  for  the  entire  world. 

Regulation  of  the  Muslim  community  rests  primarily  on 
rules  in  the  Quran,  then  on  authenticated  tales  of  the  conduct 
(sunna)  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad,  then  on  reasoning,  and 
finally  on  the  consensus  of  opinion.  By  the  end  of  the  eighth 
century,  four  main  schools  of  Muslim  jurisprudence  had 
emerged  in  Sunni  (see  Glossary)  Islam  to  interpret  the  sharia 
(Islamic  law).  Prominent  among  these  groups  was  the  Hanafi 
school,  which  dominated  most  of  India,  and  the  Shafii  school, 
which  was  more  prevalent  in  South  India.  Because  Islam  has  no 
ordained  priesthood,  direction  of  the  Muslim  community  rests 
on  the  learning  of  religious  scholars  (ulama)  who  are  expert  in 
understanding  the  Quran  and  its  appended  body  of  commen- 
taries. 

Early  leadership  controversies  within  the  Muslim  community 
led  to  divisions  that  still  have  an  impact  on  the  body  of  believ- 
ers. When  Muhammad  died,  leadership  fell  to  his  father-in-law, 
Abu  Bakr,  who  became  the  first  caliph  (khalifa,  or  successor),  a 
position  that  combined  spiritual  and  secular  power.  A  separate 
group  advocated  the  leadership  of  Ali,  the  cousin  and 
son-in-law  of  the  Prophet,  who  had  married  his  daughter 
Fatima.  Leadership  could  have  fallen  to  Ali's  son  Husayn,  but, 
in  the  power  struggle  that  followed,  in  680  Husayn  and  seventy- 
two  followers  were  murdered  at  Karbala  (now  in  modern  Iraq) .

Religious  Life 


This  leadership  dispute  formed  the  most  crucial  dividing 
point  in  Islamic  history:  the  victorious  party  went  on  to  found 
the  Umayyad  Dynasty  (661-750),  which  had  its  headquarters  at 
Damascus,  leading  the  majority  of  Muslims  in  the  Sunni  path. 
The  disaffected  Shiat  Ali  (or  Party  of  Ali)  viewed  only  his  line 
as  legitimate  and  continued  to  follow  descendants  of  Husayn  as 
their  leader  (imam — see  Glossary).  Among  the  followers  of  this 
Shia  (see  Glossary)  path,  there  is  a  party  of  "Seveners"  who 
trace  the  lineage  of  imams  down  to  Ismail  (d.  762),  the  Seventh 
Imam  and  eldest  son  of  the  Sixth  Imam.  The  Ismailis  are  the 
largest  Shia  group  in  India,  and  are  concentrated  in  Maharash- 
tra and  Gujarat.  A  second  group,  the  "Twelvers"  (the  most 
numerous  Shia  group  worldwide),  traces  the  lineage  of  imams 
through  twelve  generations,  believing  that  the  last  or  Twelfth 
Imam  became  "hidden"  and  will  reappear  in  the  world  as  a  sav- 
ior, or  Mahdi,  at  some  time  in  the  future. 

The  division  between  Sunni  and  Shia  dates  back  to  purely 
political  struggles  in  the  seventh  century,  but  over  time 
between  the  two  major  communities  many  divisive  differences 
in  ritual  and  legal  interpretations  have  evolved.  The  vast  major- 
ity of  Muslims  are  Sunni,  and  in  contemporary  India  90  per- 
cent of  Muslims  follow  this  path.  Sunnis  have  recognized  no 
legitimate  caliph  after  the  position  was  abolished  in  Turkey  in 
1924,  placing  the  direction  of  the  community  clearly  with  the 
ulama. 

Public  worship  for  the  average  Muslim  consists  of  going  to  a 
mosque  (masjid) — normally  on  Fridays,  although  mosques  are 
well  attended  throughout  the  week — for  congregational 
prayers  led  by  a  local  imam,  following  the  public  call  to  prayer, 
which  may  be  intoned  from  the  top  of  a  minaret  ( minar)  at  the 
mosque.  After  leaving  their  footwear  at  the  door,  men  and 
women  separate;  men  usually  sit  in  front,  women  in  back, 
either  inside  the  mosque  or  in  an  open  courtyard.  The  prayer 
leader  gives  a  sermon  in  the  local  regional  language,  perhaps 
interspersed  with  Arabic  or  Farsi  (sometimes  called  Persian  or 
Parsi)  quotations,  depending  on  his  learning  and  the  sophisti- 
cation of  the  audience.  Announcements  of  events  of  interest 
that  may  include  political  commentary  are  often  included. 
Then  follow  common  prayers  that  involve  responses  from  the 
worshipers  who  stand,  bow,  and  kneel  in  unison  during  devo- 
tions.

Islamic  Traditions  in  South  Asia 

Muslims  practice  a  series  of  life-cycle  rituals  that  differ  from 
those  of  Hindus,  Jains,  or  Buddhists.  The  newborn  baby  has 
the  call  to  prayer  whispered  into  the  left  ear,  the  profession  of 
faith  whispered  into  the  right  ear,  honey  or  date  paste  placed 
in  the  mouth,  and  a  name  selected.  On  the  sixth  day  after 
birth,  the  first  bath  occurs.  On  the  seventh  day  or  a  multiple  of 
the  seventh,  the  head  is  shaved,  and  alms  are  distributed,  ide- 
ally in  silver  weighing  as  much  as  the  hair;  a  sacrifice  of  animals 
imitates  the  sheep  sacrificed  instead  of  Ishmael  (Ismail)  in  bib- 
lical times.  Religious  instruction  starts  at  age  four  years,  four 
months,  and  four  days,  beginning  with  the  standard  phrase:  "In 
the  name  of  God,  the  Beneficent,  the  Merciful."  Male  circumci- 
sion takes  place  between  the  ages  of  seven  and  twelve.  Marriage 
requires  a  payment  by  the  husband  to  the  wife  and  the  solemni- 
zation of  a  marital  contract  in  a  social  gathering.  Marriage  cer- 
emonies include  the  donning  of  a  nose  ring  by  the  bride,  or  in 
South  India  a  wedding  necklace,  and  the  procession  of  the 
bridegroom.  In  a  traditional  wedding,  males  and  females 
attend  ceremonies  in  different  rooms,  in  keeping  with  the  seg- 
regation of  sexes  in  most  social  settings.  After  death  the  family 
members  wash  and  enshroud  the  body,  after  which  it  is  buried 
as  prayers  from  the  Quran  are  recited.  On  the  third  day,  friends 
and  relatives  come  to  console  the  bereaved,  read  the  Quran, 
and  pray  for  the  soul  of  the  deceased.  The  family  observe  a 
mourning  period  of  up  to  forty  days. 

The  annual  festivals  of  Islam  are  based  on  a  lunar  calendar 
of  354  days,  which  makes  the  Islamic  holy  year  independent  of 
the  Gregorian  calendar.  Muslim  festivals  make  a  complete  cir- 
cuit of  the  solar  year  every  thirty-three  years. 

The  beginning  of  the  Islamic  calendar  is  the  month  of 
Muharram,  the  tenth  day  of  which  is  Ashura,  the  anniversary  of 
the  death  of  Husayn,  the  son  of  Ali.  Ashura,  a  major  holiday,  is 
of  supreme  importance  for  the  Shia.  Devotees  engage  in  ritual- 
ized mourning  that  may  include  processions  of  colorful  repli- 
cas of  Husayn's  tomb  at  Karbala  and  standards  with  palms  on 
top,  which  are  carried  by  barefoot  mourners  and  buried  at  an 
imitation  Karbala.  In  many  areas  of  India,  these  parades  pro- 
vide a  dramatic  spectacle  that  draws  large  numbers  of 
non-Muslim  onlookers.  Demonstrations  of  grief  may  include 
bouts  of  self-flagellation  that  can  draw  blood  and  may  take 
place  in  public  streets,  although  many  families  retain  personal 
mourning  houses.  Sunni  Muslims  may  also  commemorate

Husayn's  death  but  in  a  less  demonstrative  manner,  concentrat- 
ing instead  on  the  redemptive  aspect  of  his  martyrdom. 

The  last  day  of  Ramazan  is  Id  al  Fitr  (Feast  of  Breaking  the 
Fast),  another  national  holiday,  which  ends  the  month  of  fast- 
ing with  almsgiving,  services  in  mosques,  and  visits  to  friends 
and  neighbors.  Bakr  Id,  or  Id  al  Zuha  (Feast  of  Sacrifice), 
begins  on  the  tenth  day  of  the  Islamic  month  of  Dhul  Hijjah 
and  is  a  major  holiday.  Prescribed  in  the  Quran,  Id  al  Zuha 
commemorates  Ibrahim's  willingness  to  sacrifice  Ishmael 
(rather  than  Ishaq — Isaac — as  in  the  Judeo-Christian  tradition) 
according  to  God's  command,  but  it  is  also  the  high  point  of 
the  pilgrim's  ritual  cycle  while  on  the  hajj  in  Mecca.  All  of  these 
festivals  involve  large  feasts,  gifts  given  to  family  and  neighbors, 
and  the  distribution  of  food  for  charitable  purposes. 

A  significant  aspect  of  Islam  in  India  is  the  importance  of 


159 


India:  A  Country  Study 

shrines  attached  to  the  memory  of  great  Sufi  saints.  Sufism  is  a 
mystical  path  (tariqat)  as  distinct  from  the  path  of  the  sharia.  A 
Sufi  attains  a  direct  vision  of  oneness  with  God,  often  on  the 
edges  of  orthodox  behavior,  and  can  thus  become  a  pir  (living 
saint)  who  may  take  on  disciples  (murids)  and  set  up  a  spiritual 
lineage  that  can  last  for  generations.  Orders  of  Sufis  became 
important  in  India  during  the  thirteenth  century  following  the 
ministry  of  Muinuddin  Chishti  (1142-1236),  who  settled  in 
Ajmer,  Raj  as  than,  and  attracted  large  numbers  of  converts  to 
Islam  because  of  his  holiness.  His  Chishtiyya  order  went  on  to 
become  the  most  influential  Sufi  lineage  in  India,  although 
other  orders  from  Central  Asia  and  Southwest  Asia  also 
reached  to  India  and  played  a  large  role  in  the  spread  of  Islam. 
Many  Sufis  were  well  known  for  weaving  music,  dance,  intoxi- 
cants, and  local  folktales  into  their  songs  and  lectures.  In  this 
way,  they  created  a  large  literature  in  regional  languages  that 
embedded  Islamic  culture  deeply  into  older  South  Asian  tradi- 
tions. 

In  the  case  of  many  great  teachers,  the  memory  of  their  holi- 
ness has  been  so  intense  that  they  are  still  viewed  as  active  inter- 
cessors with  God,  and  their  tombs  have  become  the  site  of  rites 
and  prayers  by  disciples  and  lay  people  alike.  Tales  of  miracu- 
lous deeds  associated  with  the  tombs  of  great  saints  have 
attracted  large  numbers  of  pilgrims  attempting  to  gain  cures 
for  physical  maladies  or  solutions  to  personal  problems.  The 
tomb  of  the  pir  thus  becomes  a  dargah  (gateway)  to  God  and 
the  focus  for  a  wide  range  of  rituals,  such  as  daily  washing  and 
decoration  by  professional  attendants,  touching  or  kissing  the 
tomb  or  contact  with  the  water  that  has  washed  it,  hanging  peti- 
tions on  the  walls  of  the  shrine  surrounding  the  tomb,  lighting 
incense,  and  giving  money. 

The  descendants  of  the  original  pir  are  sometimes  seen  as 
inheritors  of  his  spiritual  energy,  and,  as  pirs  in  their  own  right, 
they  might  dispense  amulets  sanctified  by  contact  with  them  or 
with  the  tomb.  The  annual  celebration  of  the  pir's  death  is  a 
major  event  at  important  shrines,  attracting  hundreds  of  thou- 
sands of  devotees  for  celebrations  that  may  last  for  days.  Free 
communal  kitchens  and  distribution  of  sweets  are  also  big 
attractions  of  these  festivals,  at  which  Muslim  fakirs,  or  wander- 
ing ascetics,  sometimes  appear  and  where  public  demonstra- 
tions of  self-mortification,  such  as  miraculous  piercing  of  the 
body  and  spiritual  possession  of  devotees,  sometimes  occur. 
Every  region  of  India  can  boast  of  at  least  one  major  Sufi  shrine

that  attracts  expressive  devotion,  which  remains  important, 
especially  for  Muslim  women. 

The  leadership  of  the  Muslim  community  has  pursued  vari- 
ous directions  in  the  evolution  of  Indian  Islam  during  the  twen- 
tieth century.  The  most  conservative  wing  has  typically  rested 
on  the  education  system  provided  by  the  hundreds  of  religious 
training  institutes  (madrasa)  throughout  the  country,  which 
have  tended  to  stress  the  study  of  the  Quran  and  Islamic  texts 
in  Arabic  and  Persian,  and  have  focused  little  on  modern  man- 
agerial and  technical  skills  (see  Education  and  Society,  ch.  2). 
Several  national  movements  have  emerged  from  this  sector  of 
the  Muslim  community.  The  Jamaati  Islami  (Islamic  Party), 
founded  in  1941,  advocates  the  establishment  of  an  overtly 
Islamic  government  through  peaceful,  democratic,  and  non- 
missionary  activities.  It  had  about  3,000  active  members  and 
40,000  sympathizers  in  the  mid-1980s.  The  Tablighi  Jamaat 
(Outreach  Society)  became  active  after  the  1940s  as  a  move- 
ment, primarily  among  the  ulama,  stressing  personal  renewal, 
prayer,  a  missionary  and  cooperative  spirit,  and  attention  to 
orthodoxy.  It  has  been  highly  critical  of  the  kind  of  activities 
that  occur  in  and  around  Sufi  shrines  and  remains  a  minor  if 
respected  force  in  the  training  of  the  ulama.  Other  ulama  have 


161 


India:  A  Country  Study 

upheld  the  legitimacy  of  mass  religion,  including  exaltation  of 
pin  and  the  memory  of  the  Prophet.  A  powerful  secularizing 
drive  led  to  the  founding  of  Aligarh  Muslim  University 
(founded  in  1S75  as  the  Muhammadan  Anglo-Oriental  Col- 
lege)— with  its  modern  curriculum — and  other  major  Muslim 
universities.  This  educational  drive  has  remained  the  most 
dominant  force  in  guiding  the  Muslim  community. 

Sikhism 

Sikhism  has  about  20  million  believers  worldwide  but  has  an 
importance  far  bevond  those  numbers  because  Sikhs  have 
plaved  a  disproportionately  large  role  in  the  armed  forces  and 
public  affairs  in  India  for  the  last  400  years.  Although  most 
Indian  Sikhs  (  79  percent)  remain  concentrated  in  the  state  of 
Punjab,  nearlv  3.5  million  Sikhs  live  outside  the  state,  while 
about  4  million  live  abroad.  This  Sikh  diaspora,  driven  bv  ambi- 
tion and  economic  success,  has  made  Sikhism  a  world  religion 
as  well  as  a  significant  minority  force  within  the  country 

Early  History  and  Tenets 

Sikhism  be^an  with  Guru  Xanak  ( 1469-1539).  a  member  of 
a  trading  caste  in  Punjab  who  seems  to  have  been  employed  for 
some  time  as  a  government  servant,  was  married  and  had  two 
sons,  and  at  age  forty-five  became  a  religious  teacher.  At  the 
heart  of  his  message  was  a  philosophy  of  universal  love,  devo- 
tion to  God.  and  the  equality  of  all  men  and  women  before 
God.  He  set  up  congregations  of  believers  who  ate  together  in 
free  communal  kitchens  in  an  overt  attempt  to  break  down 
caste  boundaries  based  on  food  prohibitions.  As  a  poet,  musi- 
cian, and  enlightened  master.  Xanak's  reputation  spread,  and 
bv  the  time  he  died  he  had  founded  a  new  religion  of  "disci- 
ples" ( shiksha  or  sikh)  that  followed  his  example. 

Xanak's  son.  Baba  Sri  Chand.  founded  the  Udasi  sect  of  celi- 
bate ascetics,  which  continued  in  the  1990s.  However.  Xanak 
chose  as  his  successor  not  his  son  but  Angad  (1504-52)  .  his 
chief  disciple,  to  carrv  on  the  work  as  the  second  guru.  Thus 
began  a  lineage  of  teachers  that  lasted  until  1  70S  and 
amounted  to  ten  gurus  in  the  Sikh  tradition,  each  of  whom  is 
\iewed  as  an  enlightened  master  who  propounded  directly  the 
word  of  God.  The  third  guru3  Amar  Das  |  1479-1574).  estab- 
lished missionary  centers  to  spread  the  message  and  was  so  well 
respected  that  the  Mughal  emperor  Akbar  visited  him  ( see  The 


162 


Religious  Life 


Mughals,  ch.  1).  Amar  Das  appointed  his  son-in-law  Ram  Das 
(1534-81)  to  succeed  him,  establishing  a  hereditary  succession 
for  the  position  of  guru.  He  also  built  a  tank  for  water  at  Amrit- 
sar  in  Punjab,  which,  after  his  death,  became  the  holiest  center 
of  Sikhism. 

By  the  late  sixteenth  century,  the  influence  of  the  Sikh  reli- 
gion on  Punjabi  society  was  coming  to  the  notice  of  political 
authorities.  The  fifth  guru,  Arjun  Das  (1563-1606),  was  exe- 
cuted in  Lahore  by  the  Mughal  emperor  Jahangir  (r.  1605-27) 
for  alleged  complicity  in  a  rebellion.  In  response,  the  next 
guru,  Hargobind  (d.  1644),  militarized  and  politicized  his  posi- 
tion and  fought  three  battles  with  Mughal  forces.  Hargobind 
established  a  militant  tradition  of  resistance  to  persecution  by 
the  central  government  in  Delhi  that  remains  an  important 
motif  in  Sikh  consciousness.  Hargobind  also  established  at 
Amritsar,  in  front  of  the  Golden  Temple,  the  central  shrine 
devoted  to  Sikhism,  the  Throne  of  the  Eternal  God  (Akal 
Takht)  from  which  the  guru  dispensed  justice  and  adminis- 
tered the  secular  affairs  of  the  community,  clearly  establishing 
the  tradition  of  a  religious  state  that  remains  a  major  issue.  The 
ninth  guru,  Tegh  Bahadur  (1621-75),  because  he  refused 
Mughal  emperor  Aurangzeb's  order  to  convert  to  Islam,  was 
brought  to  Delhi  and  beheaded  on  a  site  that  later  became  an 
important  gurdwara  (abode  of  the  guru,  a  Sikh  temple)  on 
Chandni  Chauk,  one  of  the  old  city's  main  thoroughfares. 

These  events  led  the  tenth  guru,  Gobind  Singh  (1666- 
1708),  to  transform  the  Sikhs  into  a  militant  brotherhood  dedi- 
cated to  defense  of  their  faith  at  all  times.  He  instituted  a  bap- 
tism ceremony  involving  the  immersion  of  a  sword  in  sugared 
water  that  initiates  Sikhs  into  the  Khalsa  (khalsa,  from  the  Per- 
sian term  for  "the  king's  own,"  often  taken  to  mean  army  of  the 
pure)  of  dedicated  devotion.  The  outward  signs  of  this  new 
order  were  the  "Five  Ks"  to  be  observed  at  all  times:  uncut  hair 
(kesh),  a  long  knife  (kirpari),  a  comb  (kangha),  a.  steel  bangle 
(kard),  and  a  special  kind  of  breeches  not  reaching  below  the 
knee  (kachha).  Male  Sikhs  took  on  the  surname  Singh  (mean- 
ing lion),  and  women  took  the  surname  Kaur  (princess).  All 
made  vows  to  purify  their  personal  behavior  by  avoiding  intoxi- 
cants, including  alcohol  and  tobacco.  In  modern  India,  male 
Sikhs  who  have  dedicated  themselves  to  the  Khalsa  do  not  cut 
their  beards  and  keep  their  long  hair  tied  up  under  turbans, 
preserving  a  distinctive  personal  appearance  recognized 
throughout  the  world.

Much  of  Guru  Gobind  Singh's  later  life  was  spent  on  the 
move,  in  guerrilla  campaigns  against  the  Mughal  Empire., 
which  was  entering  the  last  days  of  its  effective  authority  under 
Aurangzeb  (1658-1707).  .After  Gobind  Singh's  death,  the  line 
of  gurus  ended,  and  their  message  continued  through  the  Adi 
Granth  (Original  Book),  which  dates  from  1604  and  later 
became  known  as  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib  (Holy  Book  of  the 
Gurus).  The  Guru  Granth  Sahib  is  revered  as  a  continuation  of 
the  line  of  gurus  and  as  the  living  word  of  God  bv  all  Sikhs  and 
stands  at  the  heart  of  all  ceremonies. 

Most  of  the  Sikh  gurus  were  excellent  musicians,  who  com- 
posed songs  that  conveved  their  message  to  the  masses  in  the 
saints'  own  language,  which  combined  variants  of  Punjabi  with 
Hindi  and  Braj  and  also  contained  Arabic  and  Persian  vocabu- 
lary Written  in  Gurmukhi  script,  these  songs  are  one  of  the 
main  sources  of  earlv  Punjabi  language  and  literature.  There 
are  5. $94  hvmns  in  all.  arranged  according  to  the  musical  mea- 
sure  in  which  thev  are  sung.  An  interesting  feature  of  this  liter- 
ature  is  that  937  songs  and  poems  are  bv  well-known  bhakti 
saints  who  were  not  members  of  the  lineage  of  Sikh  gurus, 
including  the  North  Indian  saint  Kabir  and  five  Muslim  devo- 
tees. In  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib,  God  is  called  bv  all  the  Hindu 
names  and  bv  Allah  as  well.  From  its  beginnings,  then.  Sikhism 
was  an  inclusive  faith  that  attempted  to  encompass  and  enrich 
other  Indian  religious  traditions. 

The  belief  system  propounded  bv  the  gurus  has  its  origins  in 
the  philosophy  and  devotions  of  Hinduism  and  Islam,  but  the 
formulation  of  Sikhism  is  unique.  God  is  the  creator  of  the  uni- 
verse and  is  without  qualities  or  differentiation  in  himself.  The 
universe  (  samsar)  is  not  sinful  in  its  origin  but  is  covered  with 
impurities:  it  is  not  suffering,  but  a  transitory  opportunity  for 
the  soul  to  recognize  its  true  nature  and  break  the  cvcle  of 
rebirth.  The  unregenerate  person  is  dominated  bv  self-interest 
and  remains  immersed  in  illusion  (  ma\a).  leading  to  bad 
karma.  Meanwhile.  God  desires  that  his  creatures  escape  and 
achieve  enlightenment  (nirvana)  bv  recognizing  his  order  in 
the  universe.  He  does  this  bv  manifesting  his  grace  as  a  holy 
word,  attainable  through  recognition  and  recitation  of  God's 
holv  name  (  nam).  The  role  of  the  guru,  who  is  the  manifesta- 
tion of  God  in  the  world,  is  to  teach  the  means  for  praver 
through  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib  and  the  community  of  believers. 
The  guru  in  this  system,  and  bv  extension  the  Guru  Granth

Sahib,  are  coexistent  with  the  divine  and  play  a  decisive  role  in 
saving  the  world. 

Where  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib  is  present,  that  place  becomes 
a  gurdwara.  Many  Sikh  homes  contain  separate  rooms  or  desig- 
nated areas  where  a  copy  of  the  book  stands  as  the  center  of 
devotional  ceremonies.  Throughout  Punjab,  or  anywhere  there 
is  a  substantial  body  of  believers,  there  are  special  shrines 
where  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib  is  displayed  permanently  or  is 
installed  daily  in  a  ceremonial  manner.  These  public  gurdwaras 
are  the  centers  of  Sikh  community  life  and  the  scene  of  peri- 
odic assemblies  for  worship.  The  typical  assembly  involves 
group  singing  from  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib,  led  by  distinguished 
believers  or  professional  singers  attached  to  the  shrine,  distri- 
bution of  holy  food,  and  perhaps  a  sermon  delivered  by  the 
custodian  of  the  shrine.

As  for  domestic  and  life-cycle  rituals,  well  into  the  twentieth 
century  many  Sikhs  followed  Hindu  customs  for  birth,  mar- 
riage, and  death  ceremonies,  including  readings  from  Hindu 
scriptures  and  the  employment  of  Brahmans  as  officiants. 
Reform  movements  within  the  Sikh  community  have  purged 
many  of  these  customs,  substituting  instead  readings  from  the 
Guru  Granth  Sahib  as  the  focus  for  rituals  and  the  employment 
of  Sikh  ritual  specialists.  At  major  public  events — weddings, 
funerals,  or  opening  a  new  business — patrons  may  fund  a  read- 
ing of  the  entire  Guru  Granth  Sahib  by  special  reciters. 

Twentieth-Century  Developments 

The  existence  of  the  Khalsa  creates  a  potential  division 
within  the  Sikh  community  between  those  who  have  under- 
gone the  baptism  ceremony  and  those  who  practice  the  system 
laid  down  in  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib  but  who  do  not  adopt  the 
distinctive  life-style  of  the  Khalsa.  Among  the  latter  is  a  sect  of 
believers  founded  by  Baba  Dayal  (d.  1853)  named  the  Niran- 
karis,  who  concentrate  on  the  formless  quality  of  God  and  his 
revelation  purely  through  the  guru  and  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib, 
and  who  accept  the  existence  of  a  living,  enlightened  teacher 
as  essential  for  spiritual  development.  The  dominant  tendency 
among  the  Sikhs  since  the  late  nineteenth  century  has  been  to 
stress  the  importance  of  the  Khalsa  and  its  outward  signs. 

Revivalist  movements  of  the  late  nineteenth  century  cen- 
tered on  the  activities  of  the  Singh  Sabha  (Assembly  of  Lions), 
who  successfully  moved  much  of  the  Sikh  community  toward 
their  own  ritual  systems  and  away  from  Hindu  customs,  and 
culminated  in  the  Akali  (eternal)  mass  movement  in  the  1920s 
to  take  control  of  gurdwaras  away  from  Hindu  managers  and 
invest  it  in  an  organization  representing  the  Sikhs.  The  result 
was  passage  of  the  Sikh  Gurdwara  Act  of  1925,  which  estab- 
lished the  Central  Gurdwara  Management  Committee  to  man- 
age all  Sikh  shrines  in  Punjab,  Haryana,  and  Himachal  Pradesh 
through  an  assembly  of  elected  Sikhs.  The  combined  revenues 
of  hundreds  of  shrines,  which  collected  regular  contributions 
and  income  from  endowments,  gave  the  committee  a  large 
operating  budget  and  considerable  authority  over  the  religious 
life  of  the  community.  A  simultaneous  process  led  to  the  Akali 
Dal  (Eternal  Party),  a  political  organization  that  originally 
coordinated  nonviolent  agitations  to  gain  control  over  gur- 
dwaras, then  participated  in  the  independence  struggle,  and 
since  1947  has  competed  for  control  over  the  Punjab  state  gov-

eminent.  The  ideology  of  the  Akali  Dal  is  simple  — 
single-minded  devotion  to  the  guru  and  preservation  of  the 
Sikh  faith  through  political  power — and  the  party  has  served  to 
mobilize  a  majority  of  Sikhs  in  Punjab  around  issues  that  stress 
Sikh  separatism. 

There  is  no  official  priesthood  within  Sikhism  or  any  widely 
accepted  institutional  mechanism  for  policy  making  for  the 
entire  faith.  Instead,  decisions  are  made  by  communities  of 
believers  (sangat)  based  on  the  Guru  Granth  Sahib — a  tradition 
dating  back  to  the  eighteenth  century  when  scattered  bodies  of 
believers  had  to  fight  against  persecution  and  manage  their 
own  affairs.  Anyone  may  study  the  scriptures  intensively  and 
become  a  "knower"  (giant)  who  is  recognized  by  fellow  believ- 
ers, and  there  is  a  variety  of  training  institutes  with  full-time  stu- 
dents and  teachers. 

Leaders  of  sects  and  sectarian  training  institutions  may  feel 
free  to  issue  their  own  orders.  When  these  orders  are  com- 
bined with  the  prestige  and  power  of  the  Central  Gurdwara 
Management  Committee  and  the  Akali  Dal,  which  have  explic- 
itly narrow  administrative  goals  and  are  often  faction-ridden,  a 
mixture  of  images  and  authority  emerges  that  often  leaves  the 
religion  as  a  whole  without  clear  leadership.  Thus  it  became 
possible  for  Sant  Jarnail  Singh  Bhindranwale,  head  of  a  train- 
ing institution,  to  stand  forth  as  a  leading  authority  on  the 
direction  of  Sikhism;  initiate  reforms  of  personal  morality;  par- 
ticipate in  the  persecution  of  Nirankaris;  and  take  effective 
control  of  the  holiest  Sikh  shrine,  the  Golden  Temple  in  Amrit- 
sar,  Punjab,  in  the  early  1980s.  His  takeover  of  the  Golden  Tem- 
ple led  to  a  violent  siege  and  culminated  in  the  devastation  of 
the  shrine  by  the  army  in  1984  (see  The  Rise  of  Indira  Gandhi, 
ch.  1;  Insurgent  Movements  and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10). 
Later  terrorist  activities  in  Punjab,  carried  out  in  the  name  of 
Sikhism,  were  performed  by  a  wide  range  of  organizations 
claiming  to  represent  an  authoritative  vision  of  the  nature  and 
direction  of  the  community  as  a  whole. 

Other  Minority  Religions 

Tribal  Religions 

Among  the  68  million  citizens  of  India  who  are  members  of 
tribal  groups,  the  religious  concepts,  terminologies,  and  prac- 
tices are  as  varied  as  the  hundreds  of  tribes,  but  members  of 
these  groups  have  one  thing  in  common:  they  are  under  con- 


167 


India:  A  Country  Study 


stant  pressure  from  the  major  organized  religions.  Some  of  this 
pressure  is  intentional,  as  outside  missionaries  work  among 
tribal  groups  to  gain  converts.  Most  of  the  pressure,  however, 
comes  from  the  process  of  integration  within  a  national  politi- 
cal and  economic  system  that  brings  tribes  into  increasing  con- 
tact with  other  groups  and  different,  prestigious  belief  systems. 
In  general,  those  tribes  that  remain  geographically  isolated  in 
desert,  hill,  and  forest  regions  or  on  islands  are  able  to  retain 
their  traditional  cultures  and  religions  longer.  Those  tribes  that 
make  the  transition  away  from  hunting  and  gathering  and 
toward  sedentary  agriculture,  usually  as  low-status  laborers, 
find  their  ancient  religious  forms  in  decay  and  their  place  filled 
by  practices  of  Hinduism,  Islam,  Christianity,  or  Buddhism. 

One  of  the  most  studied  tribal  religions  is  that  of  the  Santal 
of  Orissa,  Bihar,  and  West  Bengal,  one  of  the  largest  tribes  in 
India,  having  a  population  estimated  at  4.2  million.  According 
to  the  1991  census,  however,  only  23,645  people  listed  Santal  as 
their  religious  belief. 

According  to  the  Santal  religion,  the  supreme  deity,  who  ulti- 
mately controls  the  entire  universe,  is  Thakurji.  The  weight  of 
belief,  however,  falls  on  a  court  of  spirits  (bonga),  who  handle 
different  aspects  of  the  world  and  who  must  be  placated  with 
prayers  and  offerings  in  order  to  ward  off  evil  influences. 
These  spirits  operate  at  the  village,  household,  ancestor,  and 
subclan  level,  along  with  evil  spirits  that  cause  disease,  and  can 
inhabit  village  boundaries,  mountains,  water,  tigers,  and  the 
forest.  A  characteristic  feature  of  the  Santal  village  is  a  sacred 
grove  on  the  edge  of  the  settlement  where  many  spirits  live  and 
where  a  series  of  annual  festivals  take  place. 

The  most  important  spirit  is  Maran  Buru  (Great  Mountain), 
who  is  invoked  whenever  offerings  are  made  and  who 
instructed  the  first  Santals  in  sex  and  brewing  of  rice  beer. 
Maran  Buru's  consort  is  the  benevolent  Jaher  Era  (Lady  of  the 
Grove). 

A  yearly  round  of  rituals  connected  with  the  agricultural 
cycle,  along  with  life-cycle  rituals  for  birth,  marriage  and  burial 
at  death,  involves  petitions  to  the  spirits  and  offerings  that 
include  the  sacrifice  of  animals,  usually  birds.  Religious  leaders 
are  male  specialists  in  medical  cures  who  practice  divination 
and  witchcraft.  Similar  beliefs  are  common  among  other  tribes 
of  northeast  and  central  India  such  as  the  Kharia,  Munda,  and 
Oraon. 


168 


Religious  Life 


Smaller  and  more  isolated  tribes  often  demonstrate  less 
articulated  classification  systems  of  the  spiritual  hierarchy, 
described  as  animism  or  a  generalized  worship  of  spiritual 
energies  connected  with  locations,  activities,  and  social  groups. 
Religious  concepts  are  intricately  entwined  with  ideas  about 
nature  and  interaction  with  local  ecological  systems.  As  in  San- 
tal  religion,  religious  specialists  are  drawn  from  the  village  or 
family  and  serve  a  wide  range  of  spiritual  functions  that  focus 
on  placating  potentially  dangerous  spirits  and  coordinating  rit- 
uals. 

Unlike  the  Santal,  who  have  a  large  population  long  accus- 
tomed to  agriculture  and  a  distinguished  history  of  resistance 
to  outsiders,  many  smaller  tribal  groups  are  quite  sensitive  to 
ecological  degradation  caused  by  modernization,  and  their 
unique  religious  beliefs  are  under  constant  threat.  Even  among 
the  Santal,  there  are  300,000  Christians  who  are  alienated  from 
traditional  festivals,  although  even  among  converts  the  belief 
in  the  spirits  remains  strong.  Among  the  Munda  and  Oraon  in 
Bihar,  about  25  percent  of  the  population  are  Christians. 
Among  the  Kharia  of  Bihar  (population  about  130,000),  about 
60  percent  are  Christians,  but  all  are  heavily  influenced  by 
Hindu  concepts  of  major  deities  and  the  annual  Hindu  cycle  of 
festivals.  Tribal  groups  in  the  Himalayas  were  similarly  affected 
by  both  Hinduism  and  Buddhism  in  the  late  twentieth  century. 
Even  the  small  hunting-and-gathering  groups  in  the  union  ter- 
ritory of  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands  have  been  under  severe 
pressure  because  of  immigration  to  this  area  and  the  resulting 
reduction  of  their  hunting  area. 

Christianity 

The  first  Christians  in  India,  according  to  tradition  and  leg- 
end, were  converted  by  Saint  Thomas  the  Apostle,  who  arrived 
on  the  Malabar  Coast  of  India  in  A.D.  52.  After  evangelizing 
and  performing  miracles  in  Kerala  and  Tamil  Nadu,  he  is 
believed  to  have  been  martyred  in  Madras  and  buried  on  the 
site  of  San  Thome  Cathedral.  Members  of  the  Syro-Malabar 
Church,  an  eastern  rite  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church, 
adopted  the  Syriac  liturgy  dating  from  fourth  century  Antioch. 
They  practiced  what  is  also  known  as  the  Malabar  rite  until  the 
arrival  of  the  Portuguese  in  the  late  fifteenth  century.  Soon 
thereafter,  the  Portuguese  attempted  to  latinize  the  Malabar 
rite,  an  action  which,  by  the  mid-sixteenth  century,  led  to 
charges  of  heresy  against  the  Syro-Malabar  Church  and  a 


169 


India:  A  Country  Study 

lengthy  round  of  political  machinations.  By  the  middle  of  the 
next  century,  a  schism  occurred  when  the  adherents  of  the 
Malankar  rite  (or  Syro-Malankara  Church)  broke  away  from 
the  Syro-Malabar  Church.  Fragmentation  continued  within  the 
Syro-Malabar  Church  up  through  the  early  twentieth  century 
when  a  large  contingent  left  to  join  the  Nestorian  Church, 
which  had  had  its  own  roots  in  India  since  the  sixth  or  seventh 
century.  By  1887,  however,  the  leaders  of  the  Syro-Malabar 
Church  had  reconciled  with  Rome,  which  formally  recognized 
the  legitimacy  of  the  Malabar  rite.  The  Syro-Malankara  Church 
was  reconciled  with  Rome  in  1930  and,  while  retaining  the  Syr- 
iac  liturgy,  adopted  the  Malayalam  language  instead  of  the 
ancient  Syriac  language. 

Throughout  this  period,  foreign  missionaries  made  numer- 
ous converts  to  Christianity.  Early  Roman  Catholic  missionar- 
ies, particularly  the  Portuguese,  led  by  the  Jesuit  Saint  Francis 
Xavier  (1506-52),  expanded  from  their  bases  on  the  west  coast 
making  many  converts,  especially  among  lower  castes  and  out- 
castes.  The  miraculously  undecayed  body  of  Saint  Francis 
Xavier  is  still  on  public  view  in  a  glass  coffin  at  the  Basilica  of 
Bom  Jesus  in  Goa.  Beginning  in  the  eighteenth  century,  Protes- 
tant missionaries  began  to  work  throughout  India,  leading  to 
the  growth  of  Christian  communities  of  many  varieties. 

The  total  number  of  Christians  in  India  according  to  the 
1991  census  was  19.6  million,  or  2.3  percent  of  the  population. 
About  13.8  million  of  these  Christians  were  Roman  Catholics, 
including  300,000  members  of  the  Syro-Malankara  Church. 
The  remainder  of  Roman  Catholics  were  under  the  Catholic 
Bishops'  Conference  of  India.  In  January  1993,  after  centuries 
of  self-government,  the  3 .5-million-strong  Latin-rite 
Syro-Malabar  Church  was  raised  to  archepiscopate  status  as 
part  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  In  total,  there  were  nine- 
teen archbishops,  103  bishops,  and  about  15,000  priests  in 
India  in  1995. 

Most  Protestant  denominations  are  represented  in  India,  the 
result  of  missionary  activities  throughout  the  country,  starting 
with  the  onset  of  British  rule.  Most  denominations,  however, 
are  almost  exclusively  staffed  by  Indians,  and  the  role  of  for- 
eign missionaries  is  limited.  The  largest  Protestant  denomina- 
tion in  the  country  is  the  Church  of  South  India,  since  1947  a 
union  of  Presbyterian,  Reformed,  Congregational,  Methodist, 
and  Anglican  congregations  with  approximately  2.2  million 
members.  A  similar  Church  of  North  India  has  1  million  mem- 


170 


Religious  Life 


bers.  There  are  473,000  Methodists,  425,000  Baptists,  and 
about  1.3  million  Lutherans.  Orthodox  churches  of  the  Malan- 
kara  and  Malabar  rites  total  2  million  and  700,000  members, 
respectively. 

All  Christian  churches  have  found  the  most  fertile  ground 
for  expansion  among  Dalits,  Scheduled  Castes,  and  Scheduled 
Tribe  groups  (see  Tribes,  ch.  4).  During  the  twentieth  century, 
the  fastest  growing  Christian  communities  have  been  located  in 
the  northeast,  among  the  Khasis,  Mizos,  Nagas,  and  other  hill 
tribes.  Christianity  offers  a  non-Hindu  mode  of  acculturation 
during  a  period  when  the  state  and  modern  economy  have 
been  radically  transforming  the  life-styles  of  the  hill  peoples. 
Missionaries  have  led  the  way  in  the  development  of  written 
languages  and  literature  for  many  tribal  groups.  Christian 
churches  have  provided  a  focus  for  unity  among  different  eth- 
nic groups  and  have  brought  with  them  a  variety  of  charitable 
services. 

Zoroastrianism 

According  to  the  1991  census,  there  were  79,382  members  of 
the  Zoroastrian  faith.  Some  79  percent  lived  in  Maharashtra 
(primarily  in  Bombay)  and  most  of  the  rest  in  Gujarat.  Zoroas- 
trians  are  primarily  descendants  of  tenth-century  immigrants 
from  Persia  who  preserved  the  religion  of  Zoroaster,  a  prophet 
of  Iran  who  taught  probably  in  the  sixth  century  B.C.  Although 
the  number  of  Parsis  steadily  declined  during  the  twentieth 
century  as  a  result  of  emigration  and  low  birth  rates,  their  reli- 
gion is  significant  because  of  the  financial  influence  wielded  by 
this  mostly  trading  community  and  because  they  represent  the 
world's  largest  surviving  group  of  believers  in  this  ancient  faith. 

Originally,  the  Parsis  were  shipbuilders  and  traders  located 
in  the  ports  and  towns  of  Gujarat.  Their  freedom  from  food  or 
occupational  restrictions  based  on  caste  affiliation  enabled 
them  to  take  advantage  of  the  numerous  commercial  opportu- 
nities that  accompanied  the  colonial  expansion  of  trade  and 
control.  Substantial  numbers  moved  to  Bombay,  which  served 
as  a  base  for  expanding  their  business  activities  throughout 
India  and  abroad.  A  combination  of  Western  commercial  con- 
tacts and  English-language  education  during  the  colonial 
period  made  the  Parsis  arguably  the  most  cosmopolitan  com- 
munity in  India.  Socially,  they  were  equally  at  home  with  Indi- 
ans and  Westerners;  Parsi  women  enjoyed  freedom  of 
movement  earlier  than  most  high-caste  Hindu  or  upper-class 


171

Muslim  women.  In  contemporary  India,  Parsis  are  the  most 
urban,  elite,  and  wealthy  of  any  of  the  nation's  religious  groups. 
Their  role  in  the  development  of  trade,  industry,  finance,  and 
philanthropy  has  earned  them  an  important  place  in  the  coun- 
try's social  and  economic  life,  and  several  have  achieved  high 
rank  in  government. 

The  source  of  Parsi  religion  is  a  body  of  texts  called  the 
Avesta,  which  includes  a  number  of  sections  in  archaic  lan- 
guage attributed  to  Zoroaster  himself,  and  which  preserve  the 
cult  of  the  fire  sacrifice  as  the  focus  of  ritual  life.  The  supreme 
spirit  is  Ahura  Mazda  (or  Ohrmazd),  whose  will  is  manifest  in 
the  world  through  the  actions  of  bountiful  immortals  or  good 
spiritual  attributes  that  support  life  and  love.  Opposing  the 
supreme  spirit  is  the  force  of  evil,  Angra  Mainyu  (or  Ahriman), 
which  is  the  cause  of  all  destruction  and  corruption  in  the 
world.  Equipped  with  free  will,  humans  can  choose  sides  in  this 
struggle  and  after  death  will  appear  at  the  bridge  of  judgment. 
People  who  choose  to  do  good  deeds  go  to  heaven,  those  who 
commit  evil  go  to  hell.  The  opposed  cosmic  forces  battle 
through  the  history  of  the  universe,  until  at  the  end  of  time 
there  will  be  a  final  judgment  and  a  resurrection  of  the  dead  to 
a  perfect  world. 

The  extensive  ritual  life  of  devout  Parsis  revolves  around 
sacred  fires,  of  which  there  are  three  grades  dependent  on 
extensive  ceremonial  preparation.  The  highest  two  grades  can 
only  be  maintained  in  fire  temples  by  hereditary  priests,  who 
undergo  extensive  purificatory  rites  and  wear  special  face 
masks  to  prevent  polluting  the  flames  with  breath  or  saliva, 
while  the  third  grade  of  fire  can  exist  in  the  household.  The 
most  important  rite  for  most  lay  people  is  the  Navjote,  which 
occurs  between  the  seventh  and  fifteenth  year  of  life,  and  ini- 
tiates the  young  person  into  the  adult  community.  The  cere- 
mony involves  purifying  bathing,  reciting  Av £5ta-based 
scriptures,  and  being  invested  with  a  sacred  shirt  (sudrah)  and 
waist  thread  (kusti)  that  should  always  be  worn  thereafter.  Mar- 
riage is  also  an  important  rite,  complete  with  scriptural  recita- 
tions. At  death,  great  care  is  taken  to  avoid  pollution  from  the 
body,  and  funeral  services  usually  take  place  within  twenty-four 
hours.  The  dead  are  then  disposed  of  by  exposure  to  vultures 
on  large,  circular  "towers  of  silence"  (dakhma).  Most  rituals 
take  place  in  the  home  or  in  special  pavilions;  congregational 
worship  at  fire  temples  is  limited  to  spring  and  autumn  festi- 
vals.

The  towns  of  Sanjan,  Nausari,  and  Udvada  in  Gujarat  are  of 
prime  importance  to  Parsis,  having  long  served  as  community 
centers  before  mass  migration  to  Bombay  in  the  nineteenth 
century  Bombay  is  home  to  70  percent  of  India's  Parsis,  where 
the  management  of  Parsi  affairs  rests  in  the  hands  of  a  pan- 
chayat  (see  Glossary),  the  assembly  that  serves  as  a  charitable 
and  educational  organization  providing  a  comprehensive 
social  welfare  system  at  the  local  level. 

Judaism 

Trade  contacts  between  the  Mediterranean  region  and  the 
west  coast  of  India  probably  led  to  the  presence  of  small  Jewish 
settlements  in  India  as  long  ago  as  the  early  first  millennium 
B.C.  In  Kerala  a  community  of  Jews  tracing  its  origin  to  the  fall 
of  Jerusalem  in  A.D.  70  has  remained  associated  with  the  cities 
of  Cranganore  and  Kochi  (formerly  known  as  Cochin)  for  at 
least  1,000  years.  The  Pardesi  Synagogue  in  Kochi,  rebuilt  in 
1568,  is  in  the  architectural  style  of  Kerala  but  preserves  the 
archaic  ritual  style  of  the  Sephardic  rite,  with  Babylonian  and 
Yemenite  influence  as  well.  The  Jews  of  Kochi,  concentrated 
mostly  in  the  old  'Jew  Town,"  were  completely  integrated  into 
local  culture,  speaking  Malayalam  and  taking  local  names  while 
preserving  their  knowledge  of  Hebrew  and  contacts  with

Southwest  Asia.  A  separate  community  of  Jews,  called  the  Bene 
Israel.,  had  lived  along  the  Konkan  Coast  in  and  around  Bom- 
bay. Pune.  and  Ahmadabad  for  almost  2.000  Years.  Unlike  the 
Kochi  Jews,  they  became  a  village-based  society  and  maintained 
little  contact  with  other  Jewish  communities.  Thev  always 
remained  within  the  orthodox  Jewish  fold,  practicing  the 
Sephardic  rite  without  rabbis,  with  the  synagogue  as  the  center 
of  religious  and  cultural  life.  A  third  group  of  Jews  immigrated 
to  India,  becnnnins:  at  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century  fol- 
lowing  the  trade  contacts  established  bv  the  British  Empire. 
These  Baghdad  Jews  came  mostly  from  the  area  of  modern 
Iraq  and  settled  in  Bombay  and  Calcutta.,  where  manv  of  them 
became  wealthy  and  participated  in  the  economic  leadership 
of  these  growings  cities. 

The  population  of  the  Kochi  Jews,  always  small,  had 
decreased  from  5.000  in  1951  to  about  fifty  in  the  earlv  1990s. 
During  the  same  period.,  the  Bene  Israel  decreased  from  about 
20,000  to  5.000.  while  the  Baghdadjews  declined  from  5..000  to 
250.  Emigration  to  Australia.  Israel.  Britain,  and  North  Amer- 
ica  accounts  for  most  of  this  decline.  According  to  the  1981 
Indian  census,  there  were  5.61 8  Jews  in  India.,  down  from  5.825 
in  1971.  The  1991  census  showed  a  further  decline  to  5.271. 
most  of  whom  lived  in  Maharashtra  and  Mizoram. 

Modern  Transformations 

The  process  of  modernization  in  India,  well  under  way  dur- 
ing the  British  colonial  period  (1757-1947  )  .  has  brought  with 
it  major  changes  in  the  organizational  forms  of  all  religions. 
The  missionary  societies  that  came  ^sith  the  British  in  the  earlv 
nineteenth  centurv  imported,  along  with  modern  concepts  of 
print  media  and  propaganda,  an  ideology  of  intellectual  com- 
petition and  religious  conversion.  Instead  of  the  customary 
interpretation  of  rituals  and  texts  along  received  sectarian 
lines.  Indian  religious  leaders  began  devising  intellectual  syn- 
theses that  could  encompass  the  varied  beliefs  and  practices  of 
their  traditions  within  a  framework  that  could  withstand  Chris- 
tian arguments. 

One  of  the  most  important  reactions  was  the  Arya  Samaj 
(Arva  Society),  founded  in  1875  bv  Swami  Davananda  (1824- 
83).  which  went  back  to  the  Vedas  as  the  ultimate  revealed 
source  of  truth  and  attempted  to  purge  Hinduism  of  more 
recent  accretions  that  had  no  basis  in  the  scriptures.  Originally 
active  in  Punjab.,  this  small  society  still  works  to  purify  Hindu 


174 


Religious  Life 


rituals,  converts  tribal  people,  and  runs  centers  throughout 
India.  Other  responses  include  the  Ramakrishna  order  of 
renunciants  established  by  Swami  Vivekananda  (1863-1902), 
which  set  forth  a  unifying  philosophy  that  followed  the  Vedanta 
teacher  Shankara  and  other  teachers  by  accepting  all  paths  as 
ultimately  leading  toward  union  with  the  undifferentiated  brah- 
man (see  The  Tradition  of  the  Enlightened  Master,  this  ch.). 
One  of  the  primary  goals  of  the  Ramakrishna  movement  has 
been  to  educate  Hindus  about  their  own  scriptures;  the  move- 
ment also  runs  book  stores  and  study  centers  in  all  major  cities. 
Both  of  these  paths  are  directly  modeled  on  the  institutional 
and  intellectual  forms  used  by  European  missionaries  and  reli- 
gious leaders. 

During  the  1930s  and  1940s,  again  responding  to  institu- 
tional models  from  Europe,  the  more  activist  Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak  Sangh  (RSS — National  Volunteer  Organisation) 
emerged  to  protect  Hinduism.  The  RSS  had  been  founded  in 
1925  by  Keshav  Baliram  Hedgewar  (1889-1944),  a  native  of 
Maharashtra  who  was  concerned  that  Hinduism  was  in  danger 
of  extinction  from  its  external  foes  and  needed  a  strong,  mili- 
tant force  of  devotees  to  protect  it.  Members  believe  that  the 
Indian  nation  is  the  divine  mother  to  whom  the  citizen  devotes 
mind  and  body  through  karma-yoga,  or  disciplined  service. 
Training  consists  of  daily  early  morning  meetings  at  which  the 
saffron,  white,  and  green  Indian  flag  and  the  swallow-tailed, 
red-ocher  RSS  banner  are  raised  as  rows  of  members  salute 
silently.  There  are  then  group  drills  in  gymnastic  exercises, 
sports,  discussions  of  patriotic  themes  from  a  primarily  Hindu 
viewpoint,  group  singing  of  nationalist  songs,  and  a  final  assem- 
bly with  saluting.  Throughout  India  in  the  early  1990s,  there 
were  cells  (shakha)  of  fifty  to  100  members  from  all  walks  of  life 
(the  RSS  rejects  class  differences)  who  were  devoted  to  the 
nation.  Although  it  has  attracted  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
members  from  all  over  India,  the  RSS  has  never  projected  itself 
as  a  political  party,  always  remaining  a  national  club  that  is 
ready  to  send  its  members  to  trouble  spots  for  the  defense  of 
the  nation  and  the  national  culture,  embodied  in  Hinduism. 
The  Jana  Sangh,  established  in  1951,  was  the  RSS's  political 
arm  until  it  joined  the  Janata  Party  in  1977  and  its  membership 
split  away  in  1980  to  form  the  BJR 

Another  activist  organization  is  the  Vishwa  Hindu  Parishad 
(VHP— World  Hindu  Council),  founded  in  1964.  The  VHP 
runs  schools,  medical  centers,  hostels,  orphanages,  and  mass 


175 


India:  A  Country  Study 

movements  to  support  Hinduism  wherever  it  is  perceived  as 
threatened.  This  ultraconservative  organization  played  a  role 
in  the  extensive  agitation  for  the  demolition  of  a  mosque  in 
Ayodhya,  leading  to  the  destruction  of  the  structure  during  a 
huge  demonstration  in  1992.  As  a  result  of  the  VHP's  complic- 
ity in  the  affair,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  imposed  a  two- 
year  ban  on  the  Vishwa  Hindu  Parishad  under  the  Unlawful 
Activities  Act.  When  the  ban  expired  in  December  1994,  the 
government  reimposed  it  for  two  additional  years. 

The  spread  of  Hindu  "communal"  (that  is,  religious)  senti- 
ment parallels  a  similar  rise  in  religious  chauvinism  and  "fun- 
damentalist" ideologies  among  religious  minorities,  including 
Muslims  and  Sikhs.  Against  this  background  of  agitation,  the 
periodic  outbreak  of  communal  riots  in  urban  areas  through- 
out India  contributes  to  an  atmosphere  of  religious  tension 
that  has  been  a  hallmark  of  the  national  political  scene  during 
the  twentieth  century.  Hindu-Muslim  riots,  especially  in  North 
India,  reached  a  peak  during  the  partition  of  India  in  1947  and 
periodically  escalated  in  urban  areas  in  the  early  1990s  (see 
Political  Impasse  and  Independence,  ch.  1).  This  strife  typically 
involves  low-income  groups  from  both  communities  in  strug- 
gles over  land,  jobs,  or  local  resources  that  coalesced  around  a 
religious  focus  after  seemingly  trivial  incidents  polarized  the 
two  communities.  In  practice,  although  members  of  other  reli- 
gious communities  are  the  victims  of  violence,  rioters  are  rarely 
motivated  by  religious  instructors,  although  fundamentalist 
agitators  are  often  implicated.  The  situation  in  North  India 
became  complicated  during  the  1980s  by  Sikh  terrorism  con- 
nected with  the  crisis  in  Punjab,  the  widespread  anti-Sikh  riots 
after  Prime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi's  assassination  in  Novem- 
ber 1984  by  her  Sikh  bodyguards,  and  a  series  of  terrorist  or 
counterterrorist  actions  lasting  into  the  1990s.  In  all  of  these 
cases,  many  observers  believe  that  religion  has  appeared  as  a 
cover  for  political  and  economic  struggles. 

The  perception  that  one's  religion  is  in  danger  receives  peri- 
odic reinforcement  from  the  phenomenon  of  public  mass  reli- 
gious conversion  that  receives  coverage  from  the  news  media. 
Many  of  these  events  feature  groups  of  Scheduled  Caste  mem- 
bers who  attempt  to  escape  social  disabilities  through  conver- 
sion to  alternative  religions,  usually  Islam,  Buddhism,  or 
Christianity.  These  occasions  attract  the  attention  of  funda- 
mentalist organizations  from  all  sides  and  heighten  public  con- 
sciousness of  religious  divisions.  The  most  conspicuous 


176 


Religious  Life 


movement  of  this  sort  occurred  during  the  1950s  during  the 
mass  conversions  of  Mahars  to  Buddhism  (see  Buddhism,  this 
ch.)-  In  the  early  1980s,  the  primary  example  was  the  conver- 
sion of  Dalits  to  Islam  in  Meenakshipuram,  Tamil  Nadu,  an 
event  that  resulted  in  considerable  discussion  in  the  media  and 
an  escalation  of  agitation  in  South  India.  Meanwhile,  conver- 
sions to  Christianity  among  tribal  groups  continue,  with  grow- 
ing opposition  from  Hindu  revivalist  organizations. 

Alongside  the  more  publicized  violent  outbreaks,  there  have 
been  major  nonviolent  changes,  as  new  sectarian  movements 
continue  to  grow  and  as  established  movements  change.  For 
example,  the  Radhasoami  Satsang  movement  of  North  India, 
which  includes  adherents  in  Punjab  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  encom- 
passes yogic  ideas  on  the  relationship  between  humans  and  the 
universe,  the  bhakti  saint  tradition  including  select  Sikh  influ- 
ences, and  the  veneration  of  the  enlightened  guru.  The  domi- 
nant tendency  of  these  new  religions,  following  the  example  of 
the  great  teachers  of  the  past  that  was  reiterated  by  Mahatma 
Gandhi  and  most  modern  gurus,  remains  nonviolence  to  all 
living  beings  and  acceptance  of  the  remarkable  diversity  of 
Indian  religion.

INDIA'S  ETHNIC,  LINGUISTIC,  AND  REGIONAL  complexity 
sets  it  apart  from  other  nations.  To  gain  even  a  superficial 
understanding  of  the  relationships  governing  the  huge  num- 
ber of  ethnic,  linguistic,  and  regional  groups,  the  country 
should  be  visualized  not  as  a  nation-state  but  as  the  seat  of  a 
major  world  civilization  on  the  scale  of  Europe.  The  popula- 
tion— estimated  at  936.5  million  in  1995 — is  not  only  immense 
but  also  has  been  highly  varied  throughout  recorded  history; 
its  systems  of  values  have  always  encouraged  diversity.  The  lin- 
guistic requirements  of  numerous  former  empires,  an  indepen- 
dent nation,  and  modern  communication  are  superimposed 
on  a  heterogeneous  sociocultural  base.  Almost  8  percent  of  the 
population,  approaching  65  million  people  at  the  time  of  the 
1991  census,  belongs  to  social  groups  recognized  by  the  gov- 
ernment as  Scheduled  Tribes  (see  Glossary),  with  social  struc- 
tures somewhat  different  from  the  mainstream  of  society. 
Powerful  trends  of  "regionalism" — both  in  the  sense  of  an 
increasing  attachment  to  the  states  as  opposed  to  the  central 
government,  and  in  the  sense  of  movements  for  separation 
from  the  present  states  or  greater  autonomy  for  regions  within 
them — threaten  the  current  distribution  of  power  and  delinea- 
tion of  political  divisions  of  territory. 

Linguistic  Relations 

Diversity,  Use,  and  Policy 

The  languages  of  India  belong  to  four  major  families:  Indo- 
Aryan  (a  branch  of  the  Indo-European  family),  Dravidian,  Aus- 
troasiatic  (Austric),  and  Sino-Tibetan,  with  the  overwhelming 
majority  of  the  population  speaking  languages  belonging  to 
the  first  two  families.  (A  fifth  family,  Andamanese,  is  spoken  by 
at  most  a  few  hundred  among  the  indigenous  tribal  peoples  in 
the  Andaman  Islands,  and  has  no  agreed  upon  connections 
with  families  outside  them.)  The  four  major  families  are  as  dif- 
ferent in  their  form  and  construction  as  are,  for  example,  the 
Indo-European  and  Semitic  families.  A  variety  of  scripts  are 
employed  in  writing  the  different  languages.  Furthermore, 
most  of  the  more  widely  used  Indian  languages  exist  in  a  num- 
ber of  different  forms  or  dialects  influenced  by  complex  geo- 
graphic and  social  patterns.

India:  A  Country  Study 


Sir  George  Grierson's  twelve-volume  Linguistic  Survey  of 
India,  published  between  1903  and  1923,  identified  179  lan- 
guages and  544  dialects.  The  1921  census  listed  188  languages 
and  forty-nine  dialects.  The  1961  census  listed  184  "mother 
tongues,"  including  those  with  fewer  than  10,000  speakers. 
This  census  also  gave  a  list  of  all  the  names  of  mother  tongues 
provided  by  the  respondents  themselves;  the  list  totals  1,652 
names.  The  1981  census — the  last  census  to  tabulate  lan- 
guages— reported  112  mother  tongues  with  more  than  10,000 
speakers  and  almost  1  million  people  speaking  other  lan- 
guages. The  encyclopedic  People  of  India  series,  published  by 
the  government's  Anthropological  Survey  of  India  in  the  1980s 
and  early  1990s,  identified  seventy-five  "major  languages" 
within  a  total  of  325  languages  used  in  Indian  households.  In 
the  early  1990s,  there  were  thirty-two  languages  with  1  million 
or  more  speakers  (see  table  15,  Appendix). 

The  Indian  constitution  recognizes  official  languages  (see 
The  Constitutional  Framework,  ch.  8).  Articles  343  through 
351  address  the  use  of  Hindi,  English,  and  regional  languages 
for  official  purposes,  with  the  aim  of  a  nationwide  use  of  Hindi 
while  guaranteeing  the  use  of  minority  languages  at  the  state 
and  local  levels.  Hindi  has  been  designated  India's  official  lan- 
guage, although  many  impediments  to  its  official  use  exist. 

The  constitution's  Eighth  Schedule,  as  amended  by  Parlia- 
ment in  1992,  lists  eighteen  official  or  Scheduled  Languages 
(see  Glossary).  They  are  Assamese,  Bengali,  Gujarati,  Hindi, 
Kannada,  Kashmiri,  Konkani,  Malayalam,  Manipuri,  Marathi, 
Nepali,  Oriya,  Punjabi,  Sanskrit,  Sindhi,  Tamil,  Telugu,  and 
Urdu.  (Precise  numbers  of  speakers  of  these  languages  are  not 
known.  They  were  not  reported  in  the  1991  census,  and  esti- 
mates are  subject  to  considerable  variation  because  of  the  use 
of  multiple  languages  by  individual  speakers.)  Of  the  official 
languages,  approximately  403  million  people,  or  about  43  per- 
cent of  the  estimated  total  1995  population,  speak  Hindi  as 
their  mother  tongue.  Telugu,  Bengali,  Marathi,  and  Tamil  rank 
next,  each  the  mother  tongue  of  about  4  to  5  percent  (about 
37  million  to  47  million  people);  Urdu,  Gujarati,  Malayalam, 
Kannada,  and  Oriya  are  claimed  by  between  2  and  3  percent 
(roughly  19  million  to  28  million  people);  Bhojpuri,  Punjabi, 
and  Assamese  by  1  to  2  percent  (9  million  to  19  million  peo- 
ple); and  all  other  languages  by  less  than  1  percent  (less  than  9 
million  speakers)  each.

Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

Since  independence  in  1947,  linguistic  affinity  has  served  as 
a  basis  for  organizing  interest  groups;  the  "language  question" 
itself  has  become  an  increasingly  sensitive  political  issue. 
Efforts  to  reach  a  consensus  on  a  single  national  language  that 
transcends  the  myriad  linguistic  regions  and  is  acceptable  to 
diverse  language  communities  have  been  largely  unsuccessful. 

Many  Indian  nationalists  originally  intended  that  Hindi 
would  replace  English — the  language  of  British  rule  (1757- 
1947) — as  a  medium  of  common  communication.  Both  Hindi 
and  English  are  extensively  used,  and  each  has  its  own  support- 
ers. Native  speakers  of  Hindi,  who  are  concentrated  in  North 
India,  contend  that  English,  as  a  relic  from  the  colonial  past 
and  spoken  by  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  population,  is  hope- 
lessly elitist  and  unsuitable  as  the  nation's  official  language. 
Proponents  of  English  argue,  in  contrast,  that  the  use  of  Hindi 
is  unfair  because  it  is  a  liability  for  those  Indians  who  do  not 
speak  it  as  their  native  tongue.  English,  they  say,  at  least  repre- 
sents an  equal  handicap  for  Indians  of  every  region. 

English  continues  to  serve  as  the  language  of  prestige. 
Efforts  to  switch  to  Hindi  or  other  regional  tongues  encounter 
stiff  opposition  both  from  those  who  know  English  well  and 
whose  privileged  position  requires  proficiency  in  that  tongue 
and  from  those  who  see  it  as  a  means  of  upward  mobility.  Parti- 
sans of  English  also  maintain  it  is  useful  and  indeed  necessary 
as  a  link  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  that  India  is  lucky  that  the 
colonial  period  left  a  language  that  is  now  the  world's  predomi- 
nant international  language  in  the  fields  of  culture,  science, 
technology,  and  commerce.  They  hold,  too,  that  widespread 
knowledge  of  English  is  necessary  for  technological  and  eco- 
nomic progress  and  that  reducing  its  role  would  leave  India  a 
backwater  in  world  affairs. 

Linguistic  diversity  is  apparent  on  a  variety  of  levels.  Major 
regional  languages  have  stylized  literary  forms,  often  with  an 
extensive  body  of  literature,  which  may  date  back  from  a  few 
centuries  to  two  millennia  ago.  These  literary  languages  differ 
markedly  from  the  spoken  forms  and  village  dialects  that  coex- 
ist with  a  plethora  of  caste  idioms  and  regional  lingua  francas 
(see  Village  Unity  and  Divisiveness,  ch.  5).  Part  of  the  reason 
for  such  linguistic  diversity  lies  in  the  complex  social  realities  of 
South  Asia.  India's  languages  reflect  the  intricate  levels  of 
social  hierarchy  and  caste.  Individuals  have  in  their  speech  rep- 
ertoire a  variety  of  styles  and  dialects  appropriate  to  various 
social  situations.  In  general,  the  higher  the  speaker's  status,  the 


183 


In  dm:  A  Co u  n  try  St u  dy 


more  speech  forms  there  are  at  his  or  her  disposal.  Speech  is 
adapted  in  countless  ways  to  reflect  the  specific  social  context 
and  the  relative  standing  of  the  speakers. 

Determining  what  should  be  called  a  language  or  a  dialect  is 
more  a  political  than  a  linguistic  question.  Sometimes  the  word 
language  is  applied  to  a  standardized  and  prestigious  form,  rec- 
ognized as  such  over  a  large  geographic  area,  whereas  the  word 
dialect  is  used  for  the  various  forms  of  speech  that  lack  prestige 
or  that  are  restricted  to  certain  regions  or  castes  but  are  still 
regarded  as  forms  of  the  same  language.  Sometimes  mutual 
intelligibility  is  the  criterion:  if  the  speakers  can  understand 
each  other,  even  though  with  some  difficulty,  they  are  speaking 
the  same  language,  although  thev  mav  speak  different  dialects. 
However,  speakers  of  Hindi,  Urdu,  and  Punjabi  can  often 
understand  each  other,  vet  thev  are  regarded  as  speakers  of  dif- 
ferent languages.  Whether  or  not  one  thinks  Konkani — spoken 
in  Goa,  Karnataka,  and  the  Konkan  region  of  Maharashtra — is 
a  distinct  language  or  a  dialect  of  Marathi  has  tended  to  be 
linked  with  whether  or  not  one  thinks  Goa  ought  to  be  merged 
with  Maharashtra.  The  question  has  been  settled  from  the  cen- 
tral government's  point  of  view  by  making  Goa  a  state  and  Kon- 
kani a  Scheduled  Language.  Moreover,  the  fact  that  the  Latin 
script  is  predominantly  used  for  Konkani  separates  it  further 
from  Marathi,  which  uses  the  Devanagari  (see  Glossary)  script. 
However,  Konkani  is  also  sometimes  written  in  Devanagari  and 
Kannada  scripts. 

Regional  languages  are  an  issue  in  the  politically  charged 
atmosphere  surrounding  language  policy.  Throughout  the 
1950s  and  1960s,  attempts  were  made  to  redraw  state  bound- 
aries to  coincide  with  linguistic  usa^e.  Such  efforts  have  had 
mixed  results.  Linguistic  affinity  has  often  failed  to  overcome 
other  social  and  economic  differences.  In  addition,  most  states 
have  linguistic  minorities,  and  questions  surrounding  the  defi- 
nition and  use  of  the  official  lan^ua^e  in  those  regions  are 
fraught  with  controversv. 

States  have  been  accused  of  failure  to  fulfill  their  obligations 
under  the  national  constitution  to  provide  for  the  education  of 
linguistic  minorities  in  their  mother  tongues,  even  when  the 
minority  language  is  a  Scheduled  Language.  Although  the  con- 
stitution requires  that  legal  documents  and  petitions  may  be 
submitted  in  any  of  the  Scheduled  Languages  to  any  govern- 
ment authority,  this  right  is  rarely  exercised.  Under  such  cir- 
cumstances, members  of  linguistic  minorities  may  feel  they  and 


184 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 


their  language  are  oppressed  by  the  majority,  while  people  who 
are  among  linguistic  majorities  may  feel  threatened  by  what 
some  might  consider  minor  concessions.  Thus,  attempts  to 
make  seemingly  minor  accommodations  for  social  diversity 
may  have  extensive  and  volatile  ramifications.  For  example,  in 
1994  a  proposal  in  Bangalore  to  introduce  an  Urdu-language 
television  news  segment  (aimed  primarily  at  Muslim  viewers) 
led  to  a  week  of  urban  riots  that  left  dozens  dead  and  millions 
of  dollars  in  property  damage. 

Languages  of  India 

About  80  percent  of  all  Indians — nearly  750  million  people 
based  on  1995  population  estimates — speak  one  of  the  Indo- 
Aryan  group  of  languages.  Persian  and  the  languages  of 
Afghanistan  are  close  relatives,  belonging,  like  the  Indo-Aryan 
languages,  to  the  Indo-Iranian  branch  of  the  Indo-European 
family.  Brought  into  India  from  the  northwest  during  the  sec- 
ond millennium  B.C.,  the  Indo-Aryan  tongues  spread  through- 
out the  north,  gradually  displacing  the  earlier  languages  of  the 
area. 

Modern  linguistic  knowledge  of  this  process  of  assimilation 
comes  through  the  Sanskrit  language  employed  in  the  sacred 
literature  known  as  the  Vedas  (see  The  Vedas  and  Polytheism, 
ch.  3).  Over  a  period  of  centuries,  Indo-Aryan  languages  came 
to  predominate  in  the  northern  and  central  portions  of  South 
Asia  (see  Antecedents,  ch.  1). 

As  Indo-Aryan  speakers  spread  across  northern  and  central 
India,  their  languages  experienced  constant  change  and  devel- 
opment. By  about  500  B.C.,  Prakrits,  or  "common"  forms  of 
speech,  were  widespread  throughout  the  north.  By  about  the 
same  time,  the  "sacred,"  "polished,"  or  "pure"  tongue — San- 
skrit— used  in  religious  rites  had  also  developed  along  inde- 
pendent lines,  changing  significantly  from  the  form  used  in  the 
Vedas.  However,  its  use  in  ritual  settings  encouraged  the  reten- 
tion of  archaic  forms  lost  in  the  Prakrits.  Concerns  for  the 
purity  and  correctness  of  Sanskrit  gave  rise  to  an  elaborate  sci- 
ence of  grammar  and  phonetics  and  an  alphabetical  system 
seen  by  some  scholars  as  superior  to  the  Roman  system.  By  the 
fourth  century  B.C.,  these  trends  had  culminated  in  the  work 
of  Panini,  whose  Sanskrit  grammar,  the  Ashtadhyayi  (Eight 
Chapters),  set  the  basic  form  of  Sanskrit  for  subsequent  gener- 
ations. Panini's  work  is  often  compared  to  Euclid's  as  an  intel- 
lectual feat  of  systematization. 


185 


India:  A  Country  Study 

The  Prakrits  continued  to  evolve  through  everyday  use.  One 
of  these  dialects  was  Pali,  which  was  spoken  in  the  western  por- 
tion of  peninsular  India.  Pali  became  the  language  of  Thera- 
vada  Buddhism;  eventually  it  came  to  be  identified  exclusively 
with  religious  contexts.  By  around  A.D.  500,  the  Prakrits  had 
changed  further  into  Apabhramshas,  or  the  "decayed"  speech; 
it  is  from  these  dialects  that  the  contemporary  Indo-Aryan  lan- 
guages of  South  Asia  developed.  The  rudiments  of  modern 
Indo-Aryan  vernaculars  were  in  place  by  about  A.D.  1000  to 
1300. 

It  would  be  misleading,  however,  to  call  Sanskrit  a  dead  lan- 
guage because  for  many  centuries  huge  numbers  of  works  in  all 
genres  and  on  all  subjects  continued  to  be  written  in  Sanskrit. 
Original  works  are  still  written  in  it,  although  in  much  smaller 
numbers  than  formerly.  Many  students  still  learn  Sanskrit  as  a 
second  or  third  language,  classical  music  concerts  regularly  fea- 
ture Sanskrit  vocal  compositions,  and  there  are  even  television 
programs  conducted  entirely  in  Sanskrit. 

Around  18  percent  of  the  Indian  populace  (about  169  mil- 
lion people  in  1995)  speak  Dravidian  languages.  Most  Dravid- 
ian  speakers  reside  in  South  India,  where  Indo-Aryan  influence 
was  less  extensive  than  in  the  north.  Only  a  few  isolated  groups 
of  Dravidian  speakers,  such  as  the  Gonds  in  Madhya  Pradesh 
and  Orissa,  and  the  Kurukhs  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Bihar, 
remain  in  the  north  as  representatives  of  the  Dravidian  speak- 
ers who  presumably  once  dominated  much  more  of  South 
Asia.  (The  only  other  significant  population  of  Dravidian 
speakers  are  the  Brahuis  in  Pakistan.) 

The  oldest  documented  Dravidian  language  is  Tamil,  with  a 
substantial  body  of  literature,  particularly  the  Cankam  poetry, 
going  back  to  the  first  century  A.D.  Kannada  and  Telugu  devel- 
oped extensive  bodies  of  literature  after  the  sixth  century, 
while  Malayalam  split  from  Tamil  as  a  literary  language  by  the 
twelfth  century.  In  spite  of  the  profound  influence  of  the  San- 
skrit language  and  Sanskritic  culture  on  the  Dravidian  lan- 
guages, a  strong  consciousness  of  the  distinctness  of  Dravidian 
languages  from  Sanskrit  remained.  All  four  major  Dravidian 
languages  had  consciously  differentiated  styles  varying  in  the 
amount  of  Sanskrit  they  contained.  In  the  twentieth  century,  as 
part  of  an  anti-Brahman  movement  in  Tamil  Nadu,  a  strong 
movement  arose  to  "purify"  Tamil  of  its  Sanskrit  elements,  with 
mixed  success.  The  other  three  Dravidian  languages  were  not 
much  affected  by  this  trend. 


186 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

There  are  smaller  groups,  mostly  tribal  peoples,  who  speak 
Sino-Tibetan  and  Austroasiatic  languages.  Sino-Tibetan  speak- 
ers live  along  the  Himalayan  fringe  from  Jammu  and  Kashmir 
to  eastern  Assam  (see  fig.  9).  They  comprise  about  1.3  percent, 
or  12  million,  of  India's  1995  population.  The  Austroasiatic  lan- 
guages, composed  of  the  Munda  tongues  and  others  thought 
to  be  related  to  them,  are  spoken  by  groups  of  tribal  peoples 
from  West  Bengal  through  Bihar  and  Orissa  and  into  Madhya 
Pradesh.  These  groups  make  up  approximately  0.7  percent 
(about  6.5  million  people)  of  the  population. 

Despite  the  extensive  linguistic  diversity  in  India,  many 
scholars  treat  South  Asia  as  a  single  linguistic  area  because  the 
various  language  families  share  a  number  of  features  not  found 
together  outside  South  Asia.  Languages  entering  South  Asia 
were  "Indianized."  Scholars  cite  the  presence  of  retroflex  con- 
sonants, characteristic  structures  in  verb  formations,  and  a  sig- 
nificant amount  of  vocabulary  in  Sanskrit  with  Dravidian  or 
Austroasiatic  origin  as  indications  of  mutual  borrowing,  influ- 
ences, and  counterinfluences.  Retroflex  consonants,  for  exam- 
ple, which  are  formed  with  the  tongue  curled  back  to  the  hard 
palate,  appear  to  have  been  incorporated  into  Sanskrit  and 
other  Indo-Aryan  languages  through  the  medium  of  borrowed 
Dravidian  words. 

Hindi  and  English 

For  the  speakers  of  the  country's  myriad  tongues  to  function 
within  a  single  administrative  unit  requires  some  medium  of 
common  communication.  The  choice  of  this  tongue,  known  in 
India  as  the  "link"  language,  has  been  a  point  of  significant 
controversy  since  independence.  Central  government  policy 
on  the  question  has  been  necessarily  equivocal.  The  vested 
interests  proposing  a  number  of  language  policies  have  made  a 
decisive  resolution  of  the  "language  question"  all  but  impossi- 
ble. 

The  central  issue  in  the  link-language  controversy  has  been 
and  remains  whether  Hindi  should  replace  English.  Propo- 
nents of  Hindi  as  the  link  language  assert  that  English  is  a  for- 
eign tongue  left  over  from  the  British  Raj  (see  Glossary). 
English  is  used  fluently  only  by  a  small,  privileged  segment  of 
the  population;  the  role  of  English  in  public  life  and  govern- 
mental affairs  constitutes  an  effective  bar  to  social  mobility  and 
further  democratization.  Hindi,  in  this  view,  is  not  only  already 
spoken  by  a  sizable  minority  of  all  Indians  but  also  would  be 


187 


India:  A  Country  Study 

easier  to  spread  because  it  would  be  more  congenial  to  the  cul- 
tural habits  of  the  people.  On  the  other  hand,  Dravidian-speak- 
ing  southerners  in  particular  feel  that  a  switch  to  Hindi  in  the 
well-paid,  nationwide  bureaucracies,  such  as  the  Indian  Admin- 
istrative Service,  the  military,  and  other  forms  of  national  ser- 
vice would  give  northerners  an  unfair  advantage  in  gov- 
ernment examinations  (see  The  Civil  Service,  ch.  8).  If  the 
learning  of  English  is  burdensome,  they  argue,  at  least  the  bur- 
den weighs  equally  on  Indians  from  all  parts  of  the  country.  In 
the  meantime,  an  increasing  percentage  of  Indians  send  their 
children  to  private  English-medium  schools,  to  help  assure 
their  offspring  a  chance  at  high-privilege  positions  in  business, 
education,  the  professions,  and  government. 

Hindi 

The  development  of  Hindi  and  Urdu  gives  a  glimpse  of  the 
processes  at  work  in  language  evolution  in  South  Asia. 

Hindi  and  Urdu  are  essentially  one  language  with  two 
scripts,  Devanagari  and  Persian-Arabic,  respectively.  In  their 
most  formal  literary  forms,  the  two  languages  have  two  vocabu- 
laries (Hindi  taking  words  by  preference  from  Sanskrit,  Urdu 
from  Persian  and  Arabic)  and  tend  to  be  culturally  connected 
with  Hindu  and  Islamic  culture,  respectively.  Hindi-Urdu  devel- 
oped from  the  Khari  Boli  dialect  of  Delhi,  the  capital  city  of  the 
Delhi  Sultanate,  and  it  was  the  speech  of  the  classes  and  neigh- 
borhoods most  closely  connected  with  the  Mughal  court 
(1556-1858).  In  time,  the  language  spread  even  into  South 
India  because  it  served  as  a  common  medium  of  communica- 
tion for  trade,  administration,  and  military  purposes.  Classical 
Urdu  appropriated  a  large  number  of  words  from  Persian,  the 
official  language  of  the  Mughal  Empire,  and  through  Persian 
from  Arabic. 

By  the  late  seventeenth  and  early  eighteenth  centuries,  Urdu 
had  developed  into  a  highly  stylized  form  written  in  a  Persian- 
Arabic  script.  After  the  British  took  over  from  the  Mughals, 
whose  language  of  administration  was  Persian,  Urdu  began  to 
serve  as  the  language  of  administration  in  lower  courts  in  the 
north.  British  administrators  and  missionaries,  however,  felt 
that  the  high  literary  form  of  Urdu  was  too  remote  from  every- 
day life  and  was  suffused  by  a  Persian  vocabulary  unintelligible 
to  the  masses.  Therefore,  they  instigated  the  development  of 
modern  standard  Hindi  in  Devanagari  script.  Hindi  now  pre- 
dominates in  a  number  of  states,  including  Uttar  Pradesh, 


188

Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

Bihar,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Rajasthan,  Haryana,  and  Himachal 
Pradesh,  and  in  the  National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi.  Urdu 
is  the  majority  language  in  no  large  region  but  is  more  com- 
monly spoken  in  North  India  and  is  the  official  administrative 
language  of  the  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  In  South  India, 
people  in  urban  Muslim  communities  in  former  administrative 
capitals,  such  as  Hyderabad  or  Bangalore,  may  regularly  use 
Urdu  at  home  or  in  their  workplace. 

Hindi  has  spread  throughout  North  India  as  a  contemporary 
lingua  franca.  Its  speakers  range  from  illiterate  workers  in  large 
cities  to  highly  educated  civil  servants.  Many  city  dwellers  learn 
Hindi  as  a  second  or  third  language  even  if  they  speak  another 
regional  language,  such  as  Marathi,  Bengali,  or  Gujarati.  As 
professionals  have  become  increasingly  mobile,  they  rely  more 
heavily  on  Hindi  as  a  means  of  communication;  those  aspiring 
to  career  advancement  need  to  learn  standard  Hindi.  Speakers 
of  other  Indo-Aryan  languages  tend  to  chose  Hindi  for  their 
third  language  in  school  because  of  similarities  in  grammar, 
vocabulary,  or  script  with  their  own  mother  tongue  and 
because  it  has  a  wider  use  than  another  regional  language. 

Hindi,  especially  in  the  less  highly  Sanskritized  form  used  in 
everyday  speech,  is  barely  distinct  from  everyday  Urdu,  which 
before  independence  was  called  Hindustani.  However,  Hindi 
has  long  had  pan-Indian  uses  extending  beyond  the  regions 
where  it  is  the  majority  language.  Hindi  is  the  lingua  franca  at 
pilgrimage  sites  in  all  regions  and  is  used  to  deal  with  devotees 
from  all  parts  of  the  country.  It  is  also  the  common  means  of 
communication  of  wandering  Hindu  holy  men  in  their  discus- 
sions with  each  other  and  is  used  frequently  in  preaching. 
Many  publishers  issue  Sanskrit  classics  on  religion,  astrology, 
medicine,  and  other  subjects  with  Hindi  translations,  cribs,  or 
commentaries  to  help  purchasers  who  may  not  be  confident  of 
their  Sanskrit  ability.  Purchasers  appear  to  find  those  aids  use- 
ful, even  though  Hindi  may  not  be  their  primary  spoken  or 
written  language.  Although  there  are  major  cinema  industries 
in  several  other  languages,  the  Hindi  cinema  (centered  in 
Bombay,  also  known  as  Mumbai  in  the  Marathi  language)  dom- 
inates the  Indian  motion  picture  market,  and  Hindi  films  (the 
songs  tend  to  be  in  Urdu)  are  shown  around  the  country  with- 
out subtitles  or  dubbing  (see  The  Media,  ch.  8). 

A  number  of  former  literary  languages  with  established  and 
major  bodies  of  literature,  such  as  Braj,  Avadhi,  and  Maithili, 
have  been  essentially  subsumed  under  the  rubric  of  Hindi.

India:  A  Country  Study 

Maithili,  spoken  in  northern  Bihar,  has  a  body  of  literature  and 
its  own  grammar.  Proponents  of  its  use  insist  that  it  is  a  lan- 
guage in  its  own  right  and  that  it  is  related  more  closely  to  east- 
ern Indo-Aryan  tongues  than  to  Hindi.  Nonetheless,  efforts  to 
revive  Maithili  have  had  minimal  success  beyond  its  use  in  ele- 
mentary education.  Other  regional  tongues  that  lack  literary 
forms,  such  as  Marwari  (in  Rajasthan)  and  Magadhi  (in  south- 
ern Bihar),  are  considered  variants  of  Hindi.  Some  of  them  dif- 
fer from  Hindi  considerably  more  than  does  Urdu.  In  general, 
religious  affiliation  is  the  distinguishing  characteristic  of  Hindi 
and  Urdu  speakers;  Muslims  speak  Urdu,  and  Hindus  speak 
Hindi,  although  what  they  actually  say  in  informal  situations  is 
likely  to  be  about  the  same.  The  use  of  two  radically  different 
scripts  is  a  statement  of  cultural  identity.  However,  there  are 
still  Hindu  religious  periodicals  published  in  Urdu,  and  Urdu 
writers  who  are  Hindu  by  religion. 

English 

There  is  little  information  on  the  extent  of  knowledge  of 
English  in  India.  Books  and  articles  abound  on  the  place  of 
English  in  the  Indian  education  system,  job  competition,  and 
culture;  and  on  its  sociolinguistic  aspects,  pronunciation  and 
grammar,  its  effect  on  Indian  languages,  and  Indian  literature 
in  English.  Little  information  is  available,  however,  on  the 
number  of  people  who  "know"  English  and  the  extent  of  their 
knowledge,  or  even  how  many  people  study  English  in  school. 
In  the  1981  census,  202,400  persons  (0.3  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion) gave  English  as  their  first  language.  Fewer  than  1  percent 
gave  English  as  their  second  language  while  14  percent  were 
reported  as  bilingual  in  two  of  India's  many  languages.  How- 
ever, the  census  did  not  allow  for  recording  more  than  one  sec- 
ond language  and  is  suspected  of  having  significantly 
underrepresented  bilingualism  and  multilingualism. 

The  1981  census  reported  13.3  percent  of  the  population  as 
bilingual.  The  People  of  India  project  of  the  Anthropological 
Survey  of  India,  which  assembled  statistics  on  communities 
rather  than  on  individuals,  found  that  only  34  percent  of  com- 
munities reported  themselves  as  monolingual.  An  Assamese 
who  also  knew  Bengali,  or  someone  from  a  Marathi-speaking 
family  living  in  Delhi  who  attended  a  Hindi-medium  school, 
might  give  Bengali  or  Hindi  as  his  or  her  second  language  but 
also  know  English  from  formal  school  instruction  or  picking  it 
up  on  the  street.  It  is  suspected  that  many  people  identify  lan-

it  may  say  they  do  not  know  the  language. 

English-language  daily  newspapers  have  a  circulation  of  3.1 
million  copies  per  day,  but  each  copy  is  probably  read  by  sev- 
eral people.  There  are  estimates  of  about  3  percent  (some  27 
million  people)  for  the  number  of  literates  in  English,  but  even 
if  this  percentage  is  valid,  the  number  of  people  with  a  speak- 
ing knowledge  is  certainly  higher  than  of  those  who  read  it. 
And,  the  figure  of  3  percent  for  English  literacy  may  be  low. 
According  to  one  set  of  figures,  17.6  million  people  were 
enrolled  in  English  classes  in  1977,  which  would  be  3.2  percent 
of  the  population  of  India  according  to  the  1971  census.  Tak- 
ing the  most  conservative  evaluation  of  how  much  of  the 
instruction  would  "stick,"  this  still  leaves  a  larger  part  of  the 
population  than  3  percent  with  some  English  literacy. 

Some  idea  of  the  possibilities  of  studying  English  can  be 
found  in  the  1992  Fifth  All-India  Education  Survey.  According 
to  the  survey,  only  1.3  percent  of  primary  schools,  3.4  percent 
of  upper  primary  schools,  3.9  percent  of  middle  schools,  and 
13.2  percent  of  high  schools  use  English  as  a  medium  of 
instruction.  Schools  treating  English  as  the  first  language 


193

(requiring  ten  years  of  study)  are  only  0.6  percent  of  rural  pri- 
mary schools,  2.8  percent  of  rural  high  schools,  and  9.9  per- 
cent of  urban  high  schools.  English  is  offered  as  a  second 
language  (six  years  of  study)  in  51  percent  of  rural  primary 
schools,  55  percent  of  urban  primary  schools,  57  percent  of 
rural  high  schools,  and  51  percent  of  urban  high  schools.  As  a 
third  language  (three  years  of  study),  English  is  offered  in  5 
percent  of  rural  primary  schools,  21  percent  of  urban  primary 
schools,  44  percent  of  rural  high  schools,  and  41  percent  of 
urban  high  schools.  These  statistics  show  a  considerable  desire 
to  study  English  among  people  receiving  a  mostly  vernacular 
education,  even  in  the  countryside. 

In  higher  education,  English  continues  to  be  the  premier 
prestige  language.  Careers  in  business  and  commerce,  govern- 
ment positions  of  high  rank  (regardless  of  stated  policy),  and 
science  and  technology  (attracting  many  of  the  brightest)  con- 
tinue to  require  fluency  in  English.  It  is  also  necessary  for  the 
many  students  who  contemplate  study  overseas. 

English  as  a  prestige  language  and  the  tongue  of  first  choice 
continues  to  serve  as  the  medium  of  instruction  in  elite  schools 
at  every  level  without  apology.  All  large  cities  and  many  smaller 
cities  have  private,  English-language  middle  schools  and  high 
schools  (see  Education,  ch.  2).  Even  government  schools  run 
for  the  benefit  of  senior  civil  service  officers  are  conducted  in 
English  because  only  that  language  is  an  acceptable  medium  of 
communication  throughout  the  nation. 

Working-class  parents,  themselves  rural-urban  migrants  and 
perhaps  bilingual  in  their  village  dialect  and  the  regional  stan- 
dard language,  perceive  English  as  the  tool  their  children  need 
in  order  to  advance.  Schools  in  which  English  is  the  medium  of 
instruction  are  a  "growth  industry."  Facility  in  English 
enhances  a  young  woman's  chances  in  the  marriage  market — 
no  small  advantage  in  the  often  protracted  marriage  negotia- 
tions between  families  (see  Life  Passages,  ch.  5).  The  English 
speaker  also  encounters  more  courteous  responses  in  some  sit- 
uations than  does  a  speaker  of  an  indigenous  language. 

Linguistic  States 

The  constitution  and  various  other  government  documents 
are  purposely  vague  in  defining  such  terms  as  national  lan- 
guages and  official  languages  and  in  distinguishing  either  one 
from  officially  adopted  regional  languages.  States  are  free  to 
adopt  their  own  language  of  administration  and  educational 


194 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

instruction  from  among  the  country's  officially  recognized  lan- 
guages, the  Scheduled  Languages.  Further,  all  citizens  have  the 
right  to  primary  education  in  their  native  tongue,  although  the 
constitution  does  not  stipulate  how  this  objective  is  to  be 
accomplished. 

As  drafted,  the  constitution  provided  that  Hindi  and  English 
were  to  be  the  languages  of  communication  for  the  central  gov- 
ernment until  1965,  when  the  switch  to  Hindi  was  mandated. 
The  Official  Languages  Act  of  1963,  pursuing  this  mandate, 
said  that  Hindi  would  become  the  sole  official  national  lan- 
guage in  1965.  English,  however,  would  continue  as  an  "associ- 
ate additional  official  language."  After  ten  years,  a  parlia- 
mentary committee  was  to  consider  the  situation  and  whether 
the  status  of  English  should  continue  if  the  knowledge  of  Hindi 
among  peoples  of  other  native  languages  had  not  progressed 
sufficiently.  The  act,  however,  was  ambiguous  about  whether 
Hindi  could  be  imposed  on  unwilling  states  by  1975.  In  1964 
the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  requested  all  central  ministries  to 
state  their  progress  on  the  switch  to  Hindi  and  their  plans  for 
the  period  after  the  transition  date  in  1965.  The  news  of  this 
directive  led  to  massive  riots  and  self-immolations  in  Tamil 
Nadu  in  late  1964  and  early  1965,  leading  the  central  govern- 
ment, then  run  by  the  Congress  (see  Glossary),  to  back  away 
from  its  stand.  A  conference  of  Congress  leaders,  cabinet  min- 
isters, and  chief  ministers  of  all  the  states  was  held  in  New  Delhi 
in  June  1965.  Non-Hindi-speaking  states  were  assured  that 
Hindi  would  not  be  imposed  as  the  sole  language  of  communi- 
cation between  the  central  government  and  the  states  as  long 
as  even  one  state  objected.  In  addition  any  of  the  Scheduled 
Languages  could  be  used  in  taking  examinations  for  entry  into 
the  central  government  services. 

Before  independence  in  1947,  the  Congress  was  committed 
to  redrawing  state  boundaries  to  correspond  with  linguistics. 
The  States  Reorganisation  Commission,  which  was  formed  in 
1953  to  study  the  problems  involved  in  redrawing  state  bound- 
aries, viewed  language  as  an  important,  although  by  no  means 
the  sole,  factor.  Other  factors,  such  as  economic  viability  and 
geographic  realities,  had  to  be  taken  into  account.  The  com- 
mission issued  its  report  in  1955;  the  government's  request  for 
comments  from  the  populace  generated  a  flood  of  petitions 
and  letters.  The  final  bill,  passed  in  1956  and  amended  several 
times  in  the  1960s,  by  no  means  resolved  even  the  individual 
states'  linguistic  problems. 


195 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Even  regions  with  a  long  history  of  agitation  for  a  linguistic 
state  sometimes  have  found  the  actual  transition  less  than 
smooth.  For  example,  proponents  began  lobbying  for  a  Te- 
lugu-speaking  state  in  the  early  twentieth  century.  In  1956  the 
central  government  formed  a  single  state,  Andhra  Pradesh, 
composed  of  the  predominantly  Telugu-speaking  parts  of  what 
in  British  India  had  been  the  Madras  Presidency  and  the  large 
polyglot  princely  state  of  Hyderabad.  Although  more  than  80 
percent  of  the  residents  (some  53  million  people  as  of  1991)  of 
Andhra  Pradesh  speak  Telugu,  like  most  linguistic  states  it  has 
a  sizable  linguistic  minority.  In  this  case,  the  minority  consists 
of  Urdu  speakers  centered  in  the  state's  capital,  Hyderabad, 
where  nearly  40  percent  (some  1.7  million  people  in  1991)  of 
the  population  speak  that  language.  Linguistic  affinity  did  not 
form  a  firm  basis  for  unity  between  the  two  regions  from  which 
the  state  had  been  formed  because  they  were  separated  by  cul- 
tural and  economic  differences.  Although  there  were  riots  in 
the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  in  support  of  the  formation  of 
two  separate  states,  the  separation  did  not  occur. 

The  violence  that  broke  out  in  the  state  of  Assam  in  the  early 
1980s  reflected  the  complexities  of  linguistic  and  ethnic  poli- 
tics in  South  Asia  (see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8).  The  state  has  a 
significant  number  of  Bengali-speaking  Muslims — immigrants 
and  their  descendants  who  began  settling  the  region  in  the  late 
nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries.  The  Muslims  came  in 
response  to  a  British-initiated  colonization  plan  to  bring  under 
cultivation  land  left  fallow  by  the  Assamese.  By  the  1931  census, 
the  Assamese  not  only  had  lost  a  hefty  portion  of  their  land  but 
also  had  become  a  disadvantaged  minority  in  their  traditional 
homeland.  They  represented  less  than  33  percent  of  the  total 
population  of  Assam,  and  the  Muslim  immigrants  (who 
accounted  for  roughly  25  percent  of  the  population)  domi- 
nated commerce  and  the  government  bureaucracy. 

Assamese-Bengali  rioting  started  in  1950,  and  in  the  1951 
census  many  Bengalis  listed  Assamese  as  their  native  tongue  in 
an  effort  to  placate  the  Assamese.  Further  immigration  of  Ben- 
gali speakers  after  the  formation  of  Bangladesh  in  1971  and  a 
resurgence  of  pro-Bengali  feeling  among  earlier  immigrants 
and  their  descendants  reawakened  Assamese  fears  of  being  out- 
numbered. Renewed  violence  in  the  early  and  mid-1980s  was 
sufficiently  serious  for  the  central  government  to  avoid  holding 
general  elections  in  Assam  during  December  1984  (see  Insur- 
gent Movements  and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10).

Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

The  Social  Context  of  Language 

Contemporary  languages  and  dialects,  as  they  figure  in  the 
lives  of  most  Indians,  are  a  far  cry  from  the  stylized  literary 
forms  of  Indo-Aryan  or  Dravidian  languages.  North  India  espe- 
cially can  be  viewed  as  a  continuum  of  village  dialects.  As  a 
proverb  has  it,  "Every  two  miles  the  water  changes,  every  four 
miles  the  speech."  Spoken  dialects  of  more  distant  villages  will 
be  less  and  less  mutually  understandable  and  finally  become 
simply  mutually  unintelligible  outside  the  immediate  region. 
In  some  cases,  a  variety  of  caste  dialects  coexist  in  the  same  vil- 
lage or  region.  In  addition,  there  are  numerous  regional  dia- 
lects that  villagers  use  when  doing  business  in  nearby  towns  or 
bazaars. 

Since  the  late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries, 
regional  languages,  such  as  Bengali,  Punjabi,  and  Marathi, 
have  become  relatively  standardized  and  are  now  used 
throughout  their  respective  states  for  most  levels  of  administra- 
tion, business,  and  social  intercourse.  Each  is  associated  with  a 
body  of  literature.  British  rule  was  an  impetus  for  the  official 
codification  of  these  regional  tongues.  British  colonial  adminis- 
trators and  missionaries  learned  regional  languages  and  often 
studied  their  literatures,  and  their  translations  of  English-lan- 
guage materials  and  the  Bible  encouraged  the  development  of 
written,  standard  languages.  To  provide  teaching  materials, 
prose  compositions,  grammars,  and  textbooks  were  often  com- 
missioned and,  in  some  cases,  were  closer  to  everyday  speech 
than  was  the  standard  literary  language.  Industrialization, 
modernization,  and  printing  gave  a  major  boost  to  the  vocabu- 
lary and  standardization  of  regional  tongues,  especially  by  mak- 
ing possible  the  wide  dissemination  of  dictionaries. 

Such  written  forms  still  often  differ  widely  from  spoken  ver- 
naculars and  village  dialects.  Diglossia — the  coexistence  of  a 
highly  elaborate,  formal  language  alongside  a  more  colloquial 
form  of  the  same  tongue — occurs  in  many  instances.  For  exam- 
ple, spoken  Bengali  is  so  divergent  from  written  Bengali  as  to 
be  nearly  another  tongue.  Similarly,  Telugu  scholars  waged  a 
bitter  battle  in  the  early  twentieth  century  over  proper  lan- 
guage style.  Reformers  favored  a  simplified  prose  format  for 
written  Telugu,  while  traditional  classicists  wished  to  continue 
using  a  classical  literary  poetic  form.  In  the  end,  the  classicists 
won,  although  a  more  colloquial  written  form  eventually  began 
to  appear  in  the  mass  media.  Diglossia  reinforces  social  barri- 


197

ers  because  only  a  fraction  of  the  populace  is  sufficiently  edu- 
cated to  master  the  more  literary  form  of  the  language. 

The  standard  regional  language  may  be  the  household 
tongue  of  only  a  small  group  of  educated  inhabitants  of  the 
region's  major  urban  center  that  has  long  exercised  politico- 
economic  hegemony  in  a  region.  Even  literate  villagers  may 
have  difficulty  understanding  it.  The  more  socially  isolated — 
women  and  Dalits  (see  Glossary) — tend  to  be  more  parochial 
in  their  speech  than  people  of  higher  caste,  who  are  often  able 
to  use  a  colloquial  form  of  the  regional  dialect,  the  caste  patois, 
and  the  regional  standard  dialect.  An  educated  person  may 
master  several  different  speech  forms  that  are  often  so  differ- 
ent as  to  be  considered  separate  languages.  Western-educated 
scholars  may  well  use  the  regional  standard  language  mixed 
with  English  vocabulary  with  their  colleagues  at  work.  At  home, 
a  man  may  switch  to  a  more  colloquial  vernacular,  particularly 
if  his  wife  is  uneducated.  Even  the  highly  educated  frequently 
communicate  in  their  village  dialects  at  home. 

Only  around  3  percent  of  the  population  (about  28  million 
people  in  1995)  is  truly  fluent  in  both  English  and  an  Indian 
language.  By  necessity,  a  substantial  minority  are  able  to  speak 
two  Indian  languages;  even  in  the  so-called  linguistic  states, 
there  are  minorities  who  do  not  speak  the  official  language  as 
their  native  tongue  and  must  therefore  learn  it  as  a  second  lan- 
guage. Many  tribal  people  are  bilingual.  Rural-urban  migrants 
are  frequently  bilingual  in  the  regional  standard  language  as 
well  as  in  their  village  dialect.  In  Bombay,  for  example,  many 
migrants  speak  Hindi  or  Marathi  in  addition  to  their  native 
tongue.  Religious  celebrations,  popular  festivals,  and  political 
meetings  are  typically  carried  on  in  the  regional  language, 
which  may  be  unintelligible  to  many  attendees.  Bilingualism  in 
India,  however,  is  inextricably  linked  to  social  context.  South 
Asia's  long  history  of  foreign  rule  has  fostered  what  Clarence 
Maloney  terms  "the  linguistic  flight  of  the  elite."  Language — 
either  Sanskrit,  Persian,  or  English — has  formed  a  barrier  to 
advancement  that  only  a  few  have  been  fortunate  enough  to 
overcome. 

Throughout  the  twentieth  century,  radio,  television,  and  the 
print  media  have  fostered  standardization  of  regional  dialects, 
if  only  to  facilitate  communication.  Linguistic  standardization 
has  contributed  to  ethnic  or  regional  differentiation  insofar  as 
language  has  served  as  a  cultural  marker.  Mass  communication 
forces  the  adoption  of  a  single  standard  regional  tongue;  typi-

cally,  the  choice  is  the  dialect  of  the  majority  in  the  region  or  of 
the  region's  preeminent  business  or  cultural  center.  The  use  of 
less  standard  forms  clearly  labels  speakers  outside  their  imme- 
diate home  base.  To  fulfill  its  purposes,  the  regional  language 
must  be  standardized  and  taught  to  an  increasing  percentage 
of  the  population,  thereby  encroaching  both  on  its  own  dia- 
lects and  the  minority  languages  of  the  region.  The  language 
of  instruction  and  administration  affects  the  economic  and 
career  interests  and  the  self-respect  of  an  ever-greater  propor- 
tion of  the  population. 

Ethnic  Minorities 
Tribes 

Composition  and  Location 

Tribal  peoples  constitute  roughly  8  percent  of  the  nation's 
total  population,  nearly  68  million  people  according  to  the 
1991  census.  One  concentration  lives  in  a  belt  along  the  Hima- 
layas stretching  through  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Himachal 
Pradesh,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  in  the  west,  to  Assam,  Meghalaya, 
Tripura,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Mizoram,  Manipur,  and  Nagaland 


199 


India:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  northeast  (see  fig.  1).  Another  concentration  lives  in  the 
hilly  areas  of  central  India  (Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  and,  to  a 
lesser  extent,  Andhra  Pradesh);  in  this  belt,  which  is  bounded 
by  the  Narmada  River  to  the  north  and  the  Godavari  River  to 
the  southeast,  tribal  peoples  occupy  the  slopes  of  the  region's 
mountains.  Other  tribals,  the  Santals,  live  in  Bihar  and  West 
Bengal.  There  are  smaller  numbers  of  tribal  people  in  Karna- 
taka,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Kerala,  in  western  India  in  Gujarat  and 
Rajasthan,  and  in  the  union  territories  of  Lakshadweep  and  the 
Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands. 

The  extent  to  which  a  state's  population  is  tribal  varies  con- 
siderably. In  the  northeastern  states  of  Arunachal  Pradesh, 
Meghalaya,  Mizoram,  and  Nagaland,  upward  of  90  percent  of 
the  population  is  tribal.  However,  in  the  remaining  northeast 
states  of  Assam,  Manipur,  Sikkim,  and  Tripura,  tribal  peoples 
form  between  20  and  30  percent  of  the  population.  The  largest 
tribes  are  found  in  central  India,  although  the  tribal  popula- 
tion there  accounts  for  only  around  10  percent  of  the  region's 
total  population.  Major  concentrations  of  tribal  people  live  in 
Maharashtra,  Orissa,  and  West  Bengal.  In  the  south,  about  1 
percent  of  the  populations  of  Kerala  and  Tamil  Nadu  are  tribal, 
whereas  about  6  percent  in  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Karnataka  are 
members  of  tribes. 

There  are  some  573  communities  recognized  by  the  govern- 
ment as  Scheduled  Tribes  and  therefore  eligible  to  receive  spe- 
cial benefits  and  to  compete  for  reserved  seats  in  legislatures 
and  schools.  They  range  in  size  from  the  Gonds  (roughly  7.4 
million)  and  the  Santals  (approximately  4.2  million)  to  only 
eighteen  Chaimals  in  the  Andaman  Islands.  Central  Indian 
states  have  the  country's  largest  tribes,  and,  taken  as  a  whole, 
roughly  75  percent  of  the  total  tribal  population  live  there. 

Apart  from  the  use  of  strictly  legal  criteria,  however,  the 
problem  of  determining  which  groups  and  individuals  are 
tribal  is  both  subtle  and  complex.  Because  it  concerns  eco- 
nomic interests  and  the  size  and  location  of  voting  blocs,  the 
question  of  who  are  members  of  Scheduled  Tribes  rather  than 
Backward  Classes  (see  Glossary)  or  Scheduled  Castes  (see  Glos- 
sary) is  often  controversial  (see  The  Fringes  of  Society,  ch.  5). 
The  apparently  wide  fluctuation  in  estimates  of  South  Asia's 
tribal  population  through  the  twentieth  century  gives  a  sense 
of  how  unclear  the  distinction  between  tribal  and  nontribal  can 
be.  India's  1931  census  enumerated  22  million  tribal  people,  in 
1941  only  10  million  were  counted,  but  by  1961  some  30  mil- 


200

lion  and  in  1991  nearly  68  million  tribal  members  were 
included.  The  differences  among  the  figures  reflect  changing 
census  criteria  and  the  economic  incentives  individuals  have  to 
maintain  or  reject  classification  as  a  tribal  member. 

These  gyrations  of  census  data  serve  to  underline  the  com- 
plex relationship  between  caste  and  tribe.  Although,  in  theory, 
these  terms  represent  different  ways  of  life  and  ideal  types,  in 
reality  they  stand  for  a  continuum  of  social  groups.  In  areas  of 
substantial  contact  between  tribes  and  castes,  social  and  cul- 
tural pressures  have  often  tended  to  move  tribes  in  the  direc- 
tion of  becoming  castes  over  a  period  of  years.  Tribal  peoples 
with  ambitions  for  social  advancement  in  Indian  society  at 
large  have  tried  to  gain  the  classification  of  caste  for  their 
tribes;  such  efforts  conform  to  the  ancient  Indian  traditions  of 
caste  mobility  (see  Caste  and  Class,  ch.  5).  Where  tribal  leaders 
prospered,  they  could  hire  Brahman  priests  to  construct  credi- 
ble pedigrees  and  thereby  join  reasonably  high-status  castes. 
On  occasion,  an  entire  tribe  or  part  of  a  tribe  joined  a  Hindu 
sect  and  thus  entered  the  caste  system  en  masse.  If  a  specific 
tribe  engaged  in  practices  that  Hindus  deemed  polluting,  the 
tribe's  status  when  it  was  assimilated  into  the  caste  hierarchy 
would  be  affected. 

Since  independence,  however,  the  special  benefits  available 
to  Scheduled  Tribes  have  convinced  many  groups,  even  Hin- 
dus and  Muslims,  that  they  will  enjoy  greater  advantages  if  so 
designated.  The  schedule  gives  tribal  people  incentives  to 
maintain  their  identity.  By  the  same  token,  the  schedule  also 
includes  a  number  of  groups  whose  "tribal"  status,  in  cultural 
terms,  is  dubious  at  best;  in  various  districts,  the  list  includes 
Muslims  and  a  congeries  of  Hindu  castes  whose  main  claim 
seems  to  be  their  ability  to  deliver  votes  to  the  party  that 
arranges  their  listing  among  the  Scheduled  Tribes. 

A  number  of  traits  have  customarily  been  seen  as  establish- 
ing tribal  rather  than  caste  identity.  These  include  language, 
social  organization,  religious  affiliation,  economic  patterns, 
geographic  location,  and  self-identification.  Recognized  tribes 
typically  live  in  hilly  regions  somewhat  remote  from  caste  settle- 
ments; they  generally  speak  a  language  recognized  as  tribal. 

Unlike  castes,  which  are  part  of  a  complex  and  interrelated 
local  economic  exchange  system,  tribes  tend  to  form  self-suffi- 
cient economic  units.  Often  they  practice  swidden  farming — 
clearing  a  field  by  slash-and-burn  methods,  planting  it  for  a 
number  of  seasons,  and  then  abandoning  it  for  a  lengthy  fallow

period — rather  than  the  intensive  farming  typical  of  most  of 
rural  India  (see  Land  Use.  ch.  7).  For  most  tribal  people.,  land- 
use  rights  traditionally  derive  simply  from  tribal  membership. 
Tribal  society  tends  to  be  egalitarian,  its  leadership  being  based 
on  ties  of  kinship  and  personality  rather  than  on  hereditary  sta- 
tus. Tribes  typically  consist  of  segmentary  lineages  whose 
extended  families  provide  the  basis  for  social  organization  and 
control.  Unlike  caste  religion,  which  recognizes  the  hegemony 
of  Brahman  priests,  tribal  religion  recognizes  no  authority  out- 
side the  tribe. 

Any  of  these  criteria  can  be  called  into  question  in  specific 
instances.  Lan2"ua°;e  is  not  always  an  accurate  indicator  of  tribal 
or  caste  status.  Especially  in  regions  of  mixed  population,  many 
tribal  groups  have  lost  their  mother  tongues  and  simply  speak 
local  or  resdonal  languages.  Linguistic  assimilation  is  an  on°;o- 
ing  process  of  considerable  complexity  In  the  highlands  of 
Orissa,  for  example,  the  Bondos — a  Munda-language-speaking 
tribe — use  their  own  tonsrue  among  themselves.  Oriva.  how- 
ever,  serves  as  a  lingua  franca  in  dealings  with  Hindu  neigh- 
bors.  Oriva  as  a  prestige  language  (in  the  Bondo  view), 
however,  has  also  supplanted  the  native  tongue  as  the  language 
of  ritual.  In  parts  of  Assam,  historically  divided  into  warring 
tribes  and  villages,  increased  contact  amon?  villagers  began 
during  the  colonial  period  and  has  accelerated  since  indepen- 
dence. A  pidgin  Assamese  developed  while  educated  tribal 
members  learned  Hindi  and.  in  the  late  twentieth  century. 
English. 

Self-identification  and  group  loyalty  are  not  unfailing  mark- 
ers of  tribal  identity  either.  In  the  case  of  stratified  tribes,  the 
loyalties  of  clan,  kin,  and  family  may  well  predominate  over 
those  of  tribe.  In  addition,  tribes  cannot  always  be  viewed  as 
people  living  apart:  the  degree  of  isolation  of  various  tribes  has 
varied  tremendously  The  Gonds,  Santals.  and  Bhils  tradition- 
ally have  dominated  the  regions  in  which  they  have  lived. 
Moreover,  tribal  society  is  not  always  more  egalitarian  than  the 
rest  of  the  rural  populace:  some  of  the  larger  tribes,  such  as  the 
Gonds.  are  highly  stratified. 

Economic  and  Political  Conditions 

Most  tribes  are  concentrated  in  heavilv  forested  areas  that 
combine  inaccessibility  with  limited  political  or  economic  sig- 
nificance. Historically  the  economy  of  most  tribes  was  subsis- 
tence agriculture  or  hunting  and  Catherine.  Tribal  members

traded  with  outsiders  for  the  few  necessities  they  lacked,  such 
as  salt  and  iron.  A  few  local  Hindu  craftsmen  might  provide 
such  items  as  cooking  utensils.  The  twentieth  century,  however, 
has  seen  far-reaching  changes  in  the  relationship  between  trib- 
als  and  the  larger  society  and,  by  extension,  traditional  tribal 
economies.  Improved  transportation  and  communications 
have  brought  ever  deeper  intrusions  into  tribal  lands;  mer- 
chants and  a  variety  of  government  policies  have  involved  tribal 
peoples  more  thoroughly  in  the  cash  economy,  although  by  no 
means  on  the  most  favorable  of  terms.  Large  areas  fell  into  the 
hands  of  nontribals  around  1900,  when  many  regions  were 
opened  by  the  government  to  homestead-style  settlement. 
Immigrants  received  free  land  in  return  for  cultivating  it. 
Tribal  people,  too,  could  apply  for  land  titles,  although  even 
title  to  the  portion  of  land  they  happened  to  be  planting  that 
season  could  not  guarantee  their  ability  to  continue  swidden 
cultivation.  More  important,  the  notion  of  permanent,  individ- 
ual ownership  of  land  was  foreign  to  most  tribals.  Land,  if  seen 
in  terms  of  ownership  at  all,  was  viewed  as  a  communal 
resource,  free  to  whoever  needed  it.  By  the  time  tribals 
accepted  the  necessity  of  obtaining  formal  land  titles,  they  had 
lost  the  opportunity  to  lay  claim  to  lands  that  might  rightfully 
have  been  considered  theirs.  Generally,  tribals  were  severely 
disadvantaged  in  dealing  with  government  officials  who 


203

granted  land  titles.  Albeit  belatedly,  the  colonial  regime  real- 
ized the  necessity  of  protecting  tribals  from  the  predations  of 
outsiders  and  prohibited  the  sale  of  tribal  lands.  Although  an 
important  loophole  in  the  form  of  land  leases  was  left  open, 
tribes  made  some  gains  in  the  mid-twentieth  century.  Despite 
considerable  obstruction  by  local  police  and  land  officials,  who 
were  slow  to  delineate  tribal  holdings  and  slower  still  to  offer 
police  protection,  some  land  was  returned  to  tribal  peoples. 

In  the  1970s,  the  gains  tribal  peoples  had  made  in  earlier 
decades  were  eroded  in  many  regions,  especially  in  central 
India.  Migration  into  tribal  lands  increased  dramatically,  and 
the  deadly  combination  of  constabulary  and  revenue  officers 
uninterested  in  tribal  welfare  and  sophisticated  nontribals  will- 
ing and  able  to  bribe  local  officials  was  sufficient  to  deprive 
many  tribals  of  their  landholdings.  The  means  of  subverting 
protective  legislation  were  legion:  local  officials  could  be  per- 
suaded to  ignore  land  acquisition  by  nontribal  people,  alter 
land  registry  records,  lease  plots  of  land  for  short  periods  and 
then  simplv  refuse  to  relinquish  them,  or  induce  tribal  mem- 
bers to  become  indebted  and  attach  their  lands.  Whatever  the 
means,  the  result  was  that  many  tribal  members  became  land- 
less laborers  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  and  regions  that  a  few 
years  earlier  had  been  the  exclusive  domain  of  tribes  had  an 
increasingly  heterogeneous  population.  Unlike  previous  eras 
in  which  tribal  people  were  shunted  into  more  remote  forests, 
by  the  1960s  relatively  little  unoccupied  land  was  available. 
Government  efforts  to  evict  nontribal  members  from  illegal 
occupation  have  proceeded  slowly;  when  evictions  occur  at  all, 
those  ejected  are  usually  members  of  poor,  lower  castes.  In  a 
1985  publication,  anthropologist  Christoph  von  Furer-Haimen- 
dorf  describes  this  process  in  Andhra  Pradesh:  on  average  only 
25  to  33  percent  of  the  tribal  families  in  such  villages  had  man- 
aged to  keep  even  a  portion  of  their  holdings.  Outsiders  had 
paid  about  5  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  lands  they 
took. 

Improved  communications,  roads  with  motorized  traffic, 
and  more  frequent  government  intervention  figured  in  the 
increased  contact  that  tribal  peoples  had  with  outsiders.  Tribes 
fared  best  where  there  was  little  to  induce  nontribals  to  settle: 
cash  crops  and  commercial  highways  frequently  signaled  the 
dismemberment  of  the  tribes.  Merchants  have  long  been  a  link 
to  the  outside  world,  but  in  the  past  they  were  generally  petty 
traders,  and  the  contact  thev  had  with  tribal  people  was  tran-

sient.  By  the  1960s  and  1970s,  the  resident  nontribal  shop- 
keeper was  a  permanent  feature  of  many  villages.  Shopkeepers 
often  sold  liquor  on  credit,  enticing  tribal  members  into  debt 
and  into  mortgaging  their  land.  In  the  past,  tribes  made  up 
shortages  before  harvest  by  foraging  from  the  surrounding  for- 
est. More  recently  shopkeepers  have  offered  ready  credit — with 
the  proviso  that  loans  be  repaid  in  kind  with  50  to  100  percent 
interest  after  harvest.  Repaying  one  bag  of  millet  with  two  bags 
has  set  up  a  cycle  of  indebtedness  from  which  many  have  been 
unable  to  break  loose. 

The  possibility  of  cultivators  growing  a  profitable  cash  crop, 
such  as  cotton  or  castor-oil  plants,  continues  to  draw  merchants 
into  tribal  areas.  Nontribal  traders  frequently  establish  an 
extensive  network  of  relatives  and  associates  as  shopkeepers  to 
serve  as  agents  in  a  number  of  villages.  Cultivators  who  grow  a 
cash  crop  often  sell  to  the  same  merchants,  who  provide  con- 
sumption credit  throughout  the  year.  The  credit  carries  a  high- 
interest  price  tag,  whereas  the  tribal  peoples'  crops  are  bought 
at  a  fraction  of  the  market  rate.  Cash  crops  offer  a  further  dis- 
advantage in  that  they  decrease  the  supply  of  available  food- 
stuffs and  increase  tribal  dependence  on  economic  forces 
beyond  their  control.  This  transformation  has  meant  a  decline 
in  both  the  tribes'  security  and  their  standard  of  living. 

In  previous  generations,  families  might  have  purchased  sil- 
ver jewelry  as  a  form  of  security;  contemporary  tribal  people 
are  more  likely  to  buy  minor  consumer  goods.  Whereas  jewelry 
could  serve  as  collateral  in  critical  emergencies,  current  pur- 
chases simply  increase  indebtedness.  In  areas  where  gathering 
forest  products  is  remunerative,  merchants  exchange  their 
products  for  tribal  labor.  Indebtedness  is  so  extensive  that 
although  such  transactions  are  illegal,  traders  sometimes  "sell" 
their  debtors  to  other  merchants,  much  like  indentured  ser- 
vants. 

In  some  instances,  tribes  have  managed  to  hold  their  own  in 
contacts  with  outsiders.  Some  Chenchus,  a  hunting  and  gather- 
ing tribe  of  the  central  hill  regions  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  have 
continued  to  specialize  in  collecting  forest  products  for  sale. 
Caste  Hindus  living  among  them  rent  land  from  the  Chenchus 
and  pay  a  portion  of  the  harvest.  The  Chenchus  themselves 
have  responded  unenthusiastically  to  government  efforts  to 
induce  them  to  take  up  farming.  Their  relationship  to  non- 
tribal  people  has  been  one  of  symbiosis,  although  there  were 
indications  in  the  early  1980s  that  other  groups  were  beginning 


205 


India:  A  Country  Study 

to  compete  with  the  Chenchus  in  gathering  forest  products.  A 
large  paper  mill  was  cutting  bamboo  in  their  territory  in  a  man- 
ner that  did  not  allow  regeneration,  and  two  groups  had  begun 
to  collect  for  sale  the  same  products  the  Chenchus  sell.  Dalits 
settled  among  them  with  the  help  of  the  Chenchus  and 
learned  agriculture  from  them.  The  nomadic  Banjara  herders 
who  graze  their  cattle  in  the  forest  also  have  been  allotted  land 
there.  The  Chenchus  have  a  certain  advantage  in  dealing  with 
caste  Hindus;  because  of  their  long  association  with  Hindu  her- 
mits and  their  refusal  to  eat  beef,  they  are  considered  an  unpol- 
luted caste.  Other  tribes,  particularly  in  South  India,  have 
cultural  practices  that  are  offensive  to  Hindus  and,  when  they 
are  assimilated,  are  often  considered  Dalits. 

The  final  blow  for  some  tribes  has  come  when  nontribals, 
through  politica  l  jockeying,  have  managed  to  gain  legal  tribal 
status,  that  is,  to  be  listed  as  a  Scheduled  Tribe.  The  Gonds  of 
Andhra  Pradesh  effectively  lost  their  only  advantage  in  trying 
to  protect  their  lands  when  the  Banjaras,  a  group  that  had  been 
settling  in  Gond  territory,  were  classified  as  a  Scheduled  Tribe 
in  1977.  Their  newly  acquired  tribal  status  made  the  Banjaras 
eligible  to  acquire  Gond  land  "legally"  and  to  compete  with 
Gonds  for  reserved  political  seats,  places  in  education  institu- 
tions, and  other  benefits.  Because  the  Banjaras  are  not  sched- 
uled in  neighboring  Maharashtra,  there  has  been  an  influx  of 
Banjara  emigrants  from  that  state  into  Andhra  Pradesh  in 
search  of  better  opportunities. 

Tribes  in  the  Himalayan  foothills  have  not  been  as  hard- 
pressed  by  the  intrusions  of  nontribals.  Historically,  their  politi- 
cal status  was  always  distinct  from  the  rest  of  India.  Until  the 
British  colonial  period,  there  was  little  effective  control  by  any 
of  the  empires  centered  in  peninsular  India;  the  region  was 
populated  by  autonomous  feuding  tribes.  The  British,  in 
efforts  to  protect  the  sensitive  northeast  frontier,  followed  a 
policy  dubbed  the  "Inner  Line";  nontribal  people  were  allowed 
into  the  areas  only  with  special  permission.  Postindependence 
governments  have  continued  the  policy,  protecting  the  Hima- 
layan tribes  as  part  of  the  strategy  to  secure  the  border  with 
China  (see  Principal  Regions,  ch.  2). 

This  policy  has  generally  saved  the  northern  tribes  from  the 
kind  of  exploitation  that  those  elsewhere  in  South  Asia  have 
suffered.  In  Arunachal  Pradesh  (formerly  part  of  the  North- 
East  Frontier  Agency),  for  example,  tribal  members  control 
commerce  and  most  lower-level  administrative  posts.  Govern-

ment  construction  projects  in  the  region  have  provided  tribes 
with  a  significant  source  of  cash — both  for  setting  up  busi- 
nesses and  for  providing  paying  customers.  Some  tribes  have 
made  rapid  progress  through  the  education  system.  Instruction 
was  begun  in  Assamese  but  was  eventually  changed  to  Hindi;  by 
the  early  1980s,  English  was  taught  at  most  levels.  Both  educa- 
tion and  the  increase  in  ready  cash  from  government  spending 
have  permitted  tribal  people  a  significant  measure  of  social 
mobility.  The  role  of  early  missionaries  in  providing  education 
was  also  crucial  in  Assam. 

Government  policies  on  forest  reserves  have  affected  tribal 
peoples  profoundly.  Wherever  the  state  has  chosen  to  exploit 
forests,  it  has  seriously  undermined  the  tribes'  way  of  life.  Gov- 
ernment efforts  to  reserve  forests  have  precipitated  armed  (if 
futile)  resistance  on  the  part  of  the  tribal  peoples  involved. 
Intensive  exploitation  of  forests  has  often  meant  allowing  out- 
siders to  cut  large  areas  of  trees  (while  the  original  tribal  inhab- 
itants were  restricted  from  cutting),  and  ultimately  replacing 
mixed  forests  capable  of  sustaining  tribal  life  with  single-prod- 
uct plantations.  Where  forests  are  reserved,  nontribals  have 
proved  far  more  sophisticated  than  their  forest  counterparts  at 
bribing  the  necessary  local  officials  to  secure  effective  (if  extra- 


207 


India:  A  Country  Study 


legal)  use  of  forestlands.  The  system  of  bribing  local  officials 
charged  with  enforcing  the  reserves  is  so  well  established  that 
the  rates  of  bribery  are  reasonably  fixed  (by  the  number  of 
plows  a  farmer  uses  or  the  amount  of  grain  harvested).  Tribal 
people  often  end  up  doing  unpaid  work  for  Hindus  simply 
because  a  caste  Hindu,  who  has  paid  the  requisite  bribe,  can  at 
least  ensure  a  tribal  member  that  he  or  she  will  not  be  evicted 
from  forestlands.  The  final  irony,  notes  von  Furer-Haimendorf, 
is  that  the  swidden  cultivation  many  tribes  practiced  had  main- 
tained South  Asia's  forests,  whereas  the  intensive  cultivating 
and  commercial  interests  that  replaced  the  tribal  way  of  life 
have  destroyed  the  forests  (see  Forestry,  ch.  7). 

Extending  the  system  of  primary  education  into  tribal  areas 
and  reserving  places  for  tribal  children  in  middle  and  high 
schools  and  higher  education  institutions  are  central  to  gov- 
ernment policy,  but  efforts  to  improve  a  tribe's  educational  sta- 
tus have  had  mixed  results  (see  Education,  ch.  2).  Recruitment 
of  qualified  teachers  and  determination  of  the  appropriate  lan- 
guage of  instruction  also  remain  troublesome.  Commission 
after  commission  on  the  "language  question"  has  called  for 
instruction,  at  least  at  the  primary  level,  in  the  students'  native 
tongue.  In  some  regions,  tribal  children  entering  school  must 
begin  by  learning  the  official  regional  language,  often  one 
completely  unrelated  to  their  tribal  tongue.  The  experiences  of 
the  Gonds  of  Andhra  Pradesh  provide  an  example.  Primary 
schooling  began  there  in  the  1940s  and  1950s.  The  govern- 
ment selected  a  group  of  Gonds  who  had  managed  to  become 
semiliterate  in  Telugu  and  taught  them  the  basics  of  written 
script.  These  individuals  became  teachers  who  taught  in  Gondi, 
and  their  efforts  enjoyed  a  measure  of  success  until  the  1970s, 
when  state  policy  demanded  instruction  in  Telugu.  The  switch 
in  the  language  of  instruction  both  made  the  Gond  teachers 
superfluous  because  they  could  not  teach  in  Telugu  and  also 
presented  the  government  with  the  problem  of  finding  reason- 
ably qualified  teachers  willing  to  teach  in  outlying  tribal 
schools. 

The  commitment  of  tribes  to  acquiring  a  formal  education 
for  their  children  varies  considerably.  Tribes  differ  in  the 
extent  to  which  they  view  education  positively.  Gonds  and  Par- 
dhans,  two  groups  in  the  central  hill  region,  are  a  case  in  point. 
The  Gonds  are  cultivators,  and  they  frequently  are  reluctant  to 
send  their  children  to  school,  needing  them,  they  say,  to  work 
in  the  fields.  The  Pardhans  were  traditionally  bards  and  ritual 


208 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

specialists,  and  they  have  taken  to  education  with  enthusiasm. 
The  effectiveness  of  educational  policy  likewise  varies  by 
region.  In  those  parts  of  the  northeast  where  tribes  have  gener- 
ally been  spared  the  wholesale  onslaught  of  outsiders,  school- 
ing has  helped  tribal  people  to  secure  political  and  economic 
benefits.  The  education  system  there  has  provided  a  corps  of 
highly  trained  tribal  members  in  the  professions  and  high- 
ranking  administrative  posts. 

Many  tribal  schools  are  plagued  by  high  dropout  rates.  Chil- 
dren attend  for  the  first  three  to  four  years  of  primary  school 
and  gain  a  smattering  of  knowledge,  only  to  lapse  into  illiteracy 
later.  Few  who  enter  continue  up  to  the  tenth  grade;  of  those 
who  do,  few  manage  to  finish  high  school.  Therefore,  very  few 
are  eligible  to  attend  institutions  of  higher  education,  where 
the  high  rate  of  attrition  continues. 

Practices 

The  influx  of  newcomers  disinclined  to  follow  tribal  ways  has 
had  a  massive  impact  on  social  relations  and  tribal  belief  sys- 
tems. In  many  communities,  the  immigrants  have  brought  on 
nothing  less  than  the  total  disintegration  of  the  communities 
they  entered.  Even  where  outsiders  are  not  residents  in  villages, 
traditional  forms  of  social  control  and  authority  are  less  effec- 
tive because  tribal  people  are  patently  dependent  on  politico- 
economic  forces  beyond  their  control.  In  general,  traditional 
headmen  no  longer  have  official  backing  for  their  role  in  vil- 
lage affairs,  although  many  continue  to  exercise  considerable 
influence.  Headmen  can  no  longer  control  the  allocation  of 
land  or  decide  who  has  the  right  to  settle  in  the  village,  a  loss  of 
power  that  has  had  an  insidious  effect  on  village  solidarity. 

Some  headmen  have  taken  to  leasing  village  land  to  outsid- 
ers, thus  enriching  themselves  at  the  expense  of  the  rest  of  the 
tribes.  Conflict  over  land  rights  has  introduced  a  point  of  cleav- 
age into  village  social  relations;  increased  factional  conflict  has 
seriously  eroded  the  ability  of  tribes  to  ward  off  the  intrusion  of 
outsiders.  In  some  villages,  tribal  schoolteachers  have  emerged 
as  a  new  political  force,  a  counterbalance  to  the  traditional 
headman.  Changes  in  landholding  patterns  have  also  altered 
the  role  of  the  joint  family.  More  and  more  couples  set  up  sepa- 
rate households  as  soon  as  they  marry.  Because  land  is  no 
longer  held  and  farmed  in  common  and  has  grown  more 
scarce,  inheritance  disputes  have  increased.

Hunters  and  gatherers  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  these 
far-reaching  changes.  The  lack  of  strong  authority  figures  in 
most  hunting  and  gathering  groups  handicaps  these  tribes  in 
organizing  to  negotiate  with  the  government.  In  addition, 
these  tribes  are  too  small  to  have  much  political  leverage. 
Forced  settlement  schemes  also  have  had  a  deleterious  impact 
on  the  tribes  and  their  environment.  Government-organized 
villages  are  typically  larger  than  traditional  hunting  and  gather- 
ing settlements.  Forest  reserves  limit  the  amount  of  territory 
over  which  tribes  can  ran^e  freelv.  Larger  villages  and  smaller 
territories  have  led,  in  some  instances,  to  an  increase  in  crime 
and  violence.  Traditionally,  hunters  and  gatherers  "settled" 
their  disputes  by  arranging  for  the  antagonists  simply  to  avoid 
one  another:  new,  more  circumscribed  villages  preclude  this 
arrangement. 

Tribal  beliefs  and  rituals  have  altered  in  the  face  of  increased 
contact  with  Hindus  and  missionaries  of  a  variety  of  persua- 
sions (see  Tribal  Religions,  ch.  3).  Among  groups  in  more 
intense  contact  with  the  Hindu  majority,  there  have  been  vari- 
ous transformations.  The  Gonds,  for  example,  traditionally 
worshiped  clan  gods  through  elaborate  rites,  with  Pardhans 
organizing  and  performing  the  necessary  rituals.  The  increas- 
ing impoverishment  of  large  sections  of  the  Gond  tribe  has 
made  it  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  support  the  Pardhans  as  a 
class  of  ritual  specialists.  At  the  same  time,  many  Gonds  have 
concluded  that  the  tribal  gods  were  losing  their  power  and  effi- 
cacy. Gonds  have  tended  to  seek  the  assistance  of  other  deities, 
and  thus  there  has  been  widespread  Hinduization  of  Gondi 
belief  and  practice.  Some  tribes  have  adopted  the  Hindu  prac- 
tice of  having  costly  elaborate  weddings — a  custom  that  con- 
tributes to  indebtedness  (as  it  has  in  many  rural  Indian 
families)  and  subjects  them  to  the  cash  economy  on  the  most 
deleterious  of  terms.  Some  families  have  adapted  a  traditional 
marriage  pattern — that  of  capturing  a  bride — to  modern  con- 
ditions, using  the  custom  to  avoid  the  costly  outlays  associated 
with  a  formal  wedding. 

Christian  missionaries  have  been  active  among  sundry  tribes 
since  the  mid-nineteenth  century.  Conversion  to  Christianity 
offers  a  number  of  advantages,  not  the  least  of  which  is  educa- 
tion. It  was  through  the  efforts  of  various  Christian  sects  to 
translate  the  Bible  into  tribal  languages  that  those  tongues 
acquired  a  written  script.  Christian  proselytizing  has  served  to 
preserve  tribal  lore  and  language  in  written  form  at  the  same 


210 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

time  that  it  has  tended  to  change  drastically  the  tribe's  cultural 
heritage  and  belief  systems.  In  some  instances,  the  introduc- 
tion of  Christianity  has  driven  a  wedge  between  converts  and 
their  fellow  tribal  members  who  continue  to  adhere  to  tradi- 
tional beliefs  and  practices  (see  Christianity,  ch.  3). 

Descendants  of  Foreign  Groups 

Jews  and  Parsis 

There  are  several  groups  descended  from  ancient  settlers  in 
India.  These  groups  include  the  Jews,  the  first  group  of  whom 
are  said  to  have  migrated  from  West  Asia  and  to  have  settled  in 
Cranganore  (also  the  traditional  first  site  where  Muslims  later 
arrived  in  India)  on  the  Malabar  Coast  of  Kerala  in  the  first 
century  A.D.,  a  second  group  of  Jews  who  fled  the  Arabian  Pen- 
insula in  the  face  of  Muslim  ascendancy  in  the  seventh  century, 
and  the  Parsis,  who  came  to  India  in  the  eighth  century  A.D.  to 
escape  Muslim  persecution  in  Persia  (see  Zoroastrianism;  Juda- 
ism, ch.  3). 

Portuguese 

The  European  powers  left  a  small  ethnic  imprint  on  India. 
The  Portuguese  came  first  and  left  last,  but  at  no  time  had  they 
extensive  dominions  such  as  the  Indian  kingdoms  and  empires 
or  the  lands  of  the  British  in  India.  The  Austrians,  Danish, 
Dutch,  and  French  had  yet  smaller  territories  for  shorter  peri- 
ods. By  the  time  truly  large  numbers  of  Europeans  came  to 
spend  their  working  lives  in  India  as  part  of  the  British  Raj,  rac- 
ist prejudices  that  were  largely  absent  in  earlier  centuries  had 
developed  in  the  Europeans.  Improvements  in  transportation 
(the  steamship  and  the  Suez  Canal)  also  had  made  travel 
swifter  and  safer  so  at  least  the  more  prosperous  classes  could 
return  to  Europe  on  leave  to  marry  or  choose  brides  coming 
on  the  so-called  "fishing  fleets"  for  tourism  and  husband-hunt- 
ing. 

There  are  around  730,000  Portuguese  Indians,  commonly 
known  as  Goans  or  Goanese,  about  half  of  whom  live  in  the 
state  of  Goa  and  the  others  elsewhere  in  India.  They  are 
descended  from  Indians  in  the  former  Portuguese  colony  who 
assimilated  to  Portuguese  culture  and  in  many  cases  are  the 
descendants  of  Indo-Portuguese  marriages,  which  the  Portu- 
guese civil  and  religious  authorities  encouraged.

India:  A  Country  Study 
Anglo-Indians 

The  largest  group  of  European  Indians,  however,  are  descen- 
dants of  British  men,  generally  from  the  colonial  service  and 
the  military,  and  lower-caste  Hindu  or  Muslim  women.  From 
some  time  in  the  nineteenth  century,  both  the  British  and  the 
Indian  societies  rejected  the  offspring  of  these  unions,  and  so 
the  Anglo-Indians,  as  they  became  known,  sought  marriage 
partners  among  other  Anglo-Indians.  Over  time  this  group 
developed  a  number  of  caste-like  features  and  acquired  a  spe- 
cial occupational  niche  in  the  railroad,  postal,  and  customs  ser- 
vices. A  number  of  factors  fostered  a  strong  sense  of  commu- 
nity among  Anglo-Indians.  The  school  system  focused  on 
English  language  and  culture  and  was  virtually  segregated,  as 
were  Anglo-Indian  social  clubs;  the  group's  adherence  to  Chris- 
tianity also  set  members  apart  from  most  other  Indians;  and 
distinctive  manners,  diet,  dress,  and  speech  contributed  to 
their  segregation. 

During  the  independence  movement,  many  Anglo-Indians 
identified  (or  were  assumed  to  identify)  with  British  rule,  and, 
therefore,  incurred  the  distrust  and  hostility  of  Indian  nation- 
alists. Their  position  at  independence  was  difficult.  They  felt  a 
loyalty  to  a  British  "home"  that  most  had  never  seen  and  where 
they  would  gain  little  social  acceptance.  They  felt  insecure  in 
an  India  that  put  a  premium  on  participation  in  the  indepen- 
dence movement  as  a  prerequisite  for  important  government 
positions.  Some  Anglo-Indians  left  the  country  in  1947,  hoping 
to  make  a  new  life  in  Britain  or  elsewhere  in  the  Common- 
wealth of  Nations,  such  as  Australia  or  Canada.  Many  of  these 
people  returned  to  India  after  unsuccessful  attempts  to  find  a 
place  in  "alien"  societies.  Most  Anglo-Indians,  however,  opted 
to  stay  in  India  and  made  whatever  adjustments  they  deemed 
necessary. 

Like  the  Parsis,  the  Anglo-Indians  are  essentially  urban 
dwellers.  Unlike  the  Parsis,  relatively  few  have  attained  high  lev- 
els of  education,  amassed  great  wealth,  or  achieved  more  than 
subordinate  government  positions.  In  the  1990s,  Anglo-Indians 
remained  scattered  throughout  the  country  in  the  larger  cities 
and  those  smaller  towns  serving  as  railroad  junctions  and  com- 
munications centers. 

Constitutional  guarantees  of  the  rights  of  communities  and 
religious  and  linguistic  minorities  permit  Anglo-Indians  to 
maintain  their  own  schools  and  to  use  English  as  the  medium 
of  instruction.  In  order  to  encourage  the  integration  of  the 


212

community  into  the  larger  society,  the  government  stipulates 
that  a  certain  percentage  of  the  student  body  come  from  other 
Indian  communities.  There  is  no  evident  official  discrimina- 
tion against  Anglo-Indians  in  terms  of  current  government 
employment.  A  few  have  risen  to  high  posts;  some  are  high- 
ranking  officers  in  the  military,  and  a  few  are  judges.  In  occu- 
pational terms,  at  least,  the  assimilation  of  Anglo-Indians  into 
the  mainstream  of  Indian  life  was  well  under  way  by  the  1990s. 
Nevertheless,  the  group  will  probably  remain  socially  distinct  as 
long  as  its  members  marry  only  other  Anglo-Indians  and  its 
European  descent  continues  to  be  noted. 

Africans 

Still  another  foreign-origin  group,  usually  known  collectively 
as  Siddhis,  are  the  descendants  of  Africans  brought  to  India  as 
slaves.  Although  most  African-origin  Indians  are  descendants 
of  the  large  influx  of  slaves  brought  to  western  India  in  the  sev- 
enteenth century,  the  first  Africans  reportedly  arrived  on  the 
Konkani  Coast  in  the  first  century  A.D.  as  a  result  of  the  Arab 
slave  trade,  and  there  was  an  important  African  presence, 
including  several  short-term  rulers,  in  Bengal  in  the  fifteenth 
century.  Siddhis  (the  name  means  lord  or  prince  in  African 
usage)  sometimes  rose  to  prominent — even  ruling — govern-

mental  and  military  positions  during  the  Mughal  and  British 
periods. 

Most  modern-day  Siddhis  are  Muslims  and  are  engaged  in 
agricultural  pursuits.  Thev  are  found  in  Gujarat.  Daman  and 
Diu.  Maharashtra.  Karnataka..  Andhra  Pradesh,  and  other 
states  and  union  territories,  where  thev  are  designated  as 
Scheduled  Tribe  members. 

Regionalism 

The  formation  of  states  along  linguistic  and  ethnic  lines  has 
occurred  in  India  in  numerous  instances  since  independence 
in  1947  i^see  Linguistic  States,  this  ch.).  There  have  been 
demands,  however,  to  form  units  within  states  based  not  only 
along  linguistic,  ethnic,  and  religious  lines  but  also,  in  some 
cases,  on  a  feeling  of  die  distinctness  of  a  geographical  region 
and  its  culture  and  economic  interests.  The  most  volatile  move- 
ments are  those  ongoing  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  Punjab 
see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8:  Insurgent  Movements  and  External 
Subversion,  ch.  9).  How  the  central  government  responds  to 
these  demands  will  be  an  area  of  scrutiny  through  the  late 
1990s  and  beyond.  It  is  believed  bv  some  officials  that  conced- 
ing regional  autonomy  is  less  arduous  and  takes  less  time  and 
fewer  resources  than  does  meeting  agitation,  violence.,  and 
demands  for  concessions. 

Telangana  Movement 

An  earlv  manifestation  of  regionalism  was  the  Telangana 
movement  in  what  became  the  state  of  Andhra  Pradesh.  The 
princely  ruler  of  Hvderabad.  the  nizam.  had  attempted  unsuc- 
cessfullv  to  maintain  Hvderabad  as  an  independent  state  sepa- 
rate from  India  in  1947.  His  efforts  were  simultaneous  with  the 
largest  agrarian  armed  rebellion  in  modern  Indian  historv. 
Starting  in  July  1946,  communist-led  guerrilla  squads  began 
overthrowing  local  feudal  village  resumes  and  organizing  land 
reform  in  Telugu-speaking  areas  of  Hvderabad,  collectively 
known  as  Telangana  (an  ancient  name  for  the  region  dating 
from  the  Yijavanagar  period).  In  time,  about  3.000  villages  and 
some  41.000  square  kilometers  of  territory  were  involved  in  the 
revolt.  Faced  with  the  refusal  of  the  nizam  of  Hvderabad  to 
accede  his  territory  to  India  and  the  violence  of  the  commu- 
nist-led rebellion,  the  central  government  sent  in  the  armv  in 
September  194S.  Bv  November  1949.  Hvderabad  had  been

Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

forced  to  accede  to  the  Indian  union,  and,  by  October  1951, 
the  violent  phase  of  the  Telangana  movement  had  been  sup- 
pressed. The  effect  of  the  1946-51  rebellion  and  communist 
electoral  victories  in  1952  had  led  to  the  destruction  of  Hydera- 
bad and  set  the  scene  for  the  establishment  of  a  new  state  along 
linguistic  lines.  In  1953,  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the 
States  Reorganisation  Commission,  Telugu-speaking  areas  were 
separated  from  the  former  Madras  States  to  form  Andhra, 
India's  first  state  established  along  linguistic  lines.  The  commis- 
sion also  contemplated  establishing  Telangana  as  a  separate 
state,  but  instead  Telangana  was  merged  with  Andhra  to  form 
the  new  state  of  Andhra  Pradesh  in  1956. 

The  concerns  about  Telangana  were  manifold.  The  region 
had  a  less  developed  economy  than  Andhra,  but  a  larger  reve- 
nue base  (mostly  because  it  taxed  rather  than  prohibited  alco- 
holic beverages),  which  Telanganas  feared  might  be  diverted 
for  use  in  Andhra.  They  also  feared  that  planned  dam  projects 
on  the  Krishna  and  Godavari  rivers  would  not  benefit  Telan- 
gana proportionately  even  though  Telanganas  controlled  the 
headwaters  of  the  rivers.  Telanganas  feared  too  that  the  people 
of  Andhra  would  have  the  advantage  in  jobs,  particularly  in 
government  and  education. 

The  central  government  decided  to  ignore  the  recommen- 
dation to  establish  a  separate  Telangana  state  and,  instead, 
merged  the  two  regions  into  a  unified  Andhra  Pradesh.  How- 
ever, a  "gentlemen's  agreement"  provided  reassurances  to  the 
Telangana  people.  For  at  least  five  years,  revenue  was  to  be 
spent  in  the  regions  proportionately  to  the  amount  they  con- 
tributed. Education  institutions  in  Telangana  were  to  be 
expanded  and  reserved  for  local  students.  Recruitment  to  the 
civil  service  and  other  areas  of  government  employment  such 
as  education  and  medicine  was  to  be  proportional.  The  use  of 
Urdu  was  to  continue  in  the  administration  and  the  judiciary 
for  five  years.  The  state  cabinet  was  to  have  proportional  mem- 
bership from  both  regions  and  a  deputy  chief  minister  from 
Telangana  if  the  chief  minister  was  from  Andhra  and  vice  versa. 
Finally,  the  Regional  Council  for  Telangana  was  to  be  responsi- 
ble for  economic  development,  and  its  members  were  to  be 
elected  by  the  members  of  the  state  legislative  assembly  from 
the  region. 

In  the  following  years,  however,  the  Telangana  people  had  a 
number  of  complaints  about  how  the  agreements  and  guaran- 
tees were  implemented.  The  deputy  chief  minister  position  was 


215 


India:  A  Country  Study 

never  filled.  Education  institutions  in  the  region  were  greatly 
expanded,  but  Telanganas  felt  that  their  enrollment  was  not 
proportionate  to  their  numbers.  The  selection  of  the  city  of 
Hyderabad  as  the  state  capital  led  to  massive  migration  of  peo- 
ple from  Andhra  into  Telangana.  Telanganas  felt  discriminated 
against  in  education  employment  but  were  told  by  the  state 
government  that  most  non-Telanganas  had  been  hired  on  the 
grounds  that  qualified  local  people  were  unavailable.  In  addi- 
tion, the  unification  of  pay  scales  between  the  two  regions 
appeared  to  disadvantage  Telangana  civil  servants.  In  the  atmo- 
sphere of  discontent,  professional  associations  that  earlier  had 
amalgamated  broke  apart  by  region. 

Discontent  with  the  1956  gentlemen's  agreement  intensified 
in  January  1969  when  the  guarantees  that  had  been  agreed  on 
were  supposed  to  lapse.  Student  agitation  for  the  continuation 
of  the  agreement  began  at  Osmania  University  in  Hyderabad 
and  spread  to  other  parts  of  the  region.  Government  employ- 
ees and  opposition  members  of  the  state  legislative  assembly 
swiftly  threatened  "direct  action"  in  support  of  the  students. 
The  Congress-controlled  state  and  central  governments 
offered  assurances  that  non-Telangana  civil  servants  in  the 
region  would  be  replaced  by  Mulkis,  disadvantaged  local  peo- 
ple, and  that  revenue  surpluses  from  Telangana  would  be 
returned  to  the  region.  The  protestors,  however,  were  dissatis- 
fied, and  severe  violence,  including  mob  attacks  on  railroads, 
road  transport,  and  government  facilities,  spread  over  the 
region.  In  addition,  seventy-nine  police  firings  resulted  in 
twenty-three  deaths  according  to  official  figures,  the  education 
system  was  shut  down,  and  examinations  were  cancelled.  Calls 
for  a  separate  Telangana  state  came  in  the  midst  of  counter  vio- 
lence in  Andhra  areas  bordering  Telangana.  In  the  meantime, 
the  Andhra  Pradesh  High  Court  decreed  that  a  central  govern- 
ment law  mandating  replacement  of  non-Telangana  govern- 
ment employees  with  Mulkis  was  beyond  Parliament's 
constitutional  powers. 

Although  the  Congress  faced  dissension  within  its  ranks,  its 
leadership  stood  against  additional  linguistic  states,  which  were 
regarded  as  "antinational."  As  a  result,  defectors  from  the  Con- 
gress, led  by  M.  Chenna  Reddy,  founded  the  Telangana  Peo- 
ple's Association  (Telangana  Praja  Samithi).  Despite  electoral 
successes,  however,  some  of  the  new  party  leaders  gave  up  their 
agitation  in  September  1971  and,  much  to  the  disgust  of  many

separatists,  rejoined  the  safer  political  haven  of  the  Congress 
ranks. 

In  1972  the  Supreme  Court  reversed  the  Andhra  Pradesh 
High  Court's  ruling  that  the  Mulki  rules  were  unconstitutional. 
This  decision  triggered  agitation  in  the  Andhra  region  that 
produced  six  months  of  violence. 

Throughout  the  1970s,  Andhra  Pradesh  settled  into  a  pat- 
tern of  continuous  domination  by  Congress  (R)  and  later  Con- 
gress (I),  with  much  instability  and  dissidence  within  the  state 
party  and  constant  interference  from  Indira  Gandhi  and  the 
national  party.  Chenna  Reddy,  the  erstwhile  opposition  leader, 
was  for  a  time  the  Congress  (I)  state  chief  minister.  Congress 
domination  was  only  ended  by  the  founding  of  the  Telugu 
National  Party  by  N.T.  Rama  Rao  in  1982  and  its  overwhelming 
victory  in  the  state  elections  in  1983. 

Polls  taken  after  the  end  of  the  Telangana  movement 
showed  a  certain  lack  of  enthusiasm  for  it,  and  for  the  idea  of  a 
separate  state.  Although  urban  groups  (students  and  civil  ser- 
vants) had  been  most  active  in  the  movement,  its  support  was 
stronger  in  rural  areas.  Its  supporters  were  mixed:  low  and  mid- 
dle castes,  the  young  and  the  not  so  young,  women,  illiterates 
and  the  poorly  educated,  and  rural  gentry.  Speakers  of  several 
other  languages  than  Telugu  were  heavily  involved.  The  move- 
ment had  no  element  of  religious  communalism,  but  some 


217 


India:  A  Country  Study 

observers  thought  Muslims  were  particularly  involved  in  the 
movement.  Other  researchers  found  the  Muslims  were  unen- 
thusiastic  about  the  movement  and  noted  a  feeling  that  migra- 
tion from  Andhra  to  Telangana  was  creating  opportunities  that 
were  helping  non-Telanganas.  On  the  other  hand,  of  the  two 
locally  prominent  Muslim  political  groups,  only  one  supported 
a  separate  state;  the  other  opposed  the  idea  while  demanding 
full  implementation  of  the  regional  safeguards.  Although  Urdu 
speakers  were  appealed  to  in  the  agitation  (e.g.,  speeches  were 
given  in  Urdu  as  well  as  Telugu),  in  the  aftermath  Urdu  disap- 
peared from  the  schools  and  the  administration. 

The  Telangana  movement  grew  out  of  a  sense  of  regional 
identity  as  such,  rather  than  out  of  a  sense  of  ethnic  identity, 
language,  religion,  or  caste.  The  movement  demanded  redress 
for  economic  grievances,  the  writing  of  a  separate  history,  and 
establishment  of  a  sense  of  cultural  distinctness.  The  emotions 
and  forces  generated  by  the  movement  were  not  strong 
enough,  however,  for  a  continuing  drive  for  a  separate  state.  In 
the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  the  People's  War  Group,  an  ele- 
ment of  the  Communist  Party  of  India  (Marxist-Leninist), 
renewed  violence  in  Andhra  Pradesh  but  was  dealt  with  by  state 
police  forces.  The  Telangana  movement  was  never  directed 
against  the  territorial  integrity  of  India,  unlike  the  insurrec- 
tions in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  some  of  the  unrest  in  north- 
eastern India. 

Jharkhand  Movement 

The  word  Jharkhand,  meaning  "forest  region,"  applies  to  a 
forested  mountainous  plateau  region  in  eastern  India,  south  of 
the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain  and  west  of  the  Ganga's  delta  in  Bang- 
ladesh. The  term  dates  at  least  to  the  sixteenth  century.  In  the 
more  extensive  claims  of  the  movement,  Jharkhand  comprises 
seven  districts  in  Bihar,  three  in  West  Bengal,  four  in  Orissa, 
and  two  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  Ninety  percent  of  the  Scheduled 
Tribes  in  Jharkhand  live  in  the  Bihar  districts.  The  tribal  peo- 
ples, who  are  from  two  groups,  the  Chotanagpurs  and  the  San- 
tals,  have  been  the  main  agitators  for  the  movement. 

Jharkhand  is  mountainous  and  heavily  forested  and,  there- 
fore, easy  to  defend.  As  a  result,  it  was  traditionally  autonomous 
from  the  central  government  until  the  seventeenth  century 
when  its  riches  attracted  the  Mughal  rulers.  Mughal  adminis- 
tration eventually  led  to  more  outside  interference  and  a 


218

change  from  the  traditional  collective  system  of  land  owner- 
ship to  one  of  private  landholders. 

These  trends  intensified  under  British  colonial  rule,  leading 
to  more  land  being  transferred  to  the  local  tribes'  creditors  and 
the  development  of  a  system  of  "bonded  labor,"  which  meant 
permanent  and  often  hereditary  debt  slavery  to  one  employer. 
Unable  to  make  effective  use  of  the  British  court  system,  tribal 
peoples  resorted  to  rebellion  starting  in  the  late  eighteenth 
century.  In  response,  the  British  government  passed  a  number 
of  laws  in  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries  to  restrict 
alienation  of  tribal  lands  and  to  protect  the  interests  of  tribal 
cultivators. 

The  advent  of  Christian  missions  in  the  region  in  1845  led  to 
major  cultural  changes,  which  were  later  to  be  important  in  the 
Jharkhand  movement.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  tribes 
converted  to  Christianity,  and  schools  were  founded  for  both 
sexes,  including  higher  institutions  to  train  tribal  people  as 
teachers. 

Jharkhand's  mineral  wealth  also  has  been  a  problem  for  the 
tribes.  The  region  is  India's  primary  source  of  coal  and  iron. 
Bauxite,  copper,  limestone,  asbestos,  and  graphite  also  are 
found  there.  Coal  mining  began  in  1856,  and  the  Tata  Iron  and 
Steel  Factory  was  established  injamshedpur  in  1907.

India:  A  Country  Study 


The  modern  Jharkhand  movement  dates  to  the  earlv  part  of 
the  twentieth  century:  activity  was  initially  anions:  Christian

tribal  students  but  later  also  among  non-Christians  and  even 
some  nontribals.  Rivalries  developed  among  the  various  Protes- 
tant churches  and  with  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  but  most 
of  the  groups  coalesced  in  the  electoral  arena  and  achieved 
some  successes  on  the  local  level  in  the  1930s.  The  movement 
at  this  period  was  directed  more  at  Indian  dikus  (outsiders) 
than  at  the  British.  Jharkhand  spokesmen  made  representa- 
tions to  British  constitutional  commissions  requesting  a  sepa- 
rate state  and  redress  of  Grievances,  but  without  much  success. 

Independence  in  1947  brought  emphasis  on  planned  indus- 
trialization centering;  on  heaw  industries,  including  a  large 
expansion  of  mining.  A  measure  of  the  economic  importance 
of  the  Jharkhand  mines  is  that  the  region  produces  more  than 
73  percent  of  the  revenue  of  Bihar,  a  large  state.  The  socialist 
pattern  of  development  pursued  bv  the  central  government  led 
to  forced  sales  of  tribal  lands  to  the  government,  with  the  usual 
problem  of  perceived  inadequate  compensation.  On  the  other 
hand,  government  authorities  felt  that  because  the  soils  of  the 
region  are  poor,  industrialization  was  particularly  necessary  for 
the  local  people,  not  just  for  the  national  good.  However, 
industrial  development  brought  about  further  influx  of  outsid- 
ers, and  local  people  considered  that  they  were  not  being  hired 
in  sufficient  numbers.  The  nationalization  of  the  mines  in  1971 
allegedly  was  followed  bv  the  firing  of  almost  50.000  miners 
from  Jharkhand  and  their  replacement  bv  outsiders. 

Land  was  also  acquired  bv  the  government  for  building 
dams  and  their  reservoirs.  However,  some  observers  thought 
that  very  little  of  the  electricity  and  water  produced  by  the 
dams  was  going  to  the  region.  In  addition,  government  forestry 
favored  the  replacement  of  species  of  trees  that  had  multiple 
uses  to  the  forest  dwellers  with  others  useful  onlv  for  commer- 
cial sales.  Traditional  shifting  cultivation  and  forest  grazing 
were  restricted,  and  the  local  people  felt  that  the  prices  paid  by 
the  government  for  forest  products  they  gathered  for  sale  were 
too  low.  In  the  decades  since  independence,  these  problems 
have  persisted  and  intensified. 

On  the  political  front,  in  1949  the  Jharkhand  Party,  under 
the  leadership  of  Jaipal  Singh,  swept  the  tribal  districts  in  the 
first  general  elections.  When  the  States  Reorganisation  Com- 
mission was  formed,  a  memorandum  was  submitted  to  it  asking 
for  an  extensive  region  to  be  established  as  Jharkhand,  which

would  have  exceeded  West  Bengal  in  area  and  Orissa  in  popu- 
lation. The  commission  rejected  the  idea  of  a  Jharkhand  state, 
however,  on  the  grounds  that  it  lacked  a  common  language.  In 
the  1950s,  the  Jharkhand  Party  continued  as  the  largest  opposi- 
tion party  in  the  Bihar  legislative  assembly,  but  it  gradually 
declined  in  strength.  The  worst  blow  came  in  1963  when  Jaipal 
Singh  merged  the  party  into  the  Congress  without  consulting 
the  membership.  In  the  wake  of  this  move,  several  splinter 
Jharkhand  parties  were  formed,  with  varying  degrees  of  elec- 
toral success.  These  parties  were  largely  divided  along  tribal 
lines,  which  the  movement  previously  had  not  seen. 

There  also  has  been  dissention  between  Christian  and  non- 
Christian  tribal  people  because  of  differences  in  level  of  educa- 
tion and  economic  development.  Non-Christian  tribals  formed 
separate  organizations  to  promote  their  interests  in  the  1940s 
and  again  in  the  1960s.  In  1968  a  parliamentary  study  team  vis- 
ited Ranchi  investigating  the  removal  of  groups  from  the  offi- 
cial list  of  Scheduled  Tribes  (thereby  depriving  these  groups  of 
various  compensatory  privileges).  Mass  meetings  were  held 
and  petitions  submitted  to  the  study  team  maintaining  that 
Christians  had  ceased  to  be  tribals  by  conversion  from  tribal 
religions,  and  that  they  benefitted  unfairly  both  from  mission 
schooling  and  from  government  protection  as  members  of 
Scheduled  Tribes.  In  the  following  years,  there  were  accusa- 
tions that  the  missionaries  were  foreign  outside  agitators, 

In  August  1995,  the  state  government  of  Bihar  established 
the  180-member  Provisional  Jharkhand  Area  Autonomous 
Council.  The  council  has  162  elected  members  (two  each  from 
eighty-one  assembly  constituencies  in  the  Jharkhand  area)  and 
eighteen  appointed  members. 

Uttarakhand 

The  term  Uttarakhand,  meaning  "northern  tract"  or  "higher 
tract,"  refers  to  the  Himalayan  districts  of  Uttar  Pradesh, 
between  the  state  of  Himachal  Pradesh  to  the  west  and  Nepal 
to  the  east.  It  contains  the  eight  districts  of  the  Kumaon  and 
Garhwal  divisions.  The  main  local  languages  are  Kumaoni, 
Garhwali,  and  Pahari  ("mountain"),  a  language  of  the  Indo- 
Aryan  family.  The  language  of  the  elite,  business,  and  adminis- 
tration is  Hindi. 

The  Uttarakhand  movement  is  motivated  by  regional  factors 
along  with  economic  factors  stemming  from  its  particular  geog- 
raphy. There  is  no  protest  against  the  dominance  of  Hindi  in 


221 


India:  A  Country  Study 


education  and  administration  in  the  state.  As  regards  religion, 
the  population  of  the  hills  is  almost  entirely  Hindu,  like  the 
large  majority  of  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  influx  of  outsiders  has  not 
become  an  issue;  indeed,  the  problem  has  rather  been  the 
need  for  natives  of  the  region  to  leave  it. 

The  residents  of  hill  districts  have  felt  themselves  lost  in  the 
large  state  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and  their  needs  ignored  by  the  pol- 
iticians more  concerned  with  wider  regional  issues.  There  has 
been  almost  no  development  of  industry  or  higher  education, 
although  the  1962  border  war  with  China  resulted  in  some 
infrastructure  development,  particularly  roads,  which  also  were 
extended  to  make  the  more  remote  pilgrimage  sites  more 
accessible. 

Men  of  the  region  are  forced  to  leave  their  families  in  the 
hills  and  seek  employment  in  the  plains,  where  they  mostly  find 
menial  positions  as  domestic  servants,  which  they  consider 
undignified  and  inappropriate  to  their  caste.  Students  must 
also  go  to  the  plains  for  higher  education.  All  find  the  heat  of 
the  lowlands  very  oppressive. 

The  major  potential  in  Uttarakhand  for  hydroelectric  power 
from  the  Ganga  and  Yamuna  rivers  and  for  tourism  has  not 
been  developed,  locals  feel.  Springs,  which  are  essential  for 
drinking  and  irrigation  water,  have  been  allowed  to  dry  up. 
The  particular  needs  of  hill  agriculture  have  been  ignored. 
The  plains  produce  grain  primarily,  whereas  fruit  growing  is 
more  promising  in  the  hills.  On  the  other  hand,  adjacent 
Himachal  Pradesh,  which  consists  of  Himalayan  districts  for- 
merly in  Punjab  or  in  associated  princely  states,  became  a  state 
in  1948.  Himachal  Pradesh  is  geographically  and  culturally 
quite  similar  to  Uttarakhand  and  has  enjoyed  satisfying 
progress  in  power  generation,  tourism,  and  cultivation.  Some 
administrators  observe  that  small  states  such  as  Himachal 
Pradesh  can  make  more  rapid  progress  just  by  virtue  of  being 
smaller,  so  that  the  problems  are  less  overwhelming  and  local 
needs  are  not  lost. 

The  first  demand  for  a  separate  Uttarakhand  state  was 
voiced  by  P.C.  Joshi,  a  member  of  the  Communist  Party  of 
India  (CPI),  in  1952.  However,  a  movement  did  not  develop  in 
earnest  until  1979  when  the  Uttarakhand  Kranti  Dal  (Uttara- 
khand Revolutionary  Front)  was  formed  to  fight  for  separa- 
tion. In  1991  the  Uttar  Pradesh  legislative  assembly  passed  a 
resolution  supporting  the  idea,  but  nothing  came  of  it.  In  1994 
student  agitation  against  the  state's  implementation  of  the

Mandal  Commission  (see  Glossary)  report  increasing  the  num- 
ber of  reserved  government  positions  and  university  places  for 
lower  caste  people  (the  largest  caste  of  Kumaon  and  Garhwal  is 
the  high-ranking  Rajput  Kshatriya  group)  expanded  into  a 
struggle  for  statehood.  Violence  spread  on  both  sides,  with 
attacks  on  police,  police  firing  on  demonstrators,  and  rapes  of 
female  Uttarakhand  activists.  In  1995  the  agitation  was 
renewed,  mostly  peacefully,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Uttara- 
khand Samyukta  Sangharsh  Samiti  (Uttarakhand  United  Strug- 
gle Association),  a  coalition  headed  by  the  Uttarakhand  Kranti 
Dal.  The  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP),  seeing  the  appeal  of 
statehood  to  its  high-caste  constituencies,  also  supported  the 
movement,  but  wanted  to  act  on  its  own.  To  distinguish  its 
activities,  the  BJP  wanted  the  new  state  to  be  called  Uttaran- 
chal,  meaning  "northern  border  or  region,"  essentially  a  syn- 
onym for  Uttarakhand.  In  1995  various  marches  and 
demonstrations  of  the  Uttarakhand  movement  were  tense  with 
the  possibility  of  conflict  not  just  with  the  authorities,  but  also 
between  the  two  main  political  groups.  Actual  violence,  how- 
ever, was  rare.  A  march  to  New  Delhi  in  support  of  statehood 
was  being  planned  later  in  the  year.  An  interesting  develop- 
ment was  that  women  were  playing  an  active  leadership  role  in 
the  agitation. 

Gorkhaland 

The  Gorkhaland  movement  grew  from  the  demand  of  Nepa- 
lis  living  in  Darjiling  District  of  West  Bengal  for  a  separate  state 
for  themselves.  The  Gorkhaland  National  Liberation  Front  led 
the  movement,  which  disrupted  the  district  with  massive  vio- 
lence between  1986  and  1988.  The  issue  was  resolved,  at  least 
temporarily,  in  1988  with  the  establishment  of  the  Darjiling 
Gorkha  Hill  Council  within  West  Bengal. 

Historically,  Darjiling  belonged  to  the  kingdom  of  Sikkim, 
which  had  lost  it  several  times  since  the  eighteenth  century. 
The  ethnic  identity  "Gorkha"  comes  from  the  kingdom  with 
that  name  that  united  Nepal  in  the  late  eighteenth  century  and 
was  the  focal  point  of  Nepalese  in  the  British  army. 

Immigration  from  Nepal  expanded  with  British  rule  in 
India,  and  some  34  percent  of  the  population  of  Darjiling  in 
1876  was  of  Gorkha  (also  seen  as  Gurkha)  ethnicity.  By  the  start 
of  the  twentieth  century,  Nepalese  immigrants  made  a  modest 
socioeconomic  advance  through  government  service,  and  a 
small  anglicized  elite  developed  among  them.  In  1917  the  Hill- 


223 


India:  A  Country  Study 

men's  Association  came  into  being  and  petitioned  for  the 
administrative  separation  of  Darjiling  in  1917  and  again  in 
1928  and  1942.  In  1928  the  Akhil  Bharatiya  Gorkha  League 
(All  India  Gorkha  League)  was  formed.  It  gained  additional 
support  after  World  War  II  with  the  influx  of  ex-soldiers  from 
the  Gurkha  regiments  who  had  been  exposed  to  nationalist 
movements  in  Southeast  Asia  during  service  there. 

During  the  1940s,  the  CPI  organized  Gorkha  tea  workers.  In 
presentations  to  the  States  Reorganisation  Commission  in 
1954,  the  CPI  favored  regional  autonomy  for  Darjiling  within 
West  Bengal,  with  recognition  of  Nepali  as  a  Scheduled  Lan- 
guage. The  All  India  Gorkha  League  preferred  making  the 
area  a  union  territory  under  the  national  government  (see 
Local  Government,  ch.  8). 

The  state  of  West  Bengal  nominally  has  been  supportive  of 
the  use  of  the  Nepali  language.  The  West  Bengal  Official  Lan- 
guage Act  of  1961  made  Nepali  the  official  language  of  the  hill 
subdivisions  of  Darjiling,  Kalimpong,  and  Kurseong,  where 
Nepalese  are  a  majority.  The  state  legislative  assembly  passed  a 
resolution  in  1977  that  led  Parliament  to  amend  the  national 
constitution  to  include  Nepali  as  a  Scheduled  Language.  How- 
ever, the  Gorkhaland  National  Liberation  Front  has  accused 
the  state  government  of  failure  to  actually  implement  use  of 
the  language. 

The  Gorkhaland  movement  distinguished  Darjiling  Gorkhas 
from  nationals  of  Nepal  legally  resident  in  India,  from  Nepali- 
speaking  Indian  citizens  from  other  parts  of  the  country,  and 
even  from  the  majority  in  neighboring  Sikkim,  where  Nepali  is 
the  official  language.  The  movement  was  emphatic  that  it  had 
no  desire  to  separate  from  India,  only  from  the  state  of  West 
Bengal.  Gorkhaland  supporters  therefore  preferred  to  call  the 
Gorkhas'  language  Gorkhali  rather  than  Nepali,  although  they 
did  not  attempt  to  claim  there  is  any  linguistic  difference  from 
what  other  people  call  Nepali.  The  1981  census  of  India, 
whether  in  deference  to  this  sentiment  or  for  some  other  rea- 
son, called  the  language  Gorkhali /Nepali.  However,  when  the 
Eighth  Schedule  of  the  constitution  was  amended  in  1992  to 
make  it  a  Scheduled  Language,  the  term  Nepali  alone  was  used. 

In  1986  the  Gorkhaland  National  Liberation  Front,  having 
failed  to  obtain  a  separate  regional  administrative  identity  from 
Parliament,  again  demanded  a  separate  state  of  Gorkhaland. 
The  party's  leader,  Subhash  Ghising,  headed  a  demonstration 
that  turned  violent  and  was  severely  repressed  by  the  state  gov-

ernment.  The  disturbances  almost  totally  shut  down  the  dis- 
tricts' economic  mainstays  of  tea,  tourism,  and  timber.  The  Left 
Front  government  of  West  Bengal,  which  earlier  had  supported 
some  form  of  autonomy,  now  opposed  it  as  "antinational."  The 
state  government  claimed  that  Darjiling  was  no  worse  off  than 
the  state  in  general  and  was  richer  than  many  districts.  Ghising 
made  lavish  promises  to  his  followers,  including  the  recruit- 
ment of  40,000  Indian  Gorkhas  into  the  army  and  paying 
Rsl00,000  (for  value  of  the  rupee — see  Glossary)  for  every 
Gorkha  writer.  After  two  years  of  fighting  and  the  loss  of  at  least 
200  lives,  the  government  of  West  Bengal  and  the  central  gov- 
ernment finally  agreed  on  an  autonomous  hill  district.  In  July 
1988,  the  Gorkhaland  National  Liberation  Front  gave  up  the 
demand  for  a  separate  state,  and  in  August  the  Darjiling 
Gorkha  Hill  Council  came  into  being  with  Ghising  as  chair- 
man. The  council  had  authority  over  economic  development 
programs,  education,  and  culture. 

However,  difficulties  soon  arose  over  the  panchayat  (see  Glos- 
sary) elections.  Ghising  wanted  the  hill  council  excluded  from 
the  national  law  on  panchayat  elections.  Rajiv  Gandhi's  govern- 
ment was  initially  favorable  to  his  request  and  introduced  a 
constitutional  amendment  in  1989  to  exclude  the  Darjiling 
Gorkha  Hill  Council,  along  with  several  other  northeast  hill 
states  and  regions  (Nagaland,  Meghalaya,  Mizoram,  and  the 


225 


India:  A  Country  Study 

hill  regions  of  Manipur),  but  it  did  not  pass.  However,  in  1992 
Parliament  passed  the  Seventy-third  Amendment,  which 
seemed  to  show  a  newly  serious  commitment  to  the  idea  of 
local  self-government  by  panchayats.  The  amendment  excluded 
all  the  hill  areas  just  mentioned  except  Darjiling.  Ghising 
insisted  this  omission  was  a  machination  of  West  Bengal  and 
threatened  to  revive  militant  agitation  for  a  Gorkhaland  state. 
He  also  said  the  Gorkhaland  National  Liberation  Front  would 
boycott  the  village  panchayat  elections  mandated  by  the  amend- 
ment. A  large  portion  of  his  party,  however,  refused  to  accept 
the  boycott  and  split  off  under  the  leadership  of  Chiten  Sherpa 
to  form  the  All  India  Gorkha  League,  which  won  a  sizable  num- 
ber of  panchayat  seats. 

In  1995  it  was  unclear  whether  the  region  would  remain  con- 
tent with  autonomy  rather  than  statehood.  In  August  1995, 
Sherpa  complained  to  the  state  government  that  Ghising's  gov- 
ernment had  misused  hill  council  funds,  and  West  Bengal  chief 
minister  Jyoti  Basu  promised  to  investigate.  Both  Gorkha  par- 
ties showed  willingness  to  use  general  shutdowns  to  forward 
their  ends.  The  fact  that  so  many  people  were  willing  to  follow 
Sherpa  instead  of  the  hitherto  unchallenged  Ghising  may  indi- 
cate that  they  will  be  satisfied  with  regional  autonomy. 

Ladakh 

The  region  of  Ladakh  is  isolated  in  the  Himalayas  next  to 
Tibet  and  differs  radically  from  the  rest  of  the  state  in  that  the 
majority  of  the  population  is  culturally,  ethnically,  religiously, 
and  linguistically  close  to  Tibet.  There  also  is  a  Muslim  minor- 
ity. The  region  has  no  interest  in  the  separatist  and  Islamicist 
sentiments  of  the  Vale  of  Kashmir. 

Following  several  years  of  discontent  and  agitation  about  the 
position  of  Ladakh  District  in  the  state  ofjammu  and  Kashmir, 
the  central  government  passed  the  Ladakh  Autonomous  Hill 
Development  Councils  Act  in  May  1995.  The  1995  act  estab- 
lished councils  for  the  Leh  and  Kargil  subdistricts  and  allotted 
them  powers  for  economic  development,  land  use,  and  taxa- 
tion. Elections  for  the  Leh  council  were  held  in  August  1995. 
Congress  (I)  won  all  twenty-two  elective  seats  unopposed;  the 
governor  ofjammu  and  Kashmir  was  authorized  to  appoint 
four  members  from  among  minorides  and  women. 

The  Northeast 

Northeastern  India  is  made  up  of  the  states  of  Assam, 


226 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

Meghalaya,  Tripura,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Mizoram,  Manipur, 
and  Nagaland.  Certain  tensions  exist  between  these  states  and 
a  relatively  distant  central  government  and  between  the  tribal 
peoples,  who  are  natives  of  these  states,  and  migrant  peoples 
from  other  parts  of  India.  These  tensions  have  led  the  natives 
of  these  states  to  seek  a  greater  participation  in  their  own  gov- 
ernance, control  of  their  states'  economies,  and  their  role  in 
society.  Emerging  from  these  desires  for  greater  self-gover- 
nance are  new  regional  political  parties  and  continued  insur- 
gent movements  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8;  Insurgent 
Movements  and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10).  In  addition  to 
the  more  frequently  analyzed  regional  movements  in  Jammu 
and  Kashmir,  Punjab,  and  states  such  as  Assam  and  Nagaland 
in  the  northeast,  there  are  other  regional  movements,  such  as 
those  in  the  Tripura  and  Miso  tribal  areas. 

In  May  1995,  the  state  government  of  Tripura  extended  the 
area  covered  by  the  Tripura  Tribal  Areas  Autonomous  District 
Council,  a  result  of  the  tripartite  accord  among  the  central  gov- 
ernment, the  state  government,  and  the  Tripura  National  Vol- 
unteers movement  concluded  in  1988.  In  the  elections  in  July 
1995,  the  Left  Front,  led  by  the  Communist  Party  of  India 
(Marxist),  defeated  the  alliance  of  the  Congress  (I)  and  the 
local  Tripura  Tribal  Youth  Association  (Tripura  Upajati  Juba 
Samiti),  which  had  controlled  the  council  since  1990.  The  new 
council  proceeded  to  dissolve  the  more  than  400  development 
committees  at  various  levels  under  its  jurisdiction  for  corrup- 
tion and  inaction  and  promised  to  constitute  new  ones  swiftly. 

In  June  1995,  the  Assam  government  signed  an  agreement 
with  two  organizations  of  the  Mising  tribe,  the  Mising  Autono- 
mous Demand  Committee  and  the  Mising  Greater  Council 
(Mising  Bane  Kebang),  to  set  up  an  autonomous  council  for 
the  Misings.  The  council  will  include  villages  with  majority 
tribal  populations  in  four  districts  of  Assam,  with  a  total  popula- 
tion expected  to  be  about  315,000.  However,  villages  in  so- 
called  Reserve  Forest  Areas  will  be  included  only  with  the 
approval  of  the  central  minister  of  state  with  independent 
charge  of  environment  and  forests.  This  decision  is  a  possible 
source  of  discontent  because  tribals  frequently  feel  themselves 
hampered  by  restrictions  on  the  use  of  forests  by  the  govern- 
ment. However,  in  July  1995  the  Mising  Bane  Kebang  boy- 
cotted the  swearing  in  of  the  interim  council  because  it  said  the 
Mising  Autonomous  Demand  Committee  had  kept  it  out  of  its 
formation.

India:  A  Country  Study 


Outlook 

In  the  1990s,  the  central  government  has  seemed  far  more 
willing  than  previously  to  grant  demands  for  regional  political 
entities  within  states,  acceding  to  more  demands  and  doing  so 
after  less  agitation.  This  change  may  be  part  of  a  wider  willing- 
ness to  decentralize  manifested  in  the  recent  trend  of  serious 
support  of  panchayati  raj,  granting  more  taxing,  legislative,  and 
development  powers  to  panchayats  at  various  levels  and  holding 
long-delayed  elections  to  them.  The  demands  on  money,  time, 
and  military  and  police  personnel  caused  by  the  disturbances 
in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Punjab,  and  the  northeastern  states, 
and  other  military  actions,  such  as  that  in  Sri  Lanka,  may  have 
made  the  central  authorities  more  reluctant  to  resist  demands 
if  resistance  might  require  military  suppression.  This  trend  to 
concede  substate  entities  presages  a  number  of  possible  out- 
comes for  the  Indian  polity. 

It  should  be  noted  that  any  of  these  regional  changes,  from 
the  purely  legal  point  of  view,  could  be  reversed  by  the  central 
government  on  its  own  accord.  Most  constitutional  amend- 
ments require  only  a  two-thirds  vote  of  Parliament.  However, 
once  in  place,  the  various  regional  entities  create  a  heavy  self- 
interest  among  their  office-holders  and  employees,  in  addition 
to  those  who  feel  served  by  their  creation.  An  attempt  to 
reverse  the  delegation  of  power  could  arouse  agitations  at  least 
as  intense  as  the  original  movements  to  force  the  issue. 

The  traditional  worry  about  further  divisions  of  or  within 
states  was  that  they  would  be  "antinational, "  weakening 
national  unity.  Although  the  reorganization  of  states  on  linguis- 
tic lines  was  initiallv  resisted  as  a  challenge  to  national  unity, 
once  established,  new  states  were  not  regarded  as  a  threat,  per- 
haps because  they  just  had  to  be  accepted  as  a  fait  accompli, 
and  no  attempt  to  reverse  the  organization  of  states  on  linguis- 
tic grounds  has  been  suggested.  This  attitude  prevails  in  spite 
of  the  secessionist  sentiment  that  used  to  exist  in  Tamil  Nadu 
and  still  does  in  Punjab  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  Once  the 
substate  entities  are  operational,  their  continued  existence  may 
be  regarded  as  similarly  inevitable.  However,  as  has  been 
observed,  the  regionalist  movements  have  mostly  preached, 
with  apparent  sincerity,  their  attachment  to  the  nation;  their 
complaints  have  rather  been  with  state  apparatuses.  Anyone 
concerned  about  the  possibility  of  secession  from  India  might 
consider  that  a  process  granting  more  regional  government 
bodies  might  in  fact  strengthen  national  unity.  The  regional 


228 


Language,  Ethnicity,  and  Regionalism 

governments  within  linguistic  states  could  serve  as  additional 
centers  of  loyalty,  benefits,  and  patronage  in  competition  with 
the  linguistic  states,  weakening  a  state's  ability  to  attract  an 
exclusive  attachment  and  be  seen  as  a  candidate  to  be  an  inde- 
pendent national  entity. 

Whereas  regional  sentiment  is  partly  linguistic,  promotion  of 
the  local  languages  may  provide  a  counterweight  to  the  ten- 
dencies of  states  to  insist  on  the  spread  of  the  state  language  at 
the  expense  of  all  others,  a  spread  which,  to  the  extent  that  it 
succeeds,  makes  the  state  something  more  nearly  approaching 
a  nation-state.  The  substate  regions  have  been  granted  finan- 
cial and  other  political  powers,  which,  if  they  wish,  they  can  use 
to  encourage  the  formation  or  intensification  of  ethnic  con- 
sciousness, as  the  states  also  can.  But,  since  the  regions  are 
smaller  bodies,  they  are  less  likely  to  contemplate  indepen- 
dence or  to  concur  with  a  move  toward  independence  if  the 
states  should  do  so. 

Apart  from  the  reduction  of  threats  to  national  unity,  the 
recognition  of  regionalism  may  have  further  political  benefits. 
First  is  the  reduction  of  the  violence  that  ensues  from  regional 
movements  and  their  repression.  It  is  hoped  that  intermediate 
governments  also  will  be  able  to  reduce  political  violence  by 
allowing  the  swifter  expression  and  solution  of  the  woes  of  dis- 
contented peoples.  Such  action  cannot  be  guaranteed;  it 
depends  in  part  on  which  politicians  get  elected.  Resolution  of 
problems  neglected  by  central  and  state  authorities  and  that 
originally  motivated  the  movements  is  also  possible.  Moreover, 
such  resolution  may  result  in  greater  participation  in  demo- 
cratic government  by  those  voting  or  holding  office  in  organi- 
zations closer  to  local  concerns  and  groups  than  is  the  national 
Parliament  or  even  the  state  legislatures.  In  this  way,  there  is  a 
continuation  of  the  political  mobilization  started  in  the  course 
of  the  movements. 

If  substate  regions  proliferate,  including  regional  entities 
within  regional  entities,  the  process  will  resemble  traditional 
Indian  polities  with  imperial  powers,  feudatory  monarchies, 
subinfeudation  within  those,  and  real  political  power  at  the 
local  level.  Arguably,  this  situation  would  accommodate  the 
true  nature  of  the  society  better  than  the  quite  centralized  sys- 
tem India  has  had  since  independence  and  provide  scope  for 
real  democracy.

India:  A  Country  Study 


Michael  Shapiro  and  Harold  Schiffmann's  Language  and  Soci- 
ety in  South  Asia  is  the  best  summation  of  research  on  the  lan- 
guages of  the  region  and  their  place  in  social  life.  Among 
somewhat  older  works,  Language  and  Civilization  Change  in 
South  Asia,  edited  by  Clarence  Maloney,  remains  useful,  and  in 
particular  the  introduction  by  the  editor  gives  a  good  general 
overview.  An  excellent  summary  of  the  history  and  current 
state  of  research  on  the  linguistics,  sociolinguistics,  and  history 
of  Indo-Aryan  languages  is  found  in  Colin  P.  Masica's  The  Indo- 
Aryan  Languages. 

Language  statistics,  as  well  as  lists  of  languages,  are  found  in 
the  decennial  Indian  census.  Useful  statistics  gathered  on  dif- 
ferent principles,  counting  communities  (Scheduled  Castes, 
Scheduled  Tribes,  and  other  categories)  rather  than  individu- 
als, gathered  by  the  Anthropological  Survey  of  India  are  found 
in  the  volumes  edited  by  Kumar  Suresh  Singh,  in  the  series  Peo- 
ple of  India.  Particularly  useful  on  tribes  are  K.S.  Singh's  An 
Anthropological  Atlas,  which  includes  maps  covering  culture,  lan- 
guage, physical  anthropology,  and  other  useful  categories;  his 
The  Scheduled  Tribes  is  a  thorough  encyclopedia  of  all  the  tribes. 

On  the  construction  of  linguistic  and  other  identities,  Paul 
R.  Brass's  Language,  Religion  and  Politics  in  North  India  remains 
basic  to  an  understanding  of  the  subject.  Themes  in  it  are 
updated  in  his  The  Politics  of  India  since  Independence. 

All  of  Christoph  von  Ftirer-Haimendorf's  works  on  India's 
tribal  people  are  useful.  His  Tribal  Populations  and  Cultures  of  the 
Indian  Subcontinent  provides  a  contemporary  view  of  some  of 
the  country's  larger  tribes.  Moonis  Raza  and  Aijazuddin 
Ahmad's  An  Atlas  of  Tribal  India  is  also  useful. 

Bernard  S.  Cohn's  India:  The  Social  Anthropology  of  a  Civiliza- 
tion and  David  G.  Mandelbaum's  two-volume  Society  in  India 
remain  essential  background  works.  (For  further  information

Chapter  5.  Social  Systems 


Wedding  scene  from  a  drawing,  Madhubani,  Bihar 


INDIA  IS  JUSTLY  FAMOUS  for  its  complex  social  systems. 
Indian  society  is  multifaceted  to  an  extent  perhaps  unknown  in 
any  other  of  the  world's  great  civilizations.  Virtually  no  general- 
ization made  about  Indian  society  is  valid  for  all  of  the  nation's 
multifarious  groups.  Comprehending  the  complexities  of 
Indian  social  structure  has  challenged  scholars  and  other 
observers  over  many  decades. 

The  ethnic  and  linguistic  diversity  of  Indian  civilization  is 
more  like  the  diversity  of  an  area  as  variable  as  Europe  than 
like  that  of  any  other  single  nation-state.  Living  within  the 
embrace  of  the  Indian  nation  are  vast  numbers  of  different 
regional,  social,  and  economic  groups,  each  with  different  cul- 
tural practices.  Particularly  noteworthy  are  differences  between 
social  structures  in  the  north  and  the  south,  especially  in  the 
realm  of  kinship  systems.  Throughout  the  country,  religious 
differences  can  be  significant,  especially  between  the  Hindu 
majority  and  the  large  Muslim  minority;  and  other  Indian 
groups — Buddhists,  Christians,  Jains,  Jews,  Parsis,  Sikhs,  and 
practitioners  of  tribal  religions — all  pride  themselves  on  being 
unlike  members  of  other  faiths. 

Access  to  wealth  and  power  varies  considerably,  and  vast  dif- 
ferences in  socioeconomic  status  are  evident  everywhere.  The 
poor  and  the  wealthy  live  side  by  side  in  urban  and  rural  areas. 
It  is  common  in  city  life  to  see  a  prosperous,  well-fed  man  or 
woman  chauffeured  in  a  fine  car  pass  gaunt  street  dwellers 
huddled  beneath  burlap  shelters  along  the  roadway.  In  many 
villages,  solid  cement  houses  of  landowners  rise  not  far  from 
the  flimsy  thatched  shacks  of  landless  laborers.  Even  when  not 
so  obvious,  distinctions  of  class  are  found  in  almost  every  settle- 
ment in  India. 

Urban-rural  differences  can  be  immense.  Nearly  74  percent 
of  India's  population  dwells  in  villages,  with  agriculture  provid- 
ing support  for  most  of  these  rural  residents.  In  villages,  mud- 
plastered  walls  ornamented  with  traditional  designs,  dusty 
lanes,  herds  of  grazing  cattle,  and  the  songs  of  birds  at  sunset 
provide  typical  settings  for  the  social  lives  of  most  Indians.  In 
India's  great  cities,  however,  millions  of  people  live  amidst 
cacophony — roaring  vehicles,  surging  crowds,  jammed  apart- 
ment buildings,  busy  commercial  establishments,  loudspeakers 


233

blaring  movie  tunes — while  breathing  the  poisons  of  industrial 
and  automotive  pollution. 

Gender  distinctions  are  pronounced.  The  behavior 
expected  of  men  and  women  can  be  quite  different,  especially 
in  villages,  but  also  in  urban  centers.  Prescribed  ideal  gender 
roles  help  shape  the  actions  of  both  sexes  as  they  move 
between  family  and  the  world  outside  the  home. 

Crosscutting  and  pervading  all  of  these  differences  of 
region,  language,  wealth,  status,  religion,  urbanity,  and  gender 
is  the  special  feature  of  Indian  society  that  has  received  most 
attention  from  observers:  caste.  The  people  of  India  belong  to 
thousands  of  castes  and  castelike  groups — hierarchically 
ordered,  named  groups  into  which  members  are  born.  Caste 
members  are  expected  to  marry  within  the  group  and  follow 
caste  rules  pertaining  to  diet,  avoidance  of  ritual  pollution,  and 
many  other  aspects  of  life. 

Given  the  vast  diversity  of  Indian  society,  any  observation 
must  be  tempered  with  the  understanding  that  it  cannot  apply 
to  all  Indians.  Still,  certain  themes  or  underlying  principles  of 
life  are  widely  accepted  in  India. 

Themes  in  Indian  Society 
Hierarchy 

India  is  a  hierarchical  society.  Within  Indian  culture, 
whether  in  the  north  or  the  south,  Hindu  or  Muslim,  urban  or 
village,  virtually  all  things,  people,  and  groups  of  people  are 
ranked  according  to  various  essential  qualities.  If  one  is 
attuned  to  the  theme  of  hierarchy  in  India,  one  can  discern  it 
everywhere.  Although  India  is  a  political  democracy,  in  daily 
life  there  is  little  advocacy  of  or  adherence  to  notions  of  equal- 
ity. 

Castes  and  castelike  groups — those  quintessential  groups 
with  which  almost  all  Indians  are  associated — are  ranked. 
Within  most  villages  or  towns,  everyone  knows  the  relative 
rankings  of  each  locally  represented  caste,  and  people's  behav- 
ior toward  one  another  is  constantly  shaped  by  this  knowledge. 
Between  the  extremes  of  the  very  high  and  very  low  castes, 
however,  there  is  sometimes  disagreement  on  the  exact  relative 
ranking  of  castes  clustered  in  the  middle. 

Castes  are  primarily  associated  with  Hinduism  but  also  exist 
among  other  Indian  religious  groups.  Muslims  sometimes 
expressly  deny  that  they  have  castes — they  state  that  all  Muslims 


234 


Social  Systems 


are  brothers  under  God — but  observation  of  Muslim  life  in  var- 
ious parts  of  India  r  eveals  the  existence  of  castelike  groups  and 
clear  concern  with  social  hierarchy.  Among  Indian  Christians, 
too,  differences  in  caste  are  acknowledged  and  maintained. 

Throughout  India,  individuals  are  also  ranked  according  to 
their  wealth  and  power.  For  example,  there  are  "big  men"  (bare 
admi,  in  Hindi)  and  "little  men"  (chhote  admi)  everywhere.  "Big 
men"  sit  confidently  on  chairs,  while  "little  men"  come  before 
them  to  make  requests,  either  standing  or  crouching  down  on 
their  haunches,  certainly  not  presuming  to  sit  beside  a  man  of 
high  status  as  an  equal.  Even  men  of  nearly  equal  status  who 
might  share  a  string  cot  to  sit  on  take  their  places  carefully — 
the  higher-ranking  man  at  the  head  of  the  cot,  the  lower-rank- 
ing man  at  the  foot. 

Within  families  and  kinship  groupings,  there  are  many  dis- 
tinctions of  hierarchy.  Men  outrank  women  of  the  same  or  sim- 
ilar age,  and  senior  relatives  outrank  junior  relatives.  Several 
other  kinship  relations  involve  formal  respect.  For  example,  in 
northern  India,  a  daughter-in-law  of  a  household  shows  defer- 
ence to  a  daughter  of  a  household.  Even  among  young  siblings 
in  a  household,  there  is  constant  acknowledgment  of  age  dif- 
ferences: younger  siblings  never  address  an  older  sibling  by 
name,  but  rather  by  respectful  terms  for  elder  brother  or  elder 
sister.  However,  an  older  sibling  may  address  the  younger  by 
name  (see  Linguistic  Relations,  ch.  4). 

Even  in  a  business  or  academic  setting,  where  colleagues 
may  not  openly  espouse  traditional  observance  of  caste  or  class 
ranking  behavior,  they  may  set  up  Active  kinship  relations, 
addressing  one  another  by  kinship  terms  reflecting  family  or 
village-style  hierarchy.  For  example,  a  younger  colleague  might 
respectfully  address  an  older  colleague  as  chachaji  (respected 
father's  younger  brother),  gracefully  acknowledging  the  supe- 
rior position  of  the  older  colleague. 

Purity  and  Pollution 

Many  status  differences  in  Indian  society  are  expressed  in 
terms  of  ritual  purity  and  pollution.  Notions  of  purity  and  pol- 
lution are  extremely  complex  and  vary  greatly  among  different 
castes,  religious  groups,  and  regions.  However,  broadly  speak- 
ing, high  status  is  associated  with  purity  and  low  status  with  pol- 
lution. Some  kinds  of  purity  are  inherent,  or  inborn;  for 
example,  gold  is  purer  than  copper  by  its  very  nature,  and,  sim- 
ilarly, a  member  of  a  high-ranking  Brahman  (see  Glossary),  or 


235 


India:  A  Country  Study 


priestly  caste  is  born  with  more  inherent  puritv  than  a  member 
of  a  low-ranking-  Sweeper  (Mehtar.  in  Hindi  *  caste.  Unless  the 
Brahman  defiles  himself  in  some  extraordinary  way  through- 
out  his  life  he  will  always  be  purer  than  a  Sweeper.  Other  kinds 
of  puritv  are  more  transitory — a  Brahman  who  has  just  taken  a 
bath  is  more  ritually  pure  than  a  Brahman  who  has  not  bathed 
for  a  dav.  This  situation  could  easily  reverse  itself  temporarily, 
depending:  on  bath  schedules,  participation  in  polluting  activi- 
ties, or  contact  with  temporarily  polluting;  substances. 

Puritv  is  associated  with  ritual  cleanliness — daily  bathing  in 
flowing  water,  dressing  in  properly  laundered  clothes  of 
approved  materials,  eating  onlv  the  foods  appropriate  for  one's 
caste,  refraining  from  physical  contact  with  people  of  lower 
rank,  and  avoiding;  involvement  with  rituallv  impure  sub- 
stances. The  latter  include  body  wastes  and  excretions,  most 
especially  those  of  another  adult  person.  Contact  with  the 
products  of  death  or  violence  are  typically  polluting  and  threat- 
ening to  ritual  puritv 

During:  her  menstrual  period,  a  woman  is  considered  pol- 
luted and  refrains  from  cooking,  worshiping,  or  touching  any- 
one older  than  an  infant.  In  much  of  the  south,  a  woman 
spends  this  time  sitting  outside."  resting  in  an  isolated  room  or 
shed.  During  her  period,  a  Muslim  woman  does  not  touch  the 
Quran.  At  the  end  of  the  period,  purity  is  restored  with  a  com- 
plete bath.  Pollution  also  attaches  to  birth,  both  for  the  mother 
and  the  infant's  close  kin.  and  to  death,  for  close  relatives  of 
the  deceased  <see  The  Ceremonies  of  Hinduism:  Islam,  ch.  3). 

Members  of  the  highest  priestly  castes,  the  Brahmans.  are 
srenerallv  vegetarians  i  although  some  Bengali  and  Maharash- 
trian  Brahmans  eat  fish  I  and  avoid  eating  meat,  the  product  of 
violence  and  death.  High-ranking  Warrior  castes  (fohatriyas), 
however,  typically  consume  nonvegetarian  diets,  considered 
appropriate  for  their  traditions  of  valor  and  physical  strength. 

A  Brahman  born  of  proper  Brahman  parents  retains  his 
inherent  puritv  if  he  bathes  and  dresses  himself  properly, 
adheres  to  a  vegetarian  diet,  eats  meals  prepared  onlv  by  per- 
sons of  appropriate  rank,  and  keeps  his  person  awav  from  the 
bodih"  exuviae  of  others  (except  for  necessary  contact  with  the 
secretions  of  family  infants  and  small  children). 

If  a  Brahman  happens  to  come  into  bodily  contact  with  a 
polluting  substance,  he  can  remove  this  pollution  bv  bathing 
and  changing  his  clothing.  However,  if  he  were  to  eat  meat  or 
commit  other  transgressions  of  the  rigid  dietary  codes  of  his 


Social  Systems 


particular  caste,  he  would  be  considered  more  deeply  polluted 
and  would  have  to  undergo  various  purifying  rites  and  payment 
of  fines  imposed  by  his  caste  council  in  order  to  restore  his 
inherent  purity. 

In  sharp  contrast  to  the  purity  of  a  Brahman,  a  Sweeper  born 
of  Sweeper  parents  is  considered  to  be  born  inherently  pol- 
luted. The  touch  of  his  body  is  polluting  to  those  higher  on  the 
caste  hierarchy  than  he,  and  they  will  shrink  from  his  touch, 
whether  or  not  he  has  bathed  recently  Sweepers  are  associated 
with  the  traditional  occupation  of  cleaning  human  feces  from 
latrines  and  sweeping  public  lanes  of  all  kinds  of  dirt.  Tradi- 
tionally, Sweepers  remove  these  polluting  materials  in  baskets 
carried  atop  the  head  and  dumped  out  in  a  garbage  pile  at  the 
edge  of  the  village  or  neighborhood.  The  involvement  of 
Sweepers  with  such  filth  accords  with  their  low-status  position 
at  the  bottom  of  the  Hindu  caste  hierarchy,  even  as  their  ser- 
vices allow  high-status  people,  such  as  Brahmans,  to  maintain 
their  ritual  purity. 

Members  of  the  Leatherworker  (Chamar)  caste  are  ascribed 
a  very  low  status  consonant  with  their  association  with  the  caste 
occupation  of  skinning  dead  animals  and  tanning  the  leather. 
Butchers  (Khatiks,  in  Hindi),  who  kill  and  cut  up  the  bodies  of 
animals,  also  rank  low  on  the  caste  hierarchy  because  of  their 
association  with  violence  and  death. 

However,  castes  associated  with  ruling  and  warfare — and  the 
killing  and  deaths  of  human  beings — are  typically  accorded 
high  rank  on  the  caste  hierarchy.  In  these  instances,  political 
power  and  wealth  outrank  association  with  violence  as  the  key 
determinant  of  caste  rank. 

Maintenance  of  purity  is  associated  with  the  intake  of  food 
and  drink,  not  only  in  terms  of  the  nature  of  the  food  itself,  but 
also  in  terms  of  who  has  prepared  it  or  touched  it.  This  require- 
ment is  especially  true  for  Hindus,  but  other  religious  groups 
hold  to  these  principles  to  varying  degrees.  Generally,  a  person 
risks  pollution — and  lowering  his  own  status — if  he  accepts  bev- 
erages or  cooked  foods  from  the  hands  of  people  of  lower  caste 
status  than  his  own.  His  status  will  remain  intact  if  he  accepts 
food  or  beverages  from  people  of  higher  caste  rank.  Usually, 
for  an  observant  Hindu  of  any  but  the  very  lowest  castes  to 
accept  cooked  food  from  a  Muslim  or  Christian  is  regarded  as 
highly  polluting. 

In  a  clear  example  of  pollution  associated  with  dining,  a 
Brahman  who  consumed  a  drink  of  water  and  a  meal  of  wheat 


237 


India:  A  Country  Study 


bread  with  boiled  vegetables  from  the  hands  of  a  Sweeper 
would  immediately  become  polluted  and  could  expect  social 
rejection  by  his  caste  fellows.  From  that  moment,  fellow  Brah- 
mans  following  traditional  pollution  rules  would  refuse  food 
touched  by  him  and  would  abstain  from  the  usual  social  inter- 
action with  him.  He  would  not  be  welcome  inside  Brahman 
homes — most  especially  in  the  ritually  pure  kitchens — nor 
would  he  or  his  close  relatives  be  considered  eligible  marriage 
partners  for  other  Brahmans. 

Generally,  the  acceptance  of  water  and  ordinary  foods 
cooked  in  water  from  members  of  lower-ranking  castes  incurs 
the  greatest  pollution.  In  North  India,  such  foods  are  known  as 
kaccha  khana,  as  contrasted  with  fine  foods  cooked  in  butter  or 
oils,  which  are  known  as  pakka  khana.  Fine  foods  can  be 
accepted  from  members  of  a  few  castes  slightly  lower  than  one's 
own.  Local  hierarchies  differ  on  the  specific  details  of  these 
rules. 

Completely  raw  foods,  such  as  uncooked  grains,  fresh 
unpeeled  bananas,  mangoes,  and  uncooked  vegetables  can  be 
accepted  by  anyone  from  anyone  else,  regardless  of  relative  sta- 
tus. Toasted  or  parched  foods,  such  as  roasted  peanuts,  can  also 
be  accepted  from  anyone  without  ritual  or  social  repercussions. 
(Thus,  a  Brahman  may  accept  gifts  of  grain  from  lower-caste 
patrons  for  eventual  preparation  by  members  of  his  own  caste, 
or  he  may  purchase  and  consume  roasted  peanuts  or  tanger- 
ines from  street  vendors  of  unknown  caste  without  worry.) 

Water  served  from  an  earthen  pot  may  be  accepted  only 
from  the  hands  of  someone  of  higher  or  equal  caste  ranking, 
but  water  served  from  a  brass  pot  may  be  accepted  even  from 
someone  slightly  lower  on  the  caste  scale.  Exceptions  to  this 
rule  are  members  of  the  Waterbearer  (Bhoi,  in  Hindi)  caste, 
who  are  employed  to  carry  water  from  wells  to  the  homes  of 
the  prosperous  and  from  whose  hands  members  of  all  castes 
may  drink  water  without  becoming  polluted,  even  though 
Waterbearers  are  not  ranked  high  on  the  caste  scale. 

These  and  a  great  many  other  traditional  rules  pertaining  to 
purity  and  pollution  constantly  impinge  upon  interaction 
between  people  of  different  castes  and  ranks  in  India. 
Although  to  the  non-Indian  these  rules  may  seem  irrational 
and  bizarre,  to  most  of  the  people  of  India  they  are  a  ubiqui- 
tous and  accepted  part  of  life.  Thinking  about  and  following 
purity  and  pollution  rules  make  it  necessary  for  people  to  be 
constantly  aware  of  differences  in  status.  With  every  drink  of 


238

water,  with  every  meal,  and  with  every  contact  with  another 
person,  people  must  ratify  the  social  hierarchy  of  which  they 
are  a  part  and  within  which  their  every  act  is  carried  out.  The 
fact  that  expressions  of  social  status  are  intricately  bound  up 
with  events  that  happen  to  everyone  every  day — eating,  drink- 
ing, bathing,  touching,  talking — and  that  transgressions  of 
these  rules,  whether  deliberate  or  accidental,  are  seen  as  hav- 
ing immediately  polluting  effects  on  the  person  of  the  trans- 
gressor, means  that  every  ordinary  act  of  human  life  serves  as  a 
constant  reminder  of  the  importance  of  hierarchy  in  Indian 
society. 

There  are  many  Indians,  particularly  among  the  educated 
urban  elite,  who  do  not  follow  traditional  purity  and  pollution 
practices.  Dining  in  each  others'  homes  and  in  restaurants  is 
common  among  well-educated  people  of  diverse  backgrounds, 
particularly  when  they  belong  to  the  same  economic  class.  For 
these  people,  guarding  the  family's  earthen  water  pot  from 
inadvertent  touch  by  a  low-ranking  servant  is  not  the  concern  it 
is  for  a  more  traditional  villager.  However,  even  among  those 
people  whose  words  and  actions  denigrate  traditional  purity 
rules,  there  is  often  a  reluctance  to  completely  abolish  con- 
sciousness of  purity  and  pollution  from  their  thinking.  It  is 
surely  rare  for  a  Sweeper,  however  well-educated,  to  invite  a 


239 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Brahman  to  dinner  in  his  home  and  have  his  invitation  unself- 
consciously accepted.  It  is  less  rare,  however,  for  educated 
urban  colleagues  of  vastly  different  caste  and  religious  heritage 
to  enjoy  a  cup  of  tea  together.  Some  high-caste  liberals  pride 
themselves  on  being  free  of  "casteism"  and  seek  to  accept  food 
from  the  hands  of  very  low-caste  people,  or  even  deliberately 
set  out  to  marry  someone  from  a  significantly  lower  caste  or  a 
different  religion.  Thus,  even  as  they  deny  it,  these  progressives 
affirm  the  continuing  significance  of  traditional  rules  of  purity, 
pollution,  and  hierarchy  in  Indian  society. 

Social  Interdependence 

One  of  the  great  themes  pervading  Indian  life  is  social  inter- 
dependence. People  are  born  into  groups — families,  clans,  sub- 
castes,  castes,  and  religious  communities — and  live  with  a 
constant  sense  of  being  part  of  and  inseparable  from  these 
groups.  A  corollary  is  the  notion  that  everything  a  person  does 
properly  involves  interaction  with  other  people.  A  person's 
greatest  dread,  perhaps,  is  the  possibility  of  being  left  alone, 
without  social  support,  to  face  the  necessary  challenges  of  life. 
This  sense  of  interdependence  is  extended  into  the  theological 
realm:  the  very  shape  of  a  person's  life  is  seen  as  being  greatly 
influenced  by  divine  beings  with  whom  an  ongoing  relation- 
ship must  be  maintained. 

Social  interaction  is  regarded  as  being  of  the  highest  prior- 
ity, and  social  bonds  are  expected  to  be  long  lasting.  Even  eco- 
nomic activities  that  might  in  Western  culture  involve 
impersonal  interactions  are  in  India  deeply  imbedded  in  a 
social  nexus.  All  social  interaction  involves  constant  attention 
to  hierarchy,  respect,  honor,  the  feelings  of  others,  rights  and 
obligations,  hospitality,  and  gifts  of  food,  clothing,  and  other 
desirable  items.  Finely  tuned  rules  of  etiquette  help  facilitate 
each  individual's  many  social  relationships.  - 

Western  visitors  to  India  are  sometimes  startled  to  find  that 
important  government  and  business  officials  have  left  their 
posts — often  for  many  days  at  a  time — -to  attend  a  cousin's  wed- 
ding or  participate  in  religious  activities  in  a  distant  part  of  the 
country.  "He  is  out  of  station  and  will  be  back  in  a  week  or  two," 
the  absent  official's  officemates  blandly  explain  to  the  frus- 
trated visitor.  What  is  going  on  is  not  laziness  or  hedonistic  rec- 
reation, but  is  the  official's  proper  recognition  of  his  need  to 
continually  maintain  his  social  ties  with  relatives,  caste  fellows, 
other  associates,  and  God.  Without  being  enmeshed  in  such 


240 


Social  Systems 


ties  throughout  life,  a  person  cannot  hope  to  maintain  long- 
term  efficacy  in  either  economic  or  social  endeavors.  Social 
bonds  with  relatives  must  be  reinforced  at  family  events  or  at 
rites  crucial  to  the  religious  community.  If  this  is  not  done,  peo- 
ple who  could  offer  vital  support  in  many  phases  of  life  would 
be  alienated. 

In  every  activity,  there  is  an  assumption  that  social  ties  can 
help  a  person  and  that  their  absence  can  bring  failure.  Seldom 
do  people  carry  out  even  the  simplest  task  on  their  own.  From 
birth  onward,  a  child  learns  that  his  "fate"  has  been  "written"  by 
divine  forces  and  that  his  life  will  be  shaped  by  a  plan  decided 
by  more  powerful  beings.  When  a  small  child  eats,  his  mother 
puts  the  mouthfuls  of  food  into  his  mouth  with  her  own  hand. 
When  a  boy  climbs  a  tree  to  pluck  mangoes,  another  stands 
below  with  a  basket  to  receive  them.  When  a  girl  fetches  water 
from  the  well  in  pots  on  her  head,  someone  at  her  home  helps 
her  unload  the  pots.  When  a  farmer  stacks  sheaves  of  grain 
onto  his  bullock  cart,  he  stands  atop  the  cart,  catching  the 
sheaves  tossed  up  to  him  by  his  son. 

A  student  applying  to  a  college  hopes  that  he  has  an  influen- 
tial relative  or  family  friend  who  can  put  in  a  good  word  for 
him  with  the  director  of  admissions.  At  the  age  of  marriage,  a 
young  person  expects  that  parents  will  take  care  of  finding  the 
appropriate  bride  or  groom  and  arranging  all  the  formalities. 
At  the  birth  of  a  child,  the  new  mother  is  assured  that  the 
child's  kin  will  help  her  attend  to  the  infant's  needs.  A  business- 
man seeking  to  arrange  a  contract  relies  not  only  on  his  own 
abilities  but  also  on  the  assistance  of  well-connected  friends 
and  relatives  to  help  finalize  the  deal.  And  finally,  when  facing 
death,  a  person  is  confident  that  offspring  and  other  relatives 
will  carry  out  the  appropriate  funeral  rites,  including  a  com- 
memorative feast  when,  through  gifts  of  clothing  and  food, 
continuing  social  ties  are  reaffirmed  by  all  in  attendance. 

Family  and  Kinship 
Family  Ideals 

In  India,  people  learn  the  essential  themes  of  cultural  life 
within  the  bosom  of  a  family.  In  most  of  the  country,  the  basic 
units  of  society  are  the  patrilineal  family  unit  and  wider  kinship 
groupings.  The  most  widely  desired  residential  unit  is  the  joint 
family,  ideally  consisting  of  three  or  four  patrilineally  related 
generations,  all  living  under  one  roof,  working,  eating,  wor- 


241 


Ind  i  a :  A  Co  u  n  try  St  u  dy 


shiping,  and  cooperating  together  in  mutually  beneficial  social 
and  economic  activities.  Patrilineal  joint  families  include  men 
related  through  the  male  line,  along  with  their  wives  and  chil- 
dren. Most  voung  women  expect  to  live  with  their  husband's 
relatives  after  marriage,  but  they  retain  important  bonds  with 
their  natal  families. 

Despite  the  continuous  and  growing  impact  of  urbanization, 
secularization,  and  Westernization,  the  traditional  joint  house- 
hold, both  in  ideal  and  in  practice,  remains  the  primarv  social 
force  in  the  lives  of  most  Indians.  Loyalty  to  family  is  a  deeply 
held  ideal  for  almost  evervone. 

Large  families  tend  to  be  flexible  and  wTell-suited  to  modern 
Indian  life,  especiallv  for  the  67  percent  of  Indians  who  are 
farmers  or  agricultural  workers  or  wTork  in  related  activities  (see 
Size  and  Composition  of  the  Workforce,  ch.  6) .  As  in  most  pri- 
marily agricultural  societies,  few  individuals  can  hope  to 
achieve  economic  securitv  without  being  part  of  a  cooperating 
group  of  kinsmen.  The  joint  familv  is  also  common  in  cities, 
wrhere  kinship  ties  can  be  crucial  to  obtaining  scarce  jobs  or 
financial  assistance.  Numerous  prominent  Indian  families, 
such  as  the  Tatas,  Birlas,  and  Sarabhais,  retain  joint  family 
arrangements  even  as  thev  wx>rk  together  to  control  some  of 
the  countrv's  largest  financial  empires. 

The  joint  familv  is  an  ancient  Indian  institution,  but  it  has 
undergone  some  change  in  the  late  twentieth  centurv. 
Although  several  Generations  livinp:  together  is  the  ideal,  actual 
living  arrangements  varv  widelv  depending  on  region,  social 
status,  and  economic  circumstance.  Many  Indians  live  in  joint 
families  that  deviate  in  various  ways  from  the  ideal,  and  many 
live  in  nuclear  families — a  couple  with  their  unmarried  chil- 
dren— as  is  the  most  common  pattern  in  the  West.  However, 
even  where  the  ideal  joint  familv  is  seldom  found  (as,  for  exam- 
ple, in  certain  regions  and  among  impoverished  agricultural 
laborers  and  urban  squatters),  there  are  often  strong  networks 
of  kinship  ties  through  which  economic  assistance  and  other 
benefits  are  obtained.  Not  infrequently,  clusters  of  relatives  live 
very  near  each  other,  easilv  available  to  respond  to  the  give  and 
take  of  kinship  obligations.  Even  when  relatives  cannot  actuallv 
live  in  close  proximity,  they  tvpicallv  maintain  strong  bonds  of 
kinship  and  attempt  to  provide  each  other  with  economic  help, 
emotional  support,  and  other  benefits. 

As  joint  families  grow  ever  larger,  they  inevitably  divide  into 
smaller  units,  passing  through  a  predictable  cvcle  over  time. 


242 


Social  Systems 


The  breakup  of  a  joint  family  into  smaller  units  does  not  neces- 
sarily represent  the  rejection  of  the  joint  family  ideal.  Rather,  it 
is  usually  a  response  to  a  variety  of  conditions,  including  the 
need  for  some  members  to  move  from  village  to  city,  or  from 
one  city  to  another  to  take  advantage  of  employment  opportu- 
nities. Splitting  of  the  family  is  often  blamed  on  quarrelling 
women — typically,  the  wives  of  coresident  brothers.  Although 
women's  disputes  may,  in  fact,  lead  to  family  division,  men's  dis- 
agreements do  so  as  well.  Despite  cultural  ideals  of  brotherly 
harmony,  adult  brothers  frequently  quarrel  over  land  and 
other  matters,  leading  them  to  decide  to  live  under  separate 
roofs  and  divide  their  property.  Frequently,  a  large  joint  family 
divides  after  the  demise  of  elderly  parents,  when  there  is  no 
longer  a  single  authority  figure  to  hold  the  family  factions 
together.  After  division,  each  new  residential  unit,  in  its  turn, 
usually  becomes  joint  when  sons  of  the  family  marry  and  bring 
their  wives  to  live  in  the  family  home. 

Variations  in  Family  Structure 

Some  family  types  bear  special  mention  because  of  their 
unique  qualities.  In  the  sub-Himalayan  region  of  Uttar 
Pradesh,  polygyny  is  commonly  practiced.  There,  among  Hin- 
dus, a  simple  polygynous  family  is  composed  of  a  man,  his  two 
wives,  and  their  unmarried  children.  Various  other  family  types 
occur  there,  including  the  supplemented  subpolygynous 
household — a  woman  whose  husband  lives  elsewhere  (perhaps 
with  his  other  wife),  her  children,  plus  other  adult  relatives. 
Polygyny  is  also  practiced  in  other  parts  of  India  by  a  tiny 
minority  of  the  population,  especially  in  families  in  which  the 
first  wife  has  not  been  able  to  bear  children. 

Among  the  Buddhist  people  of  the  mountainous  Ladakh 
District  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  who  have  cultural  ties  to  Tibet, 
fraternal  polyandry  is  practiced,  and  a  household  may  include 
a  set  of  brothers  with  their  common  wife  or  wives.  This  family 
type,  in  which  brothers  also  share  land,  is  almost  certainly 
linked  to  the  extreme  scarcity  of  cultivable  land  in  the  Hima- 
layan region,  because  it  discourages  fragmentation  of  holdings. 

The  peoples  of  the  northeastern  hill  areas  are  known  for 
their  matriliny,  tracing  descent  and  inheritance  in  the  female 
line  rather  than  the  male  line.  One  of  the  largest  of  these 
groups,  the  Khasis — an  ethnic  or  tribal  people  in  the  state  of 
Meghalaya — are  divided  into  matrilineal  clans;  the  youngest 
daughter  receives  almost  all  of  the  inheritance  including  the 


243 


India:  A  Country  Study 


house.  A  Khasi  husband  goes  to  live  in  his  wife's  house.  Khasis, 
many  of  whom  have  become  Christian,  have  the  highest  liter- 
acy rate  in  India,  and  Khasi  women  maintain  notable  authority 
in  the  family  and  community. 

Perhaps  the  best  known  of  India's  unusual  family  types  is  the 
traditional  Nayar  taravad,  or  great  house.  The  Nayars  are  a  clus- 
ter of  castes  in  Kerala.  High-ranking  and  prosperous,  the 
Nayars  maintained  matrilineal  households  in  which  sisters  and 
brothers  and  their  children  were  the  permanent  residents. 
After  an  official  prepuberty  marriage,  each  woman  received  a 
series  of  visiting  husbands  in  her  room  in  the  taravad  at  night. 
Her  children  were  all  legitimate  members  of  the  taravad.  Prop- 
erty, matrilineally  inherited,  was  managed  by  the  eldest  brother 
of  the  senior  woman.  This  system,  the  focus  of  much  anthropo- 
logical interest,  has  been  disintegrating  in  the  twentieth  cen- 
tury, and  in  the  1990s  probably  fewer  than  5  percent  of  the 
Nayars  live  in  matrilineal  taravads.  Like  the  Khasis,  Nayar 
women  are  known  for  being  well-educated  and  powerful  within 
the  family. 

Malabar  rite  Christians,  an  ancient  community  in  Kerala, 
adopted  many  practices  of  their  powerful  Nayar  neighbors, 
including  naming  their  sons  for  matrilineal  forebears.  Their 
kinship  system,  however,  is  patrilineal.  Kerala  Christians  have  a 
very  high  literacy  rate,  as  do  most  Indian  Christian  groups  (see 
Christianity,  ch.  3). 

Large  Kinship  Groups 

In  most  of  Hindu  India,  people  belong  not  only  to  coresi- 
dent family  groups  but  to  larger  aggregates  of  kin  as  well.  Sub- 
suming the  family  is  the  patrilineage  (known  in  northern  and 
central  India  as  the  khandan,  kutumb,  or  kul),  a  locally  based  set 
of  males  who  trace  their  ancestry  to  a  common  progenitor  a 
few  generations  back,  plus  their  wives  and  unmarried  daugh- 
ters. Larger  than  the  patrilineage  is  the  clan,  commonly  known 
as  the  gotra  or  got,  a  much  larger  group  of  patrilineally  related 
males  and  their  wives  and  daughters,  who  often  trace  common 
ancestry  to  a  mythological  figure.  In  some  regions,  particularly 
among  the  high-ranking  Rajputs  of  western  India,  clans  are 
hierarchically  ordered.  Some  people  also  claim  membership  in 
larger,  more  amorphous  groupings  known  as  vansh  and  sakha. 

Hindu  lineages  and  clans  are  strictly  exogamous — that  is,  a 
person  may  not  marry  or  have  a  sexual  alliance  with  a  member 
of  his  own  lineage  or  clan;  such  an  arrangement  would  be  con- 


244 


Social  Systems 


sidered  incestuous.  In  North  India,  rules  further  prohibit  mar- 
riage between  a  person  and  his  mother's  lineage  members  as 
well.  Among  some  high-ranking  castes  of  the  north,  exogamy  is 
also  extended  to  the  mother's,  father's  mother's,  and  mother's 
mother's  clans.  In  contrast,  in  South  India,  marriage  to  a  mem- 
ber of  the  mother's  kin  group  is  often  encouraged. 

Muslims  also  recognize  kinship  groupings  larger  than  the 
family.  These  include  the  khandan,  or  patrilineage,  and  the  aziz- 
dar,  or  kindred.  The  azizdar  group  differs  slightly  for  each  indi- 
vidual and  includes  all  relatives  linked  to  a  person  by  blood  or 
marriage.  Muslims  throughout  India  encourage  marriage 
within  the  lineage  and  kindred,  and  marriages  between  the 
children  of  siblings  are  common. 

Within  a  village  or  urban  neighborhood,  members  of  a  lin- 
eage recognize  their  kinship  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Mutual  assis- 
tance in  daily  work,  in  emergencies,  and  in  factional  struggles 
is  expected.  For  Hindus,  cooperation  in  specific  annual  rituals 
helps  define  the  kin  group.  For  example,  in  many  areas,  at  the 
worship  of  the  goddess  deemed  responsible  for  the  welfare  of 
the  lineage,  patrilineally  related  males  and  their  wives  join  in 
the  rites  and  consume  specially  consecrated  fried  breads  or 
other  foods.  Unmarried  daughters  of  the  lineage  are  only  spec- 
tators at  the  rites  and  do  not  share  in  the  special  foods.  Upon 
marriage,  a  woman  becomes  a  member  of  her  husband's  lin- 
eage and  then  participates  regularly  in  the  worship  of  her  hus- 
band's lineage  goddess.  Lineage  bonds  are  also  evident  at  life- 
cycle  observances,  when  kin  join  together  in  celebrating  births, 
marriages,  and  religious  initiations.  Upon  the  death  of  a  lin- 
eage member,  other  lineage  members  observe  ritual  death  pol- 
lution rules  for  a  prescribed  number  of  days  and  carry  out 
appropriate  funeral  rites  and  feasts. 

For  some  castes,  especially  in  the  north,  careful  records  of 
lineage  ties  are  kept  by  a  professional  genealogist,  a  member  of 
a  caste  whose  traditional  task  is  maintaining  genealogical 
tomes.  These  itinerant  bards  make  their  rounds  from  village  to 
village  over  the  course  of  a  year  or  more,  recording  births, 
deaths,  and  glorious  accomplishments  of  the  patrilineal 
descent  group.  These  genealogical  services  have  been  espe- 
cially crucial  among  Rajputs,  Jats,  and  similar  groups  whose  lin- 
eages own  land  and  where  power  can  depend  on  fine 
calculations  of  pedigree  and  inheritance  rights. 

Some  important  kinship  linkages  are  not  traced  through 
men  but  through  women.  These  linkages  involve  those  related 


245 


India:  A  Country  Study 


to  an  individual  by  blood  and  marriage  through  a  mother,  mar- 
ried sisters,  or  married  daughters,  and  for  a  man,  through  his 
wife.  Anthropologist  David  Mandelbaum  has  termed  these 
"feminal  kin."  Key  relationships  are  those  between  a  brother 
and  sister,  parents  and  daughters,  and  a  person  and  his  or  her 
mother's  brother.  Through  bonds  with  these  close  kin,  a  per- 
son has  links  with  several  households  and  lineages  in  many  set- 
tlements. Throughout  most  of  India,  there  are  continuous 
visits — some  of  which  may  last  for  months  and  include  the 
exchange  of  gifts  at  visits,  life-cycle  rites,  and  holidays,  and 
many  other  key  interactions  between  such  relatives.  These  rela- 
tionships are  often  characterized  by  deep  affection  and  will- 
ingly offered  support. 

These  ties  cut  across  the  countryside,  linking  each  person 
with  kin  in  villages  and  towns  near  and  far.  Almost  everywhere 
a  villager  goes — especially  in  the  north,  where  marriage  net- 
works cover  wide  distances — he  can  find  some  kind  of  relative. 
Moral  support,  a  place  to  stay,  economic  assistance,  and  politi- 
cal backing  are  all  available  through  these  kinship  networks. 

The  multitude  of  kinship  ties  is  further  extended  through 
the  device  of  fictive  kinship.  Residents  of  a  single  village  usually 
use  kinship  terms  for  one  another,  and  especially  strong  ties  of 
fictive  kinship  can  be  ceremonially  created  with  fellow  religious 
initiates  or  fellow  pilgrims  of  one's  village  or  neighborhood.  In 
the  villages  and  cities  of  the  north,  on  the  festival  of  Raksha 
Bandhan  (the  Tying  of  the  Protective  Thread,  during  which  sis- 
ters tie  sacred  threads  on  their  brothers'  wrists  to  symbolize  the 
continuing  bond  between  them),  a  female  may  tie  a  thread  on 
the  wrist  of  an  otherwise  unrelated  male  and  "make  him  her 
brother."  Fictive  kinship  bonds  cut  across  caste  and  class  lines 
and  involve  obligations  of  hospitality,  gift-giving,  and  variable 
levels  of  cooperation  and  assistance. 

Neighbors  and  friends  may  also  create  fictive  kinship  ties  by 
informal  agreement.  Actually,  any  strong  friendship  between 
otherwise  unrelated  people  is  typically  imbued  with  kinship- 
like qualities.  In  such  friendships,  kinship  terms  are  adopted 
for  address,  and  the  give  and  take  of  kinship  may  develop.  Such 
bonds  commonly  evolve  between  neighbors  in  urban  apart- 
ment buildings,  between  special  friends  at  school,  and  between 
close  associates  at  work.  The  use  of  kinship  terms  enhances 
affection  in  the  relationship.  In  Gujarat,  personal  names  usu- 
ally include  the  word  for  "sister"  and  "brother,"  so  that  the  use 


246 


Social  Systems 


of  someone's  personal  name  automatically  sounds  affectionate 
and  caring. 

Family  Authority  and  Harmony 

In  the  Indian  household,  lines  of  hierarchy  and  authority 
are  clearly  drawn,  shaping  structurally  and  psychologically 
complex  family  relationships.  Ideals  of  conduct  are  aimed  at 
creating  and  maintaining  family  harmony. 

All  family  members  are  socialized  to  accept  the  authority  of 
those  ranked  above  them  in  the  hierarchy.  In  general,  elders 
rank  above  juniors,  and  among  people  of  similar  age,  males 
outrank  females.  Daughters  of  a  family  command  the  formal 
respect  of  their  brothers'  wives,  and  the  mother  of  a  household 
is  in  charge  of  her  daughters-in-law.  Among  adults  in  a  joint 
family,  a  newly  arrived  daughter-in-law  has  the  least  authority. 
Males  learn  to  command  others  within  the  household  but 
expect  to  accept  the  direction  of  senior  males.  Ideally,  even  a 
mature  adult  man  living  in  his  father's  household  acknowl- 
edges his  father's  authority  on  both  minor  and  major  matters. 
Women  are  especially  strongly  socialized  to  accept  a  position 
subservient  to  males,  to  control  their  sexual  impulses,  and  to 
subordinate  their  personal  preferences  to  the  needs  of  the  fam- 
ily and  kin  group.  Reciprocally,  those  in  authority  accept 
responsibility  for  meeting  the  needs  of  others  in  the  family 
group. 

There  is  tremendous  emphasis  on  the  unity  of  the  family 
grouping,  especially  as  differentiated  from  persons  outside  the 
kinship  circle.  Internally,  efforts  are  made  to  deemphasize  ties 
between  spouses  and  between  parents  and  their  own  children 
in  order  to  enhance  a  wider  sense  of  harmony  within  the  entire 
household.  Husbands  and  wives  are  discouraged  from  openly 
displaying  affection  for  one  another,  and  in  strictly  traditional 
households,  they  may  not  even  properly  speak  to  one  another 
in  the  presence  of  anyone  else,  even  their  own  children.  Young 
parents  are  inhibited  by  "shame"  from  ostentatiously  dandling 
their  own  young  children  but  are  encouraged  to  play  with  the 
children  of  siblings. 

Psychologically,  family  members  feel  an  intense  emotional 
interdependence  with  each  other  and  the  family  as  an  almost 
organic  unit.  Ego  boundaries  are  permeable  to  others  in  the 
family,  and  any  notion  of  a  separate  self  is  often  dominated  by  a 
sense  of  what  psychoanalyst  Alan  Roland  has  termed  a  more 
inclusive  "familial  self."  Interpersonal  empathy,  closeness,  loy- 


247 


India:  A  Country  Study 

alty,  and  interdependency  are  all  crucial  to  life  within  the  fam- 
ily. 

Family  resources,  particularly  land  or  businesses,  have  tradi- 
tionally been  controlled  by  family  males,  especially  in  high-sta- 
tus groups.  Customarily,  according  to  traditional  schools  of 
Hindu  law,  women  did  not  inherit  land  or  buildings  and  were 
thus  beholden  to  their  male  kin  who  controlled  these  vital 
resources.  Under  Muslim  customary  law,  women  are  entitled  to 
inherit  real  estate  and  often  do  so,  but  their  shares  have  typi- 
cally been  smaller  than  those  of  similarly  situated  males.  Under 
modern  law,  all  Indian  women  can  inherit  land. 

Veiling  and  the  Seclusion  of  Women 

A  particularly  interesting  aspect  of  Indian  family  life  is  pur- 
dah (from  the  Hindi  parda,  literally,  curtain),  or  the  veiling  and 
seclusion  of  women.  In  much  of  northern  and  central  India, 
particularly  in  rural  areas,  Hindu  and  Muslim  women  follow 
complex  rules  of  veiling  the  body  and  avoidance  of  public 
appearance,  especially  in  the  presence  of  relatives  linked  by 
marriage  and  before  strange  men.  Purdah  practices  are  inextri- 
cably linked  to  patterns  of  authority  and  harmony  within  the 
family.  Rules  of  Hindu  and  Muslim  purdah  differ  in  certain  key 
ways,  but  female  modesty  and  decorum  as  well  as  concepts  of 
family  honor  are  essential  to  the  various  forms  of  purdah.  In 
most  areas,  purdah  restrictions  are  stronger  for  women  of  high- 
status  families. 

The  importance  of  purdah  is  not  limited  to  family  life; 
rather,  these  practices  all  involve  restrictions  on  female  activity 
and  access  to  power  and  the  control  of  vital  resources  in  a 
male-dominated  society.  Restriction  and  restraint  for  women  in 
virtually  every  aspect  of  life  are  the  basic  essentials  of  purdah. 
In  India,  both  males  and  females  are  circumscribed  in  their 
actions  by  economic  disabilities,  hierarchical  rules  of  defer- 
ence in  kinship  groups,  castes,  and  the  larger  society.  But  for 
women  who  observe  purdah,  there  are  additional  constraints. 

For  almost  all  women,  modest  dress  and  behavior  are  impor- 
tant. Clothing  covering  most  of  the  body  is  common;  only  in 
tribal  groups  and  among  a  few  castes  do  women  publicly  bare 
their  legs  or  upper  bodies.  In  most  of  the  northern  half  of 
India,  traditionally  dressed  women  cover  the  tops  of  their 
heads  with  the  end  of  the  sari  or  scarf  (dupatta).  Generally, 
females  are  expected  to  associate  only  with  kin  or  companions 
approved  by  their  families  and  to  remain  sexually  chaste.

Women  are  not  encouraged  to  roam  about  on  pleasure  jun- 
kets, but  rather  travel  only  for  explicit  family-sanctioned  pur- 
poses. In  North  India,  women  do  relatively  little  shopping; 
most  shopping  is  done  by  men.  In  contrast  to  females,  males 
have  much  more  freedom  of  movement  and  observe  much  less 
body  modesty. 

For  both  males  and  females,  free  association  with  the  oppo- 
site sex  is  limited,  and  dating  in  the  Western  sense  is  essentially 
limited  to  members  of  the  educated  urban  elite.  In  all  areas, 
illicit  liaisons  do  occur.  Although  the  male  may  escape  social 
repudiation  if  such  liaisons  become  known,  the  female  may  suf- 
fer lasting  damage  to  her  own  reputation  and  bring  dishonor 
to  her  family.  Further,  if  a  woman  is  sexually  linked  with  a  man 
of  lower  caste  status,  the  woman  is  regarded  as  being  irremedi- 
ably polluted,  "like  an  earthen  pot."  A  male  so  sullied  can  be 
cleansed  of  his  temporary  pollution,  "like  a  brass  pot,"  with  a 
ritual  bath. 

Such  rules  of  feminine  modesty  are  not  considered  purdah 
but  merely  proper  female  behavior.  For  traditional  Hindus  of 
northern  and  central  India,  purdah  observances  begin  at  mar- 
riage, when  a  woman  acquires  a  husband  and  in-laws.  Although 
she  almost  never  observes  purdah  in  her  natal  home  or  before 
her  natal  relatives,  a  woman  does  observe  purdah  in  her  hus- 
band's home  and  before  his  relatives.  As  a  young  woman,  she 
remains  inside  her  husband's  house  much  of  the  time  (rather 
than  going  out  into  lanes  or  fields),  absents  herself  or  covers 
her  face  with  her  sari  in  the  presence  of  senior  males  and 
females  related  by  marriage,  and,  when  she  does  leave  the 
house  in  her  marital  village,  covers  her  face  with  Jrer  sari. 

Through  use  of  the  end  of  the  sari  as  a  face  veil  and  defer- 
ence of  manner,  a  married  woman  shows  respect  to  her  affinal 
kin  who  are  older  than  or  equal  to  her  husband  in  age,  as  well 
as  certain  other  relatives.  She  may  speak  to  the  women  before 
whom  she  veils,  but  she  usually  does  not  converse  with  the 
men.  Exceptions  to  this  are  her  husband's  younger  brothers, 
before  whom  she  may  veil  her  face,  but  with  whom  she  has  a 
warm  joking  relationship  involving  verbal  banter. 

Initially  almost  faceless  and  voiceless  in  her  marital  home,  a 
married  woman  matures  and  gradually  relaxes  some  of  these 
practices,  especially  as  elder  in-laws  become  senescent  or  die 
and  she  herself  assumes  senior  status.  In  fact,  after  some  years, 
a  wife  may  neglect  to  veil  her  face  in  front  of  her  husband 


249

when  others  are  present  and  may  even  speak  to  her  husband  in 
public. 

Such  practices  help  shield  women  from  unwanted  male 
advances  and  control  women's  sexuality  but  also  express  rela- 
tions within  and  between  groups  of  kin.  Familial  prestige, 
household  harmony,  social  distance,  affinal  respect,  property 
ownership,  and  local  political  power  are  all  linked  to  purdah. 

Restricting  women  to  household  endeavors  rather  than 
involving  them  in  tasks  in  fields  and  markets  is  associated  with 
prestige  and  high  rank  in  northern  India.  There  the  wealthiest 
families  employ  servants  to  carry  water  from  the  well  and  to 
work  in  the  fields  alongside  family  males.  Mature  women  of 
these  families  may  make  rare  appearances  in  the  fields  to  bring 
lunch  to  the  family  males  working  there  and  sometimes  to 
supervise  laborers.  Thus  elitism  is  expressed  in  women's  exclu- 
sive domesticity,  with  men  providing  economic  necessities  for 
the  family. 

Only  women  of  poor  and  low-ranking  groups  engage  in 
heavy  manual  labor  outside  the  home,  especially  for  pay.  Such 
women  work  long  hours  in  the  fields,  on  construction  gangs, 
and  at  many  other  tasks,  often  veiling  their  faces  as  they  work. 

For  Muslim  women,  purdah  practices  involve  less  emphasis 
on  veiling  from  in-laws  and  more  emphasis  on  protecting 
women  from  contact  with  strangers  outside  the  sphere  of  kin- 
ship. Because  Muslims  often  marry  cousins,  a  woman's  in-laws 
may  also  be  her  natal  relatives,  so  veiling  her  face  within  the 
marital  home  is  often  inappropriate.  Unlike  Hindus,  Muslim 
women  do  not  veil  from  other  women  as  do  Hindus.  Tradi- 
tional Muslim  women  and  even  unmarried  girls,  however,  often 
refrain  from  appearing  in  public,  or  if  they  do  go  out,  they 
wear  an  all-covering  garment  known  as  a  burka,  with  a  full  face 
covering.  A  burka  protects  a  woman — and  her  family — from 
undue  familiarity  with  unknown  outsiders,  thus  emphasizing 
the  unity  of  the  family  vis-a-vis  the  outside  world.  Because  Mus- 
lim women  are  entitled  to  a  share  in  the  family  real  estate,  con- 
trolling their  relationships  with  males  outside  the  family  can  be 
crucial  to  the  maintenance  of  family  property  and  prestige. 

In  rural  communities  and  in  older  sections  of  cities,  purdah 
observances  remain  vital,  although  they  are  gradually  diminish- 
ing in  intensity.  Among  the  educated  urban  and  rural  elite, 
purdah  practices  are  rapidly  vanishing  and  for  many  have  all 
but  disappeared.  Chastity  and  female  modesty  are  still  highly 
valued,  but,  for  the  elite,  face-veiling  and  the  burka  are  consid-

ered  unsophisticated.  As  girls  and  women  become  more  widely 
and  more  highly  educated,  female  employment  outside  the 
home  is  commonplace,  even  for  women  of  elite  families. 

Life  Passages 

In  India,  the  ideal  stages  of  life  have  been  most  clearly  articu- 
lated by  Hindus.  The  ancient  Hindu  ideal  rests  on  childhood, 
followed  by  four  stages:  undergoing  religious  initiation  and 
becoming  a  celibate  student  of  religious  texts,  getting  married 
and  becoming  a  householder,  leaving  home  to  become  a  forest 
hermit  after  becoming  a  grandparent,  and  becoming  a  home- 
less wanderer  free  of  desire  for  all  material  things.  Although 
few  actually  follow  this  scheme,  it  serves  as  a  guide  for  those 
attempting  to  live  according  to  valued  standards.  For  Hindus, 


251 


India:  A  Country  Study 

dharma  (a  divinely  ordained  code  of  proper  conduct),  karma 
(the  sum  of  one's  deeds  in  this  life  and  in  past  lives),  and  kismat 
(fate)  are  considered  relevant  to  the  course  of  life  (see  The 
Roots  of  Indian  Religion,  ch.  3).  Crucial  transitions  from  one 
phase  of  life  to  another  are  marked  by  sometimes  elaborate 
rites  of  passage. 

Children  and  Childhood 

Throughout  much  of  India,  a  baby's  birth  is  celebrated  with 
rites  of  welcome  and  blessing — songs,  drums,  happy  distribu- 
tion of  sweets,  auspicious  unguents,  gifts  for  infant  and  mother, 
preparation  of  horoscopes,  and  inscriptions  in  the  genealo- 
gist's record  books.  In  general,  children  are  deeply  desired  and 
welcomed,  their  presence  regarded  as  a  blessing  on  the  house- 
hold. Babies  are  often  treated  like  small  deities,  pampered  and 
coddled,  adorned  with  makeup  and  trinkets,  and  carried  about 
and  fed  with  the  finest  foods  available  to  the  family.  Young  girls 
are  worshiped  as  personifications  of  Hindu  goddesses,  and  lit- 
tle boys  are  adulated  as  scions  of  the  clan. 

In  their  children,  parents  see  the  future  of  the  lineage  and 
wider  kin  group,  helpers  in  daily  tasks,  and  providers  of  secu- 
rity in  the  parents'  old  age.  These  delightful  ideals  are  articu- 
lated and  enacted  over  and  over  again;  yet,  a  coexisting  harsher 
reality  emerges  from  a  close  examination  of  events  and  statis- 
tics. Many  children  lead  lives  of  striking  hardship,  and  many 
die  premature  deaths.  In  general,  conditions  are  significantly 
worse  for  girls  than  for  boys. 

Birth  celebrations  for  baby  daughters  are  more  muted  than 
for  sons  and  are  sometimes  absent  altogether.  Although  India 
was  once  led  by  a  woman  prime  minister,  Indira  Gandhi,  and 
Indian  women  currently  hold  a  wide  range  of  powerful  posi- 
tions in  every  walk  of  life,  there  is  a  strong  cultural  bias  toward 
males.  Girls  are  frequently  victims  of  underfeeding,  medical 
neglect,  sex-selective  abortion,  and  outright  infanticide. 
According  to  the  1991  census  final  population  totals,  there 
were  927  females  per  1,000  males  in  India — a  figure  that  has 
gradually  declined  from  972  females  per  1,000  males  in  1901 
and  from  934  just  since  1981.  Much  of  this  imbalance  is 
attained  through  neglecting  the  nutritional  and  health  needs 
of  female  children,  and  much  is  also  the  result  of  inadequate 
health  care  for  women  of  childbearing  years.  The  sex  ratio  is 
even  more  imbalanced  in  urban  areas  (894  per  1,000  in  1991) 
than  in  rural  areas  (938  per  1,000  in  1991),  partially  because  a 


252 


Social  Systems 


large  number  of  village  men  go  to  work  in  cities,  leaving  their 
wives  and  children  behind  in  their  rural  homes  (see  Structure 
and  Dynamics,  ch.  2). 

That  girls  are  victims  of  fatal  neglect  and  murder  has  been 
thoroughly  discussed  in  the  Indian  press  and  in  scholarly  inves- 
tigations. It  has  been  noted  that  infant  girls  are  killed  with 
potions  of  opium  in  Rajasthan  and  pastes  of  poisonous  olean- 
der in  Tamil  Nadu — most  especially  girls  preceded  by  the  birth 
of  several  sisters.  Clinics  offering  ultrasound  and  amniocentesis 
in  order  to  detect  and  abort  female  fetuses  have  become  popu- 
lar in  various  parts  of  the  country,  and  many  thousands  of 
female  fetuses  have  been  so  destroyed.  In  Maharashtra,  Rajast- 
han, and  Punjab  such  selective  abortions  have  been  outlawed 
•because  of  pressure  from  feminist  groups.  More  usually,  girls 
are  simply  fed  and  cared  for  less  well  than  their  brothers. 

The  sex  ratio  is  particularly  unfavorable  to  females  in  the 
central  northern  section  of  the  country.  For  example,  in  Uttar 
Pradesh  there  are  only  eighty-eight  females  per  100  males;  in 
Haryana,  eighty-seven  per  100;  and  in  Rajasthan  ninety-one  per 
100.  By  contrast,  in  Kerala,  on  the  southwest  coast,  a  region  tra- 
ditionally noted  for  matriliny,  the  sex  ratio  is  reversed,  with 
females  outnumbering  males  104  to  100.  In  Andhra  Pradesh 
and  Tamil  Nadu,  two  large  southern  states,  there  are  ninety- 
seven  females  per  100  males. 

Parents  favor  boys  for  various  reasons.  In  the  north,  a  boy's 
value  in  agricultural  endeavors  is  higher  than  a  girl's,  and  after 
marriage  a  boy  continues  to  live  with  his  parents,  ideally  sup- 
porting them  in  their  old  age.  Political  scientist  Philip  Olden- 
burg notes  that  in  some  violence-prone  regions  of  the  north, 
having  sons  may  enhance  families'  capacity  to  defend  them- 
selves and  to  exercise  power.  A  girl,  however,  moves  away  to  live 
with  her  husband's  relatives,  and  with  her  goes  a  dowry.  In  the 
late  twentieth  century,  the  values  of  dowries  have  been  increas- 
ing, and,  furthermore,  groups  that  never  gave  dowries  in  the 
past  are  being  pressured  to  do  so.  Thus,  a  girl  child  can  repre- 
sent a  significant  economic  liability  to  her  parents.  In  rice- 
growing  areas,  especially  in  the  south,  girls  receive  better  treat- 
ment, and  there  is  some  evidence  that  the  better  treatment  is 
related  to  the  value  of  women  as  field  workers  in  wet-rice  culti- 
vation. Throughout  most  of  India,  for  Hindus  it  is  important  to 
have  a  son  conduct  funeral  rites  for  his  parents;  a  daughter,  as  a 
member  of  her  husband's  lineage,  has  not  traditionally  been 
able  to  do  so.

India:  A  Country  Study 

For  both  boys  and  girls,  infant  mortality  rates  tend  to  be 
high,  and  in  the  absence  of  confidence  that  their  infants  will 
live,  parents  tend  to  produce  numerous  offspring  in  the  hope 
that  at  least  two  sons  will  survive  to  adulthood.  Family  planning 
measures  are  used  to  a  modest  degree  in  India;  perhaps  37.5 
percent  of  couples  use  contraceptives  at  least  occasionally  (see 
Population  and  Family  Planning  Policy,  ch.  2).  Abortion  is 
legal,  condoms  are  advertised  on  colorful  billboards,  and  gov- 
ernment health  services  offer  small  bounties  for  patients 
undergoing  vasectomies  and  tubal  ligations.  In  some  regions, 
most  notably  Kerala,  better  health  care  and  higher  infant  sur- 
vival rates  are  associated  with  lowered  fertility  rates  (see  Health 
Conditions,  ch.  2). 

Most  children  survive  infancy  and  do  not  fall  victim  to  the 
cultural  and  economic  pressures  alluded  to  above.  The  major- 
itv  of  children  grow  up  as  valued  members  of  a  family,  trea- 
sured by  their  parents  and  encouraged  to  participate  in 
appropriate  activities.  Although  relative  ages  of  children  are 
alwavs  known  and  reflected  in  linguistic  and  deference  behav- 
ior, there  is  little  asre-STadine:  in  dailv  life.  Children  of  all  asres 
associate  with  each  other  and  with  adults,  unlike  the  situation 
in  the  West,  where  age-grading  is  common. 

Studies  of  Indian  psychology  by  Sudhir  Kakar,  Alan  Roland, 
and  others  stress  that  the  young  Indian  child  grows  up  in  inti- 
mate emotional  contact  with  the  mother  and  other  mothering 
persons.  Because  conjugal  marital  relationships  are  deempha- 
sized  in  the  joint  household,  a  woman  looks  to  her  children  to 
satisfy  some  of  her  intimacy  needs.  Her  bond  to  her  children, 
especially  her  sons  but  also  her  daughters,  becomes  enor- 
mously strong  and  lasting:.  A  child  is  suckled  on  demand,  some- 
times  for  years,  sleeps  with  a  parent  or  grandparent,  is  bathed 
by  doting  relatives,  and  is  rarely  left  alone.  Massaged  with  oil, 
carried  about,  gently  toilet-trained,  and  gratified  with  treats, 
the  young  child  develops  an  inner  core  of  well-being  and  a  pro- 
found sense  of  expectation  of  protection  from  others.  Such 
indulgent  and  close  relationships  produce  a  symbiotic  mode  of 
relating  to  others  and  effect  the  development  of  a  person  with 
a  deeply  held  sense  of  involvement  with  relatives,  so  vital  to  the 
Indian  family  situation. 

The  young  child  learns  early  about  hierarchy  within  the  fam- 
ily, as  he  watches  affectionate  and  respectful  relationships 
between  seniors  and  juniors,  males  and  females.  A  young  child 
is  often  carried  about  bv  an  older  sibling,  and  strong  and  close 


254 


Social  Systems 


sibling  bonds  usually  develop.  Bickering  among  siblings  is  not 
as  common  as  it  is  in  the  West;  rather,  most  siblings  learn  to 
think  of  themselves  as  part  of  a  family  unit  that  must  work 
together  as  it  meets  the  challenges  of  the  outside  world. 

Young  children  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  numer- 
ous rituals  that  emphasize  family  ties.  The  power  of  sibling  rela- 
tionships is  recognized,  for  example,  when  a  brother  touches 
his  sister's  feet,  honoring  in  her  the  principle  of  feminine  divin- 
ity, which,  if  treated  appropriately,  can  bring  him  prosperity.  In 
calendrical  and  life-cycle  rituals  in  both  the  north  and  the 
south,  sisters  bless  their  brothers  and  also  symbolically  request 
their  protection  throughout  life. 

After  about  four  or  five  years  of  indulgence,  children  typi- 
cally experience  greater  demands  from  family  members.  In  vil- 
lages, children  learn  the  rudiments  of  agricultural  labor,  and 
young  children  often  help  with  weeding,  harvesting,  threshing, 
and  the  like.  Girls  learn  domestic  chores,  and  boys  are  encour- 
aged to  take  cattle  for  grazing,  learn  plowing,  and  begin  to 
drive  bullock  carts  and  ride  bicycles.  City  children  also  learn 
household  duties,  and  children  of  poor  families  often  work  as 
servants  in  the  homes  of  the  prosperous.  Some  even  pick 
through  garbage  piles  to  find  shreds  of  food  and  fuel. 

In  some  areas,  children  work  as  exploited  laborers  in  facto- 
ries, where  they  weave  carpets  for  the  export  market  and  make 
matches,  glass  bangles,  and  other  products.  At  Sivakasi,  in 
Tamil  Nadu,  some  45,000  children  work  in  the  match,  fire- 
works, and  printing  industries,  comprising  perhaps  the  largest 
single  concentration  of  child  labor  in  the  world.  Children 
reportedly  as  young  as  four  years  old  work  long  hours  each  day. 

Education  in  a  school  setting  is  available  for  most  of  India's 
children,  and  many  young  people  attend  school  (see  Primary 
and  Secondary  Education,  ch.  2).  Officials  state  that  education 
is  "compulsory,"  but  the  reality  is  that  a  significant  percentage 
of  children — especially  girls — fail  to  become  literate  and 
instead  carry  out  many  other  tasks  in  order  to  contribute  to 
family  income.  More  than  half  of  India's  children  between  the 
ages  of  six  and  fourteen — 82.2  million — are  not  in  school. 
Instead  they  participate  in  the  labor  force,  even  as  more  privi- 
leged children  study  at  government  and  private  schools  and 
prepare  for  more  prestigious  jobs.  Thus  children  learn  early 
the  realities  of  socioeconomic  and  urban-rural  differentiation 
and  grow  up  to  perpetuate  India's  hierarchical  society.

For  many  children,  especially  boys,  an  important  event  of 
young  adolescence  is  religious  initiation.  Initiation  rituals  vary 
among  different  regions,  religious  communities,  and  castes 
(see  Life-Cycle  Rituals,  ch.  3).  In  the  north,  girls  reach  puberty 
without  public  notice  and  in  an  atmosphere  of  shyness, 
whereas  in  much  of  the  south,  puberty  celebrations  joyously 
announce  to  the  family  and  community  that  a  young  girl  has 
grown  to  maturity 

Marriage 

In  India  there  is  no  greater  event  in  a  family  than  a  wedding, 
dramatically  evoking  every  possible  social  obligation,  kinship 
bond,  traditional  value,  impassioned  sentiment,  and  economic 
resource.  In  the  arranging  and  conducting  of  weddings,  the 
complex  permutations  of  Indian  social  systems  best  display 
themselves. 

Marriage  is  deemed  essential  for  virtually  everyone  in  India. 
For  the  individual,  marriage  is  the  great  watershed  in  life, 
marking  the  transition  to  adulthood.  Generally,  this  transition, 
like  everything  else  in  India,  depends  little  upon  individual 
volition  but  instead  occurs  as  a  result  of  the  efforts  of  many 
people.  Even  as  one  is  born  into  a  particular  family  without  the 
exercise  of  any  personal  choice,  so  is  one  given  a  spouse  with- 
out any  personal  preference  involved.  Arranging  a  marriage  is 
a  critical  responsibility  for  parents  and  other  relatives  of  both 
bride  and  groom.  Marriage  alliances  entail  some  redistribution 
of  wealth  as  well  as  building  and  restructuring  social  realign- 
ments, and,  of  course,  result  in  the  biological  reproduction  of 
families. 

Some  parents  begin  marriage  arrangements  on  the  birth  of 
a  child,  but  most  wait  until  later.  In  the  past,  the  age  of  mar- 
riage was  quite  young,  and  in  a  few  small  groups,  especially  in 
Rajasthan,  children  under  the  age  of  five  are  still  united  in  mar- 
riage. In  rural  communities,  prepuberty  marriage  for  girls  tra- 
ditionally was  the  rule.  In  the  late  twentieth  century,  the  age  of 
marriage  is  rising  in  villages,  almost  to  the  levels  that  obtain  in 
cities.  Legislation  mandating  minimum  marriage  ages  has  been 
passed  in  various  forms  over  the  past  decades,  but  such  laws 
have  little  effect  on  actual  marriage  practices. 

Essentially,  India  is  divided  into  two  large  regions  with 
regard  to  Hindu  kinship  and  marriage  practices,  the  north  and 
the  south.  Additionally,  various  ethnic  and  tribal  groups  of  the 
central,  mountainous  north,  and  eastern  regions  follow  a  vari- 


256 


Social  Systems 


ety  of  other  practices.  These  variations  have  been  extensively 
described  and  analyzed  by  anthropologists,  especially  Irawati 
Karve,  David  G.  Mandelbaum,  and  Clarence  Maloney. 

Broadly,  in  the  Indo-Aryan-speaking  north,  a  family  seeks 
marriage  alliances  with  people  to  whom  it  is  not  already  linked 
by  ties  of  blood.  Marriage  arrangements  often  involve  looking 
far  afield.  In  the  Dravidian-speaking  south,  a  family  seeks  to 
strengthen  existing  kin  ties  through  marriage,  preferably  with 
blood  relatives.  Kinship  terminology  reflects  this  basic  pattern. 
In  the  north,  every  kinship  term  clearly  indicates  whether  the 
person  referred  to  is  a  blood  relation  or  an  affinal  relation;  all 
blood  relatives  are  forbidden  as  marriage  mates  to  a  person  or 
a  person's  children.  In  the  south,  there  is  no  clear-cut  distinc- 
tion between  the  family  of  birth  and  the  family  of  marriage. 
Because  marriage  in  the  south  commonly  involves  a  continuing 
exchange  of  daughters  among  a  few  families,  for  the  married 
couple  all  relatives  are  ultimately  blood  kin.  Dravidian  termi- 
nology stresses  the  principle  of  relative  age:  all  relatives  are 
arranged  according  to  whether  they  are  older  or  younger  than 
each  other  without  reference  to  generation. 

On  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain,  marriages  are  contracted  out- 
side the  village,  sometimes  even  outside  of  large  groups  of  vil- 
lages, with  members  of  the  same  caste  beyond  any  traceable 
consanguineal  ties.  In  much  of  the  area,  daughters  should  not 
be  given  into  villages  where  daughters  of  the  family  or  even  of 
the  natal  village  have  previously  been  given.  In  most  of  the 
region,  brother-sister  exchange  marriages  (marriages  linking  a 
brother  and  sister  of  one  household  with  the  sister  and  brother 
of  another)  are  shunned.  The  entire  emphasis  is  on  casting  the 
marriage  net  ever-wider,  creating  new  alliances.  The  residents 
of  a  single  village  may  have  in-laws  in  hundreds  of  other  vil- 
lages. 

In  most  of  North  India,  the  Hindu  bride  goes  to  live  with 
strangers  in  a  home  she  has  never  visited.  There  she  is  seques- 
tered and  veiled,  an  outsider  who  must  learn  to  conform  to 
new  ways.  Her  natal  family  is  often  geographically  distant,  and 
her  ties  with  her  consanguineal  kin  undergo  attenuation  to 
varying  degrees. 

In  central  India,  the  basic  North  Indian  pattern  prevails, 
with  some  modifications.  For  example,  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  vil- 
lage exogamy  is  preferred,  but  marriages  within  a  village  are 
not  uncommon.  Marriages  between  caste-fellows  in  neighbor- 
ing villages  are  frequent.  Brother-sister  exchange  marriages  are 


257

sometimes  arranged,  and  daughters  are  often  given  in  mar- 
riage to  lineages  where  other  daughters  of  their  lineage  or  vil- 
lage have  previously  been  wed. 

In  South  India,  in  sharp  contrast,  marriages  are  preferred 
between  cousins  (especially  cross-cousins,  that  is,  the  children 
of  a  brother  and  sister)  and  even  between  uncles  and  nieces 
(especially  a  man  and  his  elder  sister's  daughter).  The  princi- 
ple involved  is  that  of  return — the  family  that  gives  a  daughter 
expects  one  in  return,  if  not  now,  then  in  the  next  generation. 
The  effect  of  such  marriages  is  to  bind  people  together  in  rela- 
tively small,  tight-knit  kin  groups.  A  bride  moves  to  her  in-laws' 
home — the  home  of  her  grandmother  or  aunt — and  is  often 
comfortable  among  these  familiar  faces.  Her  husband  may  well 
be  the  cousin  she  has  known  all  her  life  that  she  would  marry. 

Many  South  Indian  marriages  are  contracted  outside  of  such 
close  kin  groups  when  no  suitable  mates  exist  among  close  rela- 
tives, or  when  other  options  appear  more  advantageous.  Some 
sophisticated  South  Indians,  for  example,  consider  cousin  mar- 
riage and  uncle-niece  marriage  outmoded. 

Rules  for  the  remarriage  of  widows  differ  from  one  group  to 
another.  Generally,  lower-ranking  groups  allow  widow  remar- 
riage, particularly  if  the  woman  is  relatively  young,  but  the 
highest-ranking  castes  discourage  or  forbid  such  remarriage. 
The  most  strict  adherents  to  the  nonremarriage  of  widows  are 
Brahmans.  Almost  all  groups  allow  widowers  to  remarry.  Many 
groups  encourage  a  widower  to  marry  his  deceased  wife's 
younger  sister  (but  never  her  older  sister). 

Among  Muslims  of  both  the  north  and  the  south,  marriage 
between  cousins  is  encouraged,  both  cross-cousins  (the  chil- 
dren of  a  brother  and  sister)  and  parallel  cousins  (the  children 
of  two  same-sex  siblings).  In  the  north,  such  cousins  grow  up 
calling  each  other  "brother"  and  "sister",  yet  they  may  marry. 
Even  when  cousin  marriage  does  not  occur,  spouses  can  often 
trace  between  them  other  kinship  linkages. 

Some  tribal  people  of  central  India  practice  an  interesting 
permutation  of  the  southern  pattern.  Among  the  Murias  of 
Bastar  in  southeastern  Madhya  Pradesh,  as  described  by 
anthropologist  Verrier  Elwin,  teenagers  live  together  in  a  dor- 
mitory (ghotul),  sharing  life  and  love  with  one  another  for  sev- 
eral blissful  years.  Ultimately,  their  parents  arrange  their 
marriages,  usually  with  cross-cousins,  and  the  delights  of  teen- 
age romance  are  replaced  with  the  serious  responsibilities  of 
adulthood.  In  his  survey  of  some  2,000  marriages,  Elwin  found 


258

only  seventy-seven  cases  of  ghotul  partners  eloping  together 
and  very  few  cases  of  divorce.  Among  the  Muria  and  Gond 
tribal  groups,  cross-cousin  marriage  is  called  "bringing  back 
the  milk,"  alluding  to  the  gift  of  a  girl  in  one  generation  being 
returned  by  the  gift  of  a  girl  in  the  next. 

Finding  the  perfect  partner  for  one's  child  can  be  a  chal- 
lenging task.  People  use  their  social  networks  to  locate  poten- 
tial brides  and  grooms  of  appropriate  social  and  economic 
status.  Increasingly,  urban  dwellers  use  classified  matrimonial 
advertisements  in  newspapers.  The  advertisements  usually 
announce  religion,  caste,  and  educational  qualifications,  stress 
female  beauty  and  male  (and  in  the  contemporary  era,  some- 
times female)  earning  capacity,  and  may  hint  at  dowry  size. 

In  rural  areas,  matches  between  strangers  are  usually 
arranged  without  the  couple  meeting  each  other.  Rather,  par- 
ents and  other  relatives  come  to  an  agreement  on  behalf  of  the 
couple.  In  cities,  however,  especially  among  the  educated 
classes,  photographs  are  exchanged,  and  sometimes  the  couple 
are  allowed  to  meet  under  heavily  chaperoned  circumstances, 
such  as  going  out  for  tea  with  a  group  of  people  or  meeting  in 
the  parlor  of  the  girl's  home,  with  her  relatives  standing  by. 
Young  professional  men  and  their  families  may  receive  inquir- 
ies and  photographs  from  representatives  of  several  girls'  fami- 
lies. They  may  send  their  relatives  to  meet  the  most  promising

candidates  and  then  go  on  tour  themselves  to  meet  the  young 
women  and  make  a  final  choice.  In  the  early  1990s,  increasing 
numbers  of  marriages  arranged  in  this  way  link  brides  and 
grooms  from  India  with  spouses  of  Indian  parentage  resident 
in  Europe,  North  America,  and  the  Middle  East. 

Almost  all  Indian  children  are  raised  with  the  expectation 
that  their  parents  will  arrange  their  marriages,  but  an  increas- 
ing number  of  young  people,  especially  among  the  college- 
educated,  are  finding  their  own  spouses.  So-called  love  mar- 
riages are  deemed  a  slightly  scandalous  alternative  to  properly 
arranged  marriages.  Some  young  people  convince  their  par- 
ents to  "arrange"  their  marriages  to  people  with  whom  they 
have  fallen  in  love.  This  process  has  long  been  possible  for 
Indians  from  the  south  and  for  Muslims  who  want  to  marry  a 
particular  cousin  of  the  appropriate  marriageable  category.  In 
the  upper  classes,  these  semi-arranged  love  marriages  increas- 
ingly occur  between  young  people  who  are  from  castes  of 
slightly  different  rank  but  who  are  educationally  or  profession- 
ally equal.  If  there  are  vast  differences  to  overcome,  such  as  is 
the  case  with  love  marriages  between  Hindus  and  Muslims  or 
between  Hindus  of  very  different  caste  status,  parents  are  usu- 
ally much  less  agreeable,  and  serious  family  disruptions  can 
result. 

In  much  of  India,  especially  in  the  north,  a  marriage  estab- 
lishes a  structural  opposition  between  the  kin  groups  of  the 
bride  and  groom — bride-givers  and  bride-takers.  Within  this 
relationship,  bride-givers  are  considered  inferior  to  bride-tak- 
ers and  are  forever  expected  to  give  gifts  to  the  bride-takers. 
The  one-way  flow  of  gifts  begins  at  engagement  and  continues 
for  a  generation  or  two.  The  most  dramatic  aspect  of  this  asym- 
metrical relationship  is  the  giving  of  dowry. 

In  many  communities  throughout  India,  a  dowry  has  tradi- 
tionally been  given  by  a  bride's  kin  at  the  time  of  her  marriage. 
In  ancient  times,  the  dowry  was  considered  a  woman's  wealth — 
property  due  a  beloved  daughter  who  had  no  claim  on  her 
natal  family's  real  estate — and  typically  included  portable  valu- 
ables such  as  jewelry  and  household  goods  that  a  bride  could 
control  throughout  her  life.  However,  over  time,  the  larger  pro- 
portion of  the  dowry  has  come  to  consist  of  goods  and  cash 
payments  that  go  straight  into  the  hands  of  the  groom's  family. 
In  the  late  twentieth  century,  throughout  much  of  India,  dowry 
payments  have  escalated,  and  a  groom's  parents  sometimes 
insist  on  compensation  for  their  son's  higher  education  and 


260 


Social  Systems 


even  for  his  future  earnings,  to  which  the  bride  will  presumably 
have  access.  Some  of  the  dowries  demanded  are  quite  oppres- 
sive, amounting  to  several  years'  salary  in  cash  as  well  as  items 
such  as  motorcycles,  air  conditioners,  and  fancy  cars.  Among 
some  lower-status  groups,  large  dowries  are  currently  replacing 
traditional  bride-price  payments.  Even  among  Muslims,  previ- 
ously not  given  to  demanding  large  dowries,  reports  of  exorbi- 
tant dowries  are  increasing. 

The  dowry  is  becoming  an  increasingly  onerous  burden  for 
the  bride's  family.  Antidowry  laws  exist  but  are  largely  ignored, 
and  a  bride's  treatment  in  her  marital  home  is  often  affected  by 
the  value  of  her  dowry.  Increasingly  frequent  are  horrible  inci- 
dents, particularly  in  urban  areas,  where  a  groom's  family 
makes  excessive  demands  on  the  bride's  family — even  after 
marriage — and  when  the  demands  are  not  met,  murder  the 
bride,  typically  by  setting  her  clothes  on  fire  in  a  cooking  "acci- 
dent." The  groom  is  then  free  to  remarry  and  collect  another 
sumptuous  dowry.  The  male  and  female  in-laws  implicated  in 
these  murders  have  seldom  been  punished. 

Such  dowry  deaths  have  been  the  subject  of  numerous 
media  reports  in  India  and  other  countries  and  have  mobilized 
feminist  groups  to  action.  In  some  of  the  worst  areas,  such  as 
the  National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi,  where  hundreds  of 
such  deaths  are  reported  annually  and  the  numbers  are 
increasing  yearly,  the  law  now  requires  that  all  suspicious 
deaths  of  new  brides  be  investigated.  Official  government  fig- 
ures report  1,786  registered  dowry  deaths  nationwide  in  1987; 
there  is  also  an  estimate  of  some  5,000  dowry  deaths  in  1991. 
Women's  groups  sometimes  picket  the  homes  of  the  in-laws  of 
burned  brides.  Some  analysts  have  related  the  growth  of  this 
phenomenon  to  the  growth  of  consumerism  in  Indian  society. 

Fears  of  impoverishing  their  parents  have  led  some  urban 
middle-class  young  women,  married  and  unmarried,  to  commit 
suicide.  However,  through  the  giving  of  large  dowries,  the 
newly  wealthy  are  often  able  to  marry  their  treasured  daughters 
up  the  status  hierarchy  so  reified  in  Indian  society. 

After  marriage  arrangements  are  completed,  a  rich  panoply 
of  wedding  rituals  begins.  Each  religious  group,  region,  and 
caste  has  a  slightly  different  set  of  rites.  Generally,  all  weddings 
involve  as  many  kin  and  associates  of  the  bride  and  groom  as 
possible.  The  bride's  family  usually  hosts  most  of  the  ceremo- 
nies and  pays  for  all  the  arrangements  for  large  numbers  of 
guests  for  several  days,  including  accommodation,  feasting, 


261 


India:  A  Country  Study 

decorations,  and  gifts  for  the  groom's  party.  These  arrange- 
ments are  often  extremely  elaborate  and  expensive  and  are 
intended  to  enhance  the  status  of  the  bride's  family.  The 
groom's  party  usually  hires  a  band  and  brings  fine  gifts  for  the 
bride,  such  as  jewelry  and  clothing,  but  these  are  typically  far 
outweighed  in  value  by  the  presents  received  from  the  bride's 
side. 

After  the  bride  and  groom  are  united  in  sacred  rites 
attended  by  colorful  ceremony,  the  new  bride  may  be  carried 
away  to  her  in-laws'  home,  or,  if  she  is  very  young,  she  may 
remain  with  her  parents  until  they  deem  her  old  enough  to 
depart.  A  prepubescent  bride  usually  stays  in  her  natal  home 
until  puberty,  after  which  a  separate  consummation  ceremony 
is  held  to  mark  her  departure  for  her  conjugal  home  and  mar- 
ried life.  The  poignancy  of  the  bride's  weeping  departure  for 
her  new  home  is  prominent  in  personal  memory,  folklore,  lit- 
erature, song,  and  drama  throughout  India. 

Adulthood 

In  their  new  status,  a  young  married  couple  begin  to  accept 
adult  responsibilities.  These  include  work  inside  and  outside  of 
the  home,  childbearing  and  childrearing,  developing  and 
maintaining  social  relationships,  fulfilling  religious  obligations, 
and  enhancing  family  prosperity  and  prestige  as  much  as  possi- 
ble. 

The  young  husband  usually  remains  resident  with  his  natal 
family,  surrounded  by  well-known  relatives  and  neighbors.  The 
young  bride,  however,  is  typically  thrust  into  a  strange  house- 
hold, where  she  is  expected  to  follow  ideal  patterns  of  chaste 
and  cheerfully  obedient  behavior. 

Ideally,  the  Hindu  wife  should  honor  her  husband  as  if  he 
were  her  personal  god.  Through  her  marriage,  a  woman 
becomes  an  auspicious  wife  (suhagan),  adorned  with  bangles 
and  amulets  designed  to  protect  her  husband's  life  and  imbued 
with  ritual  powers  to  influence  prosperity  and  procreation.  At 
her  wedding,  the  Hindu  bride  is  likened  to  Lakshmi,  the  God- 
dess of  Wealth,  in  symbolic  recognition  of  the  fact  that  the 
groom's  patrilineage  can  increase  and  prosper  only  through 
her  fertility  and  labors.  Despite  this  simile,  elegantly  stated  in 
the  nuptial  ritual,  the  young  wife  is  pressed  into  service  as  the 
most  subordinate  member  of  her  husband's  family.  If  any  mis- 
fortunes happen  to  befall  her  affinal  family  after  her  arrival, 
she  may  be  blamed  as  the  bearer  of  bad  luck.  Not  surprisingly, 


262 


Social  Systems 


some  young  women  find  adjusting  to  these  new  circumstances 
extremely  upsetting.  A  small  percentage  experience  psycholog- 
ical distress  so  severe  that  they  seem  to  be  possessed  by  outspo- 
ken ghosts  and  spirits. 

In  these  difficult  early  days  of  a  marriage,  and  later  on 
throughout  her  life,  a  woman  looks  to  her  natal  kin  for  moral 
and  often  economic  support.  Although  she  has  become  part  of 
another  household  and  lineage,  she  depends  on  her  natal  rela- 
tives— especially  her  brothers — to  back  her  up  in  a  variety  of 
circumstances.  A  wide  range  of  long  visits  home,  ritual  obliga- 
tions, gifts,  folklore,  and  songs  reflect  the  significance  of  a 
woman's  lifelong  ties  to  her  blood  relatives. 

By  producing  children,  especially  highly  valued  sons,  and, 
ultimately,  becoming  a  mother-in-law  herself,  a  woman  gradu- 
ally improves  her  position  within  the  conjugal  household.  In 
motherhood  the  married  woman  finds  social  approval,  eco- 
nomic security,  and  emotional  satisfaction. 

A  man  and  his  wife  owe  respect  and  obedience  to  his  parents 
and  other  senior  relatives.  Ideally,  all  cooperate  in  the  joint 
family  enterprise.  Gradually,  as  the  years  pass,  members  of  the 
younger  generation  take  the  place  of  the  older  generation  and 
become  figures  of  authority  and  respect.  As  this  transition 
occurs,  it  is  generally  assumed  that  younger  family  members 
will  physically  care  for  and  support  elders  until  their  demise. 

In  their  adult  years,  men  and  women  engage  in  a  wide  vari- 
ety of  tasks  and  occupations  strongly  linked  to  socioeconomic 
status,  including  caste  membership,  wealth,  place  of  residence, 
and  many  other  factors.  In  general,  the  higher  the  status  of  a 
family,  the  less  likely  its  members  are  to  engage  in  manual 
labor  and  the  more  likely  its  members  are  to  be  served  by 
employees  of  lower  status.  Although  educated  women  are 
increasingly  working  outside  the  home,  even  in  urbane  circles 
some  negative  stigma  is  still  attached  to  women's  employment. 
In  addition,  students  from  high-status  families  do  not  work  at 
temporary  menial  jobs  as  they  do  in  many  Western  countries. 

People  of  low  status  work  at  the  many  menial  tasks  that  high- 
status  people  disdain.  Poor  women  cannot  afford  to  abstain 
from  paid  labor,  and  they  work  alongside  their  menfolk  in  the 
fields  and  at  construction  projects.  In  low-status  families, 
women  are  less  likely  than  high-status  women  to  unquestion- 
ingly  accept  the  authority  of  men  and  even  of  elders  because 
they  are  directly  responsible  for  providing  income  for  the  fam- 
ily. Among  Sweepers,  very  low-status  latrine  cleaners,  women 


263 


India:  A  Country  Study 

carry  out  more  of  the  -aditional  tasks  than  do  men  and  hold  a 
relatively  less  subordinate  position  in  their  families  than  do 
women  of  traditional  high-status  families.  Such  women  are, 
nonetheless,  less  powerful  in  the  society  at  large  than  are 
women  of  economically  prosperous  high-status  families,  who 
control  and  influence  the  control  of  more  assets  than  do  poor 
women. 

Along  with  economically  supporting  themselves,  their 
elders,  and  their  children,  adults  must  maintain  and  add  to  the 
elaborate  social  networks  upon  which  life  depends.  Offering 
gracious  hospitality  to  guests  is  a  key  ingredient  of  proper  adult 
behavior.  Adults  must  also  attend  to  religious  matters,  carrying 
out  rites  intended  to  protect  their  families  and  communities. 
In  these  efforts,  men  and  women  constantly  work  for  the  bene- 
fit of  their  kin  groups,  castes,  and  other  social  units. 

Death  and  Beyond 

The  death  of  an  infant  or  young  child — a  common  event  in 
India — causes  sorrow  but  usually  not  major  social  disruption. 
The  death  of  a  married  adult  has  wider  repercussions.  Among 
Hindus,  the  demise  of  a  lineage  member  immediately  ritually 
pollutes  the  entire  lineage  for  a  period  of  several  days.  As  part 
of  the  mourning  process,  closely  related  male  mourners  have 
their  heads  and  facial  hair  shaved,  thus  publicly  declaring  their 
close  links  to  the  deceased.  Various  funeral  rites,  feasts,  and 
mourning  practices  affirm  kinship  ties  with  the  deceased  and 
among  survivors.  Crucial  social  bonds  become  visible  to  all 
concerned. 

Although  a  man  may  grieve  for  his  deceased  wife,  a  widow 
may  face  not  only  a  personal  loss  but  a  major  restructuring  of 
her  life.  Becoming  a  widow  in  India  is  not  a  benign  or  neutral 
event.  A  man's  death,  particularly  if  it  occurs  when  he  is  young, 
may  be  attributed  to  ill  fortune  brought  upon  him  by  his  wife, 
possibly  because  of  her  sins  in  a  past  life. 

With  the  death  of  her  husband,  a  woman's  auspicious  wife- 
hood ends,  and  she  is  plunged  into  dreaded  widowhood.  The 
very  word  widow  is  used  as  an  epithet.  As  a  widow,  a  woman  is 
devoid  of  reason  to  adorn  herself.  If  she  follows  tradition,  she 
may  shave  her  head,  shed  her  jewelry,  and  wear  only  plain 
white  or  dark  clothing. 

Widows  of  low-ranking  groups  have  always  been  allowed  to 
remarry,  but  widows  of  high  rank  have  been  expected  to 
remain  unmarried  and  chaste  until  death.  In  earlier  times,  for 


264

child  brides  married  to  older  men  and  widowed  young,  these 
strictures  caused  great  hardship  and  inspired  reform  move- 
ments in  some  parts  of  the  country. 

In  past  centuries,  the  ultimate  rejection  of  widowhood 
occurred  in  the  burning  of  the  Hindu  widow  on  her  husband's 
funeral  pyre,  a  practice  known  as  sati  (meaning,  literally,  true 
or  virtuous  one).  Women  who  so  perished  in  the  funeral  flames 
were  posthumously  adulated,  and  even  in  the  late  twentieth 
century  are  worshiped  at  memorial  tablets  and  temples  erected 
in  their  honor.  In  western  India,  Rajput  lineages  proudly  point 
to  satis  in  their  history.  Sati  was  never  widespread,  and  it  has 
been  illegal  since  1829,  but  a  few  cases  of  sati  still  occur  in 
India  every  year.  In  choosing  to  die  with  her  husband,  a  woman 
evinces  great  merit  and  power  and  is  considered  able  to  bring 
boons  to  her  husband's  patrilineage  and  to  others  who  honor 
her.  Thus,  through  her  meritorious  death,  a  widow  avoids  dis-

dain  and  achieves  glory,  not  only  for  herself,  but  for  all  of  her 
kin  as  well. 

By  restricting  widow  remarriage,  high-status  groups  limit 
restructuring  of  the  lineage  on  the  death  of  a  male  member. 
An  unmarried  widow  remains  a  member  of  her  husband's  lin- 
eage, with  no  competing  ties  to  other  groups  of  in-laws.  Her 
rights  to  her  husband's  property,  traditionally  limited  though 
they  are  to  management  rather  than  outright  inheritance, 
remain  uncomplicated  by  remarriage  to  a  man  from  another 
lineage.  It  is  among  lower-ranking  groups  with  lesser  amounts 
of  property  and  prestige  that  widow  remarriage  is  most  fre- 
quent. 

Most  Indians  see  their  present  lifetimes  as  but  a  prelude  to 
an  afterlife,  the  quality  of  which  depends  on  their  behavior  in 
this  life.  Muslims  envision  heaven  and  hell,  but  Hindus  concep- 
tualize a  series  of  rebirths  ideally  culminating  in  union  with  the 
divine  (see  The  Monastic  Path,  ch.  3).  Some  Hindus  believe 
they  are  destined  to  marry  the  same  person  in  each  of  their 
lifetimes.  Thus  people  feel  connected  with  different  permuta- 
tions of  themselves  and  others  over  cosmic  cycles  of  time. 

Caste  and  Class 

Varna,  Caste,  and  Other  Divisions 

Although  many  other  nations  are  characterized  by  social  ine- 
quality, perhaps  nowhere  else  in  the  world  has  inequality  been 
so  elaborately  constructed  as  in  the  Indian  institution  of  caste. 
Caste  has  long  existed  in  India,  but  in  the  modern  period  it  has 
been  severely  criticized  by  both  Indian  and  foreign  observers. 
Although  some  educated  Indians  tell  non-Indians  that  caste 
has  been  abolished  or  that  "no  one  pays  attention  to  caste  any- 
more," such  statements  do  not  reflect  reality. 

Caste  has  undergone  significant  change  since  indepen- 
dence, but  it  still  involves  hundreds  of  millions  of  people.  In  its 
preamble,  India's  constitution  forbids  negative  public  discrimi- 
nation on  the  basis  of  caste.  However,  caste  ranking  and  caste- 
based  interaction  have  occurred  for  centuries  and  will  con- 
tinue to  do  so  well  into  the  foreseeable  future,  more  in  the 
countryside  than  in  urban  settings  and  more  in  the  realms  of 
kinship  and  marriage  than  in  less  personal  interactions. 

Castes  are  ranked,  named,  endogamous  (in-marrying) 
groups,  membership  in  which  is  achieved  by  birth.  There  are 
thousands  of  castes  and  subcastes  in  India,  and  these  large  kin-

ship-based  groups  are  fundamental  to  South  Asian  social  struc- 
ture. Each  caste  is  part  of  a  locally  based  system  of  interde- 
pendence with  other  groups,  involving  occupational  specializa- 
tion, and  is  linked  in  complex  ways  with  networks  that  stretch 
across  regions  and  throughout  the  nation. 

The  word  caste  derives  from  the  Portuguese  casta,  meaning 
breed,  race,  or  kind.  Among  the  Indian  terms  that  are  some- 
times translated  as  caste  are  varna  (see  Glossary),  jati  (see  Glos- 
sary), jat,  biradri,  and  samaj.  All  of  these  terms  refer  to  ranked 
groups  of  various  sizes  and  breadth.  Varna,  or  color,  actually 
refers  to  large  divisions  that  include  various  castes;  the  other 
terms  include  castes  and  subdivisions  of  castes  sometimes 
called  subcastes. 

Many  castes  are  traditionally  associated  with  an  occupation, 
such  as  high-ranking  Brahmans;  middle-ranking  farmer  and 
artisan  groups,  such  as  potters,  barbers,  and  carpenters;  and 
very  low-ranking  "Untouchable"  leatherworkers,  butchers, 
launderers,  and  latrine  cleaners.  There  is  some  correlation 
between  ritual  rank  on  the  caste  hierarchy  and  economic  pros- 
perity. Members  of  higher-ranking  castes  tend,  on  the  whole,  to 
be  more  prosperous  than  members  of  lower-ranking  castes. 
Many  lower-caste  people  live  in  conditions  of  great  poverty  and 
social  disadvantage. 

According  to  the  Rig  Veda,  sacred  texts  that  date  back  to  oral 
traditions  of  more  than  3,000  years  ago,  progenitors  of  the  four 
ranked  varna  groups  sprang  from  various  parts  of  the  body  of 
the  primordial  man,  which  Brahma  created  from  clay  (see  The 
Vedas  and  Polytheism,  ch.  3).  Each  group  had  a  function  in  sus- 
taining the  life  of  society — the  social  body.  Brahmans,  or 
priests,  were  created  from  the  mouth.  They  were  to  provide  for 
the  intellectual  and  spiritual  needs  of  the  community.  Kshatri- 
yas,  warriors  and  rulers,  were  derived  from  the  arms.  Their  role 
was  to  rule  and  to  protect  others.  Vaishyas — landowners  and 
merchants — sprang  from  the  thighs,  and  were  entrusted  with 
the  care  of  commerce  and  agriculture.  Shudras — artisans  and 
servants — came  from  the  feet.  Their  task  was  to  perform  all 
manual  labor. 

Later  conceptualized  was  a  fifth  category,  "Untouchable" 
menials,  relegated  to  carrying  out  very  menial  and  polluting 
work  related  to  bodily  decay  and  dirt.  Since  1935  "Untouch- 
ables" have  been  known  as  Scheduled  Castes,  referring  to  their 
listing  on  government  rosters,  or  schedules.  They  are  also  often 
called  by  Mohandas  Karamchand  (Mahatma)  Gandhi's  term 


267 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Harijans,  or  "Children  of  God."  Although  the  term  Untouchable 
appears  in  literature  produced  by  these  low-ranking  castes,  in 
the  1990s,  many  politically  conscious  members  of  these  groups 
prefer  to  refer  to  themselves  as  Dalit  (see  Glossary),  a  Hindi 
word  meaning  oppressed  or  downtrodden.  According  to  the 
1991  census,  there  were  138  million  Scheduled  Caste  members 
in  India,  approximately  16  percent  of  the  total  population. 

The  first  four  varnas  apparently  existed  in  the  ancient  Aryan 
society  of  northern  India.  Some  historians  say  that  these  cate- 
gories were  originally  somewhat  fluid  functional  groups,  not 
castes.  A  greater  degree  of  fixity  gradually  developed,  resulting 
in  the  complex  ranking  systems  of  medieval  India  that  essen- 
tially continue  in  the  late  twentieth  century. 

Although  a  varna  is  not  a  caste,  when  directly  asked  for  their 
caste  affiliation,  particularly  when  the  questioner  is  a  West- 
erner, many  Indians  will  reply  with  a  varna  name.  Pressed  fur- 
ther, they  may  respond  with  a  much  more  specific  name  of  a 
caste,  or  jati,  which  falls  within  that  varna.  For  example,  a  Brah- 
man may  specify  that  he  is  a  member  of  a  named  caste  group, 
such  as  a  Jijotiya  Brahman,  or  a  Smartha  Brahman,  and  so  on. 
Within  such  castes,  people  may  further  belong  to  smaller  sub- 
caste  categories  and  to  specific  clans  and  lineages.  These  finer 
designations  are  particularly  relevant  when  marriages  are 
being  arranged  and  often  appear  in  newspaper  matrimonial 
advertisements. 

Members  of  a  caste  are  typically  spread  out  over  a  region, 
with  representatives  living  in  hundreds  of  settlements.  In  any 
small  village,  there  may  be  representatives  of  a  few  or  even  a 
score  or  more  castes. 

Numerous  groups  usually  called  tribes  (often  referred  to  as 
Scheduled  Tribes)  are  also  integrated  into  the  caste  system  to 
varying  degrees.  Some  tribes  live  separately  from  others — par- 
ticularly in  the  far  northeast  and  in  the  forested  center  of  the 
country,  where  tribes  are  more  like  ethnic  groups  than  castes. 
Some  tribes  are  themselves  divided  into  groups  similar  to  sub- 
castes.  In  regions  where  members  of  tribes  live  in  peasant  vil- 
lages with  nontribal  peoples,  they  are  usually  considered 
members  of  separate  castes  ranking  low  on  the  hierarchical 
scale. 

Inequalities  among  castes  are  considered  by  the  Hindu  faith- 
ful to  be  part  of  the  divinely  ordained  natural  order  and  are 
expressed  in  terms  of  purity  and  pollution.  Within  a  village,  rel- 
ative rank  is  most  graphically  expressed  at  a  wedding  or  death

feast,  when  all  residents  of  the  village  are  invited.  At  the  home 
of  a  high-ranking  caste  member,  food  is  prepared  by  a  member 
of  a  caste  from  whom  all  can  accept  cooked  food  (usually  by  a 
Brahman).  Diners  are  seated  in  lines;  members  of  a  single  caste 
sit  next  to  each  other  in  a  row,  and  members  of  other  castes  sit 
in  perpendicular  or  parallel  rows  at  some  distance.  Members  of 
Dalit  castes,  such  as  Leatherworkers  and  Sweepers,  may  be 
seated  far  from  the  other  diners — even  out  in  an  alley.  Farther 
away,  at  the  edge  of  the  feeding  area,  a  Sweeper  may  wait  with  a 
large  basket  to  receive  discarded  leavings  tossed  in  by  other 
diners.  Eating  food  contaminated  by  contact  with  the  saliva  of 
others  not  of  the  same  family  is  considered  far  too  polluting  to 
be  practiced  by  members  of  any  other  castes.  Generally,  feasts 
and  ceremonies  given  by  Dalits  are  not  attended  by  higher- 
ranking  castes. 

Among  Muslims,  although  status  differences  prevail,  broth- 
erhood may  be  stressed.  A  Muslim  feast  usually  includes  a  cloth 
laid  either  on  clean  ground  or  on  a  table,  with  all  Muslims,  rich 
and  poor,  dining  from  plates  placed  on  the  same  cloth.  Mus- 
lims who  wish  to  provide  hospitality  to  observant  Hindus,  how- 
ever, must  make  separate  arrangements  for  a  high-caste  Hindu 
cook  and  ritually  pure  foods  and  dining  area. 

Castes  that  fall  within  the  top  four  ranked  varnas  are  some- 
times referred  to  as  the  "clean  castes,"  with  Dalits  considered 


269 


Ind ia :  A  Co  u  n  try  St  u  dy 


"unclean."  Castes  of  the  top  three  ranked  varnas  are  often  des- 
ignated "twice-born,"  in  reference  to  the  ritual  initiation  under- 
gone by  male  members.,  in  which  investiture  with  the  Hindu 
sacred  thread  constitutes  a  kind  of  ritual  rebirth.  Non-Hindu 
castelike  groups  generally  fall  outside  these  designations. 

Each  caste  is  believed  by  devout  Hindus  to  have  its  own 
dharma.  or  divine lv  ordained  code  of  proper  conduct.  Accord- 
ingly, there  is  often  a  histfi  decree  of  tolerance  for  divergent 
lifestvles  among  different  castes.  Brahmans  are  usuallv 
expected  to  be  nomiolent  and  spiritual.,  according  with  their 
traditional  roles  as  vegetarian  teetotaler  priests.  Kshatrivas  are 
supposed  to  be  strong,  as  fighters  and  rulers  should  be.  with  a 
taste  for  a2;onression.  eating  meat,  and  drinking  alcohol.  Vaish- 
vas  are  stereotyped  as  adept  businessmen,  in  accord  with  their 
traditional  activities  in  commerce.  Shudras  are  often  described 
bv  others  as  tolerably  pleasant  but  expectably  somewhat  base  in 
behavior,  whereas  Dalits — especially  Sweepers — are  often 
regarded  bv  others  as  followers  of  vulvar  life-stvles.  Conversely, 
lower-caste  people  often  view  people  of  high  rank  as  haughty 
and  unfeeling. 

The  chastitv  of  women  is  strongly  related  to  caste  status. 
Generally,  the  higher  rankine  the  caste,  the  more  sexual  con- 
trol  its  women  are  expected  to  exhibit.  Brahman  brides  should 
be  virginal,  faithful  to  one  husband,  and  celibate  in  widow- 
hood.  Bv  contrast,  a  Sweeper  bride  mav  or  mav  not  be  a  virgin, 
extramarital  affairs  mav  be  tolerated,  and,  if  widowed  or 
divorced,  the  woman  is  encouraged  to  remarrv  For  the  higher 
castes,  such  control  of  female  sexuality  helps  ensure  purity  of 
lineage — of  crucial  importance  to  maintenance  of  high  status. 
Amons:  Muslims,  too.  high  status  is  stronely  correlated  with 
female  chastitv 

Within  castes  explicit  standards  are  maintained.  Transgres- 
sions mav  be  dealt  with  bv  a  caste  council  ( panchayat — see  Glos- 
sary), meeting  periodically  to  adjudicate  issues  relevant  to  the 
caste.  Such  councils  are  usually  formed  of  groups  of  elders, 
almost  alwavs  males.  Punishments  such  as  fines  and  outcasting, 
either  temporary  or  permanent,  can  be  enforced.  In  rare  cases, 
a  person  is  excommunicated  from  the  caste  for  gross  infrac- 
tions of  caste  rules.  An  example  of  such  an  infraction  might  be 
marrying  or  openlv  cohabiting  with  a  mate  of  a  caste  lower 
than  one's  own;  such  behavior  would  usually  result  in  the 
higher-caste  person  dropping  to  the  status  of  the  lower-caste 
person.

Social  Systems 


Activities  such  as  farming  or  trading  can  be  carried  out  by 
anyone,  but  usually  only  members  of  the  appropriate  castes  act 
as  priests,  barbers,  potters,  weavers,  and  other  skilled  artisans, 
whose  occupational  skills  are  handed  down  in  families  from 
one  generation  to  another.  As  with  other  key  features  of  Indian 
social  structure,  occupational  specialization  is  believed  to  be  in 
accord  with  the  divinely  ordained  order  of  the  universe. 

The  existence  of  rigid  ranking  is  supernaturally  validated 
through  the  idea  of  rebirth  according  to  a  person's  karma,  the 
sum  of  an  individual's  deeds  in  this  life  and  in  past  lives.  After 
death,  a  person's  life  is  judged  by  divine  forces,  and  rebirth  is 
assigned  in  a  high  or  a  low  place,  depending  upon  what  is 
deserved.  This  supernatural  sanction  can  never  be  neglected, 
because  it  brings  a  person  to  his  or  her  position  in  the  caste 
hierarchy,  relevant  to  every  transaction  involving  food  or  drink, 
speaking,  or  touching. 

In  past  decades,  Dalits  in  certain  areas  (especially  in  parts  of 
the  south)  had  to  display  extreme  deference  to  high-status  peo- 
ple, physically  keeping  their  distance — lest  their  touch  or  even 
their  shadow  pollute  others — wearing  neither  shoes  nor  any 
upper  body  covering  (even  for  women)  in  the  presence  of  the 
upper  castes.  The  lowest-ranking  had  to  jingle  a  little  bell  in 
warning  of  their  polluting  approach.  In  much  of  India,  Dalits 
were  prohibited  from  entering  temples,  using  wells  from  which 
the  "clean"  castes  drew  their  water,  or  even  attending  schools. 
In  past  centuries,  dire  punishments  were  prescribed  for  Dalits 
who  read  or  even  heard  sacred  texts. 

Such  degrading  discrimination  was  made  illegal  under  legis- 
lation passed  during  British  rule  and  was  protested  against  by 
preindependence  reform  movements  led  by  Mahatma  Gandhi 
and  Bhimrao  Ramji  (B.R.)  Ambedkar,  a  Dalit  leader.  Dalits  agi- 
tated for  the  right  to  enter  Hindu  temples  and  to  use  village 
wells  and  effectively  pressed  for  the  enactment  of  stronger  laws 
opposing  disabilities  imposed  on  them.  After  independence, 
Ambedkar  almost  singlehandedly  wrote  India's  constitution, 
including  key  provisions  barring  caste-based  discrimination. 
Nonetheless,  discriminatory  treatment  of  Dalits  remains  a  fac- 
tor in  daily  life,  especially  in  villages,  as  the  end  of  the  twentieth 
century  approaches. 

In  modern  times,  as  in  the  past,  it  is  virtually  impossible  for 
an  individual  to  raise  his  own  status  by  falsely  claiming  to  be  a 
member  of  a  higher-ranked  caste.  Such  a  ruse  might  work  for  a 
time  in  a  place  where  the  person  is  unknown,  but  no  one 


271 


India:  A  Country  Study 

would  dine  with  or  intermarry  with  such  a  person  or  his  off- 
spring until  the  claim  was  validated  through  kinship  networks. 
Rising  on  the  ritual  hierarchy  can  only  be  achieved  by  a  caste  as 
a  group,  over  a  long  period  of  time,  principally  by  adopting 
behavior  patterns  of  higher-ranked  groups.  This  process, 
known  as  Sanskritization,  has  been  described  by  M.N.  Srinivas 
and  others.  An  example  of  such  behavior  is  that  of  some  Leath- 
erworker  castes  adopting  a  policy  of  not  eating  beef,  in  the 
hope  that  abstaining  from  the  defiling  practice  of  consuming 
the  flesh  of  sacred  bovines  would  enhance  their  castes'  status. 
Increased  economic  prosperity  for  much  of  a  caste  greatly  aids 
in  the  process  of  improving  rank. 

Intercaste  Relations 

In  a  village,  members  of  different  castes  are  often  linked  in 
what  has  been  called  the  jajmani  system,  after  the  word  jajman, 
which  in  some  regions  means  patron.  Members  of  various  ser- 
vice castes  perform  tasks  for  their  patrons,  usually  members  of 
the  dominant,  that  is,  most  powerful  landowning  caste  of  the 
village  (commonly  castes  of  the  Kshatriya  varnd).  Households 
of  service  castes  are  linked  through  hereditary  bonds  to  a 
household  of  patrons,  with  the  lower-caste  members  providing 
services  according  to  traditional  occupational  specializations. 
Thus,  client  families  of  launderers,  barbers,  shoemakers,  car- 
penters, potters,  tailors,  and  priests  provide  customary  services 
to  their  patrons,  in  return  for  which  they  receive  customary 
seasonal  payments  of  grain,  clothing,  and  money.  Ideally,  from 
generation  to  generation,  clients  owe  their  patrons  political 
allegiance  in  addition  to  their  labors,  while  patrons  owe  their 
clients  protection  and  security. 

The  harmonious  qualities  of  the  jajmani  system  have  been 
overidealized  and  variations  of  the  system  overlooked  by  many 
observers.  Further,  the  economic  interdependence  of  the  sys- 
tem has  weakened  since  the  1960s.  Nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that 
members  of  different  castes  customarily  perform  a  number  of 
functions  for  one  another  in  rural  India  that  emphasize  coop- 
eration rather  than  competition.  This  cooperation  is  revealed 
in  economic  arrangements,  in  visits  to  farmers'  threshing  floors 
by  service  caste  members  to  claim  traditional  payments,  and  in 
rituals  emphasizing  interdependence  at  life  crises  and  calendri- 
cal  festivals  all  over  South  Asia.  For  example,  in  rural  Karna- 
taka,  in  an  event  described  by  anthropologist  Suzanne 
Hanchett,  the  annual  procession  of  the  village  temple  cart 


272 


Social  Systems 


bearing  images  of  the  deities  responsible  for  the  welfare  of  the 
village  cannot  go  forward  without  the  combined  efforts  of  rep- 
resentatives of  all  castes.  It  is  believed  that  the  sacred  cart  will 
literally  not  move  unless  all  work  together  to  move  it,  some 
pushing  and  some  pulling. 

Some  observers  feel  that  the  caste  system  must  be  viewed  as  a 
system  of  exploitation  of  poor  low-ranking  groups  by  more 
prosperous  high-ranking  groups.  In  many  parts  of  India,  land  is 
largely  held  by  dominant  castes — high-ranking  owners  of  prop- 
erty— that  economically  exploit  low-ranking  landless  laborers 
and  poor  artisans,  all  the  while  degrading  them  with  ritual 
emphases  on  their  so-called  god-given  inferior  status.  In  the 
early  1990s,  blatant  subjugation  of  low-caste  laborers  in  the 
northern  state  of  Bihar  and  in  eastern  Uttar  Pradesh  was  the 
subject  of  many  news  reports.  In  this  region,  scores  of  Dalits 
who  have  attempted  to  unite  to  protest  low  wages  have  been 
the  victims  of  lynchings  and  mass  killings  by  high-caste  land- 
owners and  their  hired  assassins. 

In  1991  the  news  magazine  India  Today  reported  that  in  an 
ostensibly  prosperous  village  about  160  kilometers  southeast  of 
Delhi,  when  it  became  known  that  a  rural  Dalit  laborer  dared 
to  have  a  love  affair  with  the  daughter  of  a  high-caste  landlord, 
the  lovers  and  their  Dalit  go-between  were  tortured,  publicly 
hanged,  and  burnt  by  agents  of  the  girl's  family  in  the  presence 
of  some  500  villagers.  A  similar  incident  occurred  in  1994, 
when  a  Dalit  musician  who  had  secretly  married  a  woman  of 
the  Kurmi  cultivating  caste  was  beaten  to  death  by  outraged 
Kurmis,  possibly  instigated  by  the  young  woman's  family.  The 
terrified  bride  was  stripped  and  branded  as  punishment  for  her 
transgression.  Dalit  women  also  have  been  the  victims  of  gang 
rapes  by  the  police.  Many  other  atrocities,  as  well  as  urban  riots 
resulting  in  the  deaths  of  Dalits,  have  occurred  in  recent  years. 
Such  extreme  injustices  are  infrequent  enough  to  be  reported 
in  outraged  articles  in  the  Indian  press,  while  much  more  com- 
mon daily  discrimination  and  exploitation  are  considered  vir- 
tually routine. 

Changes  in  the  Caste  System 

Despite  many  problems,  the  caste  system  has  operated  suc- 
cessfully for  centuries,  providing  goods  and  services  to  India's 
many  millions  of  citizens.  The  system  continues  to  operate,  but 
changes  are  occurring.  India's  constitution  guarantees  basic 
rights  to  all  its  citizens,  including  the  right  to  equality  and 


273 


India:  A  Country  Study 


equal  protection  before  the  law.  The  practice  of  untouchabilitv 
as  well  as  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  caste,  race.  sex.  or  reli- 
gion, has  been  legally  abolished.  All  citizens  have  the  rieht  to 

00.  □ 

vote,  and  political  competition  is  livelv.  Voters  from  everv  stra- 
tum of  society  have  formed  interest  groups.,  overlapping  and 
crosscutting  castes,  creating  an  evolving  new  stvle  of  integrating 
Indian  society 

Castes  themselves,  however,  far  from  being  abolished,  have 
certain  rights  under  Indian  law.  As  described  bv  anthropologist 
Owen  M.  Lvnch  and  other  scholars,  in  the  expanding  political 
arena  caste  groups  are  becoming  more  politicized  and  forced 
to  compete  with  other  interest  groups  for  social  and  economic 
benefits.  In  the  growing  cities,  traditional  intercaste  interde- 
pendencies  are  negligible. 

Independent  India  has  built  on  earlier  British  efforts  to  rem- 
edy problems  suffered  bv  Dalits  bv  granting  them  some  bene- 
fits of  protective  discrimination.  Scheduled  Castes  are  entitled 
to  reserved  electoral  offices,  reserved  jobs  in  central  and  state 
governments,  and  special  educational  benefits.  The  constitu- 
tion mandates  that  one-seventh  of  state  and  national  legislative 
seats  be  reserved  for  members  of  Scheduled  Castes  in  order  to 
guarantee  their  voice  in  government.  Reserving  seats  has 
proven  useful  because  few.  if  any  Scheduled  Caste  candidates 
have  ever  been  elected  in  nonreserved  constituencies. 

Educationally  Dalit  students  have  benefited  from  scholar- 
ships, and  Scheduled  Caste  literacy  increased  (from  10.3  per- 
cent in  1961  to  21.4  percent  in  1981.  the  last  vear  for  which 
such  figures  are  available),  although  not  as  rapidlv  as  among 
the  general  population.  Improved  access  to  education  has 
resulted  in  the  emergence  of  a  substantial  group  of  educated 
Dalits  able  to  take  up  white-collar  occupations  and  fight  for 
their  rights. 

There  has  been  tremendous  resistance  amon^  non-Dalits  to 
this  protective  discrimination  for  the  Scheduled  Castes,  who 
constitute  some  16  percent  of  the  total  population,  and  efforts 
have  been  made  to  provide  similar  advantages  to  the  so-called 
Backward  Classes  (see  Glossary),  who  constitute  an  estimated 
52  percent  of  the  population.  In  August  1990.  Prime  Minister 
Vishwanath  Pratap  (V.P. )  Singh  announced  his  intention  to 
enforce  the  recommendations  of  the  Backward  Classes  Com- 
mission (Mandal  Commission — see  Glossary),  issued  in 
December  19S0  and  largely  ignored  for  a  decade.  The  report, 
which  urged  special  advantages  for  obtaining  civil  service  posi-

Social  Systems 


tions  and  admission  to  higher  education  for  the  Backward 
Classes,  resulted  in  riots  and  self-immolations  and  contributed 
to  the  fall  of  the  prime  minister.  The  upper  castes  have  been 
particularly  adamant  against  these  policies  because  unemploy- 
ment is  a  major  problem  in  India,  and  many  feel  that  they  are 
being  unjustly  excluded  from  posts  for  which  they  are  better 
qualified  than  lower-caste  applicants. 

As  an  act  of  protest,  many  Dalits  have  rejected  Hinduism 
with  its  rigid  ranking  system.  Following  the  example  of  their 
revered  leader,  Dr.  Ambedkar,  who  converted  to  Buddhism 
four  years  before  his  death  in  1956,  millions  of  Dalits  have 
embraced  the  faith  of  the  Buddha  (see  Buddhism,  ch.  3).  Over 
the  past  few  centuries,  many  Dalits  have  also  converted  to 
Christianity  and  have  often  by  this  means  raised  their  socioeco- 
nomic status.  However,  Christians  of  Dalit  origin  still  often  suf- 
fer from  discrimination  by  Christians — and  others — of  higher 
caste  backgrounds. 

Despite  improvements  in  some  aspects  of  Dalit  status,  90  per- 
cent of  them  live  in  rural  areas  in  the  mid-1990s,  where  an 
increasing  proportion — more  than  50  percent — work  as  land- 
less agricultural  laborers.  State  and  national  governments  have 
attempted  to  secure  more  just  distribution  of  land  by  creating 
land  ceilings  and  abolishing  absentee  landlordism,  but  evasive 
tactics  by  landowners  have  successfully  prevented  more  than 
minimal  redistribution  of  land  to  tenant  farmers  and  laborers. 
In  contemporary  India,  field  hands  face  increased  competition 
from  tractors  and  harvesting  machines.  Similarly,  artisans  are 
being  challenged  by  expanding  commercial  markets  in  mass- 
produced  factory  goods,  undercutting  traditional  mutual  obli- 
gations between  patrons  and  clients.  The  spread  of  the  Green 
Revolution  has  tended  to  increase  the  gap  between  the  pros- 
perous and  the  poor — most  of  whom  are  low-caste  (see  The 
Green  Revolution,  ch.  7). 

The  growth  of  urbanization  (an  estimated  26  percent  of  the 
population  now  lives  in  cities)  is  having  a  far-reaching  effect  on 
caste  practices,  not  only  in  cities  but  in  villages.  Among  anony- 
mous crowds  in  urban  public  spaces  and  on  public  transporta- 
tion, caste  affiliations  are  unknown,  and  observance  of  purity 
and  pollution  rules  is  negligible.  Distinctive  caste  costumes 
have  all  but  vanished,  and  low-caste  names  have  been  modified, 
although  castes  remain  endogamous,  and  access  to  employ- 
ment often  occurs  through  intracaste  connections.  Restrictions 
on  interactions  with  other  castes  are  becoming  more  relaxed, 


275 


India:  A  Country  Study 


and,  at  the  same  time,  observance  of  other  pollution  rules  is 
declining — especially  those  concerning  birth,  death,  and  men- 
struation. Several  growing  Hindu  sects  draw  members  from 
many  castes  and  regions,  and  communication  between  cities 
and  villages  is  expanding  dramatically.  Kin  in  town  and  country 
visit  one  another  frequently,  and  television  programs  available 
to  huge  numbers  of  villagers  vividly  portray  new  lifestyles.  As 
new  occupations  open  up  in  urban  areas,  the  correlation  of 
caste  with  occupation  is  declining. 

Caste  associations  have  expanded  their  areas  of  concern 
beyond  traditional  elite  emulation  and  local  politics  into  the 
wider  political  arenas  of  state  and  national  politics.  Finding 
power  in  numbers  within  India's  democratic  system,  caste 
groups  are  pulling  together  closely  allied  subcastes  in  their 
quest  for  political  influence.  In  efforts  to  solidify  caste  bonds, 
some  caste  associations  have  organized  marriage  fairs  where 
families  can  make  matches  for  their  children.  Traditional  hier- 
archical concerns  are  being  minimized  in  favor  of  strengthen- 
ing horizontal  unity.  Thus,  while  pollution  observances  are 
declining,  caste  consciousness  is  not. 

Education  and  election  to  political  office  have  advanced  the 
status  of  many  Dalits,  but  the  overall  picture  remains  one  of 
great  inequity.  In  recent  decades,  Dalit  anger  has  been 
expressed  in  writings,  demonstrations,  strikes,  and  the  activities 
of  such  groups  as  the  Dalit  Panthers,  a  radical  political  party 
demanding  revolutionary  change.  A  wider  Dalit  movement, 
including  political  parties,  educational  activities,  self-help  cen- 
ters, and  labor  organizations,  has  spread  to  many  areas  of  the 
country. 

In  a  1982  Dalit  publication,  Dilip  Hiro  wrote,  "It  is  one  of  the 
great  modern  Indian  tragedies  and  dangers  that  even  well 
meaning  Indians  still  find  it  so  difficult  to  accept  Untouchable 
mobility  as  being  legitimate  in  fact  as  well  as  in  theory.  ..."  Still, 
against  all  odds,  a  small  intelligentsia  has  worked  for  many 
years  toward  the  goal  of  freeing  India  of  caste  consciousness. 

Classes 

In  village  India,  where  nearly  74  percent  of  the  population 
resides,  caste  and  class  affiliations  overlap.  According  to 
anthropologist  Miriam  Sharma,  "Large  landholders  who 
employ  hired  labour  are  overwhelmingly  from  the  upper 
castes,  while  the  agricultural  workers  themselves  come  from 
the  ranks  of  the  lowest — predominantly  Untouchable — castes."

She  also  points  out  that  household-labor-using  proprietors 
come  from  the  ranks  of  the  middle  agricultural  castes.  Distribu- 
tion of  other  resources  and  access  to  political  control  follow 
the  same  pattern  of  caste-cum-class  distinctions.  Although  this 
congruence  is  strong,  there  is  a  tendency  for  class  formation  to 
occur  despite  the  importance  of  caste,  especially  in  the  cities, 
but  also  in  rural  areas. 

In  an  analysis  of  class  formation  in  India,  anthropologist 
Harold  A.  Gould  points  out  that  a  three-level  system  of  stratifi- 
cation is  taking  shape  across  rural  India.  He  calls  the  three  lev- 
els Forward  Classes  (higher  castes),  Backward  Classes  (middle 
and  lower  castes),  and  Harijans  (very  low  castes).  Members  of 
these  groups  share  common  concerns  because  they  stand  in 
approximately  the  same  relationship  to  land  and  production — 
that  is,  they  are  large-scale  farmers,  small-scale  farmers,  and 
landless  laborers.  Some  of  these  groups  are  drawing  together 
within  regions  across  caste  lines  in  order  to  work  for  political 
power  and  access  to  desirable  resources.  For  example,  since  the 
late  1960s,  some  of  the  middle-ranking  cultivating  castes  of 
northern  India  have  increasingly  cooperated  in  the  political 
arena  in  order  to  advance  their  common  agrarian  and  market- 
oriented  interests.  Their  efforts  have  been  spurred  by  competi- 
tion with  higher-caste  landed  elites. 


277 


India:  A  Country  Study 


In  cities  other  groups  have  vested  interests  that  crosscut 
caste  boundaries,  suggesting  the  possibility  of  forming  classes 
in  the  future.  These  groups  include  prosperous  industrialists 
and  entrepreneurs,  who  have  made  successful  efforts  to  push 
the  central  government  toward  a  probusiness  stance;  bureau- 
crats, who  depend  upon  higher  education  rather  than  land  to 
preserve  their  positions  as  civil  servants;  political  officeholders, 
who  enjoy  good  salaries  and  perquisites  of  all  kinds;  and  the 
military,  who  constitute  one  of  the  most  powerful  armed  forces 
in  the  developing  world  (see  Organization  and  Equipment  of 
the  Armed  Forces,  ch.  10). 

Economically  far  below  such  groups  are  members  of  the 
menial  underclass,  which  is  taking  shape  in  both  villages  and 
urban  areas.  As  the  privileged  elites  move  ahead,  low-ranking 
menial  workers  remain  economically  insecure.  Were  they  to 
join  together  to  mobilize  politically  across  lines  of  class  and 
religion  in  recognition  of  their  common  interests,  Gould 
observes,  they  might  find  power  in  their  sheer  numbers. 

India's  rapidly  expanding  economy  has  provided  the  basis 
for  a  fundamental  change — the  emergence  of  what  eminent 
journalist  Suman  Dubey  calls  a  "new  vanguard"  increasingly 
dictating  India's  political  and  economic  direction.  This  group 
is  India's  new  middle  class — mobile,  driven,  consumer-ori- 
ented, and,  to  some  extent,  forward-looking.  Hard  to  define 
precisely,  it  is  not  a  single  stratum  of  society,  but  straddles  town 
and  countryside,  making  its  voice  heard  everywhere.  It  encom- 
passes prosperous  farmers,  white-collar  workers,  business  peo- 
ple, military  personnel,  and  myriad  others,  all  actively  working 
toward  a  prosperous  life.  Ownership  of  cars,  televisions,  and 
other  consumer  goods,  reasonable  earnings,  substantial  sav- 
ings, and  educated  children  (often  fluent  in  English)  typify  this 
diverse  group.  Many  have  ties  to  kinsmen  living  abroad  who 
have  done  very  well. 

The  new  middle  class  is  booming,  at  least  partially  in 
response  to  a  doubling  of  the  salaries  of  some  4  million  central 
government  employees  in  1986,  followed  by  similar  increases 
for  state  and  district  officers.  Unprecedented  liberalization  and 
opening  up  of  the  economy  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  have  been 
part  of  the  picture  (see  Growth  since  1980,  ch.  6). 

There  is  no  single  set  of  criteria  defining  the  middle  class, 
and  estimates  of  its  numbers  vary  widely.  The  mid-range  of  fig- 
ures presented  in  a  1992  survey  article  by  analyst  Suman  Dubey 
is  approximately  150  to  175  million — some  20  percent  of  the 


278 


Social  Systems 


population — although  other  observers  suggest  alternative  fig- 
ures. The  middle  class  appears  to  be  increasing  rapidly.  Once 
primarily  urban  and  largely  Hindu,  the  phenomenon  of  the 
consuming  middle  class  is  burgeoning  among  Muslims  and 
prosperous  villagers  as  well.  According  to  V.A.  Pai  Panandikar, 
director  of  the  Centre  for  Policy  Research,  New  Delhi,  cited  by 
Dubey,  by  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century  30  percent — some 
300  million — of  India's  population  will  be  middle  class. 

The  middle  class  is  bracketed  on  either  side  by  the  upper 
and  lower  echelons.  Members  of  the  upper  class — around  1 
percent  of  the  population — are  owners  of  large  properties, 
members  of  exclusive  clubs,  and  vacationers  in  foreign  lands, 
and  include  industrialists,  former  maharajas,  and  top  execu- 
tives. Below  the  middle  class  is  perhaps  a  third  of  the  popula- 
tion— ordinary  farmers,  tradespeople,  artisans,  and  workers.  At 
the  bottom  of  the  economic  scale  are  the  poor — estimated  at 
320  million,  some  45  percent  of  the  population  in  1988 — who 
live  in  inadequate  homes  without  adequate  food,  work  for  pit- 
tances, have  undereducated  and  often  sickly  children,  and  are 
the  victims  of  numerous  social  inequities. 

The  Fringes  of  Society 

India's  complex  society  includes  some  unique  members — 
sadhus  (holy  men)  and  hijras  (transvestite-eunuchs).  Such  peo- 
ple have  voluntarily  stepped  outside  the  usual  bonds  of  kinship 
and  caste  to  join  with  others  in  castelike  groups  based  upon 
personal — yet  culturally  shaped — inclinations. 

In  India  of  the  1990s,  several  hundred  thousand  Hindu  and 
Jain  sadhus  and  a  few  thousand  holy  women  (sadhvis)  live  an 
ascetic  life.  They  have  chosen  to  wear  ocher  robes,  or  perhaps 
no  clothing  at  all,  to  daub  their  skin  with  holy  ash,  to  pray  and 
meditate,  and  to  wander  from  place  to  place,  depending  on  the 
charity  of  others.  Most  have  given  up  affiliation  with.their  caste 
and  kin  and  have  undergone  a  funeral  ceremony  for  them- 
selves, followed  by  a  ritual  rebirth  into  their  new  ascetic  life. 
They  come  from  all  walks  of  life,  and  range  from  illiterate  vil- 
lagers to  well-educated  professionals.  In  their  new  lives  as 
renunciants,  they  are  devoted  to  spiritual  concerns,  yet  each  is 
affiliated  with  an  ascetic  order  or  subsect  demanding  strict 
adherence  to  rules  of  dress,  itinerancy,  diet,  worship,  and  ritual 
pollution.  Within  each  order,  hierarchical  concerns  are  exhib- 
ited in  the  subservience  novitiates  display  to  revered  gurus  (see 
The  Tradition  of  the  Enlightened  Master,  ch.  3).  Further,  at  pil- 


279 


India:  A  Country  Study 

grimage  sites,  different  orders  take  precedence  in  accordance 
with  an  accepted  hierarchy.  Thus,  although  sadhus  have  fore- 
sworn many  of  the  trappings  of  ordinary  life,  they  have  not 
given  up  the  hierarchy  and  interdependence  so  pervasive  in 
Indian  society. 

The  most  extreme  sadhus,  the  aghoris,  turn  normal  rules  of 
conduct  completely  upside  down.  Rajesh  and  Ramesh  Bedi, 
who  have  studied  sadhus  for  decades,  estimate  that  there  may 
be  fewer  than  fifteen  aghoris  in  contemporary  India.  In  the 
quest  for  great  spiritual  attainment,  the  aghori  lives  alone,  like 
Lord  Shiva,  at  cremation  grounds,  supping  from  a  human  skull 
bowl.  He  eats  food  provided  only  by  low-ranking  Sweepers  and 
prostitutes,  and  in  moments  of  religious  fervor  devours  his  own 
bodily  wastes  and  pieces  of  human  flesh  torn  from  burning 
corpses.  In  violating  the  most  basic  taboos  of  the  ordinary 
Hindu  householder,  the  aghori  sadhu  graphically  reminds  him- 
self and  others  of  the  correct  rules  of  social  behavior. 

Hijras  are  males  who  have  become  "neither  man  nor 
woman,"  transsexual  transvestites  who  are  usually  castrated  and 
are  attributed  with  certain  ritual  powers  of  blessing.  As 
described  by  anthropologist  Serena  Nanda,  they  are  distinct 
from  ordinary  male  homosexuals  (known  as  zenana,  woman,  or 
anmarad,  un-man),  who  retain  their  identity  as  males  and  con- 
tinue to  live  in  ordinary  society.  Most  hijras  derive  from  a  mid- 
dle- or  lower-status  Hindu  or  Muslim  background  and  have 
experienced  male  impotency  or  effeminacy.  A  few  originally 
had  ambiguous  or  hermaphroditic  sexual  organs.  An  estimated 
50,000  hijras  live  throughout  India,  predominantly  in  cities  of 
the  north.  They  are  united  in  the  worship  of  the  Hindu  god- 
dess Bahuchara  Mata. 

Hijras  voluntarily  leave  their  families  of  birth,  renounce  male 
sexuality,  and  assume  a  female  identity,  name,  and  dress.  A  hijra 
undergoes  a  surgical  emasculation  in  which  he  is  transformed 
from  an  impotent  male  into  a  potentially  powerful  new  person. 
Like  Shiva — attributed  with  breaking  off  his  phallus  and  throw- 
ing it  to  earth,  thereby  extending  his  sexual  power  to  the  uni- 
verse (recognized  in  Hindu  worship  of  the  lingam) — the 
emasculated  hijra  has  the  power  to  bless  others  with  fertility 
(see  Shiva,  ch.  3).  Groups  of  hijras  go  about  together,  dancing 
and  singing  at  the  homes  of  new  baby  boys,  blessing  them  with 
virility  and  the  ability  to  continue  the  family  line.  Hijras  are  also 
attributed  with  the  power  to  bring  rain  in  times  of  drought. 
Hijras  receive  alms  and  respect  for  their  powers,  yet  they  are 


280 


Social  Systems 


also  ridiculed  and  abused  because  of  their  unusual  sexual  con- 
dition and  because  some  act  as  male  prostitutes. 

The  hijra  community  functions  much  like  a  caste.  They  have 
communal  households;  newly  formed  Active  kinship  bonds, 
marriage-like  arrangements;  and  seven  nationwide  "houses,"  or 
symbolic  descent  groups,  with  regional  and  national  leaders, 
and  a  council.  There  is  a  hierarchy  of  gurus  and  disciples,  with 
expulsion  from  the  community  a  possible  punishment  for  fail- 
ure to  obey  group  rules.  Thus,  although  living  on  the  margins 
of  society,  hijras  are  empowered  by  their  special  relationship 
with  their  goddess  and  each  other  and  occupy  an  accepted  and 
meaningful  place  in  India's  social  world. 

The  Village  Community 

Settlement  and  Structure 

Scattered  throughout  India  are  approximately  500,000  vil- 
lages. The  Census  of  India  regards  most  settlements  of  fewer 
than  5,000  as  a  village.  These  settlements  range  from  tiny  ham- 
lets of  thatched  huts  to  larger  settlements  of  tile-roofed  stone 
and  brick  houses  (see  Structure  and  Dynamics,  ch.  2).  Most  vil- 
lages are  small;  nearly  80  percent  have  fewer  than  1,000  inhab- 
itants, according  to  the  1991  census.  Most  are  nucleated 
settlements,  while  others  are  more  dispersed.  It  is  in  villages 
that  India's  most  basic  business — agriculture — takes  place. 
Here,  in  the  face  of  vicissitudes  of  all  kinds,  farmers  follow 
time-tested  as  well  as  innovative  methods  of  growing  wheat, 
rice,  lentils,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  many  other  crops  in  order  to 
accomplish  the  challenging  task  of  feeding  themselves  and  the 
nation.  Here,  too,  flourish  many  of  India's  most  valued  cultural 
forms. 

Viewed  from  a  distance,  an  Indian  village  may  appear  decep- 
tively simple.  A  cluster  of  mud-plastered  walls  shaded  by  a  few 
trees,  set  among  a  stretch  of  green  or  dun-colored  fields,  with  a 
few  people  slowly  coming  or  going,  oxcarts  creaking,  cattle  low- 
ing, and  birds  singing — all  present  an  image  of  harmonious 
simplicity.  Indian  city  dwellers  often  refer  nostalgically  to  "sim- 
ple village  life."  City  artists  portray  colorfully  garbed  village 
women  gracefully  carrying  water  pots  on  their  heads,  and  writ- 
ers describe  isolated  rural  settlements  unsullied  by  the  com- 
plexities of  modern  urban  civilization.  Social  scientists  of  the 
past  wrote  of  Indian  villages  as  virtually  self-sufficient  commu- 
nities with  few  ties  to  the  outside  world. 


281 


India:  A  Country  Study 

In  actuality,  Indian  village  life  is  far  from  simple.  Each  village 
is  connected  through  a  variety  of  crucial  horizontal  linkages 
with  other  villages  and  with  urban  areas  both  near  and  far. 
Most  villages  are  characterized  by  a  multiplicity  of  economic, 
caste,  kinship,  occupational,  and  even  religious  groups  linked 
vertically  within  each  settlement.  Factionalism  is  a  typical  fea- 
ture of  village  politics.  In  one  of  the  first  of  the  modern  anthro- 
pological studies  of  Indian  village  life,  anthropologist  Oscar 
Lewis  called  this  complexity  "rural  cosmopolitanism." 

Throughout  most  of  India,  village  dwellings  are  built  very 
close  to  one  another  in  a  nucleated  settlement,  with  small  lanes 
for  passage  of  people  and  sometimes  carts.  Village  fields  sur- 
round the  settlement  and  are  generally  within  easy  walking  dis- 
tance. In  hilly  tracts  of  central,  eastern,  and  far  northern  India, 
dwellings  are  more  spread  out,  reflecting  the  nature  of  the 
topography.  In  the  wet  states  of  West  Bengal  and  Kerala,  houses 
are  more  dispersed;  in  some  parts  of  Kerala,  they  are  con- 
structed in  continuous  lines,  with  divisions  between  villages  not 
obvious  to  visitors. 

In  northern  and  central  India,  neighborhood  boundaries 
can  be  vague.  The  houses  of  Dalits  are  generally  located  in  sep- 
arate neighborhoods  or  on  the  outskirts  of  the  nucleated  settle- 
ment, but  there  are  seldom  distinct  Dalit  hamlets.  By  contrast, 
in  the  south,  where  socioeconomic  contrasts  and  caste  pollu- 
tion observances  tend  to  be  stronger  than  in  the  north,  Brah- 
man homes  may  be  set  apart  from  those  of  non-Brahmans,  and 
Dalit  hamlets  are  set  at  a  little  distance  from  the  homes  of 
other  castes. 

The  number  of  castes  resident  in  a  single  village  can  vary 
widely,  from  one  to  more  than  forty.  Typically,  a  village  is  domi- 
nated by  one  or  a  very  few  castes  that  essentially  control  the  vil- 
lage land  and  on  whose  patronage  members  of  weaker  groups 
must  rely.  In  the  village  of  about  1,100  population  near  Delhi 
studied  by  Lewis  in  the  1950s,  the  Jat  caste  (the  largest  cultivat- 
ing caste  in  northwestern  India)  comprised  60  percent  of  the 
residents  and  owned  all  of  the  village  land,  including  the  house 
sites.  In  Nimkhera,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Hindu  Thakurs  and  Brah- 
mans,  and  Muslim  Pathans  own  substantial  land,  while  lower- 
ranking  Weaver  (Koli)  and  Barber  (Khawas)  caste  members 
and  others  own  smaller  farms.  In  many  areas  of  the  south, 
Brahmans  are  major  landowners,  along  with  some  other  rela- 
tively high-ranking  castes.  Generally,  land,  prosperity,  and 
power  go  together. 


282 


Social  Systems 


In  some  regions,  landowners  refrain  from  using  plows  them- 
selves but  hire  tenant  farmers  and  laborers  to  do  this  work.  In 
other  regions,  landowners  till  the  soil  with  the  aid  of  laborers, 
usually  resident  in  the  same  village.  Fellow  villagers  typically 
include  representatives  of  various  service  and  artisan  castes  to 
supply  the  needs  of  the  villagers — priests,  carpenters,  black- 
smiths, barbers,  weavers,  potters,  oilpressers,  leatherworkers, 
sweepers,  waterbearers,  toddy-tappers,  and  so  on.  Artisanry  in 
pottery,  wood,  cloth,  metal,  and  leather,  although  diminishing, 
continues  in  many  contemporary  Indian  villages  as  it  did  in 
centuries  past.  Village  religious  observances  and  weddings  are 
occasions  for  members  of  various  castes  to  provide  customary 
ritual  goods  and  services  in  order  for  the  events  to  proceed 
according  to  proper  tradition. 

Aside  from  caste-associated  occupations,  villages  often 
include  people  who  practice  nontraditional  occupations.  For 
example,  Brahmans  or  Thakurs  may  be  shopkeepers,  teachers, 
truckers,  or  clerks,  in  addition  to  their  caste-associated  occupa- 
tions of  priest  and  farmer.  In  villages  near  urban  areas,  an 
increasing  number  of  people  commute  to  the  cities  to  take  up 
jobs,  and  many  migrate.  Some  migrants  leave  their  families  in 
the  village  and  go  to  the  cities  to  work  for  months  at  a  time. 
Many  people  from  Kerala,  as  well  as  other  regions,  have  tempo- 
rarily migrated  to  the  Persian  Gulf  states  for  employment  and 
send  remittances  back  to  their  village  families,  to  which  they 
will  eventually  return. 

At  slack  seasons,  village  life  can  appear  to  be  sleepy,  but  usu- 
ally villages  are  humming  with  activity.  The  work  ethic  is  strong, 
with  little  time  out  for  relaxation,  except  for  numerous  divinely 
sanctioned  festivals  and  rite-of-passage  celebrations.  Residents 
are  quick  to  judge  each  other,  and  improper  work  or  social 
habits  receive  strong  criticism.  Villagers  feel  a  sense  of  village 
pride  and  honor,  and  the  reputation  of  a  village  depends  upon 
the  behavior  of  all  of  its  residents. 

Village  Unity  and  Divisiveness 

Villagers  manifest  a  deep  loyalty  to  their  village,  identifying 
themselves  to  strangers  as  residents  of  a  particular  village,  hark- 
ing back  to  family  residence  in  the  village  that  typically  extends 
into  the  distant  past.  A  family  rooted  in  a  particular  village  does 
not  easily  move  to  another,  and  even  people  who  have  lived  in  a 
city  for  a  generation  or  two  refer  to  their  ancestral  village  as 
"our  village." 


283 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Villagers  share  use  of  common  village  facilities — the  village 
pond  (known  in  India  as  a  tank),  grazing  grounds,  temples  and 
shrines,  cremation  grounds,  schools,  sitting  spaces  under  large 
shade  trees,  wells,  and  wastelands.  Perhaps  equally  important, 
fellow  villagers  share  knowledge  of  their  common  origin  in  a 
locale  and  of  each  other's  secrets,  often  going  back  genera- 
tions. Interdependence  in  rural  life  provides  a  sense  of  unity 
among  residents  of  a  village. 

A  great  many  observances  emphasize  village  unity.  Typically, 
each  village  recognizes  a  deity  deemed  the  village  protector  or 
protectress,  and  villagers  unite  in  regular  worship  of  this  deity, 
considered  essential  to  village  prosperity.  They  may  cooperate 
in  constructing  temples  and  shrines  important  to  the  village  as 
a  whole.  Hindu  festivals  such  as  Holi,  Dipavali  (Diwali),  and 
Durga  Puja  bring  villagers  together  (see  Public  Worship,  ch.3). 
In  the  north,  even  Muslims  may  join  in  the  friendly  splashing 
of  colored  water  on  fellow  villagers  in  Spring  Holi  revelries, 
which  involve  villagewide  singing,  dancing,  and  joking.  People 
of  all  castes  within  a  village  address  each  other  by  kinship 
terms,  reflecting  the  fictive  kinship  relationships  recognized 
within  each  settlement.  In  the  north,  where  village  exogamy  is 
important,  the  concept  of  a  village  as  a  significant  unit  is  clear. 
When  the  all-male  groom's  party  arrives  from  another  village, 
residents  of  the  bride's  village  in  North  India  treat  the  visitors 
with  the  appropriate  behavior  due  to  them  as  bride-takers — 
men  greet  them  with  ostentatious  respect,  while  women  cover 
their  faces  and  sing  bawdy  songs  at  them.  A  woman  born  in  a 
village  is  known  as  a  daughter  of  the  village  while  an  in-married 
bride  is  considered  a  daughter-in-law  of  the  village.  In  her  con- 
jugal home  in  North  India,  a  bride  is  often  known  by  the  name 
of  her  natal  village;  for  example,  Sanchiwali  (woman  from  San- 
chi).  A  man  who  chooses  to  live  in  his  wife's  natal  village — usu- 
ally for  reasons  of  land  inheritance — is  known  by  the  name  of 
his  birth  village,  such  as  Sankheriwala  (man  from  Sankheri). 

Traditionally,  villages  often  recognized  a  headman  and  lis- 
tened with  respect  to  the  decisions  of  the  panchayat,  composed 
of  important  men  from  the  village's  major  castes,  who  had  the 
power  to  levy  fines  and  exclude  transgressors  from  village  social 
life.  Disputes  were  decided  within  the  village  precincts  as  much 
as  possible,  with  infrequent  recourse  to  the  police  or  court  sys- 
tem. In  present-day  India,  the  government  supports  an  elective 
panchayat  and  headman  system,  which  is  distinct  from  the  tradi- 
tional council  and  headman,  and,  in  many  instances,  even 


284 


Social  Systems 


includes  women  and  very  low-caste  members.  As  older  systems 
of  authority  are  challenged,  villagers  are  less  reluctant  to  take 
disputes  to  court. 

The  solidarity  of  a  village  is  always  riven  by  conflicts,  rivalries, 
and  factionalism.  Living  together  in  intensely  close  relation- 
ships over  generations,  struggling  to  wrest  a  livelihood  from 
the  same  limited  area  of  land  and  water  sources,  closely  watch- 
ing some  grow  fat  and  powerful  while  others  remain  weak  and 
dependent,  fellow  villagers  are  prone  to  disputes,  strategic  con- 
tests, and  even  violence.  Most  villages  include  what  villagers  call 
"big  fish,"  prosperous,  powerful  people,  fed  and  serviced 
through  the  labors  of  the  struggling  "little  fish."  Villagers  com- 
monly view  gains  as  possible  only  at  the  expense  of  neighbors. 
Further,  the  increased  involvement  of  villagers  with  the  wider 
economic  and  political  world  outside  the  village  via  travel, 
work,  education,  and  television;  expanding  government  influ- 
ence in  rural  areas;  and  increased  pressure  on  land  and 
resources  as  village  populations  grow  seem  to  have  resulted  in 
increased  factionalism  and  competitiveness  in  many  parts  of 
rural  India. 

Urban  Life 

The  Growth  of  Cities 

Accelerating  urbanization  is  powerfully  affecting  the  trans- 
formation of  Indian  society.  Slightly  more  than  26  percent  of 
the  country's  population  is  urban,  and  in  1991  more  than  half 
of  urban  dwellers  lived  in  299  urban  agglomerates  or  cities  of 
more  than  100,000  people.  By  1991  India  had  twenty-four  cities 
with  populations  of  at  least  1  million.  By  that  year,  among  cities 
of  the  world,  Bombay  (or  Mumbai,  in  Marathi),  in  Maharash- 
tra, ranked  seventh  in  the  world  at  12.6  million,  and  Calcutta, 
in  West  Bengal,  ranked  eighth  at  almost  11  million.  In  the 
1990s,  India's  larger  cities  have  been  growing  at  twice  the  rate 
of  smaller  towns  and  villages.  Between  the  1960s  and  1991,  the 
population  of  the  Union  Territory  of  Delhi  quadrupled,  to  8.4 
million,  and  Madras,  in  Tamil  Nadu,  grew  to  5.4  million.  Ban- 
galore, in  Karnataka;  Hyderabad,  in  Andhra  Pradesh;  and 
many  other  cities  are  expanding  rapidly.  About  half  of  these 
increases  are  the  result  of  rural-urban  migration,  as  villagers 
seek  better  lives  for  themselves  in  the  cities. 

Most  Indian  cities  are  very  densely  populated.  New  Delhi, 
for  example,  had  6,352  people  per  square  kilometer  in  1991.

India:  A  Country  Study 

Congestion,  noise,  traffic  jams,  air  pollution,  and  major  short- 
ages of  key  necessities  characterize  urban  life.  Every  major  city 
of  India  faces  the  same  proliferating  problems  of  grossly  inade- 
quate housing,  transportation,  sewerage,  electric  power,  water 
supplies,  schools,  and  hospitals.  Slums  and  jumbles  of  pave- 
ment dwellers'  lean-tos  constantly  multiply.  An  increasing  num- 
ber of  trucks,  buses,  cars,  three-wheel  autorickshaws,  motorcy- 
cles, and  motorscooters,  all  spewing  uncontrolled  fumes,  surge 
in  sometimes  haphazard  patterns  over  city  streets  jammed  with 
jaywalking  pedestrians,  cattle,  and  goats.  Accident  rates  are 
high  (India's  fatality  rate  from  road  accidents,  the  most  com- 
mon cause  of  accidental  death,  is  said  to  be  twenty  times  higher 
than  United  States  rates),  and  it  is  a  daily  occurrence  for  a  city 
dweller  to  witness  a  crash  or  the  running  down  of  a  pedestrian. 
In  1984  the  citizens  of  Bhopal  suffered  the  nightmare  of  India's 
largest  industrial  accident,  when  poisonous  gas  leaking  from  a 
Union  Carbide  plant  killed  and  injured  thousands  of  city  dwell- 
ers. Less  spectacularly,  on  a  daily  basis,  uncontrolled  pollutants 
from  factories  all  over  India  damage  the  urban  environments 
in  which  millions  live. 

Urban  Inequities 

Major  socioeconomic  differences  are  much  on  display  in  cit- 
ies. The  fine  homes — often  a  walled  compound  with  a  garden, 
servants'  quarters,  and  garage — and  gleaming  automobiles  of 
the  super  wealthy  stand  in  stark  contrast  to  the  burlap-covered 
huts  of  the  barefoot  poor.  Shops  filled  with  elegant  silk  saris 
and  air-conditioned  restaurants  cater  to  the  privileged,  while 
ragged  dust-covered  children  with  outstretched  hands  wait  out- 
side in  hopes  of  receiving  a  few  coins.  The  wealthy  and  the  mid- 
dle class  employ  servants  and  workers  of  various  kinds,  but 
jajmani-like  ties  are  essentially  lacking,  and  the  rich  and  the 
poor  live  much  more  separate  lives  than  in  villages.  At  the  same 
time,  casual  interaction  and  physical  contact  among  people  of 
all  castes  is  constant,  on  public  streets  and  in  buses,  trains,  and 
movie  theaters. 

As  would-be  urbanites  stream  into  the  cities,  they  often  seek 
out  people  from  their  village,  caste,  or  region  who  have  gone 
before  them  and  receive  enough  hospitality  to  tide  them  over 
until  they  can  settle  in  themselves.  They  find  accommodation 
wherever  they  can,  even  if  only  on  a  quiet  corner  of  a  sidewalk, 
or  inside  a  concrete  sewer  pipe  waiting  to  be  laid.  Some  are  for- 
tunate enough  to  find  shelter  in  decrepit  tenements  or  in  open 


286

areas  where  they  can  throw  up  flimsy  structures  of  mud,  tin 
sheeting,  or  burlap.  In  such  slum  settlements,  a  single  out- 
house may  be  shared  by  literally  thousands  of  people,  or,  more 
usually,  there  are  no  sanitary  facilities  at  all.  Ditches  are  awash 
in  raw  sewage,  and  byways  are  strewn  with  the  refuse  of  people 
and  animals  with  nowhere  else  to  go. 

Despite  the  exterior  appearance  of  chaos,  slum  life  is  highly 
structured,  with  many  economic,  religious,  caste,  and  political 
interests  expressed  in  daily  activity.  Living  conditions  are 
extremely  difficult,  and  slum  dwellers  fear  the  constant  threat 
of  having  their  homes  bulldozed  in  municipal  "slum  clearance" 
efforts;  nonetheless,  slum  life  is  animated  by  a  strong  sense  of 
joie  de  vivre. 

In  many  sections  of  Indian  cities,  scavenging  pigs,  often 
owned  by  Sweepers,  along  with  stray  dogs,  help  to  recycle  fecal 


287 


India:  A  Country  Study 


material.  Piles  of  less  noxious  vegetal  and  paper  garbage  are 
sorted  through  by  the  poorest  people,  who  seek  usable  or  sal- 
able bits  of  things.  Cattle  and  goats,  owned  by  entrepreneurial 
folk,  graze  on  these  piles,  turning  otherwise  useless  garbage 
into  valuable  milk,  dung  (used  for  cooking  fuel),  and  meat. 
These  domestic  animals  roam  even  in  neighborhoods  of  fine 
homes,  outside  the  compound  walls  that  protect  the  privileged 
and  their  gardener-tended  rose  bushes  from  needy  animals 
and  people. 

Finding  employment  in  the  urban  setting  can  be  extremely 
challenging,  and,  whenever  possible,  networks  of  relatives  and 
friends  are  used  to  help  seek  jobs.  Millions  of  Indians  are 
unemployed  or  underemployed.  Ingenuity  and  tenacity  are  the 
hallmarks  of  urban  workers,  who  carry  out  a  remarkable  multi- 
tude of  tasks  and  sell  an  incredible  variety  of  foods,  trinkets, 
and  services,  all  under  difficult  conditions.  Many  of  the  urban 
poor  are  migrant  laborers  carrying  headloads  of  bricks  and 
earth  up  rickety  bamboo  scaffolding  at  construction  sites,  while 
their  small  children  play  about  at  the  edge  of  excavations  or 
huddle  on  mounds  of  gravel  in  the  blazing  sun.  Nursing  moth- 
ers must  take  time  out  periodically  to  suckle  their  babies  at  the 
edge  of  construction  sites:  such  "recesses"  are  considered  rea- 
son to  pay  a  woman  less  for  a  day's  work  than  a  man  earns 
(male  construction  workers  earned  about  USS1  a  day  in  1994). 
Moreover,  women  are  seen  as  physically  weaker  by  some 
employers  and  thus  not  deserving  of  equal  wages  with  men. 

These  construction  projects  are  financed  by  governments 
and  by  business  enterprises,  which  are  run  by  cadres  of  well- 
educated,  healthy,  well-dressed  men  and,  increasingly,  women, 
who  occupy  positions  of  power  and  make  decisions  affecting 
many  people.  India's  major  cities  have  long  been  headquarters 
for  the  country's  highest  socioeconomic  groups,  people  with 
transnational  and  international  connections  whose  choices  are 
taking  India  into  new  realms  of  economic  development  and 
social  change.  Among  these  well-placed  people,  intercaste  mar- 
riages raise  few  eyebrows,  as  long  as  marital  unions  link  people 
of  similar  upper-  or  upper-middle-class  backgrounds.  Such 
marriages,  sometimes  even  across  religious  lines,  help  knit 
India's  most  powerful  people  together. 

Increasingly  conspicuous  in  India's  cities  are  the  growing 
ranks  of  the  middle  class.  In  carefully  laundered  clothes,  they 
emerge  from  modest  and  semiprosperous  homes  to  ride  buses 
and  motorscooters  to  their  jobs  in  offices,  hospitals,  courts,  and 


288

commercial  establishments.  Their  well-tended  children  are 
educated  in  properly  organized  schools.  Family  groups  go  out 
together  to  places  of  worship,  social  events,  snack  shops,  and  to 
bazaars  bustling  with  consumers  eager  to  buy  the  necessities  of 
a  comfortable  life.  Members  of  the  middle  class  cluster  around 
small  stock-market  outlets  in  cities  all  over  the  country.  Even  in 
Calcutta,  notorious  for  slums  and  street  dwellers,  the  dominant 
image  is  of  office  workers  in  pressed  white  garments  riding 
crowded  buses — or  Calcutta's  world-class  subway  line — to  their 
jobs  as  office  workers  and  professionals  (see  Transportation, 
ch.  6). 

For  nearly  everyone  within  the  highly  challenging  urban 
environment,  ties  to  family  and  kin  remain  crucial  to  prosper- 
ity. Even  in  the  harshest  urban  conditions,  families  show 
remarkable  resilience.  Neighborhoods,  too,  take  on  impor- 


289 


India:  A  Country  Stud\ 

tance.  and  neighbors  from  various  backgrounds  develop  coop- 
erative ties  with  one  another.  Neighborhood  solidarity  is 
expressed  at  such  annual  Hindu  festivals  as  Ganesh's  Birthdav 
(Ganesh  Chaturthi)  in  Bombay  and  Durga  Puja  in  Calcutta, 
when  neighborhood  associations  create  elaborate  images  of 
the  deities  and  take  them  out  in  grand  processions. 

Cities  as  Centers 

Cosmopolitan  cities  are  the  great  hubs  of  commerce  and 
government  upon  which  the  nation's  functioning  depends. 
Bombay.  India's  largest  citv  and  port.,  is  India's  economic  pow- 
erhouse and  locus  of  the  nation's  atomic  research.  The 
National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi,  where  a  series  of  seven  cit- 
ies was  built  over  centuries,  is  the  site  of  the  capital — New 
Delhi — and  political  nerve  center  of  the  world's  largest  democ- 
racy. Calcutta  and  Madras  fill  major  roles  in  the  country's  eco- 
nomic life,  as  do  high-tech  Bangalore  and  Ahmadabad  (in 
Gujarat  )  ,  famous  for  textiles.  Great  markets  in  foods.,  manufac- 
tured goods,  and  a  host  of  kev  commodities  are  centered  in 
urban  trading  and  distribution  points.  Most  eminent  institu- 
tions of  higher  learning,  cradles  of  intellectual  development 
and  scientific  investigation.,  are  situated  in  cities.  The  visual 
arts,  music,  classical  dancing,  poetrv.  and  literature  all  flourish 
in  the  urban  setting.  Critical  political  and  social  commentary 
appears  in  urban  newspapers  and  periodicals.  Creative  new 
trends  in  architecture  and  design  are  conceptualized  and 
brought  to  reality  in  cities. 

Cities  are  the  source  of  television  broadcasts  and  those  great 
favorites  of  the  Indian  public,  movies.  Bombay,  sometimes 
called  "Bollvwood."  and  Madras  are  major  centers  of  film  pro- 
duction, bringing  depictions  of  urban  lifestyles  before  the  eves 
of  small-town  dwellers  and  villagers  all  over  the  nation.  With 
the  continuing  national  proliferation  of  television  sets,  video- 
cassette  recorders,  and  movie  videocassettes.  the  influence  of 
such  productions  should  not  be  underestimated. 

Social  revolutions,  too,  receive  the  support  of  urban  visionar- 
ies. Among  the  more  important  social  developments  in  con- 
temporary India  is  the  growing  women's  movement,  largely  led 
bv  educated  urban  women.  Seeking  to  restructure  society  and 
gender  relations,  activists,  scholars,  and  workers  in  the 
women's  movement  have  come  together  in  numerous  loosely 
allied  and  highly  diverse  organizations  focusing  on  issues  of 
rights  and  equality,  empowerment,  and  justice  for  women.

Some  of  these  groups  exist  in  rural  areas,  but  most  are  city 
based. 

The  escalating  issues  of  dowry-related  murder  and  suicide 
are  most  pressing  in  New  Delhi,  where  groups  such  as  Saheli 
(Woman  Friend)  provide  essential  support  to  troubled  women. 
The  pathbreaking  feminist  publication  Manushi  is  published  in 
New  Delhi  and  distributed  throughout  the  country.  The  over- 
whelming economic  needs  of  self-employed  poor  female  work- 
ers in  Ahmadabad  inspired  Ela  Bhatt  and  her  coworkers  in  the 
Self-Employed  Women's  Association,  which  has  been  highly 
successful  in  helping  poor  women  improve  their  own  lives. 

Urban  women  have  initiated  protests  challenging  female 
feticide,  child  marriage,  child  prostitution,  domestic  violence, 
polygyny,  sati,  sexual  harassment,  police  rape  of  female  plain- 
tiffs, and  other  gender-related  injustices.  Their  efforts  have 
brought  new  ways  of  thinking  out  of  elite,  educated  circles  into 
the  broader  public  arena  of  India's  multilevel  society. 

In  1994,  two  attractive  urban  Indian  women  won  the  most 
prominent  international  beauty  contests,  the  Miss  Universe 
and  the  Miss  World  competitions.  Thousands  of  young  Indian 
women  idolized  the  glamorous  beauties  and  many  newspapers 
gushed  about  the  victories,  but  women's  groups  and  feminist 
commentators  decried  this  adulation.  They  pointed  out  that 
the  deprivations  and  injustices  experienced  by  a  high  propor- 
tion of  Indian  women  were  being  given  short  shrift.  While  the 
beauty  contest  winners  were  being  paraded  about  in  crowns 
and  white  chariots  before  admiring  throngs,  almost  ignored  by 
the  public  and  the  media  were  the  torture-slaying  of  a  village

woman  accused  of  theft  bv  a  soothsayer  and  the  historic  qualifi- 
cation of  six  women  as  the  Indian  air  force's  first  female  pilots 
(see  The  Air  Force,  ch.  10).  In  1995.  the  All  India  Democratic 
Women's  Association  and  other  groups  protested  in  New  Delhi 
against  the  Miss  India  contest. 

Future  Trends 

Bv  the  twenty-first  century,  India's  population  will  be  more 
than  1  billion.  Approximately  one-third  of  this  enormous  pop- 
ulation will  live  in  urban  areas,  which  means  adding  the  popu- 
lation of  another  Calcutta..  Bombay,  or  Madras  to  India's 
already  overburdened  cities  each  vear  into  the  foreseeable 
future.  In  rural  areas,  pressures  on  land  and  other  resources 
will  continue  to  intensify. 

In  India's  democracy  ideas  are  often  vociferously  expressed, 
and  members  of  different  groups  are  increasingly  demanding 
what  thev  consider  a  fair  share  of  resources  and  benefits.  Toler- 
ance for  inequity  is  diminishing  among  the  less  privileged, 
even  as  inequitv  is  increasing  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  As 
competition  for  scarce  resources  and  benefits  grows,,  some 
political  leaders  have  been  encouraging  the  populace  to  blame 
these  problems  on  religious  differences. 

Prosperity  is  available  to  many  and  access  to  education  and 
an  expanding  range  of  consumer  goods  is  possible  for  an  ever- 
increasing  number  of  people.  At  the  same  time,  the  sheer  num- 
bers of  the  poor  and  less  privileged  are  increasing  as  thev  are 
left  behind,  inadequately  educated,  and  forced  bv  circum- 
stance to  labor  under  insecure  conditions.  Class  and  gender 
justice,  widelv  sought  bv  a  significant  number  of  people, 
remains  an  elusive  goal. 

India  is  part  of  a  much  wider  community  of  nations  facing 
these  and  other  problems,  so  it  will  not  be  alone  in  seeking 
solutions.  In  this  endeavor,  the  great  structural  principles  of 
hierarchy  and  interdependence  that  have  held  Indian  society 
together  over  the  millennia  will  be  brought  to  the  fore.  Creat- 
ing  manageable  order  from  complexity,  bringing  together 
widely  disparate  groups  in  structured  efforts  to  benefit  the 
wider  society,  encouraging  harmony  among  people  with  diver- 
gent interests.,  knowing  that  close  family  and  friends  can  rely 
on  each  other  in  times  of  stress,  allocating  different  tasks  to 
those  with  different  skills,  and  striving  to  do  what  is  morallv 
right  in  the  eves  of  the  divine  and  the  human  community — 


292 


Social  Systems 


these  are  some  of  the  great  strengths  upon  which  Indian  soci- 
ety can  rely  as  it  meets  the  challenges  of  the  future.

Chapter  6.  Character  and  Structure  of  the 

Economy 


A  traditional-style  printer  using  a  wood  block  to  print  designs  on  fabric 


INDIA'S  ECONOMY  HAS  MADE  great  strides  in  the  years 
since  independence.  In  1947  the  country  was  poor  and  shat- 
tered by  the  violence  and  economic  and  physical  disruption 
involved  in  the  partition  from  Pakistan.  The  economy  had  stag- 
nated since  the  late  nineteenth  century  and  industrial  devel- 
opment had  been  restrained  to  preserve  the  area  as  a  market 
for  British  manufacturers.  In  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary) 
1950,  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  accounted  for  58.9  per- 
cent of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  and 
for  a  much  larger  proportion  of  employment.  Manufacturing, 
which  was  dominated  by  the  jute  and  cotton  textile  industries, 
accounted  for  only  10.3  percent  of  GDP  at  that  time. 

India's  new  leaders  sought  to  use  the  power  of  the  state  to 
direct  economic  growth  and  reduce  widespread  poverty.  The 
public  sector  came  to  dominate  heavy  industry,  transportation, 
and  telecommunications.  The  private  sector  produced  most 
consumer  goods  but  was  controlled  directly  by  a  variety  of  gov- 
ernment regulations  and  financial  institutions  that  provided 
major  financing  for  large  private-sector  projects.  Government 
emphasized  self-sufficiency  rather  than  foreign  trade  and 
imposed  strict  controls  on  imports  and  exports.  In  the  1950s, 
there  was  steady  economic  growth,  but  results  in  the  1960s  and 
1970s  were  less  encouraging. 

Beginning  in  the  late  1970s,  successive  Indian  governments 
sought  to  reduce  state  control  of  the  economy.  Progress  toward 
that  goal  was  slow  but  steady,  and  many  analysts  attributed  the 
stronger  growth  of  the  1980s  to  those  efforts.  In  the  late  1980s, 
however,  India  relied  on  foreign  borrowing  to  finance  develop- 
ment plans  to  a  greater  extent  than  before.  As  a  result,  when 
the  price  of  oil  rose  sharply  in  August  1990,  the  nation  faced  a 
balance  of  payments  crisis.  The  need  for  emergency  loans  led 
the  government  to  make  a  greater  commitment  to  economic 
liberalization  than  it  had  up  to  this  time.  In  the  early  1990s, 
India's  postindependence  development  pattern  of  strong  cen- 
tralized planning,  regulation  and  control  of  private  enterprise, 
state  ownership  of  many  large  units  of  production,  trade  pro- 
tectionism, and  strict  limits  on  foreign  capital  was  increasingly 
questioned  not  only  by  policy  makers  but  also  by  most  of  the 
intelligentsia.

India:  A  Country  Study 

As  India  moved  into  the  mid-1990s,  the  economic  outlook 
was  mixed.  Most  analysts  believed  that  economic  liberalization 
would  continue,  although  there  was  disagreement  about  the 
speed  and  scale  of  the  measures  that  would  be  implemented.  It 
seemed  likely  that  India  would  come  close  to  or  equal  the  rela- 
tively impressive  rate  of  economic  growth  attained  in  the  1980s, 
but  that  the  poorest  sections  of  the  population  might  not  bene- 
fit. 

Structure  of  the  Economy 

Independence  to  1979 

At  independence  the  economy  was  predominantly  agrarian. 
Most  of  the  population  was  employed  in  agriculture,  and  most 
of  those  people  were  very  poor,  existing  by  cropping  their  own 
small  plots  or  supplying  labor  to  other  farms.  Landownership, 
land  rental,  and  sharecropping  rights  were  complex,  involving 
layers  of  intermediaries  (see  Land  Use,  ch.  7).  Moreover,  the 
structural  economic  problems  inherited  at  independence  were 
exacerbated  by  the  costs  associated  with  the  partition  of  British 
India,  which  had  resulted  in  about  12  million  to  14  million  ref- 
ugees fleeing  past  each  other  across  the  new  borders  between 
India  and  Pakistan  (see  National  Integration,  ch.  1).  The  settle- 
ment of  refugees  was  a  considerable  financial  strain.  Partition 
also  divided  complementary  economic  zones.  Under  the  Brit- 
ish, jute  and  cotton  were  grown  in  the  eastern  part  of  Bengal, 
the  area  that  became  East  Pakistan  (after  1971,  Bangladesh), 
but  processing  took  place  mostly  in  the  western  part  of  Bengal, 
which  became  the  Indian  state  of  West  Bengal  in  1947.  As  a 
result,  after  independence  India  had  to  employ  land  previously 
used  for  food  production  to  cultivate  cotton  and  jute  for  its 
mills. 

India's  leaders — especially  the  first  prime  minister,  Jawahar- 
lal  Nehru,  who  introduced  the  five-year  plans — agreed  that 
strong  economic  growth  and  measures  to  increase  incomes 
and  consumption  among  the  poorest  groups  were  necessary 
goals  for  the  new  nation.  Government  was  assigned  an  impor- 
tant role  in  this  process,  and  since  1951  a  series  of  plans  have 
guided  the  country's  economic  development.  Although  there 
was  considerable  growth  in  the  1950s,  the  long-term  rates  of 
growth  were  less  positive  than  India's  politicians  desired  and 
less  than  those  of  many  other  Asian  countries.  From  FY  1951  to 
FY  1979,  the  economy  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  about  3.1  per- 


298 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

cent  a  year  in  constant  prices,  or  at  an  annual  rate  of  1.0  per- 
cent per  capita  (see  table  16,  Appendix).  During  this  period, 
industry  grew  at  an  average  rate  of  4.5  percent  a  year,  com- 
pared with  an  annual  average  of  3.0  percent  for  agriculture. 
Many  factors  contributed  to  the  slowdown  of  the  economy  after 
the  mid-1960s,  but  economists  differ  over  the  relative  impor- 
tance of  those  factors.  Structural  deficiencies,  such  as  the  need 
for  institutional  changes  in  agriculture  and  the  inefficiency  of 
much  of  the  industrial  sector,  also  contributed  to  economic 
stagnation.  Wars  with  China  in  1962  and  with  Pakistan  in  1965 
and  1971;  a  flood  of  refugees  from  East  Pakistan  in  1971; 
droughts  in  1965,  1966,  1971,  and  1972;  currency  devaluation 
in  1966;  and  the  first  world  oil  crisis,  in  1973-74,  all  jolted  the 
economy. 

Growth  since  1980 

The  rate  of  growth  improved  in  the  1980s.  From  FY  1980  to 
FY  1989,  the  economy  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  5.5  percent,  or 
3.3  percent  on  a  per  capita  basis.  Industry  grew  at  an  annual 
rate  of  6.6  percent  and  agriculture  at  a  rate  of  3.6  percent.  A 
high  rate  of  investment  was  a  major  factor  in  improved  eco- 
nomic growth.  Investment  went  from  about  19  percent  of  GDP 
in  the  early  1970s  to  nearly  25  percent  in  the  early  1980s.  India, 
however,  required  a  higher  rate  of  investment  to  attain  compa- 
rable economic  growth  than  did  most  other  low-income  devel- 
oping countries,  indicating  a  lower  rate  of  return  on 
investments.  Part  of  the  adverse  Indian  experience  was 
explained  by  investment  in  large,  long-gestating,  capital-inten- 
sive projects,  such  as  electric  power,  irrigation,  and  infrastruc- 
ture. However,  delayed  completions,  cost  overruns,  and  under- 
use  of  capacity  were  contributing  factors. 

Private  savings  financed  most  of  India's  investment,  but  by 
the  mid-1980s  further  growth  in  private  savings  was  difficult 
because  they  were  already  at  quite  a  high  level.  As  a  result,  dur- 
ing the  late  1980s  India  relied  increasingly  on  borrowing  from 
foreign  sources  (see  Aid,  this  ch.).  This  trend  led  to  a  balance 
of  payments  crisis  in  1990;  in  order  to  receive  new  loans,  the 
government  had  no  choice  but  to  agree  to  further  measures  of 
economic  liberalization.  This  commitment  to  economic 
reform  was  reaffirmed  by  the  government  that  came  to  power 
in  June  1991. 

India's  primary  sector,  including  agriculture,  forestry,  fish- 
ing, mining,  and  quarrying,  accounted  for  32.8  percent  of  GDP 


299 


India:  A  Counts  Stud\ 


in  FY  1991  (see  table  17,  Appendix).  The  size  of  the  agricul- 
tural sector  and  its  vulnerability  to  the  vagaries  of  the  monsoon 
cause  relativelv  large  fluctuations  in  the  sector's  contribution  to 
GDP  from  one  vear  to  another  (see  Crop  Output,  ch.  7). 

In  FY  1991.  the  contribution  to  GDP  of  industry,  including 
manufacturing,  construction,  and  utilities,  was  27.4  percent; 
services,  including  trade,  transportation,  communications,  real 
estate  and  finance,  and  public-  and  private-sector  services,  con- 
tributed 39. S  percent.  The  steadv  increase  in  the  proportion  of 
services  in  the  national  economv  reflects  increased 
market-determined  processes,  such  as  the  spread  of  rural  bank- 
ing, and  government  activities,  such  as  defense  spending  (see 
Agricultural  Credit,  ch.  7;  Defense  Spending,  ch.  10). 

Despite  a  sometimes  disappointing  rate  of  growth,  the 
Indian  economv  was  transformed  between  1947  and  the  early 
1990s.  The  number  of  kilowatt-hours  of  electricitv  generated, 
for  example,  increased  more  than  fiftvfold.  Steel  production 
rose  from  1.5  million  tons  a  vear  to  14.7  million  tons  a  year. 
The  countrv  produced  space  satellites  and  nuclear-power 
plants,  and  its  scientists  and  engineers  produced  an  atomic 
explosive  device  (see  Major  Research  Organizations,  this  ch.; 
Space  and  Nuclear  Programs,  ch.  10).  Tife  expectancy 
increased  from  twenty-seven  years  to  fifty-nine  years.  .Although 
the  population  increased  by  485  million  between  1951  and 
1991,  the  availability  of  food  grains  per  capita  rose  from  395 
grams  per  dav  in  FY  1950  to  466  grams  in  FY  1992  (see  Struc- 
ture and  Dynamics,  ch.  2). 

However,  considerable  dualism  remains  in  the  Indian  econ- 
omv. Officials  and  economists  make  an  important  distinction 
between  the  formal  and  informal  sectors  of  the  economv.  The 
informal,  or  unorganized,  economv  is  largely  rural  and  encom- 
passes  farming,  fishing,  forestry  and  cottage  industries.  It  also 
includes  petty  vendors  and  some  small-scale  mechanized  indus- 
trv in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  bulk  of  the  population  is 
employed  in  the  informal  economv.  which  contributes  more 
than  50  percent  of  GDP.  The  formal  economv  consists  of  large 
units  in  the  modern  sector  for  which  statistical  data  are  rela- 
tively crood.  The  modern  sector  includes  lar^e-scale  manufac- 
turing  and  mining,  major  financial  and  commercial  businesses, 
and  such  public-sector  enterprises  as  railroads,  telecommunica- 
tions, utilities,  and  government  itself. 

The  greatest  disappointment  of  economic  development  is 
the  failure  to  reduce  more  substantially  India's  widespread  pov-

erty.  Studies  have  suggested  that  income  distribution  changed 
little  between  independence  and  the  early  1990s,  although  it  is 
possible  that  the  poorer  half  of  the  population  improved  its 
position  slightly  Official  estimates  of  the  proportion  of  the 
population  that  lives  below  the  poverty  line  tend  to  vary  sharply 
from  year  to  year  because  adverse  economic  conditions,  espe- 
cially rises  in  food  prices,  are  capable  of  lowering  the  standard 
of  living  of  many  families  who  normally  live  just  above  the  sub- 
sistence level.  The  Indian  government's  poverty  line  is  based 
on  an  income  sufficient  to  ensure  access  to  minimum  nutri- 
tional standards,  and  even  most  persons  above  the  poverty  line 
have  low  levels  of  consumption  compared  with  much  of  the 
world. 

Estimates  in  the  late  1970s  put  the  number  of  people  who 
lived  in  poverty  at  300  million,  or  nearly  50  percent  of  the  pop- 
ulation at  the  time.  Poverty  was  reduced  during  the  1980s,  and 
in  FY  1989  it  was  estimated  that  about  26  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion, or  220  million  people,  lived  below  the  poverty  line.  Slower 
economic  growth  and  higher  inflation  in  FY  1990  and  FY  1991 
reversed  this  trend.  In  FY  1991,  it  was  estimated  that  332  mil- 
lion people,  or  38  percent  of  the  population,  lived  below  the 
poverty  line. 

Farmers  and  other  rural  residents  make  up  the  large  major- 
ity of  India's  poor.  Some  own  very  small  amounts  of  land  while 
others  are  field  hands,  seminomadic  shepherds,  or  migrant 
workers.  The  urban  poor  include  many  construction  workers 
and  petty  vendors.  The  bulk  of  the  poor  work,  but  low  produc- 
tivity and  intermittent  employment  keep  incomes  low.  Poverty 
is  most  prevalent  in  the  states  of  Orissa,  Bihar,  Uttar  Pradesh, 
and  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  least  prevalent  in  Haryana,  Punjab, 
Himachal  Pradesh,  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir. 

By  the  early  1990s,  economic  changes  led  to  the  growth  in 
the  number  of  Indians  with  significant  economic  resources. 
About  10  million  Indians  are  considered  upper  class,  and 
roughly  300  million  are  part  of  the  rapidly  increasing  middle 
class.  Typical  middle-class  occupations  include  owning  a  small 
business  or  being  a  corporate  executive,  lawyer,  physician, 
white-collar  worker,  or  land-owning  farmer.  In  the  1980s,  the 
growth  of  the  middle  class  was  reflected  in  the  increased  con- 
sumption of  consumer  durables,  such  as  televisions,  refrigera- 
tors, motorcycles,  and  automobiles.  In  the  early  1990s, 
domestic  and  foreign  businesses  hoped  to  take  advantage  of 


301

India  s  economic  liberalization  to  increase  the  range  of  con- 
sumer  products  ottered  to  this  market. 

Housing  and  the  ancillarv  utilities  of  sewer  and  water  sys- 
tems lag  considerably  behind  the  population's  needs.  India's 
cities  have  large  shantvtowns  built  of  scrap  or  readilv  available 
natural  materials  erected  on  whatever  space  is  available,  includ- 
ing; sidewalks.  Such  dwellings  lack  piped  water,  sewerage,  and 
electricity.  The  government  has  attempted  to  build  housing 
facilities  and  utilities  for  urban  development,  but  the  efforts 
have  fallen  far  short  of  demand.  Administrative  controls  and 
other  aspects  of  government  polio'  have  discouraged  many  pri- 
vate investors  from  constructing  housing  units. 

Liberalization  in  the  Ear l\  1  990s 

Increased  borrowing  from  foreign  sources  in  the  late  1950s, 
which  helped  fuel  economic  growth,  led  to  pressure  on  the  bal- 
ance of  payments.  The  problem  came  to  a  head  in  August  1990 
when  Iraq  invaded  Kuwait,  and  the  price  of  oil  soon  doubled. 
In  addition,  many  Indian  workers  resident  in  Persian  Gulf 
states  either  lost  their  jobs  or  returned  home  out  of  fear  for 
their  safer.",  thus  reducing  the  flow  of  remittances  isee  Size  and 
Composition  of  the  Work  Force,  this  ch.).  The  direct  economic 
impact  of  the  Persian  Gulf  conflict  was  exacerbated  by  domes- 
tic  social  and  political  developments.  In  the  earlv  1990s,  there 
was  violence  over  two  domestic  issues:  the  reservation  of  a  pro- 
portion of  public-sector  jobs  for  members  of  Scheduled  Castes 
see  Glossary)  and  the  Hindu-Muslim  conflict  at  Ayodhya  (see 
Public  Worship,  ch.  5;  Political  Issues,  ch.  S>.  The  central  gov- 
ernment fell  in  November  1990  and  was  succeeded  by  a  minor- 
ity government.  The  cumulative  impact  of  these  events  shook 
international  confidence  in  India's  economic  viability,  and  the 
country  found  it  increasingly  difficult  to  borrow  internation- 
ally As  a  result.  India  made  various  agreements  with  the  Inter- 
national Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  and  other 
organizations  that  included  commitments  to  speed  up  liberal- 
ization (see  United  Nations,  ch.  9). 

In  the  early  1990s,  considerable  progress  was  made  in  loos- 
ening government  regulations,  especially  in  the  area  of  foreign 
trade.  Mam"  restrictions  on  private  companies  were  lifted,  and 
new  areas  were  opened  to  private  capital.  However,  India 
remains  one  of  the  world  s  most  tight.lv  regulated  major  econo- 
mies. Manv  powerful  vested  interests,  including  private  firms 
that  have  benefited  from  protectionism,  labor  unions,  and

much  of  the  bureaucracy,  oppose  liberalization.  There  is  also 
considerable  concern  that  liberalization  will  reinforce  class  and 
regional  economic  disparities. 

The  balance  of  payments  crisis  of  1990  and  subsequent  pol- 
icy changes  led  to  a  temporary  decline  in  the  GDP  growth  rate, 
which  fell  from  6.9  percent  in  FY  1989  to  4.9  percent  in  FY  1990 
to  1.1  percent  in  FY  1991.  In  March  1995,  the  estimated  growth 
rate  for  FY  1994  was  5.3  percent.  Inflation  peaked  at  17  percent 
in  FY  1991,  fell  to  9.5  percent  in  FY  1993,  and  then  accelerated 
again,  reaching  11  percent  in  late  FY  1994.  This  increase  was 
attributed  to  a  sharp  increase  in  prices  and  a  shortfall  in  such 
critical  sectors  as  sugar,  cotton,  and  oilseeds.  Many  analysts 
agree  that  the  poor  suffer  most  from  the  increased  inflation 
rate  and  reduced  growth  rate.

India:  A  Country  Study 


The  Role  of  Government 

Early  Policy  Developments 

Many  early  postindependence  leaders,  such  as  Nehru,  were 
influenced  by  socialist  ideas  and  advocated  government  inter- 
vention to  guide  the  economy,  including  state  ownership  of  key 
industries.  The  objective  was  to  achieve  high  and  balanced  eco- 
nomic development  in  the  general  interest  while  particular 
programs  and  measures  helped  the  poor.  India's  leaders  also 
believed  that  industrialization  was  the  key  to  economic  devel- 
opment. This  belief  was  all  the  more  convincing  in  India 
because  of  the  country's  large  size,  substantial  natural 
resources,  and  desire  to  develop  its  own  defense  industries. 

The  Industrial  Policy  Resolution  of  1948  gave  government  a 
monopoly  in  armaments,  atomic  energy,  and  railroads,  and 
exclusive  rights  to  develop  minerals,  the  iron  and  steel  indus- 
tries, aircraft  manufacturing,  shipbuilding,  and  manufacturing 
of  telephone  and  telegraph  equipment.  Private  companies 
operating  in  those  fields  were  guaranteed  at  least  ten  years 
more  of  ownership  before  the  government  could  take  them 
over.  Some  still  operate  as  private  companies. 

The  Industrial  Policy  Resolution  of  1956  greatly  extended 
the  preserve  of  government.  There  were  seventeen  industries 
exclusively  in  the  public  sector.  The  government  took  the  lead 
in  another  twelve  industries,  but  private  companies  could  also 
engage  in  production.  This  resolution  covered  industries  pro- 
ducing capital  and  intermediate  goods.  As  a  result,  the  private 
sector  was  relegated  primarily  to  production  of  consumer 
goods.  The  public  sector  also  expanded  into  more  services.  In 
1956  the  life  insurance  business  was  nationalized,  and  in  1973 
the  general  insurance  business  was  also  acquired  by  the  public 
sector.  Most  large  commercial  banks  were  nationalized  in  1969. 
Over  the  years,  the  central  and  state  governments  formed 
agencies,  and  companies  engaged  in  finance,  trading,  mineral 
exploitation,  manufacturing,  utilities,  and  transportation.  The 
public  sector  was  extensive  and  influential  throughout  the 
economy,  although  the  value  of  its  assets  was  small  relative  to 
the  private  sector. 

Controls  over  prices,  production,  and  the  use  of  foreign 
exchange,  which  were  imposed  by  the  British  during  World 
War  II,  were  reinstated  soon  after  independence.  The  Indus- 
tries (Development  and  Regulation)  Act  of  1951  and  the  Essen- 
tial Commodities  Act  of  1955  (with  subsequent  additions) 


304 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

provided  the  legal  framework  for  the  government  to  extend 
price  controls  that  eventually  included  steel,  cement,  drugs, 
nonferrous  metals,  chemicals,  fertilizer,  coal,  automobiles,  tires 
and  tubes,  cotton  textiles,  food  grains,  bread,  butter,  vegetable 
oils,  and  other  commodities.  By  the  late  1950s,  controls  were 
pervasive,  regulating  investment  in  industry,  prices  of  many 
commodities,  imports  and  exports,  and  the  flow  of  foreign 
exchange. 

Export  growth  was  long  ignored.  The  government's  exten- 
sive controls  and  pervasive  licensing  requirements  created 
imbalances  and  structural  problems  in  many  parts  of  the  econ- 
omy. Controls  were  usually  imposed  to  correct  specific  prob- 
lems but  often  without  adequate  consideration  of  their  effect 
on  other  parts  of  the  economy.  For  example,  the  government 
set  low  prices  for  basic  foods,  transportation,  and  other  com- 
modities and  services,  a  policy  designed  to  protect  the  living 
standards  of  the  poor.  However,  the  policy  proved  counterpro- 
ductive when  the  government  also  limited  the  output  of 
needed  goods  and  services.  Price  ceilings  were  implemented 
during  shortages,  but  the  ceiling  frequently  contributed  to 
black  markets  in  those  commodities  and  to  tax  evasion  by 
black-market  participants.  Import  controls  and  tariff  policy 
stimulated  local  manufacturers  toward  production  of  import- 
substitution  goods,  but  under  conditions  devoid  of  sufficient 
competition  or  pressure  to  be  efficient. 

Private  trading  and  industrial  conglomerates  (the  so-called 
large  houses)  existed  under  the  British  and  continued  after 
independence.  The  government  viewed  the  conglomerates 
with  suspicion,  believing  that  they  often  manipulated  markets 
and  prices  for  their  own  profit.  After  independence  the  gov- 
ernment instituted  licensing  controls  on  new  businesses,  espe- 
cially in  manufacturing,  and  on  expanding  capacity  in  existing 
businesses.  In  the  1960s,  when  shortages  of  goods  were  exten- 
sive, considerable  criticism  was  leveled  at  traders  for  manipulat- 
ing markets  and  prices.  The  result  was  the  1970  Monopolies 
and  Restrictive  Practices  Act,  which  was  designed  to  provide 
the  government  with  additional  information  on  the  structure 
and  investments  of  all  firms  that  had  assets  of  more  than  Rs200 
million  (for  value  of  the  rupee — see  Glossary),  to  strengthen 
the  licensing  system  in  order  to  decrease  the  concentration  of 
private  economic  power,  and  to  place  restraints  on  certain  busi- 
ness practices  considered  contrary  to  the  public  interest.  The 
act  emphasized  the  government's  aversion  to  large  companies 


305 


India:  A  Country  Study 


in  the  private  sector,  but  critics  contended  that  the  act  resulted 
from  political  motives  and  not  from  a  strong  case  against  big 
firms.  The  act  and  subsequent  enforcement  restrained  private 
investment. 

The  extensive  controls,  the  large  public  sector,  and  the  many 
government  programs  contributed  to  a  substantial  growth  in 
the  administrative  structure  of  government.  The  government 
also  sought  to  take  on  many  of  the  unemployed.  The  result  was 
a  swollen,  inefficient  bureaucracy  that  took  inordinate 
amounts  of  time  to  process  applications  and  forms.  Business 
leaders  complained  that  they  spent  more  time  getting  govern- 
ment approval  than  running  their  companies.  Many  observers 
also  reported  extensive  corruption  in  the  huge  bureaucracy. 
One  consequence  was  the  development  of  a  large  under- 
ground economy  in  small-scale  enterprises  and  the  services  sec- 
tor. 

India's  current  economic  reforms  began  in  1985  when  the 
government  abolished  some  of  its  licensing  regulations  and 
other  competition-inhibiting  controls.  Since  1991  more  "new 
economic  policies"  or  reforms  have  been  introduced.  Reforms 
include  currency  devaluations  and  making  currency  partially 
convertible,  reduced  quantitative  restrictions  on  imports, 
reduced  import  duties  on  capital  goods,  decreases  in  subsidies, 
liberalized  interest  rates,  abolition  of  licenses  for  most  indus- 
tries, the  sale  of  shares  in  selected  public  enterprises,  and  tax 
reforms.  Although  many  observers  welcomed  these  changes 
and  attributed  the  faster  growth  rate  of  the  economy  in  the  late 
1980s  to  them,  others  feared  that  these  changes  would  create 
more  problems  than  they  solved.  The  growing  dependence  of 
the  economy  on  imports,  greater  vulnerability  of  its  balance  of 
payments,  reliance  on  debt,  and  the  consequent  susceptibility 
to  outside  pressures  on  economic  poliq7  directions  caused  con- 
cern. The  increase  in  consumerism  and  the  display  of  conspic- 
uous wealth  by  the  elite  exacerbated  these  fears. 

The  pace  of  liberalization  increased  after  1991.  By  the  mid- 
1990s,  the  number  of  sectors  reserved  for  public  ownership  was 
slashed,  and  private-sector  investment  was  encouraged  in  areas 
such  as  energy,  steel,  oil  refining  and  exploration,  road  build- 
ing, air  transportation,  and  telecommunications.  An  area  still 
closed  to  the  private  sector  in  the  mid-1990s  was  defense  indus- 
try. Foreign-exchange  regulations  were  liberalized,  foreign 
investment  was  encouraged,  and  import  regulations  were  sim- 
plified. The  average  import-weighted  tariff  was  reduced  from 


306 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

87  percent  in  FY  1991  to  33  percent  in  FY  1994.  Despite  these 
changes,  the  economy  remained  highly  regulated  by  interna- 
tional standards.  The  import  of  many  consumer  goods  was 
banned,  and  the  production  of  838  items,  mostly  consumer 
goods,  was  reserved  for  companies  with  total  investment  of  less 
than  Rs6  million.  Although  the  government  had  sold  off 
minority  stakes  in  public-sector  companies,  it  had  not  in  1995 
given  up  control  of  any  enterprises,  nor  had  any  of  the  loss- 
making  public  companies  been  closed  down.  Moreover, 
although  import  duties  had  been  lowered  substantially,  they 
were  still  high  compared  to  most  other  countries. 

Political  successes  in  the  mid-1990s  by  nationalist-oriented 
political  parties  led  to  some  backlash  against  foreign  invest- 
ment in  some  parts  of  India  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8).  In 
early  1995,  official  charges  of  serving  adulterated  products 
were  made  against  a  KFC  outlet  in  Bangalore,  and  Pepsi-Cola 
products  were  smashed  and  advertisements  defaced  in  New 
Delhi.  The  most  serious  backlash  occurred  in  Maharashtra  in 
August  1995  when  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP — Indian 
People's  Party)-led  state  government  halted  construction  of  a 
US$2.8  million  2,015-megawatt  gas-fired  electric-power  plant 
being  built  near  Bombay  (Mumbai  in  the  Marathi  language)  by 
another  United  States  company,  Enron  Corporation. 

Antipoverty  Programs 

The  government  has  initiated,  sustained,  and  refined  many 
programs  since  independence  to  help  the  poor  attain  self  suffi- 
ciency in  food  production.  Probably  the  most  important  initia- 
tive has  been  the  supply  of  basic  commodities,  particularly  food 
at  controlled  prices,  available  throughout  the  country.  The 
poor  spend  about  80  percent  of  their  income  on  food  while  the 
rest  of  the  population  spends  more  than  60  percent.  The  price 
of  food  is  a  major  determinant  of  wage  scales.  Often  when  food 
prices  rise  sharply,  rioting  and  looting  follow.  Until  the  late 
1970s,  the  government  frequently  had  difficulty  obtaining  ade- 
quate grain  supplies  in  years  of  poor  harvests.  During  those 
times,  states  with  surpluses  of  grain  were  cordoned  off  to  force 
partial  sales  to  public  agencies  and  to  keep  private  traders  from 
shipping  grain  to  deficit  areas  to  secure  very  high  prices;  state 
governments  in  surplus-grain  areas  were  often  less  than  coop- 
erative. After  the  late  1970s,  the  central  government,  by  hold- 
ing reserve  stocks  and  importing  grain  adequately  and  early, 
maintained  sufficient  supplies  to  meet  the  increased  demand 


307

during  drought  years.  It  also  provided  more  remunerative 
prices  to  farmers. 

In  rural  areas,  the  government  has  undertaken  programs  to 
mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  adverse  monsoon  rainfall,  which 
affects  not  only  farmers  but  village  artisans  and  traders  when 
the  price  of  grain  rises.  The  government  has  supplied  water  by 
financing  well  digging  and,  since  the  early  1980s,  by  power- 
assisted  well  drilling;  rescinded  land  taxes  for  drought  areas; 
tried  to  maintain  stable  food  prices;  and  provided  food 
through  a  food-for-work  program.  The  actual  work  accom- 
plished through  food-for-work  programs  is  often  a  secondary 
consideration,  but  useful  projects  sometimes  result.  Employ- 
ment is  offered  at  a  low  daily  wage,  usually  paid  in  grain,  the 
rationale  being  that  only  the  truly  needy  will  take  jobs  at  such 
low  pay. 

In  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  Indian  government  programs 
attempted  to  provide  basic  needs  at  stable,  low  prices;  to 
increase  income  through  pricing  and  regulations,  such  as  sup- 
plying water  from  irrigation  works,  fertilizer,  and  other  inputs; 
to  foster  location  of  industry  in  backward  areas;  to  increase 
access  to  basic  social  services,  such  as  education,  health,  and 
potable  water  supply;  and  to  help  needy  groups  and  deprived 
areas.  The  total  money  spent  on  such  programs  for  the  poor 
was  not  discernible  from  the  budget  data,  but  probably 
exceeded  10  percent  of  planned  budget  outlays. 

India  has  had  a  number  of  antipoverty  programs  since  the 
early  1960s.  These  include,  among  others,  the  National  Rural 
Employment  Programme  and  the  Rural  Landless  Employment 
Guarantee  Programme.  The  National  Rural  Employment  Pro- 
gramme evolved  in  FY  1980  from  the  earlier  Food  for  Work 
Programme  to  use  unemployed  and  underemployed  workers 
to  build  productive  community  assets.  The  Rural  Landless 
Employment  Guarantee  Programme  was  instituted  in  FY  1983 
to  address  the  plight  of  the  hard-core  rural  poor  by  expanding 
employment  opportunities  and  building  the  rural  infrastruc- 
ture as  a  means  of  encouraging  rapid  economic  growth.  There 
were  many  problems  with  the  implementation  of  these  and 
otherschemes,  but  observers  credit  them  with  helping  reduce 
poverty.  To  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  National  Rural 
Employment  Programme,  in  1989  it  was  combined  with  the 
Rural  Landless  Employment  Guarantee  Programme  and 
renamed  Jawahar  Rozgar  Yojana,  or  Jawahar  Employment  Plan 
(see  Development  Programs,  ch.  7).

Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

State  governments  are  important  participants  in  antipoverty 
programs.  The  constitution  assigns  responsibility  to  the  states 
in  a  number  of  matters,  including  ownership,  redistribution, 
improvement,  and  taxation  of  land  (see  The  Constitutional 
Framework,  ch.  8).  State  governments  implement  most  central 
government  programs  concerned  with  land  reform  and  the  sit- 
uation of  small  landless  farmers.  The  central  government  tries 
to  establish  programs  and  norms  among  the  states  and  union 
territories,  but  implementation  has  often  remained  at  the 
lower  bureaucratic  levels.  In  some  matters  concerning  subsoil 
rights  and  irrigation  projects,  the  central  government  exerts 
political  and  financial  leverage  to  obtain  its  objectives,  but  the 
states  sometimes  modify  or  retard  the  impact  of  central  govern- 
ment policies  and  programs. 

Development  Planning 

Planning  in  India  dates  back  to  the  1930s.  Even  before  inde- 
pendence, the  colonial  government  had  established  a  planning 
board  that  lasted  from  1944  to  1946.  Private  industrialists  and 
economists  published  three  development  plans  in  1944.  India's 
leaders  adopted  the  principle  of  formal  economic  planning 
soon  after  independence  as  an  effective  way  to  intervene  in  the 
economy  to  foster  growth  and  social  justice. 

The  Planning  Commission  was  established  in  1950.  Respon- 
sible only  to  the  prime  minister,  the  commission  is  indepen- 
dent of  the  cabinet.  The  prime  minister  is  chairperson  of  the 
commission,  and  the  minister  of  state  with  independent  charge 
for  planning  and  program  implementation  serves  as  deputy 
chairperson.  A  staff  drafts  national  plans  under  the  guidance 
of  the  commission;  draft  plans  are  presented  for  approval  to 
the  National  Development  Council,  which  consists  of  the  Plan- 
ning Commission  and  the  chief  ministers  of  the  states.  The 
council  can  make  changes  in  the  draft  plan.  After  council 
approval,  the  draft  is  presented  to  the  cabinet  and  subse- 
quently to  Parliament,  whose  approval  makes  the  plan  an  oper- 
ating document  for  central  and  state  governments  (see  The 
Legislature;  Local  Government,  ch.  8). 

The  First  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1951-55)  attempted  to  stimulate 
balanced  economic  development  while  correcting  imbalances 
caused  by  World  War  II  and  partition.  Agriculture,  including 
projects  that  combined  irrigation  and  power  generation, 
received  priority.  By  contrast,  the  Second  Five-Year  Plan  (FY 
1956-60)  emphasized  industrialization,  particularly  basic, 


309 


India:  A  Country  Study 

heavy  industries  in  the  public  sector,  and  improvement  of  the 
economic  infrastructure.  The  plan  also  stressed  social  goals, 
such  as  more  equal  distribution  of  income  and  extension  of  the 
benefits  of  economic  development  to  the  large  number  of  dis- 
advantaged people.  The  Third  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1961-65) 
aimed  at  a  substantial  rise  in  national  and  per  capita  income 
while  expanding  the  industrial  base  and  rectifying  the  neglect 
of  agriculture  in  the  previous  plan.  The  third  plan  called  for 
national  income  to  grow  at  a  rate  of  more  than  5  percent  a 
year;  self-sufficiency  in  food  grains  was  anticipated  in  the 
mid-1960s. 

Economic  difficulties  disrupted  the  planning  process  in  the 
mid-1960s.  In  1962,  when  a  brief  war  was  fought  with  China  on 
the  Himalayan  frontier,  agricultural  output  was  stagnating, 
industrial  production  was  considerably  below  expectations, 
and  the  economy  was  growing  at  about  half  of  the  planned  rate 
(see  Nehru's  Legacy,  ch.  1).  Defense  expenditures  increased 
sharply,  and  the  increased  foreign  aid  needed  to  maintain 
development  expenditures  eventually  provided  28  percent  of 
public  development  spending.  Midway  through  the  third  plan, 
it  was  clear  that  its  goals  could  not  be  achieved.  Food  prices 
rose  in  1963,  causing  rioting  and  looting  of  grain  warehouses 
in  1964.  War  with  Pakistan  in  1965  sharply  reduced  the  foreign 
aid  available.  Successive  severe  droughts  in  1965  and  1966  fur- 
ther disrupted  the  economy  and  planning.  Three  annual  plans 
guided  development  between  FY  1966  and  FY  1968  while  plan 
policies  and  strategies  were  reevaluated.  Immediate  attention 
centered  on  increasing  agricultural  growth,  stimulating 
exports,  and  searching  for  efficient  uses  of  industrial  assets. 
Agriculture  was  to  be  expanded,  largely  through  the  supply  of 
inputs  to  take  advantage  of  new  high-yield  seeds  becoming 
available  for  food  grains.  The  rupee  was  substantially  devalued 
in  1966,  and  export  incentives  were  adjusted  to  promote 
exports.  Controls  affecting  industry  were  simplified,  and 
greater  reliance  was  placed  on  the  price  mechanism  to  achieve 
industrial  efficiency. 

The  Fourth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1969-73)  called  for  a  24  per- 
cent increase  over  the  third  plan  in  real  terms  of  public  devel- 
opment expenditures.  The  public  sector  accounted  for  60 
percent  of  plan  expenditures,  and  foreign  aid  contributed  13 
percent  of  plan  financing.  Agriculture,  including  irrigation, 
received  23  percent  of  public  outlays;  the  rest  was  mostly  spent 
on  electric  power,  industry,  and  transportation.  Although  the 


310 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

plan  projected  national  income  growth  at  5.7  percent  a  year, 
the  realized  rate  was  only  3.3  percent. 

The  Fifth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1974-78)  was  drafted  in  late 
1973  when  crude  oil  prices  were  rising  rapidly;  the  rising  prices 
quickly  forced  a  series  of  revisions.  The  plan  was  subsequently 
approved  in  late  1976  but  was  terminated  at  the  end  of  FY  1977 
because  a  new  government  wanted  different  priorities  and  pro- 
grams. The  fifth  plan  was  in  effect  only  one  year,  although  it 
provided  some  guidance  to  investments  throughout  the 
five-year  period.  The  economy  operated  under  annual  plans  in 
FY  1978  and  FY  1979. 

The  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1980-84)  was  intended  to  be 
flexible  and  was  based  on  the  principle  of  annual  "rolling" 
plans.  It  called  for  development  expenditures  of  nearly  Rsl.9 
trillion  (in  FY  1979  prices),  of  which  90  percent  would  be 
financed  from  domestic  sources,  57  percent  of  which  would 
come  from  the  public  sector.  Public-sector  development  spend- 
ing would  be  concentrated  in  energy  (29  percent);  agriculture 
and  irrigation  (24  percent);  industry  including  mining  (16  per- 
cent); transportation  (16  percent);  and  social  services  (14  per- 
cent). In  practice,  slightly  more  was  spent  on  social  services  at 
the  expense  of  transportation  and  energy.  The  plan  called  for 
GDP  growth  to  increase  by  5.1  percent  a  year,  a  target  that  was 
surpassed  by  0.3  percent.  A  major  objective  of  the  plan  was  to 
increase  employment,  especially  in  rural  areas,  in  order  to 
reduce  the  level  of  poverty.  Poor  people  were  given  cows,  bul- 
lock carts,  and  handlooms;  however,  subsequent  studies  indi- 
cated that  the  income  of  only  about  10  percent  of  the  poor 
rose  above  the  poverty  level. 

The  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1985-89)  envisioned  a 
greater  emphasis  on  the  allocation  of  resources  to  energy  and 
social  spending  at  the  expense  of  industry  and  agriculture.  In 
practice,  the  main  increase  was  in  transportation  and  commu- 
nications, which  took  up  17  percent  of  public-sector  expendi- 
ture during  this  period.  Total  spending  was  targeted  at  nearly 
Rs3.9  trillion,  of  which  94  percent  would  be  financed  from 
domestic  resources,  including  48  percent  from  the  public  sec- 
tor. The  planners  assumed  that  public  savings  would  increase 
and  help  finance  government  spending.  In  practice  that 
increase  did  not  occur;  instead,  the  government  relied  on  for- 
eign borrowing  for  a  greater  share  of  resources  than  expected. 

The  schedule  for  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1992-96)  was 
affected  by  changes  of  government  and  by  growing  uncertainty 


311 


India:  A  County  Study 


over  what  role  planning  could  usefully  perform  in  a  more  lib- 
eral economv.  Two  annual  plans  were  in  effect  in  FY  1990  and 
FY  1991.  The  eighth  plan  was  finally  launched  in  April  1992 
and  emphasized  market-based  policy  reform  rather  than  quan- 
titative targets.  Total  spending  was  planned  at  RsS.7  trillion,  of 
which  94  percent  would  be  financed  from  domestic  resources, 
45  percent  of  which  would  come  from  the  public  sector.  The 
eighth  plan  included  three  general  goals.  First,  it  sought  to  cut 
back  the  public  sector  bv  selling  off  failing  and  inessential 
industries  while  encouraging  private  investment  in  such  sectors 
as  power,  steel,  and  transport.  Second,  it  proposed  that  agricul- 
ture and  rural  development  have  priority  Third,  it  sought  to 
renew  the  assault  on  illiteracy  and  improve  other  aspects  of 
social  infrastructure,  such  as  the  provision  of  fresh  drinking 
water.  Government  documents  issued  in  1992  indicated  that 
GDP  growth  was  expected  to  increase  from  around  5  percent  a 
vear  during  the  seventh  plan  to  5.6  percent  a  vear  during  the 
eighth  plan.  However,  in  1994  economists  expected  annual 
growth  to  be  around  4  percent  during  the  period  of  the  eighth 
plan. 

Four  decades  of  planning  show  that  India's  economy  a  mix 
of  public  and  private  enterprise,  is  too  large  and  diverse  to  be 
whollv  predictable  or  responsive  to  directions  of  the  planning 
authorities.  Actual  results  usually  differ  in  important  respects 
from  plan  targets.  Major  shortcomings  include  insufficient 
improvement  in  income  distribution  and  alleviation  of  poverty 
delaved  completions  and  cost  overruns  on  manv  public-sector 
projects,  and  far  too  small  a  return  on  many  public-sector 
investments.  Even  though  the  plans  have  turned  out  to  be  less 
effective  than  expected,  thev  help  guide  investment  priorities, 
policv  recommendations,  and  financial  mobilization. 

Finance 

The  earlv  governments  after  independence  operated  with 
onlv  modest  budget  deficits,  but  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  the 
amount  of  the  budget  deficit  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  increased 
gradually,  reaching  8.4  percent  in  FY  1990.  Following  eco- 
nomic  reforms,  the  deficit  declined  to  6.7  percent  by  FY  1994. 
More  than  SO  percent  of  the  public  debt  was  financed  from 
domestic  sources,  but  the  proportion  of  foreign  debt  rose 
steadily  in  the  late  1980s.  However,  although  foreign  aid  to 
India  was  substantial,  it  was  much  lower  than  most  other  devel- 
oping countries  when  calculated  on  a  per  capita  basis.  Banking 


312 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

and  credit  were  dominated  by  government-controlled  institu- 
tions, but  the  importance  of  the  private  sector  in  financial  ser- 
vices was  increasing  slowly. 

Budget 

India's  public  finance  system  follows  the  British  pattern.  The 
constitution  establishes  the  supremacy  of  the  bicameral  Parlia- 
ment— specifically  the  Lok  Sabha  (House  of  the  People) — in 
financial  matters.  No  central  government  taxes  are  levied  and 
no  government  expenditure  from  public  funds  disbursed  with- 
out an  act  of  Parliament,  which  also  scrutinizes  and  audits  all 
government  accounts  to  ensure  that  expenditures  are  legally 
authorized  and  properly  spent.  Proposals  for  taxation  or 
expenditures,  however,  may  be  initiated  only  within  the  Coun- 
cil of  Ministers — specifically  by  the  minister  of  finance.  The 
minister  of  finance  is  required  to  submit  to  Parliament,  usually 
on  the  last  day  of  February,  a  financial  statement  detailing  the 
estimated  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  central  government 
for  the  forthcoming  fiscal  year  and  a  financial  review  of  the 
current  fiscal  year. 

The  Lok  Sabha  has  one  month  to  review  and  modify  the  gov- 
ernment's budget  proposals.  If  by  April  1,  the  beginning  of  the 
fiscal  year,  the  parliamentary  discussion  of  the  budget  has  not 
been  completed,  the  budget  as  proposed  by  the  minister  of 
finance  goes  into  effect,  subject  to  retroactive  modifications 
after  the  parliamentary  review.  On  completion  of  its  budget 
discussions,  the  Lok  Sabha  passes  the  annual  appropriations 
act,  authorizing  the  executive  to  spend  money,  and  the  finance 
act,  authorizing  the  executive  to  impose  and  collect  taxes.  Sup- 
plemental requests  for  funds  are  presented  during  the  course 
of  the  fiscal  year  to  cover  emergencies,  such  as  war  or  other 
catastrophes.  The  bills  are  forwarded  to  the  Rajya  Sabha 
(Council  of  States — the  upper  house  of  Parliament)  for  com- 
ment. The  Lok  Sabha,  however,  is  not  bound  by  the  comments, 
and  the  Rajya  Sabha  cannot  delay  passage  of  money  bills.  When 
signed  by  the  president,  the  bills  become  law.  The  Lok  Sabha 
cannot  increase  the  request  for  funds  submitted  by  the  execu- 
tive, nor  can  it  authorize  new  expenditures.  Taxes  passed  by 
Parliament  may  be  retroactive. 

Each  state  government  maintains  its  own  budget,  prepared 
by  the  state's  minister  of  finance  in  consultation  with  appropri- 
ate officials  of  the  central  government.  Primary  control  over 
state  finances  rests  with  the  state  legislature  in  the  same  man- 


313 


In  d  id :  A  Conn  try  Stu  dy 


ner  as  at  the  central  government  level.  State  finances  are  super- 
vised by  the  central  government,  however,  through  the 
comptroller  and  the  auditor  general;  the  latter  reviews  state 
government  accounts  annually  and  reports  the  findings  to  the 
appropriate  state  governor  for  submission  to  the  state's  legisla- 
ture. The  central  and  state  budgets  consist  of  a  budget  for  cur- 
rent expenditures,  known  as  the  budget  on  revenue  account, 
and  a  capital  budget  for  economic  and  social  development 
expenditures. 

The  national  railroad  (Indian  Railways),  the  largest  public- 
sector  enterprise,  and  the  Department  of  Posts  and  Telegraph 
have  their  own  budgets,  funds,  and  accounts  (see  Railroads; 
Telecommunications,  this  ch.).  The  appropriations  and  dis- 
bursements under  their  budgets  are  subject  to  the  same  form 
of  parliamentary  and  audit  control  as  other  government  reve- 
nues and  expenditures.  Dividends  accrue  to  the  central  gov- 
ernment, and  deficits  are  subsidized  by  it,  a  pattern  that  holds 
true  also,  directly  or  indirectly,  for  other  government  enter- 
prises. 

During  the  eighth  plan,  the  states  were  expected  to  spend 
nearly  Rsl.9  trillion,  or  42.9  percent  of  the  public  outlay. 
Because  of  its  greater  revenue  sources,  the  central  government 
shared  with  the  states  its  receipts  from  personal  income  taxes 
and  certain  excise  taxes.  It  also  collected  other  minor  taxes,  the 
total  proceeds  of  which  were  transferred  to  the  states.  The  divi- 
sion of  the  shared  taxes  is  determined  bv  financial  commis- 
sions  established  by  the  president,  usually  at  five-year  intervals. 
In  the  early  1990s,  the  states  received  75  percent  of  the  revenue 
collected  from  income  taxes  and  around  43  percent  of  the 
excise  taxes.  The  central  government  also  provided  the  states 
with  grants  to  meet  their  commitments.  In  FY  1991,  these 
grants  and  the  states'  share  of  taxes  collected  by  the  central 
government  amounted  to  40.9  percent  of  the  total  revenue  of 
state  governments. 

The  states'  share  of  total  public  revenue  collected  declined 
from  48  percent  in  FY  1955  to  about  42  percent  in  the  late 
1970s,  and  to  about  33  percent  in  the  early  1990s.  An  impor- 
tant cause  of  the  decline  was  the  diminished  importance  of  the 
land  revenue  tax,  which  traditionally  had  been  the  main  direct 
tax  on  agriculture.  This  tax  declined  from  8  percent  of  all  state 
and  central  tax  revenues  in  FY  1950  to  less  than  1  percent  in 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  The  states  have  jurisdiction  over 
taxes  levied  on  land  and  agricultural  income,  and  vested  inter-

ests  exerted  pressure  on  the  states  not  to  raise  agricultural  taxa- 
tion. As  a  result,  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  agriculture 
largely  escaped  significant  taxation,  although  there  has  long 
been  nationwide  discussion  about  increasing  land  taxes  or 
instituting  some  sort  of  tax  on  incomes  of  the  richer  portion  of 
the  farm  community.  The  share  of  direct  taxes  in  GDP 
increased  from  2.1  percent  in  FY  1991  to  2.8  percent  in  FY 
1994. 

Since  independence  government  has  favored  more  politi- 
cally palatable  indirect  taxes— customs  and  excise  duties — over 
direct  taxes.  In  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  indirect  taxes 
accounted  for  around  75  percent  of  all  tax  revenue  collected 
by  the  central  government.  State  governments  relied  heavily  on 
sales  taxes.  Overall,  indirect  taxes  accounted  for  84.1  percent 
of  all  government  tax  revenues  in  FY  1990.  Total  government 
tax  revenues  amounted  to  17.1  percent  of  GDP  in  that  year,  up 
from  9.0  percent  in  FY  1960,  11.5  percent  in  FY  1970,  and  14.9 
percent  in  FY  1980.  In  FY  1990,  the  share  of  the  public  sector  in 
GDP  was  26.4  percent.  In  terms  of  rupees  (in  current  prices), 
total  government  income  rose  from  Rs259.8  billion  in  FY  1981 
to  Rsl.3  trillion  in  FY1992  (see  table  18,  Appendix). 

Comprehensive  tax  reforms  were  implemented  with  the  FY 
1985  budget.  Corporate  tax  was  cut,  income  taxes  simplified 
and  lowered  for  high-income  groups,  and  wealth  taxes 
reduced.  Tax  receipts  in  FY  1985  rose  by  20  percent  over  FY 
1984  as  a  result  of  tightened  enforcement,  and  taxpayers 
responded  to  lower  taxes  with  greater  compliance.  In  FY  1986, 
another  major  change  was  made  with  the  launching  of  a 
long-term  program  of  tax  reform  designed  to  eliminate  annual 
changes,  which  had  produced  uncertainty.  However,  in  FY 
1987,  when  the  monsoon  failed,  the  government  raised  taxes 
on  higher  income  groups.  The  emergency  budget  of  FY  1991, 
designed  to  cope  with  the  nation's  1990  balance  of  payments 
crisis,  increased  indirect  and  corporate  taxes,  but  the  budgets 
for  FY  1992  and  FY  1993  reflected  the  policy  of  economic  liber- 
alization. They  reduced  and  simplified  direct  taxes,  removed 
the  wealth  tax  from  financial  investments,  and  indexed  the  cap- 
ital gains  tax.  The  highest  marginal  rate  of  personal  income  tax 
was  42.5  percent  in  FY  1992. 

Fiscal  Administration 

Historically,  the  Indian  government  has  pursued  a  cautious 
policy  with  regard  to  financing  budgets,  allowing  only  small 


315 


India:  A  Counties  Study 


amounts  of  deficit  spending.  Budget  deficits  increased  in  the 
late  1980s,  and  the  necessity  of  financing  these  deficits  from 
foreign  borrowing  contributed  to  the  1990  balance  of  pay- 
ments crisis.  The  central  government  budget  deficit  reached 
8.4  percent  of  GDP  in  FY  1990,  up  from  2.6  percent  in  FY  1970, 
5.9  percent  in  FY19S0.  and  7.8  percent  in  FY  1989.  The  deficit 
was  cut  to  5.9  percent  in  FY  1991  and  5.2  percent  in  FY  1992, 
but  widened  to  7.4  percent  in  FY  1993.  It  was  expected  to 
recede  to  6.2  percent  in  FY  1995. 

The  central  government's  budget  deficits  during  the  1980s 
increased  the  total  public  debt  rapidly  until  in  FY  1991  it  stood 
at  Rs3.9  trillion.  The  bulk  of  this  debt  was  owed  to  citizens  and 
domestic  institutions  and  firms,  particularly  the  central  bank. 
Readers  of  Indian  monetary  statistics  should  be  alert  to  the  use 
of  the  terms  lakh  (see  Glossary)  and  crore  (see  Glossary),  which 
are  used  to  express  higher  numbers. 

Monetary  Process 

The  basic  elements  of  the  financial  system  were  established 
during  British  rule  (1757-1947).  The  national  currency,  the 
rupee,  had  long  been  used  domestically  before  independence 
and  even  circulated  abroad,  for  example,  in  the  Persian  Gulf 
region.  Foreign  banks,  mainly  British  and  including  some  from 
such  other  parts  of  the  empire  as  Hong  Kong,  provided  bank- 
ing and  other  services.  The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  was  formed 
in  1935  as  a  private  bank,  but  it  also  carried  out  some  central 
bank  functions.  This  colonial  banking  system,  however,  was 
geared  to  foreign  trade  and  short-term  loans.  Banking  was  con- 
centrated in  the  major  port  cities. 

The  Reserve  Bank  was  nationalized  on  January  1,  1949,  and 
given  broader  powers.  It  was  the  bank  of  issue  for  all  rupee 
notes  higher  than  the  one-rupee  denomination;  the  agent  of 
the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  controlling  foreign  exchange;  and 
the  banker  to  the  central  and  state  governments,  commercial 
banks,  state  cooperative  banks,  and  other  financial  institutions. 
The  Reserve  Bank  formulated  and  administered  monetary  pol- 
icv  to  promote  stable  prices  and  higher  production.  It  was 
given  increasing  responsibilities  for  the  development  of  bank- 
ing and  credit  and  to  coordinate  banking  and  credit  with  the 
five-year  plans.  The  Reserve  Bank  had  a  number  of  tools  with 
which  to  affect  commercial  bank  credit. 

.After  independence  the  government  sought  to  adapt  the 
banking  system  to  promote  development  and  formed  a  num- 


316 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

ber  of  specialized  institutions  to  provide  credit  to  industry,  agri- 
culture, and  small  businesses.  Banking  penetrated  rural  areas, 
and  agricultural  and  industrial  credit  cooperatives  were  pro- 
moted. Deposit  insurance  and  a  system  of  postal  savings  banks 
and  offices  fostered  use  by  small  savers.  Subsidized  credit  was 
provided  to  particular  groups  or  activities  considered  in  need 
and  which  deserved  such  help.  A  credit  guarantee  corporation 
covered  loans  by  commercial  banks  to  small  traders,  transport 
operators,  self-employed  persons,  and  other  borrowers  not 
otherwise  effectively  covered  by  major  institutions.  The  system 
effectively  reached  all  kinds  of  savers  and  provided  credit  to 
many  different  customers. 

The  government  nationalized  fourteen  major  private  com- 
mercial banks  in  1969  and  six  more  in  1980.  Nationalization 
forced  commercial  banks  increasingly  to  meet  the  credit 
requirements  of  the  weaker  sections  of  the  nation  and  to  elimi- 
nate monopolization  by  vested  interests  of  large  industry, 
trade,  and  agriculture. 

The  banking  system  expanded  rapidly  after  nationalization. 
The  number  of  bank  branches,  for  instance,  increased  from 
about  7,000  in  1969  to  more  than  60,000  in  1994,  two-thirds  of 
which  were  in  rural  areas.  The  deposit  base  rose  from  Rs50  bil- 
lion in  1969  to  around  Rs3.5  trillion  in  1994.  Nevertheless,  cur- 
rency accounted  for  well  over  50  percent  of  all  the  money 
supply  circulating  among  the  public.  In  1992  the  nationalized 
banks  held  93  percent  of  all  deposits. 

In  FY  1990,  twenty-three  foreign  banks  operated  in  India. 
The  most  important  were  ANZ  Grindlays  Bank,  Citibank,  the 
Hongkong  and  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation,  and  Standard 
Chartered  Bank. 

Public-sector  banks  are  required  to  reserve  their  lending 
based  on  40  percent  of  their  deposits  for  priority  sectors,  espe- 
cially agriculture,  at  favorable  rates.  In  addition,  35  percent  of 
their  deposits  have  to  be  held  in  liquid  form  to  satisfy  statutory 
liquidity  requirements,  and  15  percent  are  needed  to  meet  the 
cash  reserve  requirements  of  the  Reserve  Bank.  Both  these  per- 
centages represent  an  easing  of  earlier  requirements,  but  only 
a  small  proportion  of  public-sector  banks'  resources  can  be 
deployed  freely.  In  late  1994,  the  rate  of  interest  on  bank  loans 
was  deregulated,  but  deposit  rates  were  still  subject  to  ceilings. 

More  than  50  percent  of  bank  lending  is  to  the  government 
sector.  With  the  onset  of  economic  reform,  India's  banks  were 
experiencing  major  financial  losses  as  the  result  of  low  produc-

tivity,  bad  loans,  and  poor  capitalization.  Seeking  to  stabilize 
the  banking  industry,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  developed  new 
reporting  formats  and  has  initiated  takeovers  and  mergers  of 
smaller  banks  that  were  operating  with  financial  losses. 

India  has  a  rapidly  expanding  stock  market  that  in  1993 
listed  around  5,000  companies  in  fourteen  stock  exchanges, 
although  only  the  stocks  of  about  400  of  these  companies  were 
actively  traded.  Financial  institutions  and  government  bodies 
controlled  an  estimated  45  percent  of  all  listed  capital.  In  April 
1992,  the  Bombay  stock  market,  the  nation's  largest  with  a  mar- 
ket capital  of  US$65.1  billion,  collapsed,  in  part  because  of  rev- 
elations about  financial  malpractice  amounting  to  USS2 
billion.  Afterward,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India, 
the  government's  capital  market  regulator,  implemented 
reforms  designed  to  strengthen  investor  confidence  in  the 
stock  market.  In  the  mid-1990s,  foreign  institutional  investors 
took  greater  interest  than  ever  before  in  the  Indian  stock  mar- 
kets, investing  around  USS2  billion  in  FY  1993  alone. 

Despite  increases  in  energy  costs  and  other  pressures  from 
the  world  economy,  for  most  of  the  period  since  independence 
India  has  not  experienced  severe  inflation.  The  underlying 
average  rate  of  inflation,  however,  has  tended  to  rise.  Con- 
sumer prices  rose  at  an  annual  average  of  2.1  percent  in  the 
1950s,  6.3  percent  in  the  1960s,  7.8  percent  in  the  1970s,  and 
8.5  percent  in  the  1980s. 

Three  factors  lav  behind  India's  relative  price  stability.  First, 
the  government  has  intervened,  either  directlv  or  indirectlv,  to 
keep  stable  the  price  of  certain  staples,  including  wheat,  rice, 
cloth,  and  sugar.  Second,  monetary  regulation  has  restricted 
growth  in  the  money  supply.  Third,  the  overall  influence  of  the 
labor  unions  on  wages  has  been  small  because  of  the  weakness 
of  the  unions  in  India's  labor  surplus  economy. 

Foreign  Economic  Relations 
Aid 

Since  independence  India  has  had  to  draw  on  foreign  invest- 
ments to  finance  part  of  its  economic  development.  .Although 
the  government  has  attempted  to  be  as  self-reliant  as  possible, 
the  absolute  amount  of  foreign  aid  received  has  been  high.  In 
per  capita  terms,  however,  it  has  been  much  less  than  most 
other  developing  countries  receive.

In  August  1958,  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  organized 
the  Aid-to-india  Consortium,  consisting  of  the  World  Bank 
Group  and  thirteen  countries:  Austria,  Belgium,  Britain,  Can- 
ada, Denmark,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (at  that  time, 
West  Germany),  France,  Italy,  Japan,  the  Netherlands,  Norway, 
Sweden,  and  the  United  States.  The  consortium  was  formed  to 
coordinate  aid  and  establish  priorities  among  India's  major 
sources  of  foreign  assistance  and  to  simplify  India's  requests  for 
aid  based  on  its  plans  for  development.  Consortium  aid  was 
bilateral  government-to-government  aid  from  the  thirteen  con- 
sortium countries,  and  almost  all  of  the  aid,  including  that 
from  the  World  Bank  Group,  was  for  specific  projects  judged  to 
be  valuable  contributions  to  India's  development.  Of  the  Rs630 
billion  in  aid  authorized  by  all  aid  donors  between  FY  1974  and 
FY  1989,  more  than  60  percent  was  provided  by  the  consor- 
tium.

India:  A  Country  Study 

Collectively,  the  Western  nations  have  donated  a  substantial 
amount  of  aid  to  India.  In  1980  this  aid  totaled  nearly  US$1.5 
billion  and  reached  US$2.5  billion  in  1990.  In  1992  Western 
aid  reached  a  new  height:  US$3.9  billion,  which  represented 
49.8  percent  of  all  Western  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  given 
to  South  Asian  nations  that  year.  The  largest  bilateral  donor  is 
Japan.  Between  1984  and  1993,  Japan's  official  development 
assistance  grants  to  India  totaled  US$337  million.  Much 
greater  than  the  outright  grants  has  been  Japan's  large-scale 
loan  program,  which  supports  economic  infrastructure  devel- 
opment (power  plants  and  delivery  systems,  and  road  improve- 
ment) and  environmental  protection.  Between  1984  and  1993, 
Japanese  loans  to  India  totaled  nearly  US$2.4  billion.  A  ¥125 
billion  (US$1.2  billion)  loan  financing  major  projects  was 
granted  in  December  1994,  bringing  Japanese  loans  to  India 
since  1957  to  a  total  of  ¥1.6  trillion. 

United  States  assistance  was  significant  in  the  late  1950s  and 
1960s  but,  because  of  strained  India-United  States  relations, 
fell  off  sharply  in  the  1970s  (see  United  States,  ch.  9).  The 
United  States  accounted  for  8.6  percent  of  all  of  the  aid  India 
received  from  independence  through  FY  1988,  but  for  only  0.7 
percent  in  FY  1989  and  0.6  percent  in  FY  1990.  United  States 
aid  to  India  remained  relatively  insignificant  in  the  early  1990s 
when  it  took  the  form  of  grants  for  food  aid  and  consultants  in 
a  wide  variety  of  economic  growth  areas,  such  as  computers, 
steel,  telecommunications,  and  energy  production.  In  FY  1993, 
actual  United  States  obligations  through  the  United  States 
Agency  for  International  Development  totaled  almost  US$161 
million.  The  bulk  of  this  aid  was  provided  as  United  States  Pub- 
lic Law  480  food  aid  grants  with  lesser  amounts  for  develop- 
ment assistance  (including  energy  and  the  environment, 
population  control,  child  survival,  acquired  immune  deficiency 
syndrome  (AIDS)  prevention,  and  economic  growth)  and 
housing  guaranty  loans.  Germany  and  Britain  also  have  sub- 
stantial aid-to-india  programs. 

Among  countries  not  in  the  World  Bank  consortium,  the 
Soviet  Union  was  the  most  important  contributor,  providing 
more  than  16  percent  of  all  aid  between  1947  and  FY  1988. 
Since  1991,  however,  Russia  has  provided  little  aid. 

About  90  percent  of  all  aid  received  by  India  has  been  in  the 
form  of  loans.  Aid  disbursements  from  all  providers  for  FY  1990 
were  Rs67  billion. 


320 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

India  maintains  a  small  but  well-established  foreign  aid  pro- 
gram of  its  own.  In  FY  1990,  Rsl.6  billion  of  aid  was  authorized, 
of  which  Rs582  million  was  for  Bhutan  and  Rs578  million  for 
Nepal.  Bangladesh  and  Vietnam  received  significant  amounts 
of  aid  during  the  1980s,  but,  as  the  result  of  changing  world 
political  and  economic  conditions,  these  programs  were  small 
by  the  early  1990s  (see  South  Asia;  Southeast  Asia,  ch.  9). 

Trade 

Despite  its  size,  India  plays  a  relatively  small  role  in  the  world 
economy.  Until  the  1980s,  the  government  did  not  make 
exports  a  priority.  In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  Indian  officials 
believed  that  trade  was  biased  against  developing  countries  and 
that  prospects  for  exports  were  severely  limited.  Therefore,  the 
government  aimed  at  self-sufficiency  in  most  products  through 
import  substitution,  with  exports  covering  the  cost  of  residual 
import  requirements.  Foreign  trade  was  subjected  to  strict  gov- 
ernment controls,  which  consisted  of  an  all-inclusive  system  of 
foreign  exchange  and  direct  controls  over  imports  and 
exports.  As  a  result,  India's  share  of  world  trade  shrank  from 
2.4  percent  in  FY  1951  to  0.4  percent  in  FY  1980.  Largely 
because  of  oil  price  increases  in  the  1970s,  which  contributed 
to  balance  of  payments  difficulties,  governments  in  the  1970s 
and  1980s  placed  more  emphasis  on  the  promotion  of  exports. 
They  hoped  exports  would  provide  foreign  exchange  needed 
for  the  import  of  oil  and  high-technology  capital  goods.  Never- 
theless, in  the  early  1990s  India's  share  of  world  trade  stood  at 
only  0.5  percent.  In  FY  1992,  imports  accounted  for  9.3  percent 
of  GDP  and  exports  for  7.7  percent  of  GDP. 

Based  on  trends  throughout  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  it 
appears  likely  that  the  balance  of  trade  will  remain  negative  for 
the  foreseeable  future  (see  table  19,  Appendix).  The  1979 
increase  in  the  price  of  oil  produced  a  Rs58.4  billion  deficit  in 
FY  1980,  close  to  5  percent  of  GNP.  The  deficit  was  barely 
reduced  in  nominal  rupee  terms  over  the  next  five  years, 
although  it  improved  considerably  as  a  share  of  GNP  (to  2.3 
percent  in  FY  1984)  and  in  dollar  terms  (from  US$7.4  billion 
in  FY  1980  to  US$4.3  billion  in  FY  1984).  Pressure  on  the  bal- 
ance of  trade  continued  through  the  late  1980s  and  worsened 
with  the  attempted  annexation  of  Kuwait  by  Iraq  in  August 
1990,  which  led  to  a  temporary  but  sharp  increase  in  the  price 
of  oil.  In  FY  1990,  the  balance  of  trade  deficit  reached  a  record 
level  in  rupees  (Rsl06.5  billion)  and  in  dollars  (US$6  billion). 


321 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Import  controls  and  devaluation  of  the  rupee  allowed  the 
trade  deficit  to  fall  to  US$1.6  billion  in  FY  1991.  However,  it 
widened  to  USS3.3  billion  in  FY  1992  before  falling  to  an  esti- 
mated USS1  billion  in  FY  1993.  However,  one  optimistic  sign, 
noted  by  India's  minister  of  finance  in  March  1995,  was  that 
exports  had  come  to  finance  90  percent  of  India's  imports, 
compared  with  only  60  percent  in  the  mid-1980s. 

No  one  product  dominates  India's  exports.  In  FY  1993, 
handicrafts,  gems,  and  jewelry  formed  the  most  important  sec- 
tor and  accounted  for  an  estimated  US$4.9  billion  (22.2  per- 
cent) of  exports.  Since  the  early  1990s,  India  has  become  the 
world's  largest  processor  of  diamonds  (imported  in  the  rough 
from  South  Africa  and  then  fabricated  into  jewelry  for  export). 
Along  with  other  semiprecious  commodities,  such  as  gold, 
India's  gems  and  jewelry  accounted  for  11  percent  of  its  for- 
eign-exchange receipts  in  early  1993.  Textiles  and  ready-made 
garments  combined  were  also  an  important  category,  account- 
ing for  an  estimated  US$4.1  billion  (18.5  percent)  of  exports. 
Other  significant  exports  include  industrial  machinery,  leather 
products,  chemicals  and  related  products  (see  table  20,  Appen- 
dix). 

The  dominant  imports  are  petroleum  products,  valued  in  FY 
1993  at  nearly  USS5.8  billion,  or  24.7  percent  of  principal 
imports,  and  capital  goods,  amounting  to  US$4.2  billion,  or 
21.8  percent  of  principal  imports.  Other  important  import  cat- 
egories are  chemicals,  dyes,  plastics,  pharmaceuticals,  uncut 
precious  stones,  iron  and  steel,  fertilizers,  nonferrous  metals, 
and  pulp  paper  and  paper  products  (see  table  21,  Appendix). 

India's  most  important  trading  partners  are  the  United 
States,  Japan,  the  European  Union,  and  nations  belonging  to 
the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries 
(OPEC).  From  the  1950s  until  1991,  India  also  had  close  trade 
links  with  the  Soviet  Union,  but  the  breakup  of  that  nation  into 
fifteen  independent  states  led  to  a  decline  of  trade  with  the 
region.  In  FY  1993,  some  30  percent  of  all  imports  came  from 
the  European  Union,  22.4  percent  from  OPEC  nations,  11.7 
percent  from  the  United  States,  and  6.6  percent  from  Japan.  In 
that  same  year,  26  percent  of  all  exports  were  to  the  European 
Union,  18  percent  to  the  United  States,  7.8  percent  to  Japan, 
and  10.7  to  the  OPEC  nations  (see  table  22,  Appendix). 

Trade  and  investment  with  the  United  States  seemed  likely 
to  experience  an  upswing  following  a  January  1995  trade  mis- 
sion from  the  United  States  led  by  Secretary  of  Commerce

Ronald  H.  Brown  and  including  top  executives  from  twenty-six 
United  States  companies.  During  the  weeklong  visit,  some 
US$7  billion  in  business  deals  were  agreed  on,  mostly  in  the 
areas  of  infrastructure  development,  transportation,  power  and 
communication  systems,  food  processing,  health  care  services, 
insurance  and  financing  projects,  and  automotive  catalytic  con- 
verters. In  turn,  greater  access  for  Indian  goods  in  United 
States  markets  was  sought  by  Indian  officials. 

In  February  1995,  in  a  bid  to  improve  commercial  prospects 
in  Southeast  Asia,  India  signed  a  four-part  agreement  with  the 
Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN — see  Glos- 
sary). The  pact  covers  trade,  investment,  science  and  technol- 
ogy, and  tourism,  and  there  are  prospects  for  further 
agreements  on  joint  ventures,  banks,  and  civil  aviation. 

India's  balance  of  payments  position  is  closely  related  to  the 
balance  of  trade.  Foreign  aid  and  remittances  from  Indians 
employed  overseas,  however,  make  the  balance  of  payments 
more  favorable  than  the  balance  of  trade  (see  Size  and  Compo- 
sition of  the  Work  Force,  this  ch.). 

Foreign- Exchange  System 

The  central  government  has  wide  powers  to  control  transac- 
tions in  foreign  exchange.  Until  1992  all  foreign  investments 
and  the  repatriation  of  foreign  capital  required  prior  approval 
of  the  government.  The  Foreign-Exchange  Regulation  Act, 
which  governs  foreign  investment,  rarely  allowed  foreign 
majority  holdings.  However,  a  new  foreign  investment  policy 
announced  in  July  1991  prescribed  automatic  approval  for  for- 
eign investments  in  thirty-four  industries  designated  high  pri- 
ority, up  to  an  equity  limit  of  51  percent.  Initially  the 
government  required  that  a  company's  automatic  approval 
must  rely  on  matching  exports  and  dividend  repatriation,  but 
in  May  1992  this  requirement  was  lifted,  except  for  low-priority 
sectors.  In  1994  foreign  and  nonresident  Indian  investors  were 
allowed  to  repatriate  not  only  their  profits  but  also  their  capi- 
tal. Indian  exporters  are  also  free  to  use  their  export  earnings 
as  they  see  fit.  However,  transfer  of  capital  abroad  by  Indian 
nationals  is  only  permitted  in  special  circumstances,  such  as 
emigration.  Foreign  exchange  is  automatically  made  available 
for  imports  for  which  import  licenses  are  issued. 

Because  foreign-exchange  transactions  are  so  tightly  con- 
trolled, Indian  authorities  are  able  to  manage  the  exchange 
rate,  and  from  1975  to  1992  the  rupee  was  tied  to  a  trade- 


323

weighted  basket  of  currencies.  In  February  1992,  the  govern- 
ment began  moves  to  make  the  rupee  convertible,  and  in 
March  1993  a  single  floating  exchange  rate  was  implemented. 
In  July  1995,  Rs31.81  were  worth  USS1,  compared  with  Rs7.86 
in  1980,  Rsl2.37  in  1985,  and  Rsl7.50  in  1990. 

External  Debt 

India  has  frequently  encountered  balance  of  payments  diffi- 
culties (see  table  23,  Appendix).  The  usual  recourse  has  been 
to  contract  imports,  thereby  reducing  production  and  eco- 
nomic growth,  although  the  amount  of  foreign  aid  available 
has  been  an  important  factor  in  how  harsh  the  restrictions  have 
become.  Following  the  first  round  of  oil  price  increases  in 
1973-74,  increased  foreign  aid  and  some  belt-tightening  over- 
came the  country's  balance  of  payments  problems.  The  growth 
of  exports  and  the  increased  remittances  from  Indians  working 
abroad  in  the  late  1970s  permitted  a  buildup  of  substantial  for- 
eign-currency reserves.  Toward  the  end  of  the  1970s,  the  coun- 
try's external  payments  situation  was  more  favorable  than  it 
had  been  for  many  years. 

The  second  large  oil  price  increase,  in  the  1979-80  period, 
quicklv  altered  India's  terms  of  trade  and  balance  of  payments 
situation.  Between  FY  1978  and  FY  1980,  India's  oil  bill 
increased  threefold,  by  about  USS4.6  billion.  The  deficit  on  the 
balance  of  trade  rose  from  US$1.5  billion  in  FY  1979  to  US$7.7 
billion  in  FY  1980.  Officials  negotiated  a  substantial  loan  from 
the  IMF,  which,  along  with  the  foreign-exchange  reserves,  for- 
eign aid,  and  export  possibilities,  made  adjustments  possible. 
The  intent  was  to  keep  annual  economic  growth  at  5  percent 
or  more  to  reduce  poverty,  while  making  structural  adjust- 
ments in  the  economy  to  compensate  for  the  change  in  the 
external  environment.  Nonetheless,  the  external  debt  rose 
from  USS20.6  billion  in  1980  to  nearly  US$70.2  billion  in  1990. 
In  FY  1990,  commercial  loans  accounted  for  26.3  percent  of 
the  external  debt:  loans  from  international  institutions,  espe- 
cially the  World  Bank,  made  up  45.2  percent:  borrowing  from 
foreign  governments  accounted  for  28.5  percent.  The  largest 
sums  were  owed  to  Japan,  Germany,  and  the  United  States.  At 
the  time  of  the  economic  crisis  of  1990,  external  debt  was 
increasing  at  around  US$8  billion  a  year.  By  1993-94,  the 
annual  increase  had  been  cut  to  less  than  US$1  billion  and  was 
expected  to  be  further  reduced.  India's  foreign  currency

reserves,  which  stood  at  US$1  billion  in  June  1991,  had 
reached  a  record  level  of  US$20  billion  by  March  1995. 

Labor 

Size  and  Composition  of  the  Work  Force 

Based  on  the  1991  census,  the  government  estimated  that 
the  labor  force  had  grown  by  more  than  65  million  since  1981 
and  that  the  total  number  of  "main  workers" — the  "economi- 
cally active  population" — had  reached  285.9  million  people. 
This  total  did  not  include  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  which  was  not 
enumerated  in  the  1991  census.  Labor  force  statistics  for  1991 
covered  nine  main-worker  "industrial"  categories:  cultivators 
(39  percent  of  the  main-worker  force);  agricultural  laborers 
(26  percent);  livestock,  forestry,  fishing,  hunting,  plantations, 
orchards,  and  allied  activities  (2  percent);  mining  and  quarry- 
ing (1  percent);  manufacturing  (household  2  percent,  other 
than  household  7  percent);  construction  (2  percent);  trade 
and  commerce  (8  percent);  transportation,  storage,  and  com- 
munications (3  percent);  and  "other  services"  (10  percent). 
Another  28.2  million  "marginal  workers"  were  also  counted  in 
the  census  but  not  tabulated  among  the  nine  categories  even 
though  unpaid  farm  and  family  enterprise  workers  were 
counted  among  the  nine  categories.  Of  the  total  work  force — 
both  main  and  marginal  workers — 29  percent  were  women, 
and  nearly  78  percent  worked  in  rural  areas. 

Included  in  the  labor  force  are  some  55  million  children, 
other  than  those  working  directly  for  their  parents.  The  Minis- 
try of  Labour  and  nongovernmental  organizations  estimate 
that  there  are  25  million  children  employed  in  the  agricultural 
sector,  20  million  in  service  jobs  (hotels,  shops,  and  as  servants 
in  homes),  and  5  million  in  the  handloom,  carpet-making, 
gem-cutting,  and  match-making  industries.  With  mixed  suc- 
cess, nongovernmental  organizations  monitor  the  child  labor 
market  for  abuse  and  conformity  to  child  labor  laws. 

In  government  organizations  throughout  the  nation  and  in 
nonagricultural  enterprises  with  twenty-five  persons  or  more  in 
1991,  the  public  sector  employed  nearly  19  million  people 
compared  with  about  8  million  people  employed  in  the  private 
sector.  Most  of  the  growth  in  the  organized  work  force  between 
1970  and  1990  was  in  the  public  sector.  Observers  expected 
that  this  trend  might  be  reversed  if  the  government's  policy  of 
economic  liberalization  continued.  Labor  law  makes  it  very  dif- 


325

ficultfor  companies  to  lay  off  workers.  Some  observers  feel  that 
this  restriction  deters  companies  from  hiring  because  they  fear 
carrying  a  bloated  workforce  in  case  of  an  economic  turndown. 

A  new  source  of  employment  appeared  after  OPEC  sharply 
increased  crude  oil  prices  in  1974.  The  Middle  East 
oil-exporting  countries  quickly  undertook  massive  develop- 
ment programs  based  on  their  large  oil  revenues.  Most  of  these 
countries  required  the  importation  of  labor,  both  skilled  and 
unskilled,  and  India  became  one  of  many  nations  supplying 
the  labor.  Because  some  labor  agents  and  employers  took 
advantage  of  expatriate  workers,  especially  those  with  little  edu- 
cation or  few  skills,  in  1983  India  enacted  a  law  governing 
workers  going  abroad.  In  general,  the  new  legislation  provided 
more  protection  and  required  fairer  treatment  of  Indians 
employed  outside  the  country.  By  1983  some  900,000  Indian 
workers  were  registered  as  temporary  residents  in  the  Middle 
East.  In  the  mid-1980s,  there  was  a  shift  in  the  kinds  of  skills 
needed.  Fewer  laborers,  metalworkers,  and  engineers,  for 
example,  were  required  for  construction  projects,  but  the  need 
for  maintenance  workers  and  operating  staff  in  power  plants, 
hospitals,  and  offices  increased.  In  1990  it  was  estimated  that 
more  than  1  million  Indians  were  resident  in  the  Middle  East. 
India  benefited  not  only  from  the  opening  of  job  opportunides 
but  also  from  the  remittances  the  workers  sent  back,  which 
amounted  to  around  US$4.3  billion  of  foreign  exchange  in  FY 
1988.  Both  employment  and  remittances  suffered  as  a  result  of 
the  1991  Persian  Gulf  War,  when  about  180,000  Indian  workers 
were  displaced.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  outlook  for  Indian 
employment  in  the  Middle  East  was  only  fair. 

India's  labor  force  exhibits  extremes  ranging  from  large 
numbers  of  illiterate  workers  unaccustomed  to  machinery  or 
routine,  to  a  sizable  pool  of  highly  educated  scientists,  techni- 
cians, and  engineers,  capable  of  working  anywhere  in  the 
world.  A  substantial  number  of  skilled  people  have  left  India  to 
work  abroad;  the  country  has  suffered  a  brain  drain  since  inde- 
pendence. Nonetheless,  many  remain  in  India  working  along- 
side a  trained  industrial  and  commercial  work  force. 
Administrative  skills,  particularly  necessary  in  large  projects  or 
programs,  are  in  short  supply,  however.  In  the  mid-1990s,  sala- 
ries for  top  administrators  and  technical  staff  rose  sharply, 
partly  in  response  to  the  arrival  of  foreign  companies  in  India.

Labor  Relations 

The  Trade  Unions  Act  of  1926  provided  recognition  and 
protection  for  a  nascent  Indian  labor  union  movement.  The 
number  of  unions  grew  considerably  after  independence,  but 
most  unions  are  small  and  usually  active  in  only  one  firm. 
Union  membership  is  concentrated  in  the  organized  sector, 
and  in  the  early  1990s  total  membership  was  about  9  million. 
Many  unions  are  affiliated  with  regional  or  national  federa- 
tions, the  most  important  of  which  are  the  Indian  National 
Trade  Union  Congress,  the  All-India  Trade  Union  Congress, 
the  Centre  of  Indian  Trade  Unions,  the  Indian  Workers'  Associ- 
ation, and  the  United  Trade  Union  Congress.  Politicians  have 
often  been  union  leaders,  and  some  analysts  believe  that  strikes 
and  other  labor  protests  are  called  primarily  to  further  the 
interests  of  political  parties  rather  than  to  promote  the  inter- 
ests of  the  work  force. 


327 


India:  A  Country  Study 


The  government  recorded  1,825  strikes  and  lockouts  in 
1990.  As  a  result,  24.1  million  workdays  were  lost,  10.6  million 
to  strikes  and  13.5  million  to  lockouts.  More  than  1.3  million 
workers  were  involved  in  these  labor  disputes.  The  number  and 
seriousness  of  strikes  and  lockouts  have  varied  from  year  to 
year.  However,  the  figures  for  1990  and  preliminary  data  from 
1991  indicate  declines  from  levels  reached  in  the  1980s,  when 
in  some  years  as  many  as  35  million  workdays  were  lost  because 
of  labor  disputes. 

The  isolated,  insecure,  and  exploited  laborers  in  rural  areas 
and  in  the  urban  unorganized  sectors  present  a  stark  contrast 
to  the  position  of  unionized  workers  in  many  modern  enter- 
prises. In  the  early  1990s,  there  were  estimates  that  between  10 
percent  and  20  percent  of  agricultural  workers  were  bonded 
laborers.  The  International  Commission  of  Jurists,  studying 
India's  bonded  labor,  defines  such  a  person  as  one  who  works 
for  a  creditor  or  someone  in  the  creditor's  family  against  nomi- 
nal wages  in  cash  or  kind  until  the  creditor,  who  keeps  the 
books  and  sets  the  prices,  declares  the  loan  repaid,  often  with 
usurious  rates  of  interest.  The  system  sometimes  extends  to  a 
debtor's  wife  and  children,  who  are  employed  in  appalling 
working  conditions  and  exposed  to  sexual  abuse.  The  constitu- 
tion, as  interpreted  by  India's  Supreme  Court,  and  a  1976  law 
prohibit  bonded  labor.  Implementation  of  the  prohibition, 
however,  has  been  inconsistent  in  many  rural  areas. 

Many  in  the  urban  unorganized  sector  are  self-employed 
laborers,  street  vendors,  petty  traders,  and  other  services  pro- 
viders who  receive  little  income.  Along  with  the  unemployed, 
they  have  no  unemployment  insurance  or  other  benefits. 

Industry 

At  independence,  industrialization  was  viewed  as  the  engine 
of  growth  for  the  rest  of  the  economy  and  the  supplier  of  jobs 
to  reduce  poverty.  By  the  early  1990s,  substantial  progress  had 
been  made,  but  industrial  growth  had  failed  to  live  up  to  expec- 
tations. Industrial  production  rose  an  average  of  6.1  percent  in 
the  1950s,  5.3  percent  in  the  1960s,  and  4.2  percent  in  the 
1970s.  Although  this  increase  was  respectable,  it  was  less  than 
the  rate  achieved  by  some  other  developing  countries  and  less 
than  what  the  planners  expected  and  the  economy  needed  to 
bring  about  a  large  reduction  in  poverty.  The  emphasis  on 
large-scale,  capital-intensive  industries  created  far  fewer  jobs 
than  the  estimated  10  million  annual  entrants  into  the  labor 


328 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

force  required.  Hence  unemployment  and  underemployment 
remained  growing  problems.  In  the  1980s,  however,  industrial 
production  rose  at  an  average  rate  of  6.6  percent.  Observers 
believed  that  this  increase  was  largely  a  response  to  economic 
liberalization,  which  led  to  increased  investment  and  competi- 
tion. 

Government  Policies 

Government  has  played  an  important  role  in  industry  since 
independence.  The  government  has  both  owned  a  large  pro- 
portion of  industrial  establishments  and  has  tightly  regulated 
the  private  sector.  From  the  late  1970s,  the  government  sought 
to  reduce  its  role,  but  progress  remained  slow  throughout  the 
1980s.  The  Congress  (I)  government  that  came  to  power  in 
June  1991  had  a  renewed  commitment  to  cutting  back  the  role 
of  government,  and  in  the  mid-1990s  the  liberalization  pro- 
gram made  progress,  although  many  uncertainties  remained 
about  its  implementation. 

The  Industrial  Policy  Resolution  of  1948  gave  the  govern- 
ment the  go-ahead  to  build  and  operate  key  industries,  which 
largely  meant  those  producing  capital  and  intermediate  goods 
(see  Early  Policy  Developments,  this  ch.).  This  policy  partly 
reflected  socialist  ideas  then  current  in  India.  It  was  believed 
that  public  ownership  of  basic  industry  was  necessary  to  ensure 
development  in  the  interest  of  the  whole  population.  The  deci- 
sion also  reflected  the  belief  that  private  industrialists  would 
find  establishment  of  many  of  the  basic  industries  on  the  scale 
that  the  country  needed  either  unattractive  or  beyond  their 
financial  capabilities.  Moreover,  there  was  concern  that  private 
industrialists  could  enlarge  their  profits  by  dominating  markets 
in  key  commodities.  The  industrial  policy  resolutions  of  1948 
and  1956  delineated  the  lines  between  the  public  and  private 
sectors  and  stressed  the  need  for  a  large  degree  of 
self-sufficiency  in  manufacturing,  the  basic  strategy  that  guided 
industrialization  until  the  mid-1980s. 

Another  early  decision  on  industrial  policy  mandated  that 
defense  industries  would  be  developed  by  the  public  sector. 
Building  defense  industries  for  a  modern  military  force 
required  the  concomitant  development  of  heavy  industries, 
including  metallurgy  and  machine  tools.  Production  often 
started  under  foreign  licensing,  but  as  much  as  possible,  design 
and  production  became  Indianized.  India  was  one  of  only  a  few 


329 


India:  A  Country  Studx 


developing  countries  to  produce  a  variety  of  high-technologv 
militarv  equipment  to  supply  its  own  needs. 

Before  independence  there  was  a  strong  tendency  for  own- 
ership or  control  of  much  of  the  large-scale  private  industrial 
economv  to  be  concentrated  in  managing  agencies,  which 
became  powerful  under  the  British  because  thev  had  access  to 
London  money  markets.  Through  diversified  investments  and 
interlocking  directorates,  the  individuals  who  controlled  the 
managing  agencies  controlled  much  of  the  preindependence 
economv.  After  independence  Parliament  passed  legislation  to 
restrain  further  concentration,  used  the  development  of  the 
stock  market  to  induce  the  sale  of  stock  in  tightly  held  compa- 
nies to  the  public,  and  applied  high  corporate  tax  rates  to  such 
companies.  It  also  attempted  to  offset  the  monopolv  effects  of 
the  managing  agencies  bv  fixing  prices  on  a  number  of  basic 
commodities,  including  cement,  steel,  and  coal,  and  assumed 
considerable  control  of  their  distribution.  The  government 
eventually  abolished  some  of  the  managing  agencies  in  1969 
and  the  remainder  in  1971.  In  1970  the  Monopolies  and 
Restrictive  Practices  Act  supplied  the  government  with  addi- 
tional authority  to  diminish  concentrations  of  private  eco- 
nomic power  and  to  restrict  business  practices  contrary  to  the 
public  interest.  This  act  was  strengthened  in  19S4. 

Industrialization  occurred  in  a  protected  environment, 
which  led  to  distortions  that,  after  the  mid-1960s,  contributed 
to  the  sagging  industrial  growth  rate.  Tariffs  and  quantitative 
controls  largely  kept  foreign  competition  out  of  the  domestic 
market,  and  most  Indian  manufacturers  looked  on  exports 
only  as  a  residual  possibility  Industry  paid  insufficient  atten- 
tion to  the  quality  of  products,  technological  development  else- 
where, and  economies  of  scale.  Management  was  weak  in  many 
private  and  public  plants.  Shortfalls  in  reaching  plan  goals  in 
public  enterprises,  moreover,  denied  the  rest  of  the  industrial 
sector  key  inputs,  such  as  coal  and  electricity 

In  the  1980s  and  earlv  1990s..  India  began  increasingly  to 
remove  some  of  the  controls  on  industry  Nevertheless,  in  the 
mid-1990s,  there  were  state  monopolies  for  most  energy  and 
communications  production  and  services,  and  the  state  domi- 
nated the  steel,  nonferrous  metal,  machine  tool,  shipbuilding, 
chemical,  fertilizer,  paper,  and  coal  industries.  In  FY  1992.  pub- 
lic enterprises  had  a  turnover  of  Rsl.7  trillion  (see  table  24, 
Appendix).  Well  over  50  percent  of  this  total  was  accounted  for 
bv  ten  enterprises,  the  most  important  of  which  were  the  oil, 


330 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

steel,  and  coal  companies.  Public  enterprises  in  aggregate 
made  a  net  profit  after  tax  of  2.4  percent  on  capital  in  FY  1992, 
but  the  three  oil  companies  earned  95  percent  of  these  net 
profits.  In  fact,  106  of  the  233  public  companies  sustained 
losses.  Some  analysts  believed  that  the  inefficiency  of  the  public 
sector  was  concealed  by  passing  on  to  consumers  the  high  costs 
of  monopoly  products. 

Manufacturing 

Textiles 

Cotton  textiles  is  a  well-established  manufacturing  industry 
and  employs  more  workers  than  any  other  sector.  Production 
in  FY  1992  was  19  billion  square  meters  of  cloth  (see  table  25, 
Appendix).  In  Indian  textile  mills,  yarn  is  spun,  woven  into  fab- 
rics, and  processed  under  one  roof.  Production  as  a  share  of 
the  manufacturing  industry  fell  from  79  percent  in  1951  to 
under  30  percent  in  the  early  1990s  as  a  result  of  curbs  on 
capacity  expansion  and  new  equipment  and  differential  excise 
duties.  The  main  export  market  is  Russia  and  other  former 
Soviet  republics.  The  power-loom  sector  forms  the  largest  por- 
tion of  the  decentralized  part  of  the  textile  industry.  It 
expanded  from  24,000  units  in  1951  to  800,000  units  in  1989. 
Power-loom  fabric  dominates  India's  garment  export  industry. 
There  is  also  a  substantial  handloom  sector,  which  provides 
employment  in  rural  areas  (see  fig.  10). 

Steel  and  Aluminum 

After  independence,  successive  governments  placed  great 
emphasis  on  the  development  of  a  steel  industry.  In  FY  1991, 
the  six  major  plants,  of  which  five  were  in  the  public  sector, 
produced  10  million  tons.  The  rest  of  the  steel  production,  4.7 
million  tons,  came  from  180  small  plants,  almost  all  of  which 
were  in  the  private  sector.  Steel  production  more  than  doubled 
during  the  1980s  but  still  did  not  meet  demand  in  FY  1991, 
when  2.7  million  tons  were  imported.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the 
government  is  seeking  private-sector  investment  in  new  steel 
plants.  Production  is  projected  to  increase  substantially  as  the 
result  of  plans  to  set  up  a  1  million  ton  steel  plant  and  three 
pig-iron  plants  totalling  600,000  tons  capacity  in  West  Bengal, 
with  Chinese  technical  assistance  and  financial  investment. 

The  aluminum  industry  grew  from  5,000  tons  a  year  at  inde- 
pendence to  483,000  tons  in  FY  1992,  of  which  113,000  tons 


331

were  exported.  Analysts  believe  the  industry  has  a  good 
long-term  future  because  of  India's  abundant  supply  of  baux- 
ite. 

Fertilizer  and  Petrochemicals 

The  fertilizer  industry  is  another  major  industrial  sector.  In 
FY  1991,  production  reached  7.4  million  tons  of  nitrogen  and 
2.6  million  tons  of  phosphate.  In  the  early  1990s,  an  increasing 
share  of  fertilizer  production  came  from  private-sector  plants. 
Substantial  imports  were  necessary  in  FY  1990,  but  the  pros- 
pects for  expansion  of  domestic  production  are  good. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  petrochemical  industry  was  expand- 
ing rapidly.  It  produces  a  wide  variety  of  thermoplastics,  elas- 
tomers, synthetic  fibers,  and  chemicals.  Substantial  imports, 
however,  are  required  to  meet  domestic  demand.  Analysts  fore- 
cast a  major  expansion  in  production  during  the  1990s. 

Electronics  and  Motor  Vehicles 

The  engineering  sector  is  large  and  varied  and  provides 
around  12  percent  of  India's  exports  in  the  mid-1990s.  Two 
subsectors,  electronics  and  motor  vehicles,  are  the  most 
dynamic. 

Electronics  companies  benefited  from  the  economic  liberal- 
ization policies  of  the  1980s,  including  the  loosening  of  restric- 
tions on  technology  and  component  imports,  delicensing, 
foreign  investment,  and  reduction  of  excise  duties.  Output 
from  electronics  plants  grew  from  Rsl.8  billion  in  FY  1970  to 
Rs8.1  billion  in  FY  1980  and  to  Rsl23  billion  in  FY  1992.  Most 
of  the  expansion  took  place  in  the  production  of  computers 
and  consumer  electronics. 

Computer  production  rose  from  7,500  units  in  1985  to 
60,000  units  in  1988  and  to  an  estimated  200,000  units  in  1992. 
During  this  period,  major  advances  were  made  in  the  domestic 
computer  industry  that  led  to  further  sales. 

Consumer  electronics  account  for  about  30  percent  of  total 
electronics  production.  In  FY  1990,  production  included  5  mil- 
lion television  sets,  6  million  radios,  5  million  tape  recorders,  5 
million  electronic  watches,  and  140,000  video  cassette  record- 
ers. 

A  similar  expansion  occurred  in  the  motor  vehicle  industry. 
Until  the  1980s,  the  government  considered  automobiles  an 
unnecessary  luxury  and  discouraged  their  production  and  use.

Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Production  rose  from  30,000  cars  in  FY  1980  to  181,000  cars  in 
FY  1990. 

The  largest  company,  Maruti,  which  is  publicly  owned, 
exports  some  automobiles  to  Eastern  Europe  and  to  France 
and  became  a  net  foreign-exchange  earner  in  FY  1991.  The 
production  of  other  motor  vehicles  is  also  expanding.  In  FY 
1990,  India  produced  176,000  commercial  vehicles,  such  as 
trucks  and  buses,  and  1.8  million  two-wheeled  motor  vehicles. 
Following  the  government's  abolition  of  the  manufacturing 
licensing  system  in  March  1993,  British,  French,  German,  Ital- 
ian, and  United  States  manufacturers  and  firms  in  the  Repub- 
lic of  Korea  (South  Korea)  announced  they  would  join 
Japanese  and  other  South  Korean  companies  already  operating 
in  India  in  joint-venture  passenger  car  production  in  1995.  The 
growth  of  the  Indian  middle  class  sustains  such  industrial 
expansion  and  is  forcing  old-line  domestic  companies,  such  as 
Hindustan  Motors,  to  become  more  competitive. 

Construction 

Construction  contributes  5  to  6  percent  of  GDP  and  employs 
a  similar  proportion  of  the  organized  labor  force  plus  large 
numbers  of  people  in  the  informal  sector.  In  the  early  1990s, 
construction  absorbed  around  40  percent  of  public-sector  plan 
outlays,  and  more  than  1  million  workers  were  engaged  in  pub- 
lic-sector construction  projects.  Indian  firms  also  won  many 
construction  contracts  in  the  Middle  East  during  the  1980s  and 
early  1990s.  Most  companies  are  small  and  lack  access  to  mod- 
ern equipment. 

House  building  has  not  been  a  priority  of  the  government, 
and  a  housing  shortage  persists  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas. 
Analysts  believe  that  one-third  of  the  population  of  big  cities 
live  in  areas  officially  regarded  as  slums. 

Energy 

India  produces  nearly  90  percent  of  its  energy  requirements, 
65  percent  of  which  are  met  by  coal.  Although  commercial 
energy  production  has  expanded  substantially  since  indepen- 
dence, an  inadequate  supply  of  energy  remains  a  constraint  on 
industrial  growth.  Overall  growth  in  the  demand  for  energy 
was  rapid  in  the  early  1990s,  but  commercial  energy  consump- 
tion was  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  Much  energy  use  in  the 
subsistence  sector,  such  as  the  use  of  firewood  and  cattle  dung, 
is  unrecorded.  Analysts  believe  that  the  share  of  noncommer- 


335 


India:  A  Country  Study 


rial  energy  fell  from  around  65  percent  in  the  early  1950s  to  23 
percent  in  1991,  and  they  expect  this  proportion  to  fall  further 
during  the  1990s.  Most  commercial  energy  production  and  dis- 
tribution are  in  the  public  sector,  but  in  the  mid-1990s,  the  gov- 
ernment was  moving  slowly  to  encourage  the  entry  of  private 
capital. 

Coal 

The  coal  industry  is  a  key  segment  of  the  economy.  Reserves 
are  estimated  at  192  billion  tons,  78  billion  tons  of  which  are 
proven  reserves.  Additional  coal  exists  in  small  seams,  at  great 
depths,  and  in  undiscovered  locations.  The  bulk  of  the  coal 
found  has  been  in  Bihar,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Orissa,  and  West 
Bengal.  Known  reserves  should  last  well  into  the  twenty-first 
century.  In  the  1980s,  development  of  strip  mines  was  stressed 
over  underground  mines  because  of  the  speed  with  which  they 
could  be  exploited.  Most  of  the  industry  was  nationalized  in 
the  early  1970s.  Coal  India  Limited  was  established  in  1975  as 
the  government's  holding  company  for  several  operating  sub- 
sidiaries. Production  stagnated  in  the  second  half  of  the  1970s 
at  around  105  million  tons  after  an  initial  surge  in  production 
following  nationalization.  In  the  late  1970s  and  throughout  the 
1980s,  the  industry  was  plagued  by  the  flooding  of  mines,  seri- 
ous power  outages,  delays  in  commissioning  new  mines,  labor 
unrest,  lack  of  explosives,  poor  transportation,  and  environ- 
mental problems.  Government-set  coal  prices  did  not  cover 
operating  expenses  of  the  more  technically  difficult  mines. 
The  central  government  was  the  main  source  of  investment 
funds. 

Throughout  the  late  1970s  and  1980s,  the  coal  industry — 
along  with  the  electric  power  and  transportation  sectors — was  a 
critical  bottleneck  in  the  economy  and  particularly  handi- 
capped industrial  growth.  The  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (1985- 
89)  set  a  target  of  226  million  tons  for  coal  production  in  FY 
1989,  but  actual  production  reached  only  214  million  tons.  Pro- 
duction rose  to  241  million  tons  in  FY  1991  and  to  251  million 
tons  in  FY  1992.  The  annual  demand  for  coal  in  the  mid-1990s 
was  around  320  million  tons,  a  level  that  appeared  to  be  out  of 
reach  without  a  significant  leap  in  efficiency  and  large-scale 
investment.  Subsurface  mine  fires  in  Bihar,  some  of  which  have 
been  burning  since  1916,  have  consumed  some  37  million  tons 
of  coal  and  make  another  2  billion  tons  inaccessible.

Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Oil  and  Natural  Gas 

India  has  significant  amounts  of  oil  and  natural  gas,  and  four 
of  India's  top  six  revenue-generating  companies  are  in  the  oil 
and  natural  gas  business.  India  has  indigenous  sources  for 
around  60  percent  of  its  oil  needs  and  has  worked  diligently  to 
use  substitute  forms  of  energy  to  fulfill  the  other  40  percent. 
Oil  in  commercial  quantities  was  first  discovered  in  Assam  in 
1889.  The  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Commission  was  established  in 
1954  as  a  department  of  the  Geological  Survey  of  India,  but  a 
1959  act  of  Parliament  made  it,  in  effect,  the  country's  national 
oil  company.  Oil  India  Limited,  at  one  time  one-third  govern- 
ment owned,  was  also  established  in  1959  and  developed  an  oil 
field  that  had  been  discovered  by  the  Burmah  Oil  Company.  By 
1981  the  government  had  purchased  all  of  the  Burmah  Oil 
Company's  assets  in  India  and  completely  owned  Oil  India 
Limited.  The  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Commission  discovered  oil 
in  Gujarat  in  1959  and  opened  other  fields  in  the  1960s  and 
1970s. 

The  early  oil  fields  discovered  in  India  were  of  modest  size. 
Oil  production  amounted  to  200,000  tons  in  1950  and  400,000 
tons  in  1960.  By  the  early  1970s,  production  had  increased  to 
more  than  8  million  tons.  In  1974  the  Oil  and  Natural  Gas 
Commission  discovered  a  large  field — called  the  Bombay 
High — offshore  from  Bombay.  Production  from  that  field  was 
responsible  for  the  rapid  growth  of  the  country's  total  crude  oil 
production  in  the  late  1970s  and  throughout  the  1980s.  In  FY 
1989,  oil  production  peaked  at  34  million  tons,  of  which  Bom- 
bay High  accounted  for  22  million  tons.  In  the  early  1990s, 
wells  were  shut  in  offshore  fields  that  had  been  inefficiently 
exploited,  and  production  fell  to  27  million  tons  in  FY  1993. 
That  amount  did  not  meet  India's  needs,  and  30.7  million  tons 
of  crude  oil  were  imported  in  FY  1993. 

India  has  thirty-five  major  fields  onshore  (primarily  in  Assam 
and  Gujarat)  and  four  major  offshore  oil  fields  (near  Bombay, 
south  of  Pondicherry,  and  in  the  Palk  Strait).  Of  the  4,828 
wells,  in  1990  2,514  were  producing  at  a  rate  of  664,582  barrels 
per  day.  The  oil  field  with  the  greatest  output  is  Bombay  High, 
with  402,797  barrels  per  day  production  in  1990,  about  fifteen 
times  the  amount  produced  by  the  next  largest  fields.  Total 
reserves  are  estimated  at  6.1  billion  barrels. 

The  government  has  sanctioned  ambitious  exploration 
plans  to  raise  production  in  line  with  demand  and  to  exploit 
new  discoveries  as  rapidly  as  possible.  In  the  late  1980s  and 


337 


India:  A  Country  Study 

early  1990s,  there  were  encouraging  finds  in  Tamil  Nadu, 
Gujarat,  Andhra  Pradesh,  and  Assam;  many  of  these  discoveries 
were  made  offshore.  Officials  estimated  that  by  the  mid-1990s 
these  new  fields  could  contribute  as  much  as  15  million  to  20 
million  tons  in  new  production  and  that  total  crude  oil  produc- 
tion could  increase  to  51  million  tons  in  FY  1994.  In  the  early 
1990s,  the  government  renewed  attempts,  which  had  begun  in 
the  early  1980s,  to  interest  foreign  oil  companies  in  purchasing 
exploration  and  production  leases.  These  efforts  drew  only  a 
modest  response  because  the  terms  offered  were  difficult,  and 
foreign  companies  remained  suspicious  of  India's  investment 
climate.  One  response,  agreed  on  in  January  1995,  was  an 
Indian-Kuwaiti  joint  venture  to  invest  in  a  new  oil  refinery  to  be 
built  on  the  east  coast  of  India. 

Substantial  quantities  of  natural  gas  are  produced  in  associa- 
tion with  crude  oil  production.  Until  the  1980s,  most  of  this  gas 
was  flared  off  because  there  were  no  pipelines  or  processing 
facilities  to  bring  it  to  customers.  In  the  early  1980s,  large 
investments  were  made  to  bring  gases  from  Bombay  High  and 
other  offshore  fields  ashore  for  use  as  fuel  and  to  supply  feed- 
stock to  fertilizer  and  petrochemical  plants,  which  also  had  to 
be  constructed  or  converted  to  use  gas.  By  the  mid-1980s,  natu- 
ral gas  could  be  delivered  to  facilities  near  Bombay  and  near 
Kandla  in  Gujarat.  In  the  mid-1990s,  a  1,700-kilometer 
trans-India  pipeline  was  being  built;  the  pipeline  will  link  the 
facilities  near  Bombay  and  Kandla  to  a  series  of  gas-based  fertil- 
izer plants  and  power  stations.  Officials  envisage  a  grid  system 
covering  11,500  kilometers  by  FY  2004,  which  will  supply  120 
million  cubic  meters  of  gas  a  day.  Total  production  in  FY  1992 
was  18.1  billion  cubic  meters. 

India's  need  for  oil  and  petroleum-based  products — about 
40  million  tons  per  year — far  exceeded  its  domestic  production 
capabilities  of  28  million  tons  per  year  in  the  early  1990s.  Given 
India's  dependency  on  Persian  Gulf  resources,  proposals  were 
made  in  the  early  1990s  to  develop  natural  gas  pipelines  from 
Iran,  Qatar,  and  Oman  that  would  run  under  the  Arabian  Sea 
to  one  or  more  west  coast  terminals.  To  assist  with  oil  and  natu- 
ral gas  production,  in  1992  the  government  decided  to  open 
reserves  to  private  offshore  developers.  In  February  1994,  con- 
tracts were  awarded  for  three  offshore  fields  in  the  Arabian  Sea 
to  an  Indian-United  States  consortium  and  one  in  the  Bay  of 
Bengal  to  an  Indian-Australian-Japanese  consortium.  In  June 


338 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

1995,  an  agreement  was  reached  to  set  a  joint-venture  company 
to  construct  the  first  leg  of  the  pipeline,  from  Iran  to  Pakistan. 

Electric  Power 

The  electric  power  industry  is  both  a  supplier  and  a  con- 
sumer of  primary  energy,  depending  on  the  kind  of  energy 
used  to  turn  the  generators.  Hydroelectric  and  nuclear  power 
plants  add  to  the  country's  supply  of  primary  energy.  The  total 
installed  electricity  capacity  in  public  utilities  in  1992  was 
69,100  megawatts,  of  which  70  percent  was  thermal,  27  percent 
hydropower,  and  3  percent  nuclear.  The  total  installed  capacity 
was  programmed  to  reach  around  100,000  megawatts  by  FY 
1996  through  a  package  of  government-supported  incentives 
to  the  private  sector. 

Because  they  cannot  always  depend  on  public  utilities,  many 
larger  industrial  enterprises  have  developed  their  own  power 
generation  systems.  In  1992  there  was  a  capacity  of  9,000  mega- 
watts outside  the  public  utility  system.  Overall,  the  generation 
and  transmission  of  power — with  an  average  57  percent  plant 
load  factor  in  FY  1992  in  thermal  plants  and  transmission  losses 
of  22  percent — were  inefficient.  About  322  billion  kilowatt- 
hours  of  power  were  generated  by  utilities  in  FY  1992,  approxi- 
mately 8.5  percent  shy  of  demand.  The  resulting  deficit  led  to 
acute  shortages  in  some  states.  This  trend  continued  the  next 
year  when  315  billion  kilowatt-hours  were  produced.  Many  fac- 
tors contributed  to  the  shortfall  of  electric  power,  including 
slow  completion  of  new  installations,  low  use  of  installed  capac- 
ity because  of  insufficient  maintenance  and  coal,  and  poor 
management.  In  FY  1990,  industry  accounted  for  45  percent  of 
electricity  consumed,  agriculture  26  percent,  and  domestic  use 
16.5  percent.  Other  sectors,  including  commerce  and  rail- 
roads, accounted  for  the  remaining  12.5  percent. 

Rural  electrification  made  great  progress  in  the  1980s;  more 
than  200,000  villages  received  electricity  for  the  first  time.  In 
1990  around  84  percent  of  India's  villages  had  access  to  elec- 
tricity. Most  of  the  villages  without  electricity  were  in  Bihar, 
Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West  Bengal.  Villagers 
complain  that  government  figures  on  electrification  of  villages 
are  artificially  inflated.  Actually,  although  lines  have  been  run 
to  most  villages,  electricity  is  provided  only  sporadically  (for 
example,  only  nine  to  twelve  hours  per  day),  and  villagers  feel 
they  cannot  depend  on  electricity  to  operate  pumps  and  other 


339 


India:  A  Country  Study 

equipment.  Electricity  to  cities  also  is  sporadic;  blackouts  occur 
every  day  in  most  cities. 

India's  first  hydroelectric  station  was  constructed  in  1897  in 
Darjiling  (then  Darjeeling).  In  FY  1990,  installed  capacity  for 
hydroelectric  power  was  18,000  megawatts.  The  country  has  a 
large  economically  exploitable  hydroelectric  potential,  espe- 
cially in  the  foothills  of  the  Himalayas,  but  no  large  increase  in 
capacity  is  predicted  for  the  mid-1990s.  Hydroelectric  facilities 
have  to  be  coordinated  with  other  sources  of  electricity  because 
seasonal  and  annual  variations  in  rainfall  affect  the  amount  of 
water  needed  to  turn  the  generators  and  consequently  the 
amount  of  electricity  that  can  be  produced. 

Hydroelectric  power  projects  have  not  been  without  contro- 
versy. Dams  for  irrigation  and  power  generation  have  displaced 
people  and  raised  the  specter  of  ecological  problems. 

Nuclear  Power 

Nuclear-power  developments  are  under  the  purview  of  the 
Nuclear  Power  Corporation  of  India,  a  government-owned 
entity  under  the  Department  of  Atomic  Energy.  The  corpora- 
tion is  responsible  for  designing,  constructing,  and  operating 
nuclear-power  plants.  In  1995  there  were  nine  operational 
plants  with  a  potential  total  capacity  of  1,800  megawatts,  about 
3  percent  of  India's  total  power  generation.  There  are  two  units 
each  in  Tarapur,  north  of  Bombay  in  Maharashtra;  in  Rawat- 
bhata  in  Rajasthan;  in  Kalpakkam  near  Madras  in  Tamil  Nadu; 
and  in  Narora  in  Uttar  Pradesh;  and  one  unit  in  Kakrapur  in 
southeastern  Gujarat.  However,  of  the  nine  plants,  all  have 
been  faced  with  safety  problems  that  have  shut  down  reactors 
for  periods  ranging  from  months  to  years.  The  Rajasthan 
Atomic  Power  Station  in  Rawatbhata  was  closed  indefinitely,  as 
of  February  1995.  Moreover,  environmental  problems,  caused 
by  radiation  leaks,  have  cropped  up  in  communities  near 
Rawatbhata.  Other  plants  operate  at  only  a  fraction  of  their 
capacity,  and  some  foreign  experts  consider  them  the  most 
inefficient  nuclear-power  plants  in  the  world. 

In  addition  to  the  nine  established  plants,  seven  reactors  are 
under  construction  in  the  mid-1990s:  one  at  Kakrapur  and  two 
each  at  Kaiga,  on  the  coast  of  Karnataka,  Rawatbhata,  and  Tara- 
pur, which,  when  finished,  will  bring  an  additional  2,320  mega- 
watts of  energy  online.  Construction  of  ten  additional  reactors 
is  in  the  planning  stage  for  Kaiga,  Rawatbhata,  and  Kudangu- 
lam  in  Tamil  Nadu,  which,  when  combined,  will  supply  4,800

megawatts  capacity.  The  overall  plan  is  to  increase  nuclear-gen- 
eration capacity  to  10,000  megawatts  by  FY  2000,  but  work  has 
been  slowed  because  of  financial  shortages.  India  partially  over- 
came its  shortage  of  enriched  uranium— needed  to  fuel  the 
Tarapur  units— by  imports  from  China,  starting  in  1995. 

Mining  and  Quarrying 

For  a  country  of  its  size,  India  does  not  have  a  great  deal  of 
mineral  wealth  (see  fig.  11).  Mining  accounted  for  less  than  2 
percent  of  GDP  in  FY  1990.  Nonetheless,  iron  and  bauxite  are 
found  in  sufficient  quantities  to  base  industries  on  their  extrac- 
tion and  processing.  Assessment  of  the  country's  resources  by 
the  Geological  Survey  of  India  is  still  far  from  complete  in  the 
mid-1990s,  and  observers  do  not  rule  out  the  possibility  of 
important  new  finds. 

In  1992  reserves  of  iron  ore  were  estimated  at  among  the 
world's  largest — at  19.2  billion  tons.  Extraction  capacity  is  67 
million  tons  of  ore  per  year,  but  only  53  million  tons  were  pro- 
duced in  FY  1992.  About  60  percent  of  output  is  exported, 
mainly  to  the  South  Korea  and  Japan.  The  largest  iron  ore  min- 
ing project  is  at  Kudremukh,  Chikmagalore  District,  Karnataka. 
India  also  has  abundant  bauxite,  the  main  mineral  source  for 
aluminum.  Reserves  are  estimated  at  about  2.7  billion  tons,  or 
8  percent  of  the  world  total.  In  FY  1991,  512,000  tons  of  alumi- 
num were  produced,  of  which  61,000  tons  were  exported.  Most 
bauxite  mines  are  in  Bihar  and  Karnataka.  India  is  the  world's 
third  largest  producer  of  manganese,  and  its  mines  extracted 
around  1.4  million  tons  of  manganese  ore  per  year  in  the  early 
1990s  from  a  total  estimated  reserve  of  180  million  tons.  India 
also  has  significant  reserves  of  copper,  estimated  at  422  million 
tons.  However,  the  production  of  copper,  at  46,000  tons  in  FY 
1991,  fell  well  short  of  domestic  demand.  Most  copper  mines 
are  in  Bihar  and  Rajasthan.  Smaller  amounts  of  lead,  zinc,  and 
mica  are  also  produced. 

Ownership  and  the  power  to  grant  mineral  concessions  gen- 
erally have  rested  with  the  state  governments.  The  central  gov- 
ernment, however,  has  exerted  considerable  influence  over 
such  leases,  particularly  in  cases  of  important  and  strategic 
minerals.  In  fact,  most  mining  of  important  and  strategic  min- 
erals is  undertaken  by  central  government  enterprises  in  which 
states  sometimes  hold  part  ownership.  In  the  early  1990s,  ura- 
nium ore  was  mined,  milled,  and  processed  only  in  Bihar;  rare 
earths — including  mineral  sands,  monazite,  ilmenite,  rutile, 


341 


India:  A  Country  Study 

zircon,  rare  earths  chloride,  and  others — were  mined  in  Tamil 
Nadu,  Kerala,  and  Orissa.  During  this  period,  the  central  gov- 
ernment was  attempting  to  increase  the  private  sector's  share 
of  this  industry. 

Transportation 

Transportation  is  a  large  and  varied  sector  of  the  economy. 
Modes  of  conveyance  for  goods  range  from  people's  heads  (on 
which  loads  are  balanced)  and  bicycle  rickshaws  to  trucks  and 
railroad  cars.  The  national  railroad  was  the  major  freight 
hauler  at  independence,  but  road  transport  grew  rapidly  after 
1947.  Both  rail  and  road  transport  remain  important. 

The  share  of  transportation  investments  in  total  public 
investment  declined  during  the  period  from  the  early  1950s  to 
the  early  1980s;  real  public  transportation  investment  also 
declined  during  much  of  that  period  because  of  the  need  for 
funds  in  the  rest  of  the  economy.  As  a  consequence,  by  the 
early  1980s  the  transportation  system  was  barely  meeting  the 
needs  of  the  nation  or  preparing  for  future  economic  growth. 
Many  roads,  for  example,  were  breaking  up  because  of  overuse 
and  lack  of  maintenance;  railroads  required  new  track  and  roll- 
ing stock.  Ports  needed  equipment  and  facilities,  particularly 
for  bulk  and  container  cargo;  and  at  many  airports  the  national 
civil  airlines  needed  supporting  equipment,  including  provi- 
sion for  instrument  landings.  The  government  planned  to 
devote  19  percent  of  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1992-96)  bud- 
get to  transportation  and  communications,  up  from  the  16  per- 
cent devoted  to  the  sector  during  the  seventh  plan. 

Although  there  is  a  large  private-sector  involvement  in  trans- 
portation, government  plays  a  large  regulatory  and  develop- 
mental role.  The  central  government  has  ministries  to  handle 
civil  aviation,  railroads,  and  surface  transportation.  Counter- 
part agencies  are  found  at  the  state  and  union  territory  level. 
Critical  to  improving  the  entire  transportation  sector  in  the 
late  1990s  is  the  ability  of  the  sector  to  adjust  to  the  central  gov- 
ernment's national  reform  initiatives,  including  privatization, 
deregulation,  and  reduced  subsidies.  The  sector  must  also 
adjust  to  foreign  trade  expansion,  demographic  pressures  and 
increasing  urbanization,  technological  change  and  obsoles- 
cence, energy  availability,  and  environmental  and  public  safety 
concerns.

Railroads 

India's  railroad  system  is  the  government's  largest  public 
enterprise  (see  fig.  12).  Its  route  length  extends  62,458  kilome- 
ters. The  railroads  of  India  are  the  fourth  most  heavily  used  sys- 
tem in  the  world,  which  suggests  the  large  investment  made  in 
rail  transportation.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  railroad  system 
employed  1.7  million  people  and  carried  around  66  percent  of 
India's  goods  traffic  (some  350  million  tons  in  FY  1992)  and  40 
percent  of  passenger  traffic  (3.7  billion  passenger  journeys  in 
FY  1992). 

Indian  Railways  is  administered  and  managed  by  the  Railway 
Board,  which  is  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Railways.  The 
minister  of  railways  is  assisted  by  the  minister  of  state  for  rail- 
ways. Indian  Railways  is  Asia's  largest  railroad  system  and  the 
second  largest  state-owned  system  under  a  single  management 
in  the  world.  The  62,458  kilometers  of  route-length  track  run 
in  three  gauges:  narrow  gauge  (610  and  762  millimeters), 
meter  gauge  (1,000  millimeters),  and  broad  gauge  (1,676  milli- 
meters). Around  17  percent,  or  about  11,000  kilometers,  of  all 
gauges  is  electrified,  and  about  27  percent,  or  10,859  kilome- 
ters, of  the  broad-gauge  track  is  electrified.  Some  14,600  kilo- 
meters are  double  or  multiple  tracked.  As  of  FY  1991,  there 
were  some  116,000  railroad  bridges  and  some  7,100  railroad 
stations. 

The  railroad  system  is  divided  into  nine  zones:  central,  east- 
ern, northern,  northeastern,  northeast  frontier,  southern, 
south-central,  southeastern,  and  western.  As  of  FY  1993,  Indian 
Railways  had  1,725  steam,  4,069  diesel,  and  2,012  electric  loco- 
motives; 3,444  electric  multiple-unit  coaches;  30,298  conven- 
tional passenger  coaches;  6,163  other  passenger  cars 
(including  luggage  and  mail  cars  in  which  passengers  some- 
times travel);  and  337,562  freight  cars  of  all  kinds. 

The  Eighth  Five- Year  Plan  provided  for  a  Rs45  trillion  invest- 
ment in  railroad  development.  Priority  was  to  be  given  to  track 
and  roadbed  renovation,  additional  electrification,  conversion 
of  high-use  meter-gauge  lines  to  broad-gauge  track,  the 
replacement  of  all  steam  locomotives,  and  improved  signalling 
and  telecommunications.  By  1992,  however,  the  funds  actually 
approved  by  the  government  were  only  80  percent  of  the 
eighth  plan's  amount,  and  only  42  percent  would  be  covered  by 
the  central  government  budget.  Indian  Railways  was  expected 
to  come  up  with  the  balance.  Thus,  in  FY  1994,  the  outlay  was 
set  at  Rs65.1  billion;  Rsll.5  billion  was  to  come  from  central 


345 


344 


India:  A  Country  Study 


government  revenues,  Rs43.1  billion  from  internal  railroad 
resources,  and  Rsl0.5  billion  from  loans.  Some  of  the  invest- 
ment funds,  as  in  the  past,  were  expected  from  the  World 
Bank.  The  only  way  to  cover  these  outlays  with  such  low  budget- 
ary support  was  with  drastic  increases  in  fares  and  rates  in  pas- 
senger service.  In  FY  1993,  Indian  Railways  made  capital 
expenditures  amounting  to  US$2  billion  for  items  such  as  new 
rolling  stock,  new  line  construction,  track  renewal,  and  electri- 
fication. 

An  example  of  the  scale  of  new  rail  line  construction  is  the 
new  broad-gauge  high-speed  Konkan  Railway,  a  760-kilometer 
coastal  connection  between  Bombay  and  Mangalore  featuring 
fifty-five  stations,  seventy-three  tunnels,  143  major  bridges,  and 
some  1,670  minor  bridges.  The  line  crosses  several  mountain 
ranges  and  runs  some  380  kilometers  through  an  earthquake- 
prone  zone.  Besides  opening  up  an  all-weather  transportation 
infrastructure  between  two  important  cities,  it  cuts  the  distance 
by  rail  between  them  by  1,127  circuitous  kilometers. 

India  has  a  major  railroad-equipment  production  industry. 
Although  some  state-of-the-art  electrical  components  and 
equipment  are  imported,  India  is  developing  sufficient  indus- 
trial capacity  to  meet  most  of  its  standard  locomotive  and  pas- 
senger-car and  ancillary  equipment  needs  and  has  made  plans 
to  export  locomotives.  The  Research,  Design,  and  Standards 
Organisation  of  Indian  Railways  engages  in  research  and  simu- 
lations aimed  at  further  improving  the  quality  of  domestic 
achievements,  which  have  included  high-speed  passenger 
trains  (up  to  140  kilometers  per  hour)  and  freight  trains  (up  to 
80  kilometers  per  hour)  and  solid-state  signalling  equipment. 
Because  some  two-thirds  of  the  nation's  freight  is  carried  by 
train,  there  is  a  serious  freight  car  shortage.  To  overcome  this 
and  other  industry-related  rail  transportation  problems,  Indian 
Railways  envisions  having  to  import  up  to  5,000  freight  cars  a 
year. 

Rapid  Transit 

India  also  has  two  rapid-rail  systems  and  a  third  in  the  plan- 
ning stage.  The  most  advanced  is  the  world-class  metro  system 
in  Calcutta  that  opened  in  1984  and  carried  50,000  passengers 
daily  in  1992-93.  It  uses  Indian-made  subway  cars  that  run  on 
the  initial  ten  kilometers  of  what  will  be  a  16.5  kilometer-long, 
seventeen-station  (eleven  stations  were  in  service  in  1995) 
route  scheduled  for  completion  in  1995.  Plans  for  more  than

sixty  additional  kilometers  are  on  the  books.  Calcutta  is  also 
served  by  a  seventy-seven-kilometer-long  tramway  network, 
which  is  to  be  phased  out  because  of  large  annual  losses  despite 
a  government  subsidy.  In  1992  Calcutta  Tramways  started  run- 
ning more  reliable  buses  on  some  routes. 

Rapid  transit  systems  are  also  in  operation  or  being  planned 
for  Madras  and  New  Delhi.  The  Madras  system  opened  8.5  kilo- 
meters— of  a  planned  21.7  kilometers — of  single-track  service 
in  1991,  using  broad-gauge  Indian  Railways  electric  multiple- 
unit  vehicles.  When  completed  in  2011,  the  New  Delhi  system, 
in  the  planning  stages  since  the  late  1980s,  will  include  some 
220  kilometers  of  underground  and  elevated  track  and  a  light- 
rail  system  of  300  kilometers.  In  1994  the  Ministry  of  State  for 
Surface  Transport  tendered  bids  for  the  first  phase,  a  167-kilo- 
meter elevated  high-speed  tram  system  to  operate  on  nine  cor- 
ridors throughout  the  National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi. 
Bombay  is  served  by  a  suburban  rail  network  that  began  opera- 
tion in  1992. 

The  Road  System 

India  has  nearly  2  million  kilometers  of  roads:  960,000  kilo- 
meters of  surfaced  roads  and  more  than  1  million  kilometers  of 
roads  constructed  of  gravel,  crushed  stone,  or  earth.  Fifty-three 
highways,  just  under  20,000  kilometers  in  total  length,  are 
rated  as  national  highways,  but  they  carry  about  40  percent  of 
the  road  traffic.  To  improve  road  transportation,  significant 
efforts  were  begun  in  the  1980s  to  build  roads  to  link  major 
highways,  to  widen  existing  roads  from  single  to  double  lanes, 
and  to  construct  major  bridges. 

These  road-building  achievements  represent  an  impressive 
expansion  from  the  1950  total  of  400,000  kilometers  of  roads 
of  all  kinds,  but  more  than  25  percent  of  villages  still  have  no 
road  link,  and  about  60  percent  have  no  all-weather  road  link. 
These  statistics,  however,  mask  important  regional  variations. 
Almost  all  villages  in  Kerala,  Haryana,  and  Punjab  are  served 
by  all-weather  roads.  By  contrast,  only  15  percent  of  villages  in 
Orissa  and  21  percent  in  Rajasthan  are  connected  with  all- 
weather  roads.  The  quality  of  roads,  including  major  highways, 
is  poor  by  international  standards.  Nonetheless,  roads  carry 
about  60  percent  of  all  passenger  traffic. 

The  central  and  state  governments  share  responsibilities  for 
road  building  and  maintaining  roads  and  for  some  transporta- 
tion companies.  The  Ministry  of  State  for  Surface  Transport 


349

India:  A  Country  Study 


administers  the  national  highway  system,  and  state  highways 
and  other  state  roads  are  maintained  by  state  public  works 
departments.  Minor  roads  are  maintained  by  municipalities, 
districts,  and  villages.  Still  other  roads,  about  22,000  kilometers 
in  total  in  1991,  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Border  Roads 
Development  Board,  a  central  government  organization  estab- 
lished in  1960  to  facilitate  economic  development  and  defense 
preparedness,  especially  in  the  north  and  northeast. 

Motor  Vehicles 

The  number  of  registered  vehicles  increased  from  300,000 
in  FY  1950  to  5.2  million  in  FY  1980  and  23.4  million  in  FY 
1991.  India  now  has  more  than  375,000  buses  and  800,000 
trucks.  About  40  percent  of  bus  transport  is  in  the  public  sec- 
tor. Major  urban  bus  lines  are  found  in  cities  such  as  Bombay, 
Calcutta,  New  Delhi,  Madras,  and  other  major  urban  agglomer- 
ates. Bombay,  India's  largest  city,  for  example,  had  some  3,000 
buses  running  on  339  routes  and  carrying  1.6  billion  passen- 
gers per  year  in  FY  1992.  The  National  Capital  Territory  of 
Delhi,  with  more  than  3,800  buses  and  870  routes,  carried 
nearly  1.4  billion  passengers  in  that  year,  and  the  Madras  bus 
system,  with  some  2,300  vehicles  and  428  routes,  carried 
around  1.3  billion  passengers.  Because  it  has  a  subway  system  in 
place,  Calcutta's  bus  service  is  considerably  smaller.  Calcutta 
had  1,200  buses  and  202  routes  and  carried  308  million  passen- 
gers per  year  in  FY  1992.  There  are  also  unregulated  bus  ser- 
vices in  some  cities  as  well  as  extensive  suburban  and 
interurban  and  rural  bus  services. 

Truck  transportation  is  largely  in  private  hands.  Two-wheel 
and  three-wheel  vehicles  also  play  a  major  role  in  hauling  pas- 
sengers and  freight.  Emissions  control  is  very  low  by  interna- 
tional standards,  and  fumes  from  motor  vehicles  contribute 
mightily  to  India's  air  pollution.  New  Delhi  ranks  among  the 
ten  most  polluted  cities  in  the  world,  according  to  the  World 
Health  Organization.  Automotive  traffic  causes  much  of  the 
pollution. 

Ports,  Maritime  Transportation,  and  Inland  Waterways 

India  has  eleven  major  seaports:  Kandla,  Bombay,  Nhava 
Sheva,  Marmagao,  New  Mangalore,  and  Kochi  (formerly 
known  as  Cochin)  on  the  west  coast,  and  Calcutta-Haldia,  Para- 
dip,  Vishakhapatnam,  Madras,  and  Tuticorin  on  the  east  coast. 
The  port  at  Nhava  Sheva,  located  across  the  harbor  from  Bom-

bay  Port,  was  established  in  1982  under  the  administration  of 
the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  Port  Trust  as  a  separate  port  rather  than 
an  adjunct  to  Bombay.  The  eleven  ports  are  the  responsibility 
of  the  Ministry  of  State  for  Surface  Transport  but  are  managed 
by  semi-independent  port  trusts  overseen  by  boards  appointed 
by  the  ministry  from  government  departments,  including  the 
navy,  port  labor  and  industry,  and  ship  owners  and  shipping 
companies. 

In  order  of  gross  weight  tonnage  conveyed  annually,  Bom- 
bay, Vishakhapatnam,  Madras,  and  Marmagao  are  the  most 
important  ports.  In  addition,  there  are  some  139  minor  work- 
ing ports  along  the  two  coasts  and  on  offshore  islands  adminis- 
tered  by  local,  state,  or  union  territory  maritime 
administrations.  Total  traffic  at  the  eleven  major  ports 
increased  from  107  million  tons  in  FY  1984  to  179  million  tons 
in  FY  1993.  In  FY  1993,  some  US$250  million  in  profits  were 
earned,  an  achievement  that  attracted  some  US$4.5  billion  in 
foreign  investments  in  the  ports  in  FY1992-FY1993. 

In  1995  there  were  three  government-owned  shipping  cor- 
porations, the  most  important  of  which  was  the  Shipping  Cor- 
poration of  India.  There  were  also  between  fifty  and  sixty 
private  companies  operating  a  total  of  443  vessels  amounting  to 


351 


India:  A  Country  Study 


6.3  million  gross  registered  tons,  more  than  300  of  which  were 
1,000  gross  registered  tons  or  more.  Indian  tonnage  repre- 
sented 1.7  percent  of  the  world  total.  Overall,  the  share  of 
Indian  vessels  in  total  Indian  trade  is  around  35  percent. 
Approximately  40  to  50  percent  of  capacity  is  underused.  As  a 
result  of  the  global  slump  of  the  late  1980s,  shipping  compa- 
nies experienced  financial  difficulties;  the  leading  private  ship- 
ping company,  Scindia  Steam  Navigation  Company,  collapsed 
in  19S7.  The  collapse  left  most  Indian  shipping  under  public 
ownership.  The  government's  director  general  of  shipping  pro- 
vides oversight  for  all  aspects  of  shipping. 

India  has  four  major  and  three  medium-sized  shipyards,  all 
government  run.  The  Cochin  Shipyards  in  Kochi,  Hindustan 
Shipyard  in  Vishakhapatnam,  and  Hooghly  Dock  and  Port 
Engineers  in  Calcutta  are  the  most  important  shipbuilding 
enterprises  in  India.  Thirn-five  smaller  shipvards  are  in  the  pri- 
vate sector.  Drydocks  at  Kochi  and  Vishakhapatnam  accommo- 
date the  nation's  major  ship  repair  needs. 

In  addition  to  its  coastal  and  ocean  trade  routes,  India  has 
more  than  16,000  kilometers  of  inland  waterways.  Of  that  num- 
ber, more  than  3,600  kilometers  are  navigable  by  large  vessels, 
although  in  practice  only  about  2,000  kilometers  are  used. 
Inland  waters  are  regulated  by  the  Inland  Waterways  Authority 
of  India,  which  was  established  in  1986  to  develop,  maintain, 
and  regulate  the  nation's  waterways  and  to  advise  the  central 
and  state  governments  on  inland  waterway  development. 

Civil  Aviation 

Air  transportation  is  under  the  purview  of  the  Department 
of  Civil  Aviation,  a  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Aviation  and 
Tourism.  In  1995  the  government  owned  two  airlines  and  one 
helicopter  service,  and  private  companies  owned  six  airlines. 

The  government-owned  airlines  dominated  India's  air  trans- 
portation  in  the  mid-1990s.  Air  India  is  the  international  car- 
rier: it  carried  more  than  2.2  million  passengers  in  FY  1992. 
Indian  Airlines  is  the  major  domestic  carrier  and  also  runs 
international  flights  to  nearby  countries.  It  carried  9.8  million 
passengers  in  FY  1989,  when  it  had  a  load  factor  of  more  than 
80  percent  in  its  fifty-nine  airplanes.  Analysts,  however,  attrib- 
uted this  high  load  factor  to  a  shortage  of  capacity  rather  than 
efficiency  of  operation.  A  major  expansion  was  planned  for  the 
1990s,  but  an  airplane  crash  in  1990  and  a  pilots'  strike  in  1991 
damaged  the  airline,  which  carried  only  7.8  million  passengers

in  FY  1992.  Two  other  accidents  in  1993,  plus  several  hijack- 
ings, put  constraints  on  the  growth  of  both  airlines. 

A  third  government-owned  airline,  Vayudoot,  was  also  a 
domestic  carrier  in  the  early  1990s.  It  provided  feeder  service 
between  smaller  cities  and  the  larger  places  served  by  Air  India 
and  Indian  Airlines.  By  1994  Indian  Airlines  had  taken  over 
Vayudoot.  Another  publicly  owned  company,  Pawan  Hans,  runs 
helicopter  service,  mostly  to  offshore  locations  and  other  areas 
that  cannot  be  served  by  fixed-wing  aircraft. 

In  1995  India's  six  private  airlines  accounted  for  more  than 
10  percent  of  domestic  air  traffic.  Both  the  number  of  carriers 
and  their  market  share  are  expected  to  rise  in  the  mid-1990s. 
The  four  major  private  airlines  are  East  West  Airlines,  Jagsons 
Airlines,  Continental  Aviation,  and  Damania  Airways. 

In  addition  to  the  Indian-owned  airlines,  many  foreign  air- 
lines provide  international  service.  In  1995  forty-two  airlines 
operated  air  services  to,  from,  and  through  India. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  India  had  288  usable  airports.  Of  these, 
208  had  permanent-surface  runways  and  two  had  runways  of 
more  than  3,659  meters,  fifty-nine  had  runways  of  between 
2,400  and  3,659  meters,  and  ninety-two  had  runways  between 
1,200  and  2,439  meters.  There  are  major  international  airports 
at  Bombay,  Delhi,  Calcutta,  Madras,  and  Thiruvananthapuram 
(Trivandrum),  under  the  management  of  the  International 
Airport  Authority  of  India.  International  service  also  operates 
from  Marmagao,  Bangalore,  and  Hyderabad.  A  consortium  of 
Indian  and  British  companies  signed  a  memorandum  of  under- 
standing with  the  state  government  of  Maharashtra  in  June 
1995  to  build  a  new  international  airport  for  Bombay,  across 
the  harbor  from  the  main  city  and  to  be  linked  by  a  cross-har- 
bor roadway.  Major  regional  airports  are  located  at  Ahmada- 
bad,  Allahabad,  Pune,  Srinagar,  Chandigarh,  Kochi,  and 
Nagpur. 

Telecommunications 

National  Policy 

In  1994  the  government  issued  its  National  Telecommunica- 
tions Policy.  The  policy  was  issued  in  recognition  of  the  "urgent 
need"  to  provide  universal  access  to  basic  telecommunications 
services  by  1997  and  offers  guidelines  for  entry  of  the  private 
sector  into  basic  telecommunications  services.  To  facilitate  pri- 
vate-sector participation,  licensing  procedures  were  established 


354 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

in  the  Department  of  Telecommunications,  and  equity  partici- 
pation for  companies  registered  in  India  (with  51  or  more  per- 
cent Indian  ownership)  was  anticipated.  Private-sector  licenses, 
however,  were  to  be  granted  only  for  local  (versus  long-dis- 
tance) telecommunications  networks.  An  autonomous  body, 
the  Telecommunications  Authority  of  India,  was  established  to 
regulate  private-sector  activity. 

Telephone 

The  telephone  system,  like  many  other  aspects  of  telecom- 
munications, is  in  the  government  sector,  under  the  control  of 
the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Broadcasting.  The  moderniza- 
tion of  the  telephone  system  has  been  underway  since  1986 
when  Mahanagar  Telephone  Nigam,  a  government  corpora- 
tion, was  established  to  operate  systems  in  Bombay  and  New 
Delhi,  and  Videsh  Sanchar  Nigam,  also  government  owned, 
was  set  up  as  the  overseas  carrier.  Progress  was  slow,  however; 
the  rest  of  the  nation's  service  continued  as  a  civil-service-run 
operation  under  the  Department  of  Telecommunications  until 
1994  when  basic  telephone  services  were  opened  to  private-sec- 
tor competition. 

The  number  of  telephone  connections  rose  from  800,000  in 
FY  1968  to  8  million  in  FY  1994.  The  system  remains  substan- 
dard by  international  standards,  however,  and  there  is  a  waiting 
list  for  connections  of  2.8  million  people.  Sometimes  several 
years  elapse  between  application  and  installation  of  a  tele- 
phone line.  Close  to  1  million  new  connections  a  year  are 
being  established  in  the  mid-1990s.  Plans  for  increasing  the 
capacity  of  the  system  to  handle  more  directly  dialed  calls  were 
being  implemented  in  the  early  1990s,  and  20  million  lines 
should  be  in  operation  by  FY  2000.  This  number  is  very  low  for 
a  population  that  by  then  will  probably  exceed  1  billion.  Tele- 
phone line  density  was  less  than  0.7  per  100  persons  in  1994, 
one  of  the  lowest  densities  among  the  major  nations  of  Asia. 

There  also  are  submarine  telecommunications  cables  link- 
ing India  with  Malaysia  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates. 
Although  the  government  is  a  major  manufacturer  of  tele- 
phone equipment,  the  private  sector — especially  foreign  ven- 
tures— is  becoming  increasingly  involved  in  manufacturing  in 
the  mid-1990s  and  paging,  cellular  phone  service,  and  elec- 
tronic mail  are  being  introduced.

Radio 

Radio  broadcasting  is  a  government  monopoly  under  the 
Directorate  General  of  All  India  Radio — established  in  1936 
and  since  1957  also  known  as  Akashvani — a  government- 
owned,  semicommercial  operation  of  the  Ministry  of  Informa- 
tion and  Broadcasting.  From  only  six  stations  at  the  time  of 
independence,  All  India  Radio's  network  had  expanded  by  the 
mid-1990s  to  146  AM  stations  plus  a  National  Channel,  the 
Integrated  North-East  Service  (aimed  at  tribal  groups  in  north- 
east India),  and  the  External  Service.  There  are  five  regional 
headquarters  for  All  India  Radio:  the  North  Zone  in  New 
Delhi;  the  North-East  Zone  in  Guwahati,  Assam;  the  East  Zone 
in  Calcutta;  the  West  Zone  in  Bombay;  and  the  South  Zone  in 
Madras. 

The  government-owned  network  provides  both  national  and 
local  programs  in  Hindi,  English,  and  sixteen  regional  lan- 
guages. Commercial  services,  which  were  inaugurated  in  1967, 
are  provided  by  Vividh  Bharati  Service,  headquartered  in  Bom- 
bay. Vividh  Bharati,  which  accepts  advertisements,  broadcasts 
from  thirty-one  AM  and  FM  stations  in  the  mid-1990s. 

India  has  an  extensive  network  of  mediumwave  and  short- 
wave stations.  In  1994  there  were  eighty-five  FM  stations  and 
seventy-three  shortwave  stations  that  covered  the  entire  coun- 
try. The  broadcasting  equipment  is  mostly  Indian  made  and 
reaches  special  audiences,  such  as  farmers  needing  agrocli- 
matic,  plant  protection,  and  other  agriculture-related  informa- 
tion. The  number  of  radio  receivers  increased  almost  fivefold 
between  1970  and  1994,  from  around  14  million  to  nearly  65 
million.  Most  radios  are  also  produced  within  India. 

The  foreign  broadcast  service  is  a  function  of  the  External 
Services  Division  of  All  India  Radio.  In  1994  seventy  hours  of 
news,  features,  and  entertainment  programs  were  broadcast 
daily  in  twenty-five  languages  using  thirty-two  shortwave  trans- 
mitters. The  principal  target  audiences  are  listeners  in  neigh- 
boring countries  and  the  large  overseas  Indian  community. 

Television 

Television  service  is  available  throughout  the  country. 
Broadcasting  is  a  central  government  monopoly  under  the 
Ministry  of  Information  and  Broadcasting,  but  the  only  net- 
work system,  Doordarshan,  also  known  as  TV1,  accepts  adver- 
tisements for  some  programs.  Doordarshan,  established  in 


356 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

1959  and  a  part  of  All  India  Radio  until  1976,  consists  of  one 
national  network  and  seven  regional  networks.  In  1992  there 
were  sixty-three  high-power  television  transmitters,  369 
medium-power  transmitters,  seventy-six  low-power  transmitters, 
and  twenty-three  transposers.  Regular  satellite  transmissions 
began  in  1982  (the  same  year  color  transmission  began). 

By  1994  some  6  million  people  were  receiving  television 
broadcasts  via  satellite,  and  the  number  was  expected  to 
increase  rapidly  throughout  the  rest  of  the  decade.  Cable  tele- 
vision was  even  more  prolific,  with  an  estimated  12  to  15  mil- 
lion subscribers  in  1994.  Besides  Doordarshan,  Zee  TV — an 
independent  station  broadcasting  from  Bombay  since  1992 — 
uses  satellite  transmissions.  In  fact,  because  Doordarshan  is  the 
only  network  that  is  permitted  to  broadcast  television  signals 
domestically,  Zee  TV  and  other  entrepreneurs  broadcast  their 
Indian-made  videotapes  via  foreign  transmitters.  Other  net- 
works joining  the  fray  are  Cable  News  Network  (CNN — starting 
in  1990);  Asia  Television  Network  (1991);  Hong  Kong-based 
Star  TV  (1991);  Jain  TV,  near  Bombay  (1994);  EL  TV,  a  spinoff 
of  Zee  TV  in  Bombay  (1994);  HTV,  an  affiliate  of  the  Hindustan 
Times  in  New  Delhi  (1994);  and  Sun  TV,  a  Tamil-language  ser- 
vice in  Madras  (1994)  (see  Broadcast  Media,  ch.  8).  In  a  com- 
munications breakthrough  in  July  1995,  Doordarshan  agreed, 
for  a  US$1.5  million  annual  fee  and  50  percent  of  advertising 
revenue  when  it  exceeds  US$1.5  million,  to  allow  CNN  to 
broadcast  twenty-four  hours  a  day  via  an  Indian  satellite. 

Doordarshan  offers  national,  regional,  and  local  service. 
The  number  of  television  sets  increased  from  around  500,000 
in  1976  to  9  million  in  early  1987  and  to  around  47  million  in 
1994;  increases  are  expected  to  continue  at  around  6  million 
sets  per  year.  More  than  75  percent  of  television  sets  were  black 
and  white  models  in  1992,  but  the  proportion  of  color  sets  is 
increasing  annually.  Most  television  sets  are  produced  in  India. 

Tourism 

Tourism  has  not  been  a  government  priority,  but  it  nonethe- 
less provides  around  6  percent  of  foreign-exchange  earnings. 
The  total  number  of  visitors  to  India  was  estimated  at  nearly  1.8 
million  in  FY  1992.  The  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  estimated  an 
annual  increase  of  6  to  7  percent  in  visitor  arrivals;  tourists 
from  Europe  and  North  America  were  targeted.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  the  government  offered  special  tax  incentives  to  the 
industry  to  help  alleviate  a  shortage  of  hotel  rooms.  Estimated 


357 


India:  A  Country  Study 

gross  export  earnings  from  tourism  were  Rs24  billion  and  net 
earnings  Rsl7  billion,  making  the  industry  an  important  for- 
eign-exchange earner.  With  under  0.3  percent  of  the  world's 
tourists  and  around  1  percent  of  world  tourism  spending, 
India,  however,  has  barely  tapped  its  tourism  potential. 

Science  and  Technology 

Origin  and  Development 

Indian  scientific  research  and  technological  developments 
since  independence  in  1947  have  received  substantial  political 
support  and  most  of  their  funding  from  the  government.  Sci- 
ence and  technology  initiatives  have  been  important  aspects  of 
the  government's  five-year  plans  and  usually  are  based  on  ful- 
filling short-term  needs,  while  aiming  to  provide  the  institu- 
tional base  needed  to  achieve  long-term  goals.  As  India  has 
striven  to  develop  leading  scientists  and  world-class  research 
institutes,  government-sponsored  scientific  and  technical 
developments  have  aided  diverse  areas  such  as  agriculture,  bio- 
technology, cold  regions  research,  communications,  environ- 
ment, industry,  mining,  nuclear  power,  space,  and 
transportation.  As  a  result,  India  has  experts  in  such  fields  as 
astronomy  and  astrophysics,  liquid  crystals,  condensed  matter 
physics,  molecular  biology,  virology,  and  crystallography. 
Observers  have  pointed  out,  however,  that  India's  emphasis  on 
basic  and  theoretical  research  rather  than  on  applied  research 
and  technical  applications  has  diminished  the  social  and  eco- 
nomic effects  of  the  government's  investments.  In  the  mid- 
1990s,  government  funds  supported  nearly  80  percent  of 
India's  research  and  development  activities,  but,  as  elsewhere 
in  the  economic  sector,  emphasis  increasingly  was  being  put  on 
independent,  nongovernmental  sources  of  support  (see  Liber- 
alization in  the  Early  1990s;  Resource  Allocation,  this  ch.). 

India  has  a  long  and  proud  scientific  tradition.  Nehru,  in  his 
Discovery  of  India  published  in  1946,  praised  the  mathematical 
achievements  of  Indian  scholars,  who  are  said  to  have  devel- 
oped geometric  theorems  before  Pythagoras  did  in  the  sixth 
century  B.C.  and  were  using  advanced  methods  of  determining 
the  number  of  mathematical  combinations  by  the  second  cen- 
tury B.C.  By  the  fifth  century  A.D.,  Indian  mathematicians 
were  using  ten  numerals  and  by  the  seventh  century  were  treat- 
ing zero  as  a  number.  These  breakthroughs,  Nehru  said,  "liber- 
ated the  human  mind  .  .  .  and  threw  a  flood  of  light  on  the 


358 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

behavior  of  numbers."  The  conceptualization  of  squares,  rect- 
angles, circles,  triangles,  fractions,  the  ability  to  express  the 
number  ten  to  the  twelfth  power,  algebraic  formulas,  and 
astronomy  had  even  more  ancient  origins  in  Vedic  literature, 
some  of  which  was  compiled  as  early  as  1500  B.C.  The  concepts 
of  astronomy,  metaphysics,  and  perennial  movement  are  all 
embodied  in  the  Rig  Veda  (see  The  Vedas  and  Polytheism,  ch. 
3).  Although  such  abstract  concepts  were  further  developed  by 
the  ancient  Greeks  and  the  Indian  numeral  system  was  popu- 
larized in  the  first  millennium  A.D.  by  the  Arabs  (the  Arabic 
word  for  number,  Nehru  pointed  out,  is  hindsah,  meaning 
"from  Hind  (India)"),  their  Indian  origins  are  a  source  of 
national  pride. 

Technological  discoveries  have  been  made  relating  to  phar- 
macology, brain  surgery,  medicine,  artificial  colors  and  glazes, 
metallurgy,  recrystalization,  chemistry,  the  decimal  system, 
geometry,  astronomy,  and  language  and  linguistics  (systematic 
linguistic  analysis  having  originated  in  India  with  Panini's 
fourth-century  B.C.  Sanskrit  grammar,  the  Ashtadhyayi) .  These 
discoveries  have  led  to  practical  applications  in  brick  and  pot- 
tery making,  metal  casting,  distillation,  surveying,  town  plan- 
ning, hydraulics,  the  development  of  a  lunar  calendar,  and  the 
means  of  recording  these  discoveries  as  early  as  the  era  of 
Harappan  culture  (ca.  2500-1500  B.C.;  see  Harappan  Culture, 
ch.  1). 

Written  information  on  scientific  developments  from  the 
Harrapan  period  to  the  eleventh  century  A.D.  (when  the  first 
permanent  Muslim  settlements  were  established  in  India)  is 
found  in  Sanskrit,  Pali,  Arabic,  Persian,  Tamil,  Malayalam,  and 
other  classical  languages  that  were  intimately  connected  to 
Indian  religious  and  philosophical  traditions.  Archaeological 
evidence  and  written  accounts  from  other  cultures  with  which 
India  has  had  contact  have  also  been  used  to  corroborate  the 
evidence  of  Indian  scientific  and  technological  developments. 
The  technology  of  textile  production,  hydraulic  engineering, 
water-powered  devices,  medicine,  and  other  innovations,  as 
well  as  mathematics  and  other  theoretical  sciences,  continued 
to  develop  and  be  influenced  by  techniques  brought  in  from 
the  Muslim  world  by  the  Mughals  after  the  fifteenth  century. 

The  practical  applications  of  scientific  and  technical  devel- 
opments are  witnessed,  for  example,  by  the  proliferation  of 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  water  tanks  for  irrigation  in  South 
India  by  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries.  Although 


359 


India:  A  Countn  Studx 


each  tank  was  built  through  local  efforts,  together,  in  effect, 
they  created  a  closely  integrated  network  supplying  water 
throughout  the  region.  The  science  of  metallurgy  led  to  the 
construction  of  numerous  small  but  sophisticated  furnaces  for 
producing;  iron  and  steel.  By  the  late  eighteenth  century,  it  is 
estimated  that  production  capability  may  have  reached  200.000 
tons  per  year.  High  leyels  of  textile  production — making  India 
the  world's  leading  producer  and  exporter  of  textiles  before 
1800 — were  the  result  of  refinements  in  spinning  technology. 

Several  millennia  of  interest  in  astronomy  in  India  eyentuallv 
resulted  in  the  invention  and  construction  of  a  network  of 
sophisticated,  large-scale  astronomical  obseryatories — the  Jan- 
tar  Mantars  (meaning  "house  of  instruments" ) — in  the  early 
eighteenth  century  Constructed  of  stone,  brick,  stucco,  and 
marble,  the  Jantar  Mantar  complexes  were  used  to  determine 
the  seasons,  phases  of  the  moon  and  sun.  and  locations  of  stars 
and  planets  from  points  in  Delhi.  Mathura.  Jaipur.  Yaranasi. 
and  Ujjain.  The  Jantar  Mantars  were  designed  and  built  by  a 
renowned  astronomer  and  city  planner.  Sawaijai  Singh  II.  the 
Hindu  maharajah  of  Amber,  between  1725  and  1734.  after  he 
been  asked  by  Mohammad  Shah,  the  tenth  Mughal  emperor, 
to  reform  the  calendar.  These  complexes  had  the  patronage  of 
the  Mughal  emperors  and  haye  long  attracted  the  attention  of 
Western  scholars  and  trayelers.  some  of  whom  haye  found 
them  anachronistic  in  light  of  the  use  of  telescopes  in  Europe 
and  China  more  than  a  century  before  Jai  Singh's  projects.  As 
United  States  scientist  William  A.  Blanpied  has  pointed  out.  Jai 
Singh,  who  subscribed  to  Hindu  cosmology,  was  aware  of  West- 
ern developments  but  preferred  to  perfect  his  naked-eye  obser- 
vations  rather  than  concentrate  on  precise  calculational 
astro  no  my. 

The  arrival  of  the  British  in  India  in  the  early  seyenteenth 
century — the  Portuguese.  Dutch,  and  French  also  had  a  pres- 
ence, although  it  was  much  less  pervasive — led  eyentually  to 
new  scientific  deyelopments  that  added  to  the  indigenous 
achieyements  of  the  previous  millennia  (see  The  Coming  of 
the  Europeans,  ch.  1  >.  Although  colonization  subverted  much 
of  Indian  culture,  turning  the  region  into  a  source  of  raw  mate- 
rials  for  the  factories  of  England  and  France  and  leaving  only 
low-technology  production  to  local  entrepreneurs,  a  new  orga- 
nization was  brought  to  science  in  the  form  of  the  British  edu- 
cation system.  Science  education  under  British  rule  (by  the 
East  India  Company  from  1757  to  1S57  and  by  the  British  gov- 


360 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

ernment  from  1858  to  1947)  initially  involved  only  rudimen- 
tary mathematics,  but  as  greater  exploitation  of  India  took 
place,  there  was  more  need  for  surveying  and  medical  schools 
to  train  indigenous  people  to  assist  Europeans  in  their  explora- 
tions and  research.  What  new  technologies  were  implemented 
were  imported  rather  than  developed  indigenously,  however, 
and  it  was  only  during  the  immediate  preindependence  period 
that  Indian  scientists  came  to  enjoy  political  patronage  and 
support  for  their  work  (see  The  Independence  Movement,  ch. 

i). 

Western  education  and  techniques  of  scientific  inquiry  were 
added  to  the  already  established  Indian  base,  making  way  for 
later  developments.  The  major  result  of  these  developments 
was  the  establishment  of  a  large  and  sophisticated  educational 
infrastructure  that  placed  India  as  the  leader  in  science  and 
technology  in  Asia  at  the  time  of  independence  in  1947.  There- 
after, as  other  Asian  nations  emerged,  India  lost  its  primacy  in 
science,  a  situation  much  lamented  by  India's  leaders  and  sci- 
entists. However,  the  infrastructure  was  in  place  and  has  con- 
tinued to  produce  generations  of  top  scientists. 

One  of  the  most  famous  scientists  of  the  pre-  and  postinde- 
pendence  era  was  Indian-trained  Chandrasekhara  Venkata 
(C.V.)  Raman,  an  ardent  nationalist,  prolific  researcher,  and 
writer  of  scientific  treatises  on  the  molecular  scattering  of  light 
and  other  subjects  of  quantum  mechanics.  In  1930  Raman  was 
awarded  the  Nobel  prize  in  physics  for  his  1928  discovery  of 
the  Raman  Effect,  which  demonstrates  that  the  energy  of  a 
photon  can  undergo  partial  transformation  within  matter.  In 
1934-36,  with  his  colleague  Nagendra  Nath,  Raman  pro- 
pounded the  Raman-Nath  Theory  on  the  diffraction  of  light  by 
ultrasonic  waves.  He  was  a  director  of  the  Indian  Institute  of 
Science  and  founded  the  Indian  Academy  of  Sciences  in  1934 
and  the  Raman  Research  Institute  in  1948. 

Another  leading  scientist  was  Homi  Jehangir  Bhabha,  an 
eminent  physicist  internationally  recognized  for  his  contribu- 
tions to  the  fields  of  positron  theory,  cosmic  rays,  and  muon 
physics  at  the  University  of  Cambridge  in  Britain.  In  1945,  with 
financial  assistance  from  the  Sir  Dorabji  Tata  Trust,  Bhabha 
established  the  Tata  Institute  of  Fundamental  Research  in 
Bombay  (see  Major  Research  Organizations,  this  ch.). 

Other  eminent  preindependence  scientists  include  Sir  Jaga- 
dish  Chandra  (J.C.)  Bose,  a  Cambridge-educated  Bengali  phys- 
icist who  discovered  the  application  of  electromagnetic  waves 


361 


India:  A  Country  Study 

to  wireless  telegraphy  in  1895  and  then  went  on  to  a  second 
notable  career  in  biophysical  research.  Meghnad  Saha,  also 
from  Bengal,  was  trained  in  India,  Britain,  and  Germany  and 
became  an  internationally  recognized  nuclear  physicist  whose 
mathematical  equations  and  ionization  theory  gave  new  insight 
into  the  functions  of  stellar  spectra.  In  the  late  1930s,  Saha 
began  promoting  the  importance  of  science  to  national  eco- 
nomic modernization,  a  concept  fully  embraced  by  Nehru  and 
several  generations  of  government  planners.  The  Bose-Einstein 
Statistics,  used  in  quantum  physics,  and  Boson  particles  are 
named  after  another  leading  scientist,  mathematician  Satyen- 
dranath  (S.N.)  Bose.  S.N.  Bose  was  trained  in  India,  and  his 
research  discoveries  gave  him  international  fame  and  an 
opportunity  for  advanced  studies  in  France  and  Germany.  In 
1924  he  sent  the  results  of  his  research  on  radiation  as  a  form 
of  gas  to  Albert  Einstein.  Einstein  extended  Bose's  statistical 
methods  to  ordinary  atoms,  which  led  him  to  predict  a  new 
state  of  matter — called  the  Bose-Einstein  Condensation — that 
was  scientifically  proved  in  United  States  laboratory  experi- 
ments in  1995.  Prafulla  Chandra  Ray,  another  Bengali,  earned 
a  doctorate  in  inorganic  chemistry  from  the  University  of  Edin- 
burgh in  1887  and  went  on  to  a  devoted  career  of  teaching  and 
research.  His  work  was  instrumental  in  establishing  the  chemi- 
cal industry  in  Bengal  in  the  early  twentieth  century. 

At  the  onset  of  independence,  Nehru  called  science  "the 
very  texture  of  life"  and  optimistically  declared  that  "science 
alone  .  .  .  can  solve  problems  of  hunger  and  poverty,  of  insani- 
tation  and  illiteracy,  of  superstition  and  deadening  customs." 
Under  his  leadership,  the  government  set  out  to  cure  numer- 
ous societal  problems.  The  Green  Revolution,  educational 
improvement,  establishment  of  hundreds  of  scientific  laborato- 
ries, industrial  and  military  research,  massive  hydraulic 
projects,  and  entry  into  the  frontiers  of  space  all  evolved  from 
this  early  decision  to  embrace  high  technology  (see  The  Green 
Revolution,  ch.  7). 

One  of  the  early  planning  documents  was  the  Scientific  Pol- 
icy Resolution  of  1958,  which  called  for  embracing  "by  all 
appropriate  means,  the  cultivation  of  science  and  scientific 
research  in  all  its  aspects — pure,  applied,  and  educational"  and 
encouraged  individual  initiatives.  In  1983  the  government 
issued  a  similar  statement,  which,  while  stressing  the  impor- 
tance of  international  cooperation  and  the  diffusion  of  scien- 
tific knowledge,  put  considerable  emphasis  on  self-reliance  and

the  development  of  indigenous  technology.  This  goal  is  still  in 
place  in  the  mid-1990s. 

Infrastructure  and  Government  Role 

Science  and  technology  policy  and  research  have  largely 
been  the  domains  of  government  since  1947  and  are  largely 
patterned  after  the  structure  left  behind  by  the  British.  Within 
the  central  government,  there  are  a  top-down  apparatus  and  a 
plethora  of  ministries,  departments,  lower-level  agencies,  and 
institutions  involved  in  the  science  and  technology  infrastruc- 
ture. 

Government-administered  science  and  technology  emanate 
from  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  to  which  a  chief  science 
adviser  and  the  Science  Advisory  Council,  when  they  are 
appointed,  have  direct  input.  The  prime  minister  de  jure  con- 
trols the  science  and  technology  sector  through  the  National 
Council  on  Science  and  Technology,  the  minister  of  state  for 
science  and  technology  (who  has  control  over  day-to-day  opera- 
tions of  the  science  and  technology  infrastructure),  and  minis- 
ters responsible  for  ocean  development,  atomic  energy, 
electronics,  and  space.  Other  ministries  and  departments  also 
have  significant  science  and  technology  components  and

answer  to  the  prime  minister  through  their  respective  minis- 
ters. Among  them  are  agriculture,  chemicals  and  fertilizers, 
civil  aviation  and  tourism,  coal,  defence,  environment,  food, 
civil  supplies,  forests  and  wildlife,  health  and  family  welfare, 
home  affairs,  human  resource  development,  nonconventional 
energy  sources,  petrochemicals,  and  petroleum  and  natural 
gas,  as  well  as  other  governmental  entities. 

The  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  was  established  in 
1971  to  formulate  science  and  technology  policies  and  imple- 
ment, identify,  and  promote  "frontline"  research  throughout 
the  science  and  technology  infrastructure.  The  ministry, 
through  its  subordinate  Department  of  Science  and  Technol- 
ogy, also  coordinates  intragovernmental  and  international 
cooperation  and  provides  funding  for  domestic  institutions 
and  research  programs.  The  Department  of  Scientific  and 
Industrial  Research,  a  technology  transfer  organization,  and 
the  Department  of  Biotechnology,  which  runs  a  number  of 
developmental  laboratories,  are  the  ministry's  other  adminis- 
trative elements.  Indicative  of  the  level  of  importance  placed 
on  science  and  technology  is  the  fact  that  Prime  Minister  P.V. 
Narasimha  Rao  held  the  portfolio  for  this  ministry  in  the  early 
and  mid-1990s.  Some  argued,  however,  that  Rao  could  truly 
strengthen  the  sector  by  appointing,  as  his  predecessors  did,  a 
chief  science  adviser  and  a  committee  of  leading  scientists  to 
provide  high-level  advice  and  delegate  the  running  of  these 
ministries  to  others. 

The  National  Council  on  Science  and  Technology  is  at  the 
apex  of  the  science  and  technology  infrastructure  and  is 
chaired  by  the  prime  minister.  The  integration  of  science  and 
technology  planning  with  national  socioeconomic  planning  is 
carried  out  by  the  Planning  Commission  (see  Development 
Planning,  this  ch.).  Scientific  advisory  committees  in  individual 
socioeconomic  ministries  formulate  long-term  programs  and 
identify  applicable  technologies  for  their  particular  area  of 
responsibility.  The  rest  of  the  infrastructure  has  seven  major 
components.  The  national-level  component  includes  govern- 
ment organizations  that  provide  hands-on  research  and  devel- 
opment, such  as  the  ministries  of  atomic  energy  and  space,  the 
Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  (CSIR — a  compo- 
nent of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology),  and  the 
Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research.  The  second  compo- 
nent, organizations  that  support  research  and  development, 
includes  the  departments  or  ministries  of  biotechnology,  non- 


364 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

conventional  energy  sources,  ocean  development,  and  science 
and  technology.  The  third-echelon  component  includes  state 
government  research  and  development  agencies,  which  are 
usually  involved  with  agriculture,  animal  husbandry,  irrigation, 
public  health,  and  the  like  and  that  also  are  part  of  the  national 
infrastructure.  The  four  other  major  components  are  the  uni- 
versity system,  private  research  organizations,  public-sector 
research  and  development  establishments,  and  research  and 
development  centers  within  private  industries.  Almost  all  inter- 
nationally recognized  university-level  research  is  carried  out  in 
government-controlled  or  government-supported  institutions. 
The  results  of  government-sponsored  research  are  transferred 
to  public-  and  private-sector  industries  through  the  National 
Research  and  Development  Corporation.  This  corporation  is 
part  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  and  has  as  its 
purpose  the  commercialization  of  scientific  and  technical 
know-how,  the  promotion  of  research  through  grants  and 
loans,  promotion  of  government  and  industry  joint  projects, 
and  the  export  of  Indian  technology. 

Resource  Allocation 

Central  government  financial  support  of  research  and  devel- 
opment— including  subsidies  to  public-sector  industries — was 
75.7  percent  of  total  financial  support  in  FY  1992.  State  govern- 
ments provided  an  additional  9.3  percent.  However,  even  when 
combined  with  the  private-sector  contribution  (15.0  percent), 
research  and  development  expenditures  were  only  just  over  0.8 
percent  of  the  GDP  in  FY  1992.  Although  there  was  growth  in 
research  and  development  expenditures  during  the  1980s  and 
early  1990s,  the  rate  of  growth  was  less  than  the  GNP  rate  of 
growth  during  the  same  period  and  was  a  cause  of  concern  for 
government  planners.  Moreover,  the  bulk  of  government 
research  and  development  expenditures  (80  percent  in  FY 
1992)  goes  to  only  five  agencies:  the  Defence  Research  and 
Development  Organisation  (DRDO),  the  Ministry  of  Space, 
the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research,  the  Ministry  of 
Atomic  Energy,  and  CSIR,  and  to  their  constituent  organiza- 
tions. 

Despite  long-term  government  commitment  to  research  and 
development,  India  compares  poorly  with  other  major  Asian 
countries.  In  Japan,  for  example,  nearly  3  percent  of  GDP  goes 
to  research  and  development;  in  South  Korea  and  Taiwan,  the 
figure  is  nearly  2  percent.  In  India,  research  and  development 


365 


India:  A  Country  Study 

receives  only  0.8  percent  of  GDP;  only  China  among  the  major 
players  spends  less  (0.7  percent).  However,  India's  share  of 
GDP  expenditure  on  research  and  development  has  increased 
slightly:  in  1975  it  stood  at  0.5  percent,  in  1980  at  0.6  percent, 
and  in  1985  at  0.8,  where  it  has  become  static. 

Because  of  the  allocation  of  financial  inputs,  India  has  been 
more  successful  at  promoting  security-oriented  and  large-scale 
scientific  endeavors,  such  as  space  and  nuclear  science  pro- 
grams, than  at  promoting  industrial  technology.  Part  of  the  lat- 
ter lack  of  achievement  has  been  attributed  to  the  limited  role 
of  universities  in  the  research  and  development  system. 
Instead,  India  has  concentrated  on  government-sponsored  spe- 
cialized institutes  and  provided  minimal  funding  to  university 
research  programs.  The  low  funding  level  has  encouraged  uni- 
versity scientists  to  find  jobs  in  the  more  liberally  funded  pub- 
lic-sector national  laboratories.  Moreover,  private  industry  in 
India  plays  a  relatively  minor  role  in  the  science  and  technol- 
ogy system  (15  percent  of  the  total  investment  compared  with 
Japan's  80  percent  and  slightly  more  than  50  percent  in  the 
United  States).  This  low  level  of  private-sector  investment  has 
been  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  prepon- 
derance of  trade-oriented  rather  than  technology-oriented 
industries,  protectionist  tariffs,  and  rigid  regulation  of  foreign 
investment.  The  largest  private-sector  research  and  develop- 
ment expenditures  during  the  FY  1990-FY 1992  period  were  in 
the  areas  of  engineering  and  technology,  particularly  in  the 
industrial  development,  transportation,  communications,  and 
health  services  sectors.  Nonetheless,  they  were  relatively  small 
expenditures  when  compared  with  government  and  public-sec- 
tor inputs  in  the  same  fields.  The  key  element  for  Indian  indus- 
try to  benefit  from  the  greater  government  and  public-sector 
efforts  in  the  1990s  is  the  ability  of  the  government  and  public- 
sector  laboratories  to  develop  technologies  with  broad  applica- 
tions and  to  transfer  these  technologies — as  is  done  by  the 
National  Research  and  Development  Corporation — to  private- 
sector  industries  able  to  apply  them  with  maximum  efficiency. 

India  ranks  eleventh  in  the  world  in  its  number  of  active  sci- 
entific and  technical  personnel.  Including  medical  personnel, 
they  were  estimated  at  around  188,000  in  1950,  450,000  in 
1960,  1.2  million  in  1970,  1.8  million  in  1980,  and  3.8  million 
in  1990.  India's  universities,  university-level  institutions,  and 
colleges  have  produced  more  than  200,000  science  and  tech- 
nology graduates  per  year  since  1985.  Doctorates  are  awarded 


366 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

each  year  to  about  3,000  people  in  science,  between  500  and 
600  in  engineering,  around  800  in  agricultural  sciences,  and 
close  to  6,000  in  medicine.  However,  in  1990  India  had  the  low- 
est number  of  scientific  and  engineering  personnel  (3.3)  per 
10,000  persons  in  the  national  labor  force  of  the  major  Asian 
nations.  For  example,  Japan,  had  nearly  seventy-five  per  10,000, 
South  Korea  had  more  than  thirty-seven  per  10,000,  and  China 
had  5.6  per  10,000. 

The  quality  of  higher  education  in  the  sciences  has  not 
improved  as  quickly  as  desired  since  independence  because  of 
the  flight  of  many  top  scientists  from  academia  to  higher-pay- 
ing jobs  in  government-funded  research  laboratories.  Foreign 
aid,  aimed  at  counteracting  university  faculty  shortages,  has 
produced  top-rate  graduates  as  intended.  However,  because  of 
limited  job  prospects  at  home,  many  of  the  brightest  physi- 
cians, scientists,  and  engineers  have  been  attracted  by  opportu- 
nities abroad,  particularly  in  Western  nations.  Since  the  early 
1990s,  this  trend  has  appeared  to  be  changing  as  more  high- 
technology  jobs,  especially  in  fields  requiring  computer  science 
skills,  have  begun  to  open  in  India  as  a  result  of  economic  lib- 
eralization. The  "brain  bank"  network  of  Indian  scientists 
abroad  that  was  seen  as  a  potential  source  of  talent  by  some 
observers  in  the  1980s  has  proven  to  be  a  valuable  resource  in 
the  1990s. 

Using  imported  technology,  scientists  made  major  advances 
in  microprocessors  during  the  1980s  that  brought  the  country 
to  only  one  generation  (three  to  four  years)  behind  interna- 
tional leaders.  A  sign  of  how  much  microcomputer  use  has 
developed  could  be  seen  in  sales:  from  US$93  million  in  FY 
1983  to  US$488  million  in  FY  1988.  Facilitating  the  use  of  auto- 
mation has  been  a  counterpart  to  the  expansion  of  the  data 
communication  field.  The  development  of  the  "Param  9000" 
supercomputer  prototype,  reportedly  capable  of  billions  of 
floating  point  operations  per  second,  was  completed  in  Decem- 
ber 1994  and  was  announced  by  the  state-owned  Centre  for 
Development  of  Advanced  Computing  as  ready  for  sale  to 
operational  users  in  March  1995.  Earlier  Param  models,  using 
parallel  processing  technologies  to  achieve  near-supercom- 
puter performance,  were  produced  in  sufficient  quantity  for 
export  in  the  early  1990s. 

DRDO  developed  its  own  parallel  processing  computer, 
which  was  unveiled  by  Prime  Minister  Rao  in  April  1995.  Devel- 
oped by  DRDO's  Advanced  Numerical  Research  and  Analysis

Group  in  Hyderabad,  the  supercomputer  is  capable  of  1  billion 
points  per  second  speed  and  can  be  used  for  geophysics,  image 
processing,  and  molecular  modeling. 

Major  Research  Organizations 

Agriculture 

The  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  was  established 
in  1929  as  an  autonomous  clearinghouse-type  organization 
charged  with  conducting,  aiding,  promoting,  and  coordinating 
agricultural  and  animal  husbandry  research.  It  has  seventy-six 
institutes,  bureaus,  centers,  and  project  directorates  and  sev- 
enty-one nationwide  coordinated  research  projects.  Education 
programs  are  mostly  operated  through  India's  twenty-six  agri- 
cultural universities.  The  council  has  administrative  links  to  the 
Department  of  Agricultural  Research  and  Education  of  the 
Ministry  of  Agriculture  (see  Development  Programs,  ch.  7). 

The  council  supports  numerous  research  institutes  through- 
out the  states  and  union  territories.  They  include  laboratories 
doing  research  on  arid  zones,  birds,  aquaculture,  cattle, 
agroengineering,  horticulture,  wool,  salinity,  soils,  veterinary 
science,  animal  and  plant  genetics,  land  use,  dairy  production, 
and  a  variety  of  crops,  including  rice,  jute,  cotton,  tobacco,  oil- 
seeds, potatoes,  and  others. 

Biotechnology 

India  has  placed  considerable  effort  on  biotechnology.  At 
the  national  level,  the  Department  of  Biotechnology,  estab- 
lished in  1986  as  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technol- 
ogy, is  responsible  for  biotechnology  research  and 
development  and  biotechnology-related  manufacturing, 
including  bio-safety  regulation.  It  also  acts  as  the  government's 
agent  for  biotechnology  imports.  The  department  supports  two 
autonomous  laboratories,  the  National  Institute  of  Immunobi- 
ology  in  New  Delhi  and  the  National  Facility  for  Animal  Tissue 
and  Cell  Culture  in  Pune,  Maharashtra.  Research  and  develop- 
ment takes  place  in  the  areas  of  burn,  heart,  and  cornea  treat- 
ment; germplasma  banks  for  plants,  animals,  algae,  and 
microbes;  viral  vaccine;  animal  embryo  technology;  animal  and 
human  fertility  control;  communicable  and  genetic  disease 
prevention;  and  biofertilizer,  biocontrol,  and  biomass  agents. 
The  department  also  controls  two  state-owned  enterprises 
involved  in  vaccine  production,  the  Bharat  Immunologicals

and  Biologicals  Corporation  and  the  Indian  Vaccines  Corpora- 
tion, both  in  New  Delhi. 

CSIR  oversees  numerous  subnational  biotechnology  institu- 
tions. These  include  the  Central  Drug  Research  Institute  in 
Lucknow,  Uttar  Pradesh;  the  Centre  for  Cellular  and  Molecular 
Biology  in  Hyderabad,  Andhra  Pradesh;  the  Indian  Institute  of 
Chemical  Biology  in  Calcutta;  and  the  Institute  of  Microbial 
Technology  in  Chandigarh  among  others. 

Defense 

DRDO  is  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Defence,  and  its 
director  general  is  the  chief  scientific  adviser  to  the  minister  of 
defence.  DRDO,  which  was  established  in  1958,  has  forty-five 
research  laboratories  and  institutes  serving  the  research  and 
development  needs  of  the  armed  forces.  Its  significant  achieve- 
ments include  the  development  of  light  combat  aircraft,  air- 
craft engines,  light  field  artillery,  ballistic  bomb  fuses,  smoke 
and  incendiary  devices,  combat  vehicles,  satellite  communica- 
tions terminals,  encryption  devices,  sonar  systems,  torpedo 
propulsion  devices,  high-performance  inertial  guidance  sys- 
tems, target  acquisition  and  ground  electronics,  and  various 
rocket  and  missile  systems. 

Education  Institutions 

The  Indian  Institute  of  Science  is  a  university-level  organiza- 
tion that  has  contributed  much  to  Bangalore's  development  as 
a  technology  capital.  The  institute  was  founded  in  1909  on  land 
in  Bangalore  donated  by  the  maharajah  of  Mysore,  using  an 
endowment  provided  by  one  of  the  major  benefactors  of  mod-

ern  Indian  science,  Jamsetji  Nusserwanji  (J.N.)  Tata,  for  the 
development  of  experimental  science.  Before  independence 
and  for  some  years  after  independence,  the  institute  had  a  pri- 
marily British  and  British-trained  faculty  committed  to  raising 
India's  scientific  levels.  In  1956  the  institute  was  given  univer- 
sity status. 

The  Indian  Institute  of  Science  has  more  than  forty  depart- 
ments, centers,  laboratories,  and  education  programs  orga- 
nized for  the  study  of  biological,  chemical,  electrical, 
mathematical,  mechanical,  and  physical  sciences.  It  also  has  a 
major  library,  the  National  Centre  for  Science  Information, 
and  a  fee-based  Centre  for  Scientific  and  Industrial  Consul- 
tancy. 

The  Indian  Academy  of  Sciences  is  also  located  in  Banga- 
lore. The  academy  was  founded  by  C.V.  Raman  in  1934  "to  pro- 
mote the  progress  and  uphold  the  cause  of  science,  both  in  the 
pure  and  applied  branches."  Although  the  academy  is  not  a 
research  institute,  it  provides  scholarships  and  fellowships, 
publishes  research  results,  and  bestows  honors  on  deserving 
scientists,  both  Indian  and  foreign.  The  academy  is  half  funded 
by  the  Department  of  Science  and  Technology,  and  the 
remainder  of  the  budget  is  met  through  subscriptions  to  its 
publications.  Raman  also  founded  the  Raman  Research  Insti- 
tute in  1948  as  an  independent,  private  science  laboratory  at 
which  he  and  others  continued  to  conduct  ground-breaking 
research  on  the  campus  of  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science. 

The  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  (IIT)  is  a  university-level 
entity  providing  undergraduate  and  graduate  education  in 
engineering  and  technology.  The  five  autonomous  IIT  cam- 
puses listed  in  order  of  their  founding,  are  located  in  Kharag- 
pur  (West  Bengal;  1950),  Bombay  (1958),  Madras  (1959), 
Kanpur  (Uttar  Pradesh;  1960),  and  New  Delhi  (1961).  The  IIT 
system  was  founded  by  the  central  government  in  1950  and 
raised  to  an  "institution  of  national  importance"  by  Parliament 
by  means  of  the  Indian  Institute  of  Technology  Act  of  1956  and 
its  subsequent  amendments.  Besides  receiving  central  govern- 
ment support  in  the  early  years,  IIT  received  assistance  from 
West  Germany,  the  Soviet  Union,  Britain,  the  United  Nations 
Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO), 
and  the  United  States.  Instructional  and  research  departments 
range  from  agricultural  engineering  to  aeronautical  engineer- 
ing and  from  earth  sciences  and  postharvest  technology  to 
naval  architecture  and  ocean  engineering.  To  round  out  stu-

dents'  education,  the  IIT  system  also  offers  humanities  and 
social  science  courses.  For  example,  the  Madras  campus  of  IIT 
teaches  economics,  history,  English,  psychology,  and  business 
at  the  undergraduate  level  in  support  of  other  departments 
and  at  the  graduate  level  leading  to  a  master's  degree  in  indus- 
trial management.  While  each  campus  has  departments  in  the 
basic  physical  sciences,  there  are  unique  departments  and  spe- 
cializations at  each  of  the  five  sites.  Admission  to  IIT  is  highly 
competitive;  some  100,000  applicants  take  placement  examina- 
tions for  2,000  student  positions  each  year. 

Although  most  important  research  is  done  in  government- 
and  industry-sponsored  laboratories,  several  universities,  in 
addition  to  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science  and  the  five  IIT  cam- 
puses, are  involved  in  significant  research.  Those  with  notable 
science  programs  are  Delhi  University,  Benares  Hindu  Univer- 
sity in  Varanasi,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Aligarh  Muslim  University  in 
Aligarh,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  Shanti  Niketan  University  in  Shanti 
Niketan,  West  Bengal. 

Information  Science 

The  Indian  National  Scientific  Documentation  Centre  (INS- 
DOC)  is  a  major  government  science  and  technology  informa- 
tion agency.  Established  in  1952  as  part  of  CSIR,  INSDOC  has 
its  main  office  in  New  Delhi  and  regional  centers  in  Bangalore, 
Calcutta,  and  Madras.  The  center  provides  document  delivery, 
a  wide  range  of  on-line  database  services,  directed  research  and 
bibliographic  services,  translation  services,  training  and  test- 
ing, and  other  science  information  services.  It  also  publishes 
science  and  technology-related  bibliographies,  abstracts, 
library  science  documentation,  conference  proceedings,  direc- 
tories, and  reference  aids,  and  operates  the  National  Science 
Library.  INSDOC  serves  government  agencies,  academia,  and 
public  and  private  organizations  and  individuals  throughout 
India  and  South  Asia  on  a  partial  cost-recovery  and  partially 
subsidized  basis.  Like  many  government  agencies  and  govern- 
ment-funded organizations,  INSDOC  in  the  early  1990s  was 
compelled  to  recover  ever-increasing  percentages — upward  of 
50  percent  for  some  institutes  in  1993 — of  its  annual  budget 
from  nonappropriated  sources. 

Industry 

Founded  in  1942,  CSIR  is  headquartered  in  New  Delhi,  but 
its  network  of  laboratories  is  spread  throughout  the  nation. 


371 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Although  heavily  involved  in  science,  biotechnology,  and  infor- 
mation science  activities,  it  also  emphasizes  industrial  research. 
The  president  of  CSIR  is  ex  officio  the  prime  minister,  a  situa- 
tion that  gives  the  council  considerable  political  prestige. 
CSIR's  network  of  nearly  200  national  laboratories  has  links 
throughout  the  nation  to  another  200  government-sector 
research  and  development  institutions  and  about  1,000 
research  and  development  units  in  the  industrial  sector  that 
are  supported  by  both  public  and  private  funds  (see  Early  Pol- 
icy Developments,  this  ch.).  Beyond  pure  and  applied  research, 
CSIR  also  has  outreach  programs  such  as  those  under  the  aus- 
pices of  the  National  Institute  of  Science,  Technology,  and 
Development  Studies  (NISTADS),  established  in  1974  as  a  cen- 
ter and  raised  to  institute  level  in  1981. 

CSIR  also  conducts  and  funds  studies,  organizes  conferences 
and  training  programs,  prepares  exhibits,  and  publishes 
reports  on  the  history  and  organization  of  Indian  science, 
resource  allocation  and  planning,  analyses  of  the  science  and 
technology  community  (including  behavioral  research  on  sci- 
entists), the  societal  and  environmental  impact  of  science  and 
technology,  and  international  cooperation.  Part  of  CSIR's  pub- 
lication program  is  directed  at  elementary  and  secondary 
school  students  with  the  intention  of  popularizing  science  at 
early  ages. 

The  emphasis  on  industrial  research  is  observable  in  the 
organizations  supported  by  CSIR.  They  include,  among  others, 
the  Central  Electrochemical  Research  Institute  in  Karaikudi, 
Tamil  Nadu;  the  Central  Electronics  Engineering  Institute  in 
Pilani,  Rajasthan;  the  Central  Glass  and  Ceramic  Research 
Institute  in  Calcutta;  the  Central  Leather  Research  Institute  in 
Madras;  the  Indian  Institute  of  Petroleum  in  Dehra  Dun,  Uttar 
Pradesh;  the  National  Metallurgical  Laboratory  in  Jamshedpur, 
Bihar;  and  the  National  Physical  Laboratory  in  New  Delhi. 

Nuclear  Power 

The  key  policy-planning  body  for  India's  nuclear  energy  pro- 
gram is  the  Atomic  Energy  Commission,  which  was  founded  in 
1948  and  has  offices  in  New  Delhi  and  Bombay.  The  chairman 
of  the  commission  is  concurrently  the  secretary  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  Atomic  Energy  (later  the  Ministry  of  Atomic  Energy), 
which  was  established  in  1954  (with  Homi  Bhabha  as  is  first 
head)  and  exercises  executive  control  over  nuclear  programs 
and  executes  India's  development  and  utilization  of  nuclear 


372 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

energy  for  peaceful  purposes.  To  carry  out  its  avowed  peaceful- 
use  mission,  the  department  has  policy  bodies  involved  with 
regulatory  and  safety  issues;  research  and  development  centers, 
both  integral  to  the  department  and  private  concerns  that 
receive  government  funding;  organizations  involved  with 
nuclear  fuel  and  heavy  water  development;  and  public-sector 
rare  earths  and  uranium  mining  and  electronics  companies 
(see  Energy,  this  ch.).  The  department  also  funds  numerous 
research  institute-  and  university-based  projects. 

As  a  far-reaching  result  of  India's  1974  test  of  a  nuclear 
explosive  device,  nuclear  proliferation  problems  continue  to 
confront  both  the  department  and  the  commission  (see  Space 
and  Nuclear  Programs,  ch.  10).  Divisive  issues  between  India 
and  the  United  States  over  nuclear-fuel  supplies  for  the  Tara- 
pur  nuclear  power  plant  (which  the  United  States  wants  cut 
off)  were  compounded  in  1993  when  the  Ministry  of  Atomic 
Energy  announced  it  was  seeking  foreign  buyers  for  surplus 
heavy  water  being  made  by  India's  seven  operating  heavy  water 
plants.  The  plants  were  developed  originally  because  of  the 
fuel  shortage  that  confronted  India  after  the  Treaty  on  the 
Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  was  signed  by  most 
other  nuclear  nations  in  1968.  Over  time  the  plants  met  domes- 
tic needs  and  began  to  produce  an  exportable  surplus,  leading 
to  India-United  States  friction.  The  Atomic  Energy  Commis- 
sion's January  1994  announcement  that  it  planned  to  continue 
its  development  of  fast  breeder  reactors  also  was  likely  to  cause 
international  concern. 

India  also  has  made  a  major  commitment  to  the  use  of 
nuclear  power  for  the  generation  of  electricity.  Major  resources 
have  been  devoted  to  research,  power  station  construction,  and 
delivery  services. 

Space 

The  space  program  had  its  genesis  in  the  Indian  National 
Committee  of  Space  Research,  which  was  established  in  1962  as 
part  of  the  Department  of  Atomic  Energy.  In  1972  the  Depart- 
ment of  Space  and  the  Space  Commission  were  established  as 
the  executive  and  policy  wings  of  the  program.  The  Depart- 
ment of  Space  operates  the  Indian  Space  Research  Organisa- 
tion (ISRO,  established  in  1969)  and  four  independent 
projects:  the  Indian  National  Satellite  Space  Segment  Project, 
the  Natural  Resource  Management  System,  the  National 
Remote  Sensing  Agency,  and  the  Physical  Research  Laboratory. 


373 


India:  A  Country  Study 


The  department  also  sponsors  research  in  various  academic 
and  research  institutions.  The  ISRO  is  headquartered  in  Ban- 
galore and  has  operating  units  at  twenty-two  sites  throughout 
the  country  that  deal  with  space  systems,  propulsion,  commu- 
nications, telemetry  and  tracking,  research,  launches,  and 
other  facets  of  the  space  program.  The  major  achievements  of 
the  space  program  have  been  in  the  area  of  the  domestic 
design,  production,  and  launching  of  remote  sensing  and  com- 
munications satellites.  The  primary  goal  of  the  space  program 
is  to  have  independent  remote  sensing  and  communications 
satellite  systems  with  launcher  autonomy 

In  1992  the  ISRO  set  up  the  Antrix  Corporation  to  market 
space  and  telecommunications  products  to  help  recover  some 
of  the  costs  of  the  annual  space  budget.  That  budget  increased 
from  Rs3.8  billion  in  FY  1990  to  an  estimated  Rs7.5  billion  in 
FY  1994.  The  majority  of  the  FY  1994  expenditures  were  slated 
for  rocket  development  (50  percent)  and  communications  and 
remote  sensing  satellite  operations  (26.8  percent). 

Space  research  began  with  the  establishment  of  the  Thumba 
Equatorial  Rocket  Launching  Station  near  Thiruvanan- 
thapuram,  Kerala.  From  Thumba  Indian  scientists  launched 
United  States-made  rockets  carrying  French  satellites  to  study 
the  upper  atmospheric  winds  over  the  magnetic  equator.  From 
this  station,  Indian  scientists  also  have  carried  out  original 
research  in  electrojet  currents  over  the  magnetic  equator,  verti- 
cal profiles  of  airglow,  and  cosmic  X-ray  background  radiation. 
The  first  Indian  experimental  satellite  was  launched  in  1975, 
followed  by  four  others:  operational  communications  and 
remote  sensing  satellites  have  been  launched  as  part  of  the 
Indian  National  Satellite  System  (Insat).  Insat  is  an  interagency 
project  operated  by  the  Department  of  Space  for  domestic 
radio  relay,  computer  network,  television,  rural  telegraph  net- 
work, and  weather,  emergency,  and  other  radio  communica- 
tions. 

Three  satellites  operated  by  Insat  were  in  use  in  the  mid- 
1990s  in  cooperation  with  the  International  Telecommunica- 
tion Union's  International  Telecommunications  Satellite 
(Intelsat)  system.  The  three  satellites  (the  first-generation 
Insat-1D  in  June  1990,  the  second-generation  Insat-2A  in  July 
1992,  and  Insat-2B  in  July  1993)  were  indigenously  built  under 
the  direction  of  the  ISRO  and  put  into  geostationary  orbit  over 
the  Indian  Ocean  using  French  rockets  launched  in  French 
Guiana.  Additional  and  more  advanced  communications  satel- 


374 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

lites — Insat-2C,  Insat-2D,  and  Insat-2E — were  planned  for 
launch  in  FY  1994,  FY  1995,  and  FY  1996. 

Although  early  Indian  satellites  were  launched  by  the  Soviet 
Union,  the  United  States,  and  the  European  Space  Agency,  in 
1980  India  began  using  domestically  produced  launch  vehicles 
for  its  Rohini  and  Stretched  Rohini  experimental  satellites. 
The  ISRO  has  launch  ranges  at  Thumba,  Sriharikota  Island  on 
the  east  coast  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  and  Balasore  in  Orissa. 

Foreign  observers  in  1993  believed  that  the  launch  vehicle 
program  was  the  least  developed  part  of  the  space  program 
and  had  fallen  behind  the  satellite  program  in  technological 
capability.  Supporting  this  belief  was  the  September  1993 
launch  of  India's  liquid-and-solid-fuel  Polar  Satellite  Launch 
Vehicle  (PSLV),  designed  to  carry  a  1,000-kilogram  satellite,  at 
Sriharikota.  Although  the  PSLV-D1  was  successfully  launched, 
it  malfunctioned  before  reaching  orbit.  Despite  such  setbacks, 
the  national  goal  of  achieving  launcher  autonomy  has  been  set 
for  2000. 

In  May  1994,  after  several  failed  launches,  India's  five-stage, 
solid-fuel  Augmented  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (ASLV)  pro- 
gram, which  started  its  test  phase  in  1987,  succeeded  in  deploy- 
ing a  133-kilogram  satellite  and  placing  it  in  a  low  earth  orbit 
via  a  solid-fuel  launch  vehicle,  the  ASLV-D4.  The  ASLV-D4  was 
launched  from  Sriharikota.  In  March  1995,  the  head  of  the 
ISRO  announced  that  India  would  become  self-reliant  in 
launcher  technology  by  1997-98  when  the  first  Geostationary 
Launch  Vehicle  (GSLV)  flight  was  planned. 

Through  international  cooperation  programs,  India  also  has 
put  a  man  in  space  with  the  Soviet  Union,  has  participated  in 
various  French  and  German  space  ventures,  and  has  had  a  pay- 
load  aboard  the  United  States  Space  Shuttle.  It  also  provided 
technical  expertise  to  the  Arab  Satellite  Communication  Orga- 
nization (Arabsat)  and  entered  into  a  cooperative  space 
research  agreement  with  the  Ukrainian  National  Space  Agency. 

Indian  weather  satellites  help  nations  throughout  the  Indian 
Ocean  littoral  by  providing  weather  information  and  real-time 
distress  alert  services.  Like  the  nuclear  energy  program,  the 
space  program  has  military  implications  that  are  contentious 
international  political  issues  (see  Russia;  United  States,  ch.  9). 

Other  Leading  Institutions 

Although  much  of  the  top  executive  authority  of  the  science 
and  technology  infrastructure  resides  in  New  Delhi,  some  pre- 


375 


India:  A  Country  Study 


mier  science  and  technology  institutions  are  located  elsewhere. 
Bangalore,  the  capital  of  Karnataka,  is  a  center  for  high-tech- 
nology industry  and  a  major  research  and  development  site. 
Much  of  the  activity  in  Bangalore's  "Silicon  Valley"  is  carried 
out  through  collaborative  arrangements  with  multinational 
corporations  in  fields  such  as  aeronautics,  communications, 
electronics,  and  machine  tools.  By  1990  there  were  more  than 
100,000  people  employed  by  3,000  companies  in  the  electron- 
ics industry  alone. 

The  Tata  Institute  of  Fundamental  Research  in  Bombay  con- 
ducts fundamental  research  in  astronomy,  mathematics,  molec- 
ular biology,  and  physics;  and  applied  research  in  computer 
science,  ion  accelerators,  material  science,  and  solid  state  elec- 
tronics. Organizationally,  the  institute  is  a  component  of  the 
Department  of  Atomic  Energy.  When  the  atomic  energv  pro- 
gram began  in  1948,  the  Tata  Institute  provided  trained  staff, 
and  in  1955,  because  of  the  important  role  it  p laved  in  nuclear 
energy  research,  the  institute  was  recognized  as  the  National 
Centre  of  the  Government  of  India  for  Advanced  Study  and 
Fundamental  Research  in  Nuclear  Science  and  Mathematics. 
In  this  capacity,  the  institute  became  a  world-class  nuclear 
research  facility,  recognized  for  its  discoveries  in  the  field  of 
strange  particles. 

Research  on  applied  mathematics,  astrophysics,  deoxyribo- 
nucleic acid  (DNA),  high-power  microwaves,  stratospheric  and 
underground  nuclear  physics,  theoretical  computer  science, 
and  other  high-technology  fields  is  carried  out  by  the  Tata 
Institute  in  Bombay  and  at  its  facilities  in  Bangalore  and  Kolar 
in  Karnataka,  Hyderabad  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Pachmarhi  in 
Madhva  Pradesh,  Pune  in  Maharashtra,  and  Udhagamandalam 
(Ooty)  in  Tamil  Nadu. 

Tata  Institute  scientists  designed  the  first  Indian  digital  com- 
puter in  the  1960s  and  since  then  have  contributed  directly  to 
the  manufacture  of  microwave  components  and  devices.  Joint 
work  has  been  conducted  with  foreign  laboratories,  such  as 
accelerator  experiments  with  Switzerland  and  the  United 
States.  The  Tata  Institute  also  provides  both  formal  and  infor- 
mal science  education  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  sci- 
ence education  and  developing  remedial  measures  for 
improving  scholastic  performance. 

Prospects  in  Science  and  Technology 

Some  observers  of  the  Indian  science  and  technology  com- 


376 


Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

munity,  while  acknowledging  its  strong  points,  complain  that 
there  is  a  lack  of  communication  and  coordination  among  the 
numerous  science  and  technology  institutes.  They  also  have 
commented  that  because  of  a  lack  of  materials  and  purpose, 
the  quality  of  some  government  laboratories  is  low  and  that 
quality-control  research  is  found  primarily  in  the  private  sector. 
Although  little  movement  is  being  made  toward  privatization 
of  science  and  technology  research,  the  government  is  trying 
to  bring  private  industry — where  there  is  more  innovation  and 
competitiveness — into  the  research  process.  In  the  1990s,  a 
considerable  amount  of  discussion  and  experimentation  is 
occurring  in  the  area  of  technology  transfer  from  fundamental 
research  institutes  to  the  marketplace. 

On  a  more  fundamental  level,  it  has  been  observed  that 
there  often  is,  at  best,  a  tenuous  link  between  major  financial 
investment  in  research  and  development  and  the  results 
enjoyed  by  India's  society  and  economy.  Despite  major  achieve- 
ments in  such  fields  as  agriculture,  telecommunications,  health 
care,  and  nuclear  energy — many  of  which  derived  from  foreign 
technology  inputs — parts  of  India's  population  face  malnutri- 
tion, depend  on  bullock  carts  for  transportation,  suffer  from 
diseases  wiped  out  in  many  other  nations,  and  use  cow  dung 
and  wood  for  fuel.  Although  the  government  has  decentralized 
to  some  extent,  inordinate  government  control  over  planning 
and  operation  of  research  institutions  continues,  and  the  weak 
link  between  the  research  and  industrial  sectors  persists.  How- 
ever, with  its  sizable  domestic-  and  foreign-trained  base  of  sci- 
entists and  engineers  and  considerable  participation  in  the 
scientific  programs  of  official  international  organizations, 
India  has  immense  potential  for  self-fulfillment  and  technolog- 
ical aid  to  other  Asian  nations  in  the  early  twenty-first  century. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  Indian  economy  appears  to  be  at  a 
crossroads.  The  economic  system  established  after  indepen- 
dence, which  was  marked  by  a  large  public  sector,  a  tightly  reg- 
ulated private  sector,  and  a  limited  role  for  foreign  trade,  is 
under  attack  from  many  quarters.  However,  the  extent  to  which 
the  government  is  willing  and  able  to  make  changes  remains 
unclear,  and  the  opposition  of  vested  interests  to  liberalization 
makes  it  likely  that  reforms  will  continue  to  take  place  only 
gradually.

India:  A  Country  Study 

A  good  survey  of  the  Indian  economy  from  independence 
until  the  mid-1980s  is  V.N.  Balasubramanyam's  The  Economy  of 
India.  The  various  essays  in  The  Indian  Economy:  Recent  Develop- 
ment and  Future  Prospects,  edited  by  Robert  E.B.  Lucas  and 
Gustav  F.  Papanek,  cover  the  same  period  and  also  evaluate  the 
early  stage  of  the  "new  economic  policy"  of  the  mid-1980s.  For 
more  recent  developments,  the  periodical  literature  is  the  most 
useful,  especially  the  articles  in  Economic  and  Political  Weekly 
[Bombay].  Also  helpful  are  Bimaljalan's  India's  Economic  Crisis, 
which  covers  the  1990  balance  of  payments  crisis,  and  the  vol- 
ume he  edited,  The  Indian  Economy:  Problems  and  Prospects,  which 
reviews  India's  economic  conditions  since  1947.  India  in  Transi- 
tion: Freeing  the  Economy,  byjagdish  Bhagwati,  is  also  an  impor- 
tant contribution  to  the  analysis  of  India's  economic  reforms. 

The  most  current  and  easily  accessible  sources  on  the  econ- 
omy are  two  publications  of  the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  in 
London:  Country  Profile:  India,  Nepal,  an  annual  survey  of  the 
economy;  and  Country  Report:  India,  Nepal,  a  quarterly  publica- 
tion that  includes  the  latest  economic  information.  The  annual 
Economic  Survey,  prepared  by  India's  Ministry  of  Finance, 
reviews  economic  developments  in  each  fiscal  year.  The  Minis- 
try of  Planning's  Statistical  Abstract,  which  is  published  at  irregu- 
lar intervals,  provides  considerable  statistical  information, 
including  the  most  recent  released  by  the  government. 

There  are  numerous  works  on  Indian  science  and  technol- 
ogy. A.K.  Bag's  Science  and  Civilization  in  India,  Abdur  Rahman's 
Science  and  Technology  in  Indian  Culture,  and  the  Directory  of  Scien- 
tific Research  Institutions  in  India,  published  by  the  Indian 
National  Scientific  Documentation  Centre,  are  useful.  Also 
very  useful  are  annual  and  other  reports  from  various  scientific 
institutions,  such  as  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science,  and  gov- 
ernment science  agencies,  such  as  the  Council  of  Scientific  and 
Industrial  Research  and  the  Indian  Space  Research  Organisa- 
tion. Several  articles  by  William  A.  Blanpied  are  helpful  cri- 
tiques of  India's  scientific  and  technology  developments.  (For

Chapter  7.  Agriculture

Uttar  Pradesh  and  Rajasthan 


AGRICULTURE  HAS  ALWAYS  BEEN  INDIA'S  most  important 
economic  sector.  In  the  mid-1990s,  it  provides  approximately 
one-third  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary) 
and  employs  roughly  two-thirds  of  the  population.  Since  inde- 
pendence in  1947,  the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  GDP  has 
declined  in  comparison  to  the  growth  of  the  industrial  and  ser- 
vices sectors.  However,  agriculture  still  provides  the  bulk  of 
wage  goods  required  by  the  nonagricultural  sector  as  well  as 
numerous  raw  materials  for  industry.  Moreover,  the  direct 
share  of  agricultural  and  allied  sectors  in  total  exports  is 
around  18  percent.  When  the  indirect  share  of  agricultural 
products  in  total  exports,  such  as  cotton  textiles  and  jute 
goods,  is  taken  into  account,  the  percentage  is  much  higher. 

Dependence  on  agricultural  imports  in  the  early  1960s  con- 
vinced planners  that  India's  growing  population,  as  well  as  con- 
cerns about  national  independence,  security,  and  political 
stability,  required  self-sufficiency  in  food  production.  This  per- 
ception led  to  a  program  of  agricultural  improvement  called 
the  Green  Revolution,  to  a  public  distribution  system,  and  to 
price  supports  for  farmers  (see  The  Green  Revolution,  this 
ch.).  In  the  1980s,  despite  three  years  of  meager  rainfall  and  a 
drought  in  the  middle  of  the  decade,  India  managed  to  get 
along  with  very  few  food  imports  because  of  the  growth  in 
food-grain  production  and  the  development  of  a  large  buffer 
stock  against  potential  agricultural  shortfalls.  By  the  early 
1990s,  India  was  self-sufficient  in  food-grain  production.  Agri- 
cultural production  has  kept  pace  with  the  food  needs  of  the 
growing  population  as  the  result  of  increased  yields  in  almost 
all  crops,  but  especially  in  cereals.  Food  grains  and  pulses 
account  for  two-thirds  of  agricultural  production  in  the  mid- 
1990s.  The  growth  in  food-grain  production  is  a  result  of  con- 
centrated efforts  to  increase  all  the  Green  Revolution  inputs 
needed  for  higher  yields:  better  seed,  more  fertilizer,  improved 
irrigation,  and  education  of  farmers.  Although  increased  irri- 
gation has  helped  to  lessen  year-to-year  fluctuations  in  farm 
production  resulting  from  the  vagaries  of  the  monsoons,  it  has 
not  eliminated  those  fluctuations. 

Food-grain  production  increased  from  50.8  million  tons  in 
fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1950  to  176.3  million  tons  in  FY 
1990.  The  compound  growth  rate  from  FY  1949  to  FY  1987  was 


381 


India:  A  Counties  Study 


2.7  percent  per  annum.  Overall,  wheat  was  the  best  performer, 
with  production  increasing  more  than  eightfold  in  forty  years. 
Wheat  was  followed  by  rice,  which  had  a  production  increase  of 
more  than  350  percent.  Coarse  grains  had  a  poorer  rate  of 
increase  but  still  doubled  in  output  during  those  years:  produc- 
tion of  pulses  went  up  by  less  than  70  percent.  The  increase  in 
oilseed  production,  however,  was  not  enough  to  fill  consumer 
demands,  and  India  went  from  being  an  exporter  of  oilseeds  in 
the  1950s  to  a  major  importer  in  the  1970s  and  the  early  1980s. 
The  agricultural  sector  attempted  to  increase  oilseed  produc- 
tion in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  These  efforts  were  successful: 
oilseed  production  doubled  and  the  need  for  imports  was 
reduced.  In  the  early  1990s,  India  was  on  the  verge  of  self-suffi- 
ciency in  oilseed  production. After  independence  in  1947,  the 
cropping  pattern  became  more  diversified,  and  cultivation  of 
commercial  crops  received  a  new  impetus  in  line  with  domestic 
demands  and  export  requirements.  Xontraditional  crops,  such 
as  summer  mung  (a  variety  of  lentil,  part  of  the  pulse  family), 
sovbeans,  peanuts,  and  sunflowers,  were  gradually  gaining 
importance. 

The  per  capita  availability  of  a  number  of  food  items 
increased  significantly  in  the  postindependence  period  despite 
a  population  increase  from  361  million  in  1951  to  846  million 
in  1991.  Per  capita  availability  of  cereals  went  up  from  334 
grams  per  dav  in  1951  to  470  grams  per  day  in  1990.  Availability 
of  edible  oils  increased  significantly,  from  3.2  kilograms  per 
year  per  capita  in  FY  1960  to  5.4  kilograms  in  FY  1990.  Simi- 
larly, the  availability  of  sugar  per  capita  increased  from  4.7  to 
12.5  kilograms  per  year  during  the  same  period.  The  one  area 
in  which  availability  decreased  was  pulses,  which  went  from 
60.7  grams  per  day  to  39.4  grams  per  day.  This  shortfall  pre- 
sents a  serious  problem  in  a  country  where  a  large  part  of  the 
population  is  vegetarian  and  pulses  are  the  main  source  of  pro- 
tein. 

There  are  large  disparities  among  India's  states  and  territo- 
ries in  agricultural  performance,  only  some  of  which  can  be 
attributed  to  differences  in  climate  or  initial  endowments  of 
infrastructure  such  as  irrigation.  Realizing  the  importance  of 
agricultural  production  for  economic  development,  the  central 
government  has  played  an  active  role  in  all  aspects  of  agricul- 
tural development.  Planning  is  centralized,  and  plan  priorities, 
policies,  and  resource  allocations  are  decided  at  the  central 
level.  Food  and  price  policy  also  are  decided  by  the  central  gov-

ernment.  Thus,  although  agriculture  is  constitutionally  the 
responsibility  of  the  states  rather  than  the  central  government, 
the  latter  plays  a  key  role  in  formulating  policy  and  providing 
financial  resources  for  agriculture. 

Land  Use 

In  FY  1987,  field  crops  were  planted  on  about  45  percent  of 
the  total  land  mass  of  India.  Of  this  cultivated  land,  almost  37 
million  hectares  were  double-cropped,  making  the  gross  sown 
area  equivalent  to  almost  173  million  hectares.  About  15  mil- 
lion hectares  were  permanent  pastureland  or  were  planted  in 
various  tree  crops  and  groves.  Approximately  108  million  hec- 
tares were  either  developed  for  nonagricultural  uses,  forested, 
or  unsuited  for  agriculture  because  of  topography.  About  29.6 
million  hectares  of  the  remaining  land  were  classified  as  culti- 
vable but  fallow,  and  15.6  million  hectares  were  classified  as  cul- 
tivable wasteland.  These  45  million  hectares  constitute  all  the 
land  left  for  expanding  the  sown  area;  for  various  reasons,  how- 
ever, much  of  it  is  unsuited  for  immediate  cropping.  Expansion 
in  crop  production,  therefore,  has  to  come  almost  entirely 
from  increasing  yields  on  lands  already  in  some  kind  of  agricul- 
tural use  (see  table  26;  table  27,  Appendix). 

Topography,  soils,  rainfall,  and  the  availability  of  water  for 
irrigation  have  been  major  determinants  of  the  crop  and  live- 
stock patterns  characteristic  of  the  three  major  geographic 
regions  of  India — the  Himalayas,  the  Indo-Gangetic  Plain,  and 
the  Peninsula — and  their  agro-ecological  subregions  (see  fig.  5; 
Principal  Regions,  ch.  2).  Government  policy  as  regards  irriga- 
tion, the  introduction  of  new  crops,  research  and  education, 
and  incentives  has  had  some  impact  on  changing  the  tradi- 
tional crop  and  livestock  patterns  in  these  subregions.  The 
monsoons,  however,  play  a  critical  role  in  determining  whether 
the  harvest  will  be  bountiful,  average,  or  poor  in  any  given  year. 
One  of  the  objectives  of  government  policy  in  the  early  1990s 
was  to  find  methods  of  reducing  this  dependence  on  the  mon- 
soons. 

Himalayas 

The  Himalayan  region,  with  some  520,000  square  kilometers 
of  land,  ranks  well  behind  the  other  two  regions  in  agricultural 
importance.  Despite  generally  adequate  rainfall,  the  rugged 
topography  allows  less  than  10  percent  of  the  land  to  be  used 


383 


India:  A  Country  Study 


for  agriculture.  The  sandy,  loamy  soils  on  the  hillsides  and  the 
alluvial  clays  in  the  region's  premier  agricultural  subregion,  the 
Vale  of  Kashmir — located  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  state 
of  Jammu  and  Kashmir — provide  fertile  land  for  agricultural 
use.  The  main  crops  are  rice,  corn,  wheat,  barley,  millet,  and 
potatoes.  Most  of  India's  temperate-zone  fruits  (apples,  apri- 
cots, cherries,  and  peaches)  and  walnuts  are  grown  in  the  vale. 
Sericulture  and  sheepherding  also  are  being  undertaken.  In 
the  eastern  Himalayan  subregion,  the  soils  are  moderately  rich 
in  organic  matter  and  are  acidic.  Although  much  of  the  farm- 
ing is  done  on  terraced  hillsides,  there  is  a  significant  amount 
of  shifting  cultivation,  which  has  resulted  in  deforestation  and 
soil  erosion.  Rice,  corn,  millet,  potatoes,  and  oilseeds  were  the 
main  crops  in  the  early  1990s.  The  region  also  is  well  known  for 
the  tea  plantations  of  the  mountainous  Darjiling  (Darjeeling) 
area  in  the  northern  tip  of  West  Bengal. 

Indo-Gangetic  Plain 

The  vast  Indo-Gangetic  Plain,  extending  from  Punjab  to 
Assam,  is  the  most  intensively  farmed  zone  of  the  country  and 
one  of  the  most  intensively  farmed  in  the  world.  Rainfall,  most 
of  which  comes  with  the  southwest  monsoon,  is  generally  ade- 
quate for  summer-grown  crops,  but  in  some  years  vast  areas  are 
seared  by  drought.  Fortunately,  much  of  the  land  has  access,  or 
potential  access,  to  irrigation  waters  from  wells  and  rivers, 
ensuring  crops  even  in  years  of  drought  and  making  possible  a 
winter  crop  as  well  as  a  summer  harvest.  Wheat  is  the  main 
crop  in  the  west,  rice  in  the  east.  Pulses,  sorghum,  oilseeds,  and 
sugarcane  are  among  other  important  crops.  Mango  orchards 
are  common.  Other  fruits  of  the  subregion  include  guavas, 
jackfruit,  plums,  lemons,  oranges,  and  pomegranates. 

In  the  Great  Indian  Desert,  rainfall  is  scanty  and  erratic. 
About  20  percent  of  the  total  area  is  under  cultivation,  mostly 
in  Haryana  and  Gujarat  states,  and  comparatively  little  in  Rajas- 
than.  The  Indira  Gandhi  Canal — begun  in  1958  as  the  Rajast- 
han  Canal — was  designed  to  bring  water  from  the  north. 
Progress  was  slow,  and  only  the  first  stage  was  close  to  comple- 
tion by  the  end  of  the  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1985-89).  By 
then,  the  canal  had  substantially  increased  the  area  under  culti- 
vation in  Rajasthan,  and  a  new  completion  date  of  1999  is  antic- 
ipated (see  Development  Programs,  this  ch;  Development 
Planning,  ch.  6).  The  cultivable  area  is  expected  to  expand  fur- 
ther with  the  development  of  the  canal's  second  stage  during

the  1990s.  The  leading  crops  of  the  subregion  are  millet,  sor- 
ghum, wheat,  and  peanuts.  Vast  expanses  of  sparse  vegetation 
provide  sustenance  for  sheep  and  goats.  In  the  late  1980s,  dairy 
farming  became  important  in  locations  that  had  sufficient  pas- 
tureland. 

Peninsular  India 

The  east  and  west  coasts,  the  coastal  plains,  and  the  deltaic 
tracts  that  extend  inland  for  some  100  to  200  kilometers  in 
Peninsular  India  benefit  from  both  the  June-to-September 
southwest  monsoon  and  the  October-to-November  northeast 
monsoon.  Farther  inland,  as  the  topography  and  climate 
change,  so  does  the  pattern  of  agriculture.  The  proportion  of 
land  under  cultivation  ranges  from  about  50  percent  along  the 
coastal  plain  and  in  the  western  part  of  Andhra  Pradesh  to 
about  25  percent  in  eastern  Madhya  Pradesh.  Except  in  areas 
of  certain  developed  river  valleys,  double-cropping  is  rare.  Rice 
is  the  predominant  crop  in  high-rainfall  areas  and  sorghum  in 
low-rainfall  areas.  Other  crops  of  significance  along  the  east 
coast  and  in  the  Central  Highlands  in  the  early  1990s  were 
pigeon  peas,  mustard,  peanuts,  millet,  linseed,  castor  beans, 
cotton,  and  tobacco. 

On  the  Deccan  Plateau,  deep,  alluvial  black  soils  that  retain 
moisture  for  a  long  time  are  the  basis  for  much  of  the  region's 
output  of  farm  products.  However,  the  region  also  has  many 
farming  areas  that  are  covered  by  thin,  light-textured  soils  that 
suffer  quickly  from  drought.  Whether  a  crop  is  made  or  lost  is, 
therefore,  often  dependent  on  the  availability  of  supplemen- 
tary water  from  ponds  and  streams.  About  60  percent  of  the 
land  in  the  state  of  Maharashtra  was  under  cultivation  in  the 
early  1990s,  less  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  About  75  percent  of  the 
cropland  of  the  Deccan  during  this  period  was  planted  in  food 
crops,  such  as  millet,  sorghum,  rice,  wheat,  and  peanuts;  most 
of  the  remaining  cropland  was  planted  in  fodder  crops. 

In  the  far  south  of  the  Peninsula,  the  area  under  cultivation 
varies  from  about  10  percent  in  the  Western  Ghats,  to  25  per- 
cent in  the  western  coastal  tract,  to  55  percent  on  the  Karna- 
taka  Plateau.  Here  is  the  India — the  land  of  spices — that  Vasco 
da  Gama  and  other  European  navigators  came  searching  for  in 
the  fifteenth  century.  On  the  Karnataka  Plateau,  sorghum,  mil- 
let, pulses,  cotton,  and  oilseeds  are  the  main  crops  on  the  90 
percent  of  the  cultivated  land  that  is  dry-farmed;  rice,  sugar- 
cane, and  vegetables  predominate  on  the  10  percent  that  was 


385

irrigated  in  the  late  1980s.  Coconuts,,  areca.  coffee.,  pepper, 
rubber,  cashew  nuts,  tapioca.,  and  cardamom  are  widely  grown 
on  plantations  in  the  Xilgiri  Hills  and  on  the  western  slopes  of 
the  Western  Ghats. 

Land  Tenure 

Matters  concerning  the  ownership,  acquisition,  distribution, 
and  taxation  of  land  are,  bv  provision  of  the  constitution., 
under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  states  (see  Local  Government.,  ch. 
S  .  Because  of  the  diverse  attitudes  and  approaches  that  would 
result  from  such  freedom  if  there  were  no  general  guidelines, 
the  central  government  has  at  times  laid  down  directives  deal- 
ing with  the  main  problems  affecting  the  ownership  and  use  of 
land.  But  it  remains  for  the  state  governments  to  implement 
the  central  government  guidelines.  Such  implementation  has 
varied  widelv  among  the  states. 

Landholding  Categories 

India  is  a  land  of  small  farms,  of  peasants  cultivating  their 
ancestral  lands  mainly  bv  familv  labor  and.  despite  the  spread 
of  tractors  in  the  1980s.,  bv  pairs  of  bullocks.  About  50  percent 
of  all  operational  holdings  in  19S0  were  less  than  one  hectare 
in  size.  About  19  percent  fell  in  the  one-to-two  hectare  range. 
16  percent  in  the  two-to-four  hectare  range,  and  11  percent  in 
the  four-to-ten  hectare  range.  Onlv  4  percent  of  the  working 
farms  encompassed  ten  or  more  hectares. 

Although  farms  are  tvpicallv  small  throughout  the  country, 
the  average  size  holding  bv  state  ranges  from  about  0.5  hectare 
in  Kerala  and  0.75  hectare  in  Tamil  Nadu  to  three  hectares  in 
Maharashtra  and  five  hectares  in  Rajasthan.  Factors  influenc- 
ing this  range  include  soils,  topographs  rainfall,  rural  popula- 
tion densitv.  and  thoroughness  of  land  redistribution 
programs. 

Manv  factors — historical.,  political,  economic,  and  demo- 
graphic— have  affected  the  development  of  the  prevailing 
land-tenure  status.  The  operators  of  most  agricultural  holdings 
possess  vested  rights  in  the  land  thev  till,  whether  as  full  owners 
or  as  protected  tenants.  By  the  earlv  1990s,  there  were  tenancy 
laws  in  all  the  states  and  union  territories  except  Nagaland. 
Meghalava.  and  Mizoram.  The  laws  provide  for  states  to  confer 
ownership  on  tenants.,  who  can  buv  the  land  thev  farm  in 
return  for  fair  pavment:  states  also  oversee  provision  of  security

of  tenure  and  the  establishing  of  fair  rents.  The  implementa- 
tion of  these  laws  has  varied  among  the  states.  West  Bengal, 
Karnataka,  and  Kerala,  for  example,  have  achieved  more  suc- 
cess than  other  states.  The  land  tenure  situation  is  compli- 
cated, and  it  has  varied  widely  from  state  to  state.  There  is, 
however,  much  less  variation  in  the  mid-1990s  than  in  the 
postindependence  period. 

Independent  India  inherited  a  structure  of  landholding  that 
was  characterized  by  heavy  concentration  of  cultivable  areas  in 
the  hands  of  relatively  large  absentee  landowners  (zamindars — 
see  Glossary),  the  excessive  fragmentation  of  small  landhold- 
ings,  an  already  growing  class  of  landless  agricultural  workers, 
and  the  lack  of  any  generalized  system  of  documentary  evi- 
dence of  landownership  or  tenancy.  Land  was  important  as  a 
status  symbol;  from  one  generation  to  the  next,  there  was  a  ten- 
dency for  an  original  family  holding  to  be  progressively  subdi- 


387

vided,  a  situation  that  continued  in  the  early  1990s.  This 
phenomenon  resulted  in  many  landholdings  that  were  too 
small  to  provide  a  livelihood  for  a  family.  Borrowing  money 
against  land  was  almost  inevitable  and  frequently  resulted  in 
the  loss  of  land  to  a  local  moneylender  or  large  landowner,  fur- 
ther widening  the  gap  between  large  and  small  landholders. 
Moreover,  inasmuch  as  landowners  and  moneylenders  tended 
to  belong  to  higher  castes  and  petty  owners  and  tenants  to 
lower  castes,  land  tenure  had  strong  social  as  well  as  economic 
impact  (see  Varna,  Caste,  and  Other  Divisions;  Settlement  and 
Structure,  ch.  5). 

By  the  early  1970s,  after  extensive  legislation,  large  absentee 
landowners  had,  for  all  practical  purposes,  been  eliminated; 
their  rights  had  been  acquired  by  the  state  in  exchange  for 
compensation  in  cash  and  government  bonds.  More  than  20 
million  former  zamindar-system  tenants  had  acquired  occu- 
pancy rights  to  the  land  they  tilled.  Whereas  previously  the 
landlord  collected  rent  from  his  tenants  and  passed  on  a  por- 
tion of  it  as  land  revenue  to  the  government,  starting  in  the 
early  1970s,  the  state  collected  the  rent  directly  from  cultivators 
who,  in  effect,  had  become  renters  from  the  state.  Most  former 
tenants  acquired  the  right  to  purchase  the  land  they  tilled,  and 
payments  to  the  state  were  spread  out  over  ten  to  twenty  years. 
Large  landowners  were  divested  not  only  of  their  cultivated 
land  but  also  of  ownership  of  forests,  lakes,  and  barren  lands. 
They  were  also  stripped  of  various  other  economic  rights,  such 
as  collection  of  taxes  on  sales  of  immovable  property  within 
their  jurisdiction  and  collection  of  money  for  grazing  privileges 
on  uncultivated  lands  and  use  of  river  water.  These  rights  also 
were  taken  over  by  state  governments  in  return  for  compensa- 
tion. By  1980  more  than  6  million  hectares  of  waste,  fallow,  and 
other  categories  of  unused  land  had  been  vested  in  state  gov- 
ernments and,  in  turn,  distributed  to  landless  agricultural 
workers. 

Land  Reform 

A  major  concern  in  rural  India  is  the  huge  number  of  land- 
less or  near-landless  families,  many  of  whom  are  wholly  depen- 
dent on  a  few  weeks  of  work  at  the  peak  planting  and 
harvesting  seasons.  The  number  of  landless  rural  families  has 
grown  steadily  since  independence,  both  in  absolute  terms  and 
as  a  proportion  of  the  population.  In  1981  there  were  195.1 
million  rural  workers:  55.4  million  were  agricultural  laborers 


388 


Agriculture 


who  depended  primarily  on  casual  farm  work  for  a  livelihood. 
In  the  early  1990s,  the  rural  work  force  had  grown  to  242  mil- 
lion, of  whom  73.7  million  were  classified  as  agricultural  labor- 
ers. Approximately  33  percent  of  the  employed  rural  workers 
were  classified  as  casual  wage  laborers. 

Because  of  the  large  number  of  landless  farmers  and  the  fre- 
quent neglect  of  land  by  absentee  landlords  in  the  early  years 
of  independence,  the  principle  that  there  should  be  a  ceiling 
on  the  size  of  landholdings,  depending  on  the  crop  planted 
and  the  quality  of  the  land,  was  embodied  in  the  First  Five-Year 
Plan  (FY  1951-55).  An  agricultural  census  was  conducted  to 
provide  guidance  in  setting  such  ceilings.  During  the  Second 
Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1956-60),  most  states  legislated  fixed  ceil- 
ings, but  there  was  little  uniformity  among  the  states;  ceilings 
ranged  from  six  to  132  hectares.  Certain  specialized  branches 
of  agriculture,  such  as  horticulture,  cattle  breeding,  and  dairy 
farming,  were  usually  exempted  from  ceilings. 

All  the  states  instituted  programs  to  force  landowners  to  sell 
their  over-the-ceiling  holdings  to  the  government  at  fixed 
prices;  the  states,  in  turn,  were  to  redistribute  the  land  to  the 
landless.  But  adamant  resistance,  high  costs,  sloppy  record 
keeping,  and  poor  administration  in  general  combined  to 
weaken  and  delay  this  aspect  of  land  reform.  The  delays  in  leg- 
islation allowed  large  landowners  to  circumvent  the  intent  of 
the  laws  by  spurious  partitioning,  sales,  gifts  to  family  members, 
and  other  methods  of  evading  ceilings.  Many  exemptions  were 
granted  so  that  there  was  little  surplus  land. 

To  ensure  more  uniformity  in  income,  to  combat  evasion  of 
the  intent  of  the  laws,  and  to  secure  more  land  for  distribution 
to  the  landless,  the  central  government  in  the  1970s  pushed  for 
greatly  reduced  ceilings.  For  a  family  of  five,  the  central  gov- 
ernment guidelines  called  for  not  more  than  10.9  hectares  of 
good,  irrigated  land  suitable  for  double-cropping,  not  more 
than  10.9  hectares  of  land  suited  for  one  crop  annually,  and 
not  more  than  21.9  hectares  for  orchards.  Exemptions  were 
continued  for  land  used  as  cocoa,  coffee,  tea,  and  rubber  plan- 
tations; land  held  by  official  banks  and  other  government 
units;  and  land  held  by  agricultural  schools  and  research  orga- 
nizations. At  the  option  of  the  states,  land  held  by  religious, 
educational,  and  charitable  trusts  also  could  be  exempted.  To 
protect  the  states  from  legal  challenges  to  their  land  reform 
laws,  the  constitution  was  amended  in  1974  to  include  in  its 
Ninth  Schedule  the  state  laws  that  had  been  enacted  in  con- 


389 


India:  A  Country  Study 

formance  with  national  guidelines.  Land  reform  laws  enacted 
after  1974  also  were  included  in  the  amendment. 

By  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  all  states  and  union  territo- 
ries, except  Goa,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Nagaland,  Manipur, 
Mizoram,  and  Tripura,  had  passed  ceiling  laws  to  conform  to 
central  government  guidelines.  In  Maharashtra,  for  example, 
the  revised  ceiling  law  that  became  effective  in  1975  set  upper 
limits  at  perennially  irrigated  land,  7.2  hectares;  seasonally  irri- 
gated land,  10.8  hectares;  paddy  land  in  an  assured  rainfall 
area,  14.6  hectares;  and  other  dry  land,  21.9  hectares.  By  the 
early  1980s,  about  150,000  hectares  had  been  declared  surplus 
under  this  act,  about  100,000  of  which  had  been  distributed  to 
6,500  landless  persons.  A  1973  land  reform  amendment  in 
Bihar  set  a  range  of  ceilings  on  holdings  for  a  family  of  five, 
from  six  to  eighteen  hectares  depending  on  land  quality,  and 
offered  an  allowance  for  each  additional  family  member,  sub- 
ject to  a  maximum  of  one-and-one-half  times  the  holding. 
Within  five  years,  the  Bihar  government  had  acquired  94,000 
hectares  of  surplus  land  and  had  distributed  53,000  hectares  to 
138,000  landless  families.  Success  nationwide  was  limited.  Of 
the  2.9  million  hectares  of  land  declared  surplus,  nearly  1.9 
million  hectares  had  been  distributed  by  the  end  of  the  seventh 
plan,  leaving  1  million  hectares  still  to  be  distributed  as  of  early 
1993. 

By  the  early  1990s,  nearly  all  the  states  had  enacted  legisla- 
tion aimed  at  the  consolidation  of  each  tiller's  landholdings 
into  one  contiguous  plot.  Implementation  was  patchy  and  spo- 
radic, however.  By  the  early  1980s,  the  work  had  been  com- 
pleted only  in  Punjab,  Haryana,  and  western  Uttar  Pradesh 
and  had  begun  in  Orissa  and  Bihar.  In  most  of  the  other  states, 
nothing  had  been  accomplished  by  the  early  1990s.  The  Sixth 
Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1980-84)  set  a  goal  for  the  completion  of 
the  consolidation  of  holdings  within  ten  years,  which  was  not 
achieved. 

In  order  to  protect  tenants  from  exorbitant  rents  (often  up 
to  50  percent  of  their  produce),  the  states  passed  legislation  to 
regulate  rents.  The  maximum  rate  was  fixed  at  levels  not 
exceeding  20  to  25  percent  of  the  gross  produce  in  all  states 
except  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  and  Punjab.  The  states  also 
adopted  various  other  measures  for  the  protection  of  tenants, 
including  moratoriums  on  evictions,  minimum  periods  of  ten- 
ure, and  security  of  tenure  subject  to  eviction  on  prescribed 
grounds  only.

Agriculture 


By  the  early  1980s,  most  of  the  cultivated  area  had  been  sur- 
veyed and  records  of  rights  prepared.  In  most  states,  revenue 
assessment — the  tax  on  land — against  farmland  had  been 
revised  upward  in  keeping  with  a  rise  in  farm  prices  (see  Agri- 
cultural Taxation,  this  ch.).  In  several  states,  steps  were  taken  to 
associate  village  assemblies,  or  panchayat  (see  Glossary),  with 
the  maintenance  of  land  records,  the  collection  of  land  reve- 
nue, and  the  management  of  lands  belonging  to  government; 
the  results  of  these  efforts  have  frequently  been  unsatisfactory. 

Economic  Development 

Evolution  of  Policy 

The  British  colonial  government  of  India  did  not  pursue  an 
active  policy  of  agricultural  development  despite  modest 
efforts  to  formulate  a  policy  (see  The  British  Raj,  1858-1947, 
ch.  1).  One  such  effort  was  the  appointment  in  1926  of  the 
Royal  Commission  on  Agriculture,  which  made  some  recom- 
mendations for  improving  agriculture  and  promoting  the  wel- 
fare of  the  rural  population.  Most  of  the  commission's  recom- 
mendations were  deferred  because  of  the  Great  Depression  of 
the  1930s.  One  outcome,  however,  was  the  establishment  of  the 
Imperial  (later  Indian)  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  in 
1929.  During  World  War  II,  disruptions  in  international  trade 
also  led  the  government  to  initiate  the  Grow  More  Food  Cam- 
paign. The  government  adopted  its  first  agricultural  policy 
statement  in  the  wake  of  famine  in  Bengal  in  1943.  The  policy 
objectives  included  increased  production  of  food  grains,  use  of 
better  methods  of  production,  improved  marketing,  better 
prices  for  the  producers,  fair  wages  for  agricultural  labor,  fair 
distribution  of  food,  increased  production  of  raw  materials, 
and  improvements  in  research  and  education.  This  statement 
was  the  basis  of  many  of  the  policies  adopted  soon  after  inde- 
pendence, especially  in  the  First  Five- Year  Plan,  when  the  cen- 
tral government  was  committed  to  giving  priority  to 
agricultural  production  to  increase  the  food  supply  in  the 
country. 

The  prolonged  neglect  of  agriculture  meant  that  there  was 
almost  no  growth  in  the  agricultural  sector.  From  1891  to  1946, 
output  of  all  crops  grew  at  0.4  percent  a  year;  the  rate  for  food 
grains  was  only  0.1  percent  per  year.  The  land  tenure  system 
led  to  exploitative  agrarian  relations  and  stagnation  (see  Land 
Tenure,  this  ch.).  Farmers  had  little  incentive  to  invest,  and 


391 


India:  A  Country  Study 

despite  great  strides  in  foreign  agricultural  technology,  Indian 
agricultural  technology  stagnated.  Specifically,  there  were  few 
improvements  in  seeds,  agricultural  implements,  machines,  or 
chemical  fertilizers. 

At  the  time  of  independence  in  1947,  agriculture  and  allied 
sectors  provided  well  over  70  percent  of  the  country's  employ- 
ment and  more  than  50  percent  of  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary).  Agricultural  development  was  a  key  to  a 
number  of  national  goals,  such  as  reducing  rural  poverty,  pro- 
viding an  adequate  diet  for  all  citizens,  supplying  agricultural 
raw  materials  for  the  textile  industry  and  other  industries,  and 
expanding  exports.  In  the  mid-1960s,  the  goal  of  self-reliance 
was  added  to  this  list.  The  central  government  has  played  a  pro- 
gressively more  important  role  on  the  agricultural  front  by  pro- 
viding overall  leadership  and  coordination,  as  well  as  by 
providing  a  significant  part  of  the  financing  for  agricultural 
programs.  However,  the  primary  responsibility  for  the  design 
and  implementation  of  agricultural  programs,  in  accordance 
with  the  constitution,  remained  with  the  states  in  the  late  twen- 
tieth century  (see  The  Constitutional  Framework,  ch.  8). 

India's  agricultural  growth  strategy  after  independence 
evolved  over  three  distinct  phases.  In  the  first  phase,  roughly 
covering  the  period  through  the  Second  Five- Year  Plan,  agri- 
cultural growth  rested  on  removing  basic  socioeconomic  con- 
straints through  land  reform,  change  in  the  village  power 
structure,  reorganization  of  the  rural  poor  into  cooperatives, 
and  better  citizen  participation  in  planning.  The  initial 
assumption  was  that  changing  the  land  tenure  system  by  abol- 
ishing the  zamindar  system — a  method  of  revenue  collecting 
and  landholding  developed  during  the  Mughal  and  British 
colonial  periods — would  stimulate  agricultural  output  (see  The 
Mughal  Era;  The  British  Empire  in  India,  ch.  1). 

The  second  phase  occurred  during  the  Third  Five-Year  Plan 
(FY  1961-65).  The  continuing  shortages  of  food  in  the  1960s 
and  the  consequent  crises  convinced  planners  that  raising  agri- 
cultural output,  especially  food  grains,  was  essential  for  politi- 
cal stability  and  independence  from  foreign  food  aid. 
Self-sufficiency  in  food-grain  production  and  development  of 
an  adequate  buffer  stock  through  procurement  became  clearly 
defined  goals  in  the  mid-1960s.  Keeping  in  mind  the  variety  of 
socioeconomic  and  agroclimatic  differences,  the  government 
adopted  an  area-specific  approach,  and  emphasized  programs 


392 


Agriculture 


such  as  the  Intensive  Area  Agricultural  Programme  and  the 
Intensive  Agricultural  District  Programme. 

The  third  phase  is  identified  predominantly  as  the  Green 
Revolution.  This  phase  relied  on  better  seeds,  more  water  via 
irrigation,  and  improved  quantity  and  quality  of  fertilizer  dur- 
ing the  Fourth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1969-73),  the  Fifth  Five-Year 
Plan  (FY  1974-78),  and  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1980-84). 
The  Green  Revolution  was  successful  in  meeting  the  goals  of 
self-sufficiency  in  food-grain  production  and  adequate  buffer 
stocks  by  the  end  of  the  1970s.  Production  was  more  than  100 
million  tons  in  1978  and  1979.  Imports  were  negligible,  and 
the  year-end  buffer  stocks  from  1976-79  averaged  more  than 
17  million  tons.  After  1980  buffer  stocks  fell  below  10  millions 
tons  only  once,  in  1988. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  the  major  goals  of  agricultural  policy  con- 
tinued to  be  self-sufficiency  in  food  staples  and  adequate  food 
supplies  at  affordable  prices  for  consumers.  Expanding  cereal 
production  continued  to  be  a  major  objective  because  of  the 
population  growth  rate  of  almost  2  percent  per  year.  The  bud- 
getary share  of  agriculture,  together  with  irrigation  and  flood 
control  projects,  remained  almost  constant  in  the  first  six 
plans,  varying  between  21  percent  and  24  percent. 

The  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  (FY  1992-96),  as  conceived  in  the 
early  1990s,  not  only  aimed  at  continued  self-sufficiency  in 
food  production,  but  also  included  plans  to  generate  surpluses 
of  some  agricultural  commodities  for  export.  It  also  aimed  at 
spreading  the  Green  Revolution  to  more  regions  of  the  coun- 
try with  an  emphasis  on  dryland  farming. 

Development  Programs 

Within  the  broad  framework  of  policy,  the  government  has 
undertaken  a  wide  variety  of  programs  in  agriculture  to  build 
up  the  physical  and  information  infrastructures  necessary  for 
sustained  development.  There  are  programs  for  the  better- 
ment of  the  rural  population;  research,  education,  and  exten- 
sion programs;  irrigation  development  schemes;  plans  to 
increase  the  supply  of  agricultural  inputs,  such  as  seeds,  fertiliz- 
ers, and  pesticides;  plans  to  change  the  institutional  framework 
of  land  ownership;  plans  to  improve  agricultural  financing;  bet- 
ter marketing  techniques;  and  plans  to  improve  technology. 
These  programs  are  administered,  financed,  and  run  by  the 
central  government  and  by  the  state  governments,  and  both 


393 


India:  A  Country  Study 

levels  encourage  private-sector  development  through  direct  or 
indirect  programs. 

Some  of  the  specialized  programs  in  place  in  the  1990s  were 
introduced  during  the  Fifth  Plan.  Among  them  were  the  Small 
Farmers  Development  Agency,  Minimum  Needs  Programme, 
Hill  Area  Development  Programme,  and  Drought-Prone  Areas 
Programme.  In  1989  two  other  programs,  the  National  Rural 
Employment  Programme  and  the  Rural  Landless  Employment 
Guarantee  Programme,  were  merged  into  a  single  program 
called  the  Jawahar  Employment  Plan  (Jawahar  Rozgar  Yojana; 
Jawahar  in  memory  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  [1889-1964],  India's 
first  prime  minister;  rozgar  means  daily  employment  in  Hindi; 
and  yojana  means  project  or  plan). 

The  Integrated  Rural  Development  Programme,  launched 
in  FY  1978  and  extended  throughout  India  by  FY  1980,  is  a 
self-employment  program  intended  to  raise  the  income-gener- 
ation capacity  of  target  groups  among  the  poor.  The  aim  is  to 
raise  recipients  above  the  poverty  line  by  providing  substantial 
opportunities  for  self-employment.  During  the  seventh  plan, 
the  total  expenditure  under  the  program  was  Rs33.2  million 
(for  value  of  the  rupee — see  Glossary),  and  Rs53.7  million  of 
term  credit  was  mobilized.  Some  13  million  new  families  partic- 
ipated, bringing  total  coverage  under  the  program  to  more 
than  18  million  families.  These  development  programs  have 
played  an  important  role  in  increased  agricultural  production 
by  educating  farmers  and  providing  them  with  financial  and 
other  inputs  to  increase  yields.  They  have  also  alleviated  some 
problems  of  the  rural  poor.  However,  further  success  has  been 
limited  by  the  lack  of  efficient  administrative  mechanisms,  the 
limitation  of  resources,  the  magnitude  of  the  task,  and  the  lack 
of  willingness  to  change  the  status  quo.  Many  of  the  program 
results  appear  better  on  paper  than  the  actual  results  in  the 
field  because  of  lack  of  implementation  and  poor  monitoring. 

Research,  Education,  and  Extension 

The  central  government's  Department  of  Agricultural 
Research  and  Education  was  established  in  1973  in  the  Ministry 
of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (later,  the  Ministry  of 
Agriculture).  The  department  is  responsible  for  coordinating 
research  and  educational  facilities  in  agriculture,  animal  hus- 
bandry, and  fisheries.  The  department  also  provides  support 
services  to  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  (see 
Major  Research  Organization,  ch.  6).

Higher  education  has  also  seen  advances.  India  has  twenty- 
eight  agricultural  universities,  which  include  164  colleges  spe- 
cializing in  agriculture,  veterinary  science,  agricultural  engi- 
neering, home  science,  fisheries,  dairy  technology,  forestry, 
horticulture,  sericulture,  food  science,  and  food-handling  tech- 
nology. They  are  located  through  most  of  the  states  in  India. 
One  of  them  is  a  central  university  that  has  specialized  exten- 
sion colleges  in  the  seven  northeastern  states.  The  undergradu- 
ate student  enrollment  in  the  early  1990s  was  around  9,600  and 
there  was  a  capacity  for  some  4,500  graduate  students  (see  Col- 
leges and  Universities,  ch.  2). 

Agricultural,  animal  husbandry,  and  forestry  research  is  con- 
ducted under  the  auspices  of  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricul- 
tural Research,  central  research  institutes,  and  various 
commodity  committees.  The  council  had  forty-six  institutes  in 
operation  in  1992.  India's  largest  such  institute  is  the  Indian 


395 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Agricultural  Research  Institute,  established  in  1905  at  Pusa, 
Bihar.  Because  of  an  earthquake  at  Pusa,  the  research  institute 
moved  to  New  Delhi  in  1936.  The  institute  was  later  accorded 
university  status. 

In  addition  to  these  agricultural  research  and  education 
institutions,  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  also 
has  a  large  network  of  organizations  to  disseminate  agricultural 
technology  information.  In  the  mid-1990s,  there  were  national 
centers  used  to  demonstrate  new  crop  varieties  and  production 
technologies  in  forty-eight  districts  throughout  the  country. 
There  also  were  seventy  nationwide  coordinated  research 
projects  operating  at  120  centers  to  test  specific  production 
technologies. 

Agricultural  Extension 

After  independence  in  1947,  the  government's  first  step 
toward  building  an  agricultural  extension  system  was  expan- 
sion of  the  World  War  II  Grow  More  Food  Campaign.  Adminis- 
trators and  extension  workers  were  exhorted  to  convince 
cultivators  of  the  gains  in  yields  that  could  be  obtained  through 
the  use  of  improved  seeds,  compost,  farmyard  manure,  and 
better  cultivation  practices.  Rural  agents,  often  inundated  with 
other  assignments,  had  little  or  no  training  for  extension  work, 
however.  Gains  in  yields  were  minimal,  and  India's  leaders 
came  to  realize  that  converting  millions  of  poor  farmers  to  the 
use  of  new  technologies  was  a  colossal  task. 

The  Community  Development  Programme  was  inaugurated 
in  1952  to  implement  a  systematic,  integrated  approach  to 
rural  development.  The  nation  was  divided  into  development 
blocks,  each  consisting  of  about  100  villages  having  popula- 
tions of  60,000  to  70,000  people.  By  1962  the  entire  country 
was  covered  by  more  than  5,000  such  blocks.  The  key  person  in 
the  program  was  the  village-level  worker,  who  was  responsible 
for  transmitting  to  about  ten  villages  not  only  farming  technol- 
ogy, but  also  village  uplift  programs  such  as  cooperation,  adult 
literacy,  health,  and  sanitation.  Although  each  block  was  staffed 
with  extension  workers,  the  villagers  themselves  were  expected 
to  provide  the  initiative  and  much  of  the  needed  financial  and 
labor  resources,  which  they  were  not  in  a  position  to  do  or 
inclined  to  do.  Although  progress  had  been  made  by  the  early 
1960s,  it  was  apparent  that  the  program  was  spread  too  thin  to 
bring  about  the  hoped-for  increase  in  agricultural  production. 
Criticism  of  the  program  led  to  more  specialized  development 


396 


Agriculture 


projects,  and  some  of  the  functions  were  taken  up  by  local  vil- 
lage bodies.  There  was  only  a  negligible  allocation  for  commu- 
nity development  in  the  sixth  plan,  however,  and  the  program 
was  phased  out  in  the  early  1980s. 

The  Intensive  Agricultural  District  Programme,  launched  in 
five  districts  in  1960  by  the  central  government  in  cooperation 
with  the  United  States-based  Ford  Foundation,  used  a  distinctly 
different  approach  to  boosting  farm  yields.  The  program  oper- 
ated under  the  premise  that  concentrating  scarce  inputs  in  the 
potentially  most  productive  districts  would  increase  farm-crop 
yield  faster  than  would  a  wider  but  less  concentrated  distribu- 
tion of  resources  in  less  productive  districts.  Among  these 
inputs  were  technical  staff,  fertilizers,  improved  seeds,  and 
credit.  Under  the  technical  guidance  of  American  cooperative 
specialists,  the  program  placed  unusual  emphasis  on  organiza- 
tional structures  and  administrative  arrangements.  For  the  first 
time,  modern  technology  was  systematically  introduced  to 
Indian  farmers.  Within  a  decade,  the  program  covered  fifteen 
districts,  28,000  villages,  and  1  million  inhabitants.  The  Inten- 
sive Agricultural  District  Programme  was  thus  a  significant 
influence  on  the  forthcoming  Green  Revolution. 

Irrigation 

Except  in  southeastern  India,  which  receives  most  of  its  rain 
from  the  northeast  monsoon  in  October  and  November,  dry- 
land cultivators  place  their  hopes  for  a  harvest  on  the  south- 
west monsoon,  which  usually  reaches  India  in  early  June  and  by 
mid-July  has  extended  to  the  entire  country.  There  are  great 
variations  in  the  average  amount  of  rainfall  received  by  the  var- 
ious regions — from  too  much  for  most  crops  in  the  eastern 
Himalayas  to  never  enough  in  Rajasthan.  Season-to-season  vari- 
ations in  rainfall  are  also  great.  The  consequence  is  bumper 
harvests  in  some  seasons,  crop-searing  drought  in  others. 
Therefore,  the  importance  of  irrigation  cannot  be  overempha- 
sized. 

Irrigation  has  been  a  high  priority  in  economic  development 
since  1951;  more  than  50  percent  of  all  public  expenditures  on 
agriculture  have  been  spent  on  irrigation  alone.  The  land  area 
under  irrigation  expanded  from  22.6  million  hectares  in  FY 
1950  to  59  million  hectares  in  FY  1990,  an  increase  of  161  per- 
cent in  four  decades  (see  table  28,  Appendix).  This  increase 
was  about  33  percent  of  the  estimated  potential.  The  overall 
strategy  has  been  to  concentrate  public  investments  in  surface 


397 


India:  A  Country  Study 


svstems.  such  as  large  dams,  long  canals,  and  other  large-scale 
works  requiring  huge  outlays  of  capital  oyer  a  period  of  years, 
and  in  deep-well  projects  that  also  involve  large  capital  outlavs. 
Shallow-well  schemes  and  small  surface-water  projects,  mainlv 
ponds  (called  tanks  in  India).,  have  been  supported  bv  govern- 
ment credit  but  were  otherwise  installed  and  operated  by  pri- 
vate entrepreneurs.  Roughly  42  percent  of  the  net  irrigated 
area  in  FY  1990  was  from  surface  water  sources.  Tanks,  step 
wells,  and  tube  wells  provided  another  51  percent:  the  rest 
came  from  other  sources. 

Between  1951  and  1990,  nearly  1,350  large-  and  medium- 
sized  irrigation  works  were  started,  and  about  850  were  com- 
pleted. The  most  ambitious  of  these  projects  was  the  Indira 
Gandhi  Canal,  with  an  anticipated  completion  date  of  close  to 
1999.  When  completed,  the  Indira  Gandhi  Canal  will  be  the 
world's  longest  irrigation  canal.  Besrinniner  at  the  Hairke  Bar- 
rage,  a  few  kilometers  below  the  confluence  of  the  Sutlej  and 
Beas  rivers  in  western  Punjab,  it  will  run  south-southwest  for 
650  kilometers,  terminating  deep  in  Raj  as  than  near  Jaisalmer, 
close  to  the  border  with  Pakistan.  A  dramatic  change  already 
had  taken  place  in  this  hot  and  inhospitable  wasteland  bv  the 
late  1980s.  As  a  result,  desert  dwellers  switched  from  raising 
goats  and  sheep  to  raising  wheat,  and  outsiders  flocked  in  to 
purchase  six-hectare  plots  for  the  equivalent  of  USS3.000. 

Progress  in  irrigation  has  not  been  without  problems.  Large 
dams  and  long  canals  are  costly  and  also  highly  visible  indica- 
tors of  progress:  the  political  pressure  to  launch  such  projects 
was  frequently  irresistible.  But  because  funds  and  technical 
expertise  were  in  short  supply  many  projects  moved  forward  at 
a  slow  pace.  The  Indira  Gandhi  Canal  project  is  a  leading 
example.  And  the  central  government's  transfer  of  huge 
amounts  of  water  from  Punjab  to  Haryana  and  Rajasthan,  fre- 
quently cited  as  a  source  of  grievance  bv  Sikhs  in  Punjab,  con- 
tributed to  the  civil  unrest  in  Punjab  during  the  1980s  and 
earlv  1990s  (see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8:  Insurgent  Movements 
and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10). 

Problems  also  have  arisen  as  ground  water  supplies  used  for 
irrigation  face  depletion.  Drawing  water  off  from  one  area  to 
irrigate  another  often  leads  to  increased  salinity  in  the  supply 
area  with  resultant  effects  on  crop  production  there.  Some 
areas  receiving  water  through  irrigation  are  poorly  managed  or 
inadequately  designed:  the  result  often  is  too  much  water  and 
water-logged  fields  incapable  of  production.  To  alleviate  this 


398 


Agriculture 


problem,  more  emphasis  is  being  placed  on  using  irrigation 
water  to  spray  fields  rather  than  allowing  it  to  flow  through 
ditches.  Furthermore,  charges  of  corruption  and  mismanage- 
ment have  been  levied  against  government-operated  facilities. 
Cases  of  bribery,  maldistribution  of  water,  and  carelessness  are 
frequently  raised  in  the  media. 

Another  major  problem  has  been  the  displacement  of  thou- 
sands of  people,  usually  poor  people,  by  large  hydroelectric 
projects.  Critics  also  claim  that  the  projects  are  damaging  to 
the  ecology.  Smaller  projects  and  such  traditional  methods  for 
irrigation  as  tanks  and  wells  are  seen  as  having  less  serious 
impact.  In  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  the  debate  between 
large-scale  versus  small-scale  projects  came  to  the  fore  because 
of  the  US$3  billion  Sardar  Sarovar  project  on  the  Narmada 
River.  Sardar  Sarovar,  as  conceived,  was  one  of  the  world's  larg- 
est hydroelectric  and  irrigation  projects.  Some  37,000  hectares 
of  land  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  and  Maharashtra  were 
slated  to  be  submerged  following  the  construction  of  some 
3,000  dams,  75,000  kilometers  of  canals,  and  an  electric  power 
generating  capacity  of  1,450  megawatts  of  power  per  year. 
Included  among  the  3,000  dams  was  the  proposed  160-meter- 
high  Sardar  Sarovar  Dam.  In  1985  the  World  Bank  (see  Glos- 
sary) agreed  to  loan  US$450  million  for  the  project.  Environ- 
mentalists in  India  and  abroad,  however,  argued  that  the 
project  was  ecologically  undesirable.  In  the  face  of  this  strong 
protest,  the  World  Bank  appointed  a  two-member  team  in  1991 
to  review  the  project.  Despite  a  negative  review  of  the  environ- 
mental impact  by  the  team,  World  Bank  funding  and  the 
project  continued.  By  1993,  however,  in  the  face  of  continued 
international  protest  as  well  as  opposition  and  a  call  for  a  satya- 
graha  (passive  resistance — see  Glossary)  by  villages  in  the 
affected  areas,  the  central  government  cancelled  the  dam 
project  loan.  Work  on  the  Sardar  Sarovar  project  continues, 
however,  with  funds  provided  by  the  central  government  and 
the  governments  of  the  three  states  involved. 

Although  India  had  the  second  largest  irrigated  area  in  the 
world,  the  area  under  assured  irrigation  or  with  at  least  mini- 
mal drainage  is  inadequate.  The  irrigation  potential  estimated 
to  have  been  created  by  the  early  1990s  was  about  82.8  million 
hectares.  This  amount  includes  the  gross  irrigated  area  plus 
the  potential  for  double  cropping  provided  by  irrigation. 
There  was  a  cumulative  gap  in  irrigated  land  use  of  about  8.6

million  hectares  until  FY  1990,  by  which  time  the  gap  had 
decreased  through  improved  land  management. 

Seeds 

The  central  government  established  the  National  Seeds  Cor- 
poration in  1963  and  the  State  Farm  Corporations  of  India  in 
1969  to  encourage  production  and  distribution  of  certified 
seeds  of  various  crops.  Thirteen  state  seed  corporations  were 
established  to  arrange  production  and  distribution  of  certified 
seeds.  Production  of  breeder  seed  was  organized  by  the  Indian 
Council  of  Agricultural  Research  through  interested  breeders 
and  scientists.  The  National  Seeds  Corporation  and  State  Farm 
Corporations  of  India  also  produced  breeder  seeds.  The  avail- 
ability of  breeder  seeds  increased  eightfold  during  the  1980s, 
from  391.4  tons  in  FY  1981  to  3,213  tons  in  FY  1988. 

The  production  and  availability  of  seeds  has  increased  enor- 
mously since  the  late  1970s.  The  distribution  of  certified  and 
quality  seeds  showed  an  increase  from  140,000  tons  in  FY  1979 
to  568,000  tons  in  FY  1988.  A  buffer  stock  of  seeds  is  main- 
tained by  the  National  Seeds  Corporation  for  the  northeastern 
states  and  by  the  State  Farm  Corporations  of  India  for  the 
other  states  against  such  unforeseen  contingencies  as  floods, 
droughts,  and  diseases. 

Fertilizer 

The  rate  of  fertilizer  consumption  increased  dramatically 
after  independence,  although  it  was  still  lower  than  in  most 
other  countries  worldwide.  India  used  only  sixty-nine  kilograms 
per  hectare  in  1989,  ranking  it  fifty-sixth  worldwide  and  below 
all  its  South  Asian  neighbors  except  Nepal.  Fertilizer  consump- 
tion increased  from  approximately  69,000  tons  of  nutrients  in 
FY  1950  to  12.6  million  tons  in  FY  1990,  and  was  expected  to  be 
about  13.8  million  tons  in  FY  1993.  Punjab  used  the  highest 
amount  of  fertilizer  per  hectare  followed  by  Tamil  Nadu.  The 
use  of  fertilizers  was  high  in  Punjab  and  Harayana  in  the  north 
because  of  adequate  irrigation.  In  the  south,  other  than  in 
Tamil  Nadu,  consumption,  especially  in  Andhra  Pradesh  and 
Kerala,  was  higher  than  the  national  average.  The  disparity  in 
the  use  of  fertilizers  across  states  was  decreasing,  however.  Cow 
dung  is  an  important  source  of  fertilizer — and  fuel — in  India. 
Statistics  on  its  usage,  however,  are  not  available. 

The  fertilizer  subsidy  has  been  growing  since  FY  1976.  The 
initial  subsidy  was  a  response  to  the  increase  in  the  price  of 


400

crude  oil  by  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting 
Countries  (OPEC — see  Glossary).  The  price  increase  led  to  a 
rise  in  the  cost  of  naphtha,  which  in  turn  increased  fertilizer 
prices.  The  fertilizer  subsidy  increased  from  Rs600  million  in 
FY  1976  to  Rs32  billion  in  FY  1988,  to  nearly  Rs44  billion  in  FY 
1990.  Further  increases  are  expected  as  the  decade  progresses. 
Plans  in  1992  to  cut  the  subsidy  by  40  percent  were  curtailed 
following  heavy  political  opposition  from  the  major  farming 
states. 

Plant  Protection  and  Pesticides 

The  government  has  introduced  integrated  pest  manage- 
ment at  the  central  and  state  levels  for  purposes  of  plant  pro- 
tection. Twenty-five  central,  integrated  pest-management 
centers  have  been  established  in  twenty-two  states  and  one 
union  territory  for  pest  surveillance  and  monitoring,  promo- 
tion of  biocontrol  methods  of  conservation,  promotion  of 
nonchemical  methods  of  pest  control,  training  of  extension 
workers  and  farmers,  and  demonstration  farms. 

The  use  of  synthetic  pesticides  has  increased  steadily 
because  of  the  spreading  use  of  new  high-yielding  varieties  of 
seeds  and  their  greater  vulnerability  to  plant  pests  and  diseases. 
The  sale  of  synthetic  pesticides  jumped  from  8,620  tons  in  crop 
year  1960-61  to  65,000  tons  in  1982-83  and  85,660  tons  in 


401 


India:  A  Country  Study 

1989-90.  In  1960  only  about  6  million  hectares  received  chemi- 
cal pesticides,  but  by  the  early  1980s  some  100  million  hectares 
were  being  treated,  and  the  growth  in  coverage  continues  in 
the  1990s.  The  rapid  rise  in  the  use  of  plant  protection  led  to 
the  enactment  of  the  Insecticides  Act  of  1968  to  regulate  the 
import,  sale,  transport,  distribution,  and  use  of  insecticides. 

Technology  and  Mechanization 

Despite  the  pervasive,  large-scale  use  of  draft  animals 
throughout  India,  agricultural  machinery  and  implements, 
tractors,  in  particular,  have  had  an  important  place  in  increas- 
ing agricultural  productivity.  The  stock  of  tractors  increased 
from  8,600  in  FY  1950  to  518,500  in  FY  1982  and  continued  to 
grow  rapidly  throughout  the  1980s  (see  table  29,  Appendix). 
The  number  and  sale  of  power  tillers  and  combine  harvesters 
produced  and  sold  was  small,  with  4,678  tillers  and  110  harvest- 
ers sold  in  FY  1988.  There  was  a  significant  increase  in  the 
number  of  electric  pumps  and  oil  pump  sets  for  irrigation  dur- 
ing the  1980s. 

The  production  and  use  of  machinery  are  hampered  by  the 
small  size  of  many  operational  holdings.  However,  a  number  of 
improved  agricultural  implements  are  available  for  tilling, 
seeding  and  fertilizer  application,  weeding,  harvesting,  and 
threshing.  The  implements  include  moldboard  plows,  disc  har- 
rows, cultivators,  seed  drills  (more  than  110,000  were  sold 
annually  in  the  early  1990s),  and  mechanical  power  threshers. 
These  tools  have  the  potential  of  increasing  yields  for  all  crops, 
but  the  adoption  rate  of  improved  machinery  is  low.  The  Cen- 
tral Institute  of  Agricultural  Engineering  at  Bhopal,  Madhya 
Pradesh,  under  the  aegis  of  the  Indian  Council  for  Agricultural 
Research,  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  manufacture  and 
promotion  of  technology  for  small  and  marginal  farmers.  The 
government  introduced  an  incentive  scheme  in  1990  to  subsi- 
dize the  cost  of  machinery  by  up  to  50  percent  to  small  and 
marginal  farms.  Additionally,  farmers'  agroservice  centers  are 
being  established  to  provide  custom  service  for  improved 
implements  and  machinery.  The  eighth  plan  includes  a  major 
thrust  for  upgrading  and  adopting  proven  technology 

In  a  country  with  a  large  and  growing  labor  force,  too  much 
mechanization  in  the  short  run  could  create  fossil  fuel  short- 
ages as  well  as  social  and  economic  problems  (see  Size  and 
Composition  of  the  Work  Force,  ch.  6).  There  is,  nevertheless, 
room  for  improvements  in  technology.  Since  FY  1983,  there 


402 


Agriculture 


have  been  attempts  to  popularize  improved  animal-drawn  agri- 
cultural implements  and  hand  tools  through  demonstrations 
and  subsidies  to  small  and  marginal  farmers. 

Despite  these  advances  in  mechanization,  most  crops  are  still 
sown,  transplanted,  weeded,  and  harvested  through  labor- 
intensive  human  work.  Most  grains  are  harvested  by  teams  of 
laborers  wielding  hand-forged  iron  sickles,  binding  up  sheaves 
of  grain,  and  carrying  loads  of  sheaves  on  their  heads  to  bul- 
lock carts  to  be  transported  to  threshing  floors.  Teams  of  bul- 
locks are  then  driven  over  the  sheaves  to  separate  the  grains 
from  the  stalks,  and  workers  toss  basketloads  of  grain  into  the 
air  to  separate  the  grain  from  the  chaff.  Lentils,  a  crucial  part 
of  the  Indian  diet,  also  are  harvested  through  labor-intensive 
means.  Groups  of  laborers  squat  down  in  fields  for  hours  at  a 
time,  ripping  out  lentil  plants  at  the  root  by  hand.  Machinery 
available  to  lentil  farmers  has  proven  difficult  to  use,  and  tradi- 
tional methods  are  preferred. 

Price  Policy  and  Terms  of  Trade 

After  independence,  India's  initial  price  policy  could  be 
characterized  as  serving  the  interests  of  the  consumers,  partic- 
ularly where  food  grains  were  concerned,  and  most  of  all  in 
regard  to  wheat.  Food  prices  were  kept  low  to  provide  cheap 
food  for  urban  consumers  under  the  theory  that  a  cheap  and 
easy  supply  of  wage  goods — of  which  food  grains  formed  the 
main  component — would  inhibit  inflationary  pressures  on  the 
economy.  This  policy,  buttressed  with  imports  under  the 
United  States  Public  Law  480  Food  for  Peace  Program,  kept 
prices  at  a  low  level  during  the  late  1950s  and  early  1960s  but 
did  not  provide  incentives  for  Indian  farmers  to  invest  or 
increase  production.  The  terms  of  trade  vis-a-vis  manufacturing 
were  favorable  to  agriculture  in  FY  1959  and  then  on  a  par  with 
other  sectors  for  three  years.  Thereafter,  when  manufacturing 
prices  went  up  faster  than  agricultural  prices  as  a  result  of  gov- 
ernment policy,  terms  of  trade  favored  manufacturing  and 
turned  against  the  agricultural  sector.  This  change  led  to  a 
food  crisis  in  the  mid-1960s  when  agricultural  production  fell. 

From  about  1965,  the  need  to  guarantee  remunerative 
prices  to  farmers  was  stressed  to  ensure  self-sufficiency  in  food- 
grain  production  as  soon  as  possible.  The  Agricultural  Prices 
Commission — in  1993  called  the  Commission  for  Agricultural 
Costs  and  Prices — was  set  up  to  advise  the  government  on  agri- 
cultural prices,  keeping  in  view  the  interests  of  both  the  con- 


403 


India:  A  Country  Study 

sumer  and  the  producer.  Of  particular  concern  were  prices  for 
wheat,  rice,  coarse  grains,  pulses,  sugarcane,  oilseeds,  cotton, 
and  jute.  In  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  the  commission  was 
supplied  with  cost  of  production  data,  compiled  through  sam- 
ple surveys,  to  improve  its  effectiveness  in  setting  prices.  The 
commission  was  reasonably  successful  in  providing  remunera- 
tive prices  for  farmers.  It  used  the  price  mechanism  to  increase 
the  production  of  commodities  in  demand,  such  as  oilseeds  at 
the  end  of  the  1980s,  and  to  keep  prices  at  a  reasonable  level 
for  consumers. 

Production 
Crop  Output 

The  average  rate  of  output  growth  since  the  1950s  has  been 
more  than  2.5  percent  per  year  and  was  greater  than  3  percent 
during  the  1980s,  compared  with  less  than  1  percent  per 
annum  during  the  period  from  1900  to  1950.  Most  of  the 
growth  in  aggregate  crop  output  was  the  result  of  an  increase 
in  yields,  rather  than  an  increase  in  the  area  under  crops.  The 
yield  performance  of  crops  has  varied  widely  (see  table  30, 
Appendix). 

The  national  growth  rates  mask  variability  in  the  perfor- 
mance of  different  states,  but  in  the  regions  with  the  greatest 
increases  three  categories  are  discernible.  The  first  category 
includes  states  or  areas  that  have  an  exceptionally  high  agricul- 
tural growth  rate — Punjab,  Haryana,  and  western  Uttar 
Pradesh.  The  second  is  states  or  areas  that  have  high  growth 
rates,  but  not  as  high  as  the  first  category — Andhra  Pradesh, 
Maharashtra,  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  A  third  category  has  a 
lesser  growth  rate  and  includes  Bihar,  Gujarat,  Karnataka, 
Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Tamil  Nadu,  eastern  Uttar  Pradesh,  and 
West  Bengal.  These  eight  states,  however,  comprise  55  percent 
of  the  total  food-grains  area  (see  fig.  13). 

Some  observers  believe  that  the  increase  in  productivity  has 
been  an  important  factor  explaining  the  satisfactory  growth  of 
food-grain  production  since  the  mid-1960s.  However,  the  gains 
in  productivity  remain  confined  to  select  areas.  Between  FY 
1960  and  FY  1980,  yields  increased  by  125.6  percent  in  North 
India  (Punjab,  Haryana,  and  western  Uttar  Pradesh).  The 
increase  in  the  other  regions  was  much  less:  central  India,  36 
percent;  eastern,  22.7  percent;  southern,  58.3  percent;  and 
western  India,  31.6  percent.  The  national  average  was  nearly 


404 


Agriculture 


40.9  percent.  Part  of  this  disparity  can  be  explained  by  the  fact 
that  during  this  period  Punjab  and  Haryana  were  way  ahead  of 
other  states  in  terms  of  irrigated  area,  intensity  of  irrigation, 
and  intensity  of  cropping.  Availability  of  irrigation  is  one  of  the 
crucial  factors  governing  regional  variations. 

As  a  result  of  a  good  monsoon  during  FY  1990,  food  grain 
production  reached  176  million  tons,  3  percent  more  than  in 
FY  1989.  The  production  of  rice  and  wheat  was  74.6  million 
and  54.5  million  tons,  respectively.  Among  the  commercial 
crops,  sugarcane  and  oilseeds  reached  production  levels  of 
240.3  million  tons  and  21.8  million  tons,  respectively.  The 
increased  production  in  FY  1990  was  mainly  the  result  of  con- 
tinuing increases  in  yields  for  all  the  main  crops — rice,  wheat, 
pulses,  and  oilseeds.  In  the  case  of  oilseeds  and  sugarcane, 
higher  production  was  also  the  result  of  the  increased  number 
of  hectares  planted  (see  table  31,  Appendix). 

The  growth  in  food-grain  production  did  not  occur  in  a  lin- 
ear trend,  but  as  a  series  of  spurts  depending  mostly  on  the 
weather,  input  availability,  and  price  policy.  Aggregate  growth 
was  composed  of  an  even  split  between  area  expansion  and 
yield  growth  before  FY  1964.  Since  FY  1967,  the  contribution  of 
growth  in  yields  has  become  dominant  and  attests  to  the  vigor 
with  which  agriculture  has  responded  to  the  opportunities 
opened  up  by  new  seed,  water,  and  fertilizer  technology. 

Food-Grain  Production 

Food  grains  include  rice,  wheat,  corn  (maize),  coarse  grains 
(sorghum  and  millet),  and  pulses  (beans,  dried  peas,  and  len- 
tils). In  FY  1990,  approximately  127.5  million  hectares  were 
sown  with  food  grains,  about  75  percent  of  the  total  planted 
area.  The  total  number  of  hectares  increased  by  31  percent 
over  the  forty-year  period  from  FY  1950  to  FY  1990.  Most  of  this 
increase  occurred  in  the  1950s;  there  was  almost  no  change  in 
the  sown  number  of  hectares  through  the  1980s.  Around  33 
percent  of  cropland  was  given  over  to  rice,  about  29  percent  to 
coarse  grains,  and  the  rest  evenly  divided  between  wheat  and 
pulses. 

Rice,  India's  preeminent  crop,  is  the  staple  food  of  the  peo- 
ple of  the  eastern  and  southern  parts  of  the  country.  Produc- 
tion increased  from  53.6  million  tons  in  FY  1980  to  74.6  million 
tons  in  FY  1990,  a  39  percent  increase  over  the  decade.  By  FY 
1992,  rice  production  had  reached  111  million  tons,  second  in 
the  world  only  to  China  with  its  182  million  tons.  Since  1950 


407 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  increase  has  been  more  than  350  percent.  Most  of  this 
increase  was  the  result  of  an  increase  in  yields;  the  number  of 
hectares  increased  only  40  percent  during  this  period.  Yields 
increased  from  1,336  kilograms  per  hectare  in  FY  1980  to  1,751 
kilograms  per  hectare  in  FY  1990.  The  per-hectare  yield 
increased  more  than  262  percent  between  1950  and  1992. 

Wheat  production  showed  an  843  percent  increase,  from 
nearly  6.5  million  tons  in  FY  1950  to  54.5  million  tons  in  FY 
1990  to  56.7  million  tons  in  FY  1992.  Most  of  this  greater  pro- 
duction was  the  result  of  an  increase  in  yields  that  went  from 
663  kilograms  per  hectare  in  FY  1950  to  2,274  kilograms  in  FY 
1990.  Along  with  the  excellent  performance  in  yields, 
improved  wheat  production  resulted  from  an  increase  in  the 
area  planted  from  nearly  9.8  million  hectares  in  FY  1950  to  24.0 
million  hectares  in  FY  1990. 

Sorghum  and  millet,  the  principal  coarse  grains,  are  dryland 
crops  most  frequently  grown  as  staples  in  central  and  western 
India.  Corn  and  barley  are  staple  foods  grown  mainly  near  and 
in  the  Himalayan  region.  As  the  result  of  increased  yields,  the 
production  of  coarse  grains  has  doubled  since  1950;  there  was 
hardly  any  change  in  the  area  sown  for  these  grains.  The  pro- 
duction of  pulses  did  not  fare  well,  increasing  by  only  68  per- 
cent over  the  four  decades.  Land  devoted  to  pulses  increased 
by  28  percent,  and  yields  were  up  by  30  percent.  Pulses  are  an 
important  source  of  protein  in  the  vegetarian  diet;  the  small 
improvement  in  production  along  with  the  increase  in  popula- 
tion meant  a  reduced  availability  of  pulses  per  capita. 

Before  the  Green  Revolution,  coarse  grains  showed  satisfac- 
tory rates  of  growth  but  afterward  lost  cultivated  areas  to  wheat 
and  rice,  and  their  growth  declined.  The  area  sown  with  coarse 
grains  increased  from  FY  1950  to  FY  1970  by  roughly  20  per- 
cent but  declined  subsequently  up  to  the  early  1990s.  In  FY 
1990  the  area  sown  was  3  percent  less  than  in  FY  1950  and  20 
percent  less  than  in  FY  1970.  The  area  sown  with  two  coarse 
grains,  jowar  (barley)  and  bajra  (millet),  increased  from  FY 
1950  to  FY  1970  and  then  declined  during  the  1970s  and  the 
1980s.  The  area  sown  with  jowar  increased  from  15.6  million 
hectares  in  FY  1950  to  17.4  million  hectares  in  FY  1970  and 
then  decreased  to  14.5  million  hectares  in  FY  1990.  The  area 
sown  with  bajra  increased  from  9.0  million  hectares  in  FY  1950 
to  12.9  million  hectares  in  FY  1970  and  stood  at  10.4  million 
hectares  in  FY  1990.  A  similar  pattern  existed  for  other  coarse 
grains.  Overall,  India's  coarse-grain  production  increased  from 


408 


Agriculture 


15.4  million  tons  in  1950  to  29  million  tons  in  1980  to  33.1  mil- 
lion tons  in  1990  and  33.7  million  tons  in  1993. 

Oilseeds 

India  in  the  mid-1990s  has  almost  attained  self-sufficiency  in 
the  production  of  oilseeds  to  extract  vegetable  oil,  essential  in 
the  Indian  diet.  Peanuts,  grown  mainly  as  a  rain-fed  crop  on 
part  of  the  semiarid  areas  of  western  and  southern  India, 
account  for  the  largest  source  of  the  nation's  production  of 
vegetable  oils.  The  second-ranking  source  of  vegetable  oils  in 
the  early  1990s  was  rapeseed.  Cottonseed,  an  important 
by-product  of  cotton  fiber  and  once  mostly  fed  to  cattle,  was 
another  source  of  vegetable  oils.  Soybeans  and  sunflower  seeds 
were  relatively  new  as  significant  oilseeds,  but  their  production 
increased  rapidly  in  the  1980s. 

The  production  of  oilseeds  increased  from  5.2  million  tons 
in  FY  1950  to  21.8  million  tons  in  FY  1990.  Specific  information 
regarding  area  planted  is  not  available  for  all  oilseeds,  but  it 
increased  in  the  1980s,  as  did  the  yields.  The  growth  of  produc- 
tion before  the  mid-1970s  was  not  adequate  to  meet  the  needs 
of  the  increasing  population,  and  large  quantities  had  to  be 
imported  from  the  1970s  to  the  mid-1980s,  using  scarce  foreign 
exchange. 

Commercial  Crops 

India  is  the  largest  producer  of  sugar  in  the  world,  harvest- 
ing 12  million  tons  in  1993,  followed  by  Brazil's  9  million  tons 
and  China's  7  million  tons.  Sugar  availability  per  capita 
increased  from  4.7  kilograms  per  year  in  FY  1960  to  12.5  kilo- 
grams per  year  in  FY  1990,  following  the  more  than  fourfold 
increase  in  production  from  57  million  tons  in  FY  1950  to  240 
million  tons  in  FY  1990.  This  increase  in  production  was  a 
result  of  the  doubling  of  the  yield  per  hectare  and  a  doubling 
of  the  area  sown  with  sugar.  Imports  of  sugar  were  negligible  in 
FY  1992  and  FY  1993.  However,  in  the  FY  1995  budget  presenta- 
tion to  the  Lok  Sabha  in  March  1995,  Minister  of  Finance  Man- 
mohan  Singh  said  it  was  necessary  to  supplement  the  public 
distribution  system  with  "necessary  imports  of  sugar." 

Raw  cotton  is  the  most  important  nonfood  commodity  pro- 
duced on  India's  farms.  Cotton  was  an  important  export  crop 
in  the  1950s,  but  thereafter  it  provided  the  raw  material  for 
India's  textile  industry,  which  grew  greatly  to  meet  the  needs  of 
an  expanding  population  (see  Manufacturing,  ch.  6).  Cotton

fabrics  found  an  expanding  international  market  in  the  1980s 
and  earned  valuable  foreign  exchange.  The  foreign  exchange 
earned  from  raw  cotton,  cotton  yarn,  and  fabrics  of  all  textile 
materials  increased  from  US$163  million  in  FY  1960  to  US$1.4 
billion  in  FY  1980  to  nearly  US$3.9  billion  in  FY  1990  and 
US$3.8  billion  by  FY  1992.  Cotton  production  increased  from 
600,000  tons  in  FY  1950  to  nearly  1.7  million  tons  in  FY  1990. 
These  improvements  largely  resulted  from  increased  yields,  as 
there  was  little  increase  in  the  sown  area  devoted  to  cotton. 

Raw  jute  is  second  only  to  cotton  as  a  farm-produced  indus- 
trial raw  material.  Before  partition  in  1947,  India  was  the 
world's  main  supplier  of  jute  and  jute  goods  used  as  packaging 
material.  As  a  result  of  the  partition  of  India  and  Pakistan,  the 
main  jute  growing  area  was  in  East  Pakistan  (eastern  Bengal, 
after  1971  the  independent  nation  of  Bangladesh),  and  the  fac- 
tories manufacturing  jute  goods  were  in  West  Bengal,  which 
remained  part  of  India  after  partition.  Jute  also  had  been 
India's  main  source  of  export  earnings.  As  a  result,  there  was  a 
concerted  effort  to  increase  raw  jute  production.  The  area 
sown  with  jute  increased  from  571,000  hectares  in  FY  1950  to 
nearly  1.2  million  hectares  in  FY  1985  but  then  decreased  to 
692,000  hectares  in  FY  1988.  Yields  increased  steadily  from 
1,040  kilograms  per  hectare  in  FY  1950  to  1,803  kilograms  per 
hectare  in  FY  1990.  These  two  factors  combined  to  more  than 
double  jute  production  from  595  million  tons  in  FY  1950  to  1.4 
billion  tons  in  FY  1990,  with  a  maximum  production  of  nearly  2 
billion  tons  in  FY  1985.  Because  technological  changes  in  pack- 
aging reduced  the  worldwide  demand  for  jute,  production  in 
the  early  1990s  was  mainly  for  the  domestic  market.  In  FY  1990, 
jute  provided  less  than  1  percent  of  export  earnings. 

The  Green  Revolution 

The  introduction  of  high-yielding  varieties  of  seeds  after 
1965  and  the  increased  use  of  fertilizers  and  irrigation  are 
known  collectively  as  the  Green  Revolution,  which  provided 
the  increase  in  production  needed  to  make  India  self-sufficient 
in  food  grains.  The  program  was  started  with  the  help  of  the 
United  States-based  Rockefeller  Foundation  and  was  based  on 
high-yielding  varieties  of  wheat,  rice,  and  other  grains  that  had 
been  developed  in  Mexico  and  in  the  Philippines.  Of  the  high- 
yielding  seeds,  wheat  produced  the  best  results.  Production  of 
coarse  grains — the  staple  diet  of  the  poor — and  pulses — the

main  source  of  protein — lagged  behind,  resulting  in  reduced 
per  capita  availability. 

The  total  area  under  the  high-yielding-varieties  program  was 
a  negligible  1.9  million  hectares  in  FY  1960.  Since  then  growth 
has  been  spectacular,  increasing  to  nearly  15.4  million  hectares 
by  FY  1970,  43.1  million  hectares  by  FY  1980,  and  63.9  million 
hectares  by  FY  1990.  The  rate  of  growth  decreased  significantly 
in  the  late  1980s,  however,  as  additional  suitable  land  was  not 
available  (see  table  32,  Appendix). 

The  major  benefits  of  the  Green  Revolution  were  experi- 
enced mainly  in  northern  and  northwestern  India  between 
1965  and  the  early  1980s;  the  program  resulted  in  a  substantial 
increase  in  the  production  of  food  grains,  mainly  wheat  and 
rice.  Food-grain  yields  continued  to  increase  throughout  the 
1980s,  but  the  dramatic  changes  in  the  years  between  1965  and 
1980  were  not  duplicated.  By  FY  1980,  almost  75  percent  of  the 
total  cropped  area  under  wheat  was  sown  with  high-yielding 
varieties.  For  rice  the  comparable  figure  was  45  percent.  In  the 
1980s,  the  area  under  high-yielding  varieties  continued  to 
increase,  but  the  rate  of  growth  overall  was  slower.  The  eighth 
plan  aimed  at  making  high-yielding  varieties  available  to  the 
whole  country  and  developing  more  productive  strains  of 
other  crops. 

The  Green  Revolution  created  wide  regional  and  interstate 
disparities.  The  plan  was  implemented  only  in  areas  with 
assured  supplies  of  water  and  the  means  to  control  it,  large 
inputs  of  fertilizers,  and  adequate  farm  credit.  These  inputs 
were  easily  available  in  at  least  parts  of  the  states  of  Punjab, 
Haryana,  and  western  Uttar  Pradesh;  thus,  yields  increased 


411 


India:  A  Country  Study 


most  in  these  states.  In  other  states,  such  as  Andhra  Pradesh 
and  Tamil  Nadu,  in  areas  where  these  inputs  were  not  assured, 
the  results  were  limited  or  negligible,  leading  to  considerable 
variation  in  crop  yields  within  these  states.  The  Green  Revolu- 
tion also  increased  income  disparities:  higher  income  growth 
and  reduced  incidence  of  poverty  were  found  in  the  states 
where  yields  increased  the  most  and  lower  income  growth  and 
little  change  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  other  states. 

Livestock  and  Poultry 

A  large  number  of  farmers  depend  on  livestock  for  their  live- 
lihood. In  addition  to  supplying  milk,  meat,  eggs,  and  hides, 
animals,  mainly  bullocks,  are  the  major  source  of  power  for 
both  farmers  and  drayers.  Thus,  animal  husbandry  plays  an 
important  role  in  the  rural  economy.  The  gross  value  of  output 
from  this  sector  was  Rs358  billion  in  FY  1989,  an  amount  that 
constituted  about  25  percent  of  the  total  agricultural  output  of 
Rsl.4  trillion. 

In  FY  1992,  India  had  approximately  25  percent  of  the 
world's  cattle,  with  a  collective  herd  of  193  million  head.  India 
also  had  110  million  goats,  75  million  water  buffalo,  44  million 
sheep,  and  10  million  pigs.  Milk  production  in  FY  1990  was  esti- 
mated to  have  reached  53.5  million  tons,  and  egg  production 
had  reached  a  level  of  23.3  billion  eggs.  Dairy  farming  pro- 
vided supplementary  employment  and  an  additional  source  of 
income  to  many  small  and  marginal  farmers.  The  National 
Dairy  Development  Board  was  established  in  1965  under  the 
auspices  of  Operation  Flood  at  Anand,  in  Gujarat,  to  promote, 
plan,  and  organize  dairy  development  through  cooperatives;  to 
provide  consultations;  and  to  set  up  dairy  plants,  which  were 
then  turned  over  to  the  cooperatives.  There  were  more  than 
63,000  Anand-style  dairy  cooperative  societies  with  some  7.5 
million  members  in  the  early  1990s.  The  milk  produced  and 
sold  by  these  farmers  brought  Rs320  million  a  day,  or  more 
than  RslO  trillion  a  year.  The  increase  in  milk  production  per- 
mitted India  to  end  imports  of  powdered  milk  and  milk-related 
products.  In  addition,  30,000  tons  of  powdered  milk  were 
exported  annually  to  neighboring  countries. 

Operation  Flood,  the  world's  largest  integrated  dairy  devel- 
opment program,  attempted  to  establish  linkages  between 
rural  milk  producers  and  urban  consumers  by  organizing 
farmer-owned  and  -managed  dairy  cooperative  societies.  In  the 
early  1990s,  the  program  was  in  its  third  phase  and  was  receiv- 


412

ing  financial  assistance  from  the  World  Bank  and  commodity 
assistance  from  the  European  Economic  Community.  At  that 
time,  India  had  more  than  64,000  dairy  cooperative  societies, 
with  close  to  7.7  million  members.  These  cooperatives  estab- 
lished a  daily  processing  capacity  of  15.5  million  liters  of  whole 
milk  and  727  tons  of  milk  powder. 

Forestry 

Some  50  million  hectares,  about  17  percent  of  India's  land 
area,  were  regarded  as  forestland  in  the  early  1990s.  In  FY  1987, 
however,  actual  forest  cover  was  64  million  hectares.  However, 
because  more  than  50  percent  of  this  land  was  barren  or  brush- 
land,  the  area  under  productive  forest  was  actually  less  than  35 
million  hectares,  or  approximately  10  percent  of  the  country's 
land  area.  The  growing  population's  high  demand  for  forest 
resources  continued  the  destruction  and  degradation  of  forests 
through  the  1980s,  taking  a  heavy  toll  on  the  soil.  An  estimated 
6  billion  tons  of  topsoil  were  lost  annually.  However,  India's  0.6 
percent  average  annual  rate  of  deforestation  for  agricultural 
and  nonlumbering  land  uses  in  the  decade  beginning  in  1981 
was  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  and  on  a  par  with  Brazil. 

Many  forests  in  the  mid-1990s  are  found  in  high-rainfall, 
high-altitude  regions,  areas  to  which  access  is  difficult.  About 
20  percent  of  total  forestland  is  in  Madhya  Pradesh;  other 
states  with  significant  forests  are  Orissa,  Maharashtra,  and 
Andhra  Pradesh  (each  with  about  9  percent  of  the  national 
total);  Arunachal  Pradesh  (7  percent);  and  Uttar  Pradesh  (6 
percent).  The  variety  of  forest  vegetation  is  large:  there  are  600 
species  of  hardwoods,  sal  (Shorea  robusta)  and  teak  being  the 
principal  economic  species. 

Conservation  has  been  an  avowed  goal  of  government  policy 
since  independence.  Afforestation  increased  from  a  negligible 
amount  in  the  first  plan  to  nearly  8.9  million  hectares  in  the 
seventh  plan.  The  cumulative  area  afforested  during  the  1951- 
91  period  was  nearly  17.9  million  hectares.  However,  despite 
large-scale  tree  planting  programs,  forestry  is  one  arena  in 
which  India  has  actually  regressed  since  independence.  Annual 
fellings  at  about  four  times  the  growth  rate  are  a  major  cause. 
Widespread  pilfering  by  villagers  for  firewood  and  fodder  also 
represents  a  major  decrement.  In  addition,  the  forested  area 
has  been  shrinking  as  a  result  of  land  cleared  for  farming, 
inundations  for  irrigation  and  hydroelectric  power  projects, 


413 


India:  A  Country  Study 


and  construction  of  new  urban  areas,  industrial  plants,  roads, 
power  lines,  and  schools. 

India's  long-term  strategy  for  forestry  development  reflects 
three  major  objectives:  to  reduce  soil  erosion  and  flooding;  to 
supply  the  growing  needs  of  the  domestic  wood  products 
industries;  and  to  supply  the  needs  of  the  rural  population  for 
fuelwood,  fodder,  small  timber,  and  miscellaneous  forest  pro- 
duce. To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  National  Commission  on 
Agriculture  in  1976  recommended  the  reorganization  of  state 
forestry  departments  and  advocated  the  concept  of  social  for- 
estry. The  commission  itself  worked  on  the  first  two  objectives, 
emphasizing  traditional  forestry  and  wildlife  activities;  in  pur- 
suit of  the  third  objective,  the  commission  recommended  the 
establishment  of  a  new  kind  of  unit  to  develop  community  for- 
ests. Following  the  leads  of  Gujarat  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  a  num- 
ber of  other  states  also  established  community-based  forestry 
agencies  that  emphasized  programs  on  farm  forestry,  timber 
management,  extension  forestry,  reforestation  of  degraded  for- 
ests, and  use  of  forests  for  recreational  purposes. 

Such  socially  responsible  forestry  was  encouraged  by  state 
community  forestry  agencies.  They  emphasized  such  projects 
as  planting  wood  lots  on  denuded  communal  cattle-grazing 
grounds  to  make  villages  self-sufficient  in  fuelwood,  to  supply 
timber  needed  for  the  construction  of  village  houses,  and  to 
provide  the  wood  needed  for  the  repair  of  farm  implements. 
Both  individual  farmers  and  tribal  communities  were  also 
encouraged  to  grow  trees  for  profit.  For  example,  in  Gujarat, 
one  of  the  more  aggressive  states  in  developing  programs  of 
socioeconomic  importance,  the  forestry  department  distrib- 
uted 200  million  tree  seedlings  in  1983.  The  fast-growing  euca- 
lyptus is  the  main  species  being  planted  nationwide,  followed 
by  pine  and  poplar. 

The  role  of  forests  in  the  national  economy  and  in  ecology 
was  further  emphasized  in  the  1988  National  Forest  Policy, 
which  focused  on  ensuring  environmental  stability,  restoring 
the  ecological  balance,  and  preserving  the  remaining  forests. 
Other  objectives  of  the  policy  were  meeting  the  need  for  fuel- 
wood,  fodder,  and  small  timber  for  rural  and  tribal  people 
while  recognizing  the  need  to  actively  involve  local  people  in 
the  management  of  forest  resources.  Also  in  1988,  the  Forest 
Conservation  Act  of  1980  was  amended  to  facilitate  stricter 
conservation  measures.  A  new  target  was  to  increase  the  forest 
cover  to  33  percent  of  India's  land  area  from  the  then-official

estimate  of  23  percent.  In  June  1990,  the  central  government 
adopted  resolutions  that  combined  forest  science  with  social 
forestry,  that  is,  taking  the  sociocultural  traditions  of  the  local 
people  into  consideration. 

Since  the  early  1970s,  as  they  realized  that  deforestation 
threatened  not  only  the  ecology  but  their  livelihood  in  a  variety 
of  ways,  people  have  become  more  interested  and  involved  in 
conservation.  The  best  known  popular  activist  movement  is  the 
Chipko  Movement,  in  which  local  women  decided  to  fight  the 
government  and  the  vested  interests  to  save  trees.  The  women 
of  Chamoli  District,  Uttar  Pradesh,  declared  that  they  would 
embrace — literally  "to  stick  to"  (chipkna  in  Hindi) — trees  if  a 
sporting  goods  manufacturer  attempted  to  cut  down  ash  trees 
in  their  district.  Since  initial  activism  in  1973,  the  movement 
has  spread  and  become  an  ecological  movement  leading  to 
similar  actions  in  other  forest  areas.  The  movement  has  slowed 
down  the  process  of  deforestation,  exposed  vested  interests, 
increased  ecological  awareness,  and  demonstrated  the  viability 
of  people  power. 

Fishing 

Fish  production  has  increased  more  than  fivefold  since  inde- 
pendence. It  rose  from  only  800,000  tons  in  FY  1950  to  4.1  mil- 


415 


India:  A  Country  Study 

lion  tons  in  the  early  1990s.  Special  efforts  have  been  made  to 
promote  extensive  and  intensive  inland  fish  farming,  modern- 
ize coastal  fisheries,  and  encourage  deep-sea  fishing  through 
joint  ventures.  These  efforts  led  to  a  more  than  fourfold 
increase  in  coastal  fish  production  from  520,000  tons  in  FY 
1950  to  2.4  million  tons  in  FY  1990.  The  increase  in  inland  fish 
production  was  even  more  dramatic,  increasing  almost  eight- 
fold from  218,000  tons  in  FY  1950  to  1.7  million  tons  in  FY 
1990.  The  value  of  fish  and  processed  fish  exports  increased 
from  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  value  of  exports  in  FY  1960 
to  3.6  percent  in  FY  1993. 

The  important  marine  fish  in  the  mid-1990s  are  mackerel, 
sardines,  Bombay  duck,  shark,  ray,  perch,  croaker,  carangid, 
sole,  ribbonfish,  whitebait,  tuna,  silverbelly,  prawn,  and  cuttle- 
fish. The  main  freshwater  fish  are  carp  and  catfish;  the  main 
brackish-water  fish  are  hilsa  (a  variety  of  shad),  and  mullet. 

Great  potential  exists  for  expanding  the  nation's  fishing 
industry.  India's  exclusive  economic  zone,  stretching  200  nauti- 
cal miles  into  the  Indian  Ocean,  encompasses  more  than  2  mil- 
lion square  kilometers.  In  the  mid-1980s,  only  about  33  percent 
of  that  area  was  being  exploited.  The  potential  annual  catch 
from  the  area  has  been  estimated  at  4.5  million  tons.  In  addi- 
tion to  this  marine  zone,  India  has  about  1.4  million  hectares 
of  brackish  water  available  for  aquaculture,  of  which  only 
60,000  hectares  were  being  farmed  in  the  early  1990s;  about  1.6 
million  hectares  of  freshwater  lakes,  ponds,  and  swamps;  and 
nearly  64,000  kilometers  of  rivers  and  streams. 

In  1990  there  were  1.7  million  full-time  fishermen,  1.3  mil- 
lion part-time  fishermen,  and  2.3  million  occasional  fisher- 
men, many  of  whom  worked  as  saltmakers,  ferrymen,  or 
seamen,  or  operated  boats  for  hire.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  fish- 
ing fleet  consisted  of  180,000  traditional  craft  powered  by  sails 
or  oars,  26,000  motorized  traditional  craft,  and  some  34,000 
mechanized  boats. 

Fisheries  research  and  training  institutions  are  supported  by 
central  and  state  governments  that  deserve  much  of  the  credit 
for  the  expansion  and  improvements  in  the  Indian  fishing 
industry.  The  principal  fisheries  research  institutions,  all  of 
which  operate  under  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural 
Research,  are  the  Central  Institute  of  Marine  Fisheries 
Research  at  Kochi  (formerly  Cochin),  Kerala;  the  Central 
Inland  Fisheries  Institute  at  Barrackpore,  West  Bengal;  and  the 
Central  Institute  of  Fisheries  Technology  at  Willingdon  Island

near  Kochi.  Most  fishery  training  is  provided  by  the  Central 
Institute  for  Fishery  Education  in  Bombay  (or  Mumbai  in 
Marathi),  which  has  ancillary  institutions  in  Barrackpore,  Agra 
(Uttar  Pradesh),  and  Hyderabad  (Andhra  Pradesh).  The  Cen- 
tral Fisheries  Corporation  in  Calcutta  is  instrumental  in  bring- 
ing about  improvements  in  fishing  methods,  ice  production, 
processing,  storing,  marketing,  and  constructing  and  repairing 
fishing  vessels.  Operating  under  a  1972  law,  the  Marine  Prod- 
ucts Export  Authority,  headquartered  in  Kochi,  has  made  sev- 
eral market  surveys  abroad  and  has  been  instrumental  in 
introducing  and  enforcing  hygiene  standards  that  have  gained 
for  Indian  fishery  export  products  a  reputation  for  cleanliness 
and  quality. 

The  implementation  of  two  programs  for  inland  fisheries — 
establishing  fish  farmers'  development  agencies  and  the 
National  Programme  of  Fish  Seed  Development — has  led  to 
encouragingly  increased  production,  which  reached  1.5  mil- 
lion tons  during  FY  1990,  up  from  0.9  million  tons  in  FY  1984. 
A  network  of  313  fish  farmers'  development  agencies  was  func- 
tioning in  1992.  Under  the  National  Programme  of  Fish  Seed 
Development,  forty  fish-seed  hatcheries  were  commissioned. 
Fish-seed  production  doubled  from  5  billion  fry  in  FY  1983  to 
10  billion  fry  in  FY  1989.  A  new  program  using  organic  waste 
for  aquaculture  was  started  in  FY  1986.  Inland  fish  production 
as  a  percent  of  total  fish  production  increased  from  36  percent 
in  FY  1980  to  40  percent  by  FY  1990. 

Apart  from  four  main  fishing  harbors — Kochi  (Kerala), 
Madras  (Tamil  Nadu),  Vishakhapatnam  (Andhra  Pradesh), 
and  Roychowk  in  Calcutta  (West  Bengal) — twenty-three  minor 
fishing  harbors  and  ninety-five  fish-landing  centers  are  desig- 
nated to  provide  landing  and  berthing  facilities  to  fishing  craft. 
The  harbors  at  Vishakhapatnam,  Kochi,  and  Roychowk  were 
completed  by  1980;  the  one  at  Madras  was  completed  in  the 
1980s.  A  major  fishing  harbor  was  under  construction  at  Sas- 
soon  Dock  in  Bombay  in  the  early  1990s,  as  were  thirteen  addi- 
tional minor  fishing  harbors  and  eighteen  small  landing 
centers.  By  early  1990,  there  were  225  deep-sea  fishing  vessels 
operating  in  India's  exclusive  economic  zone.  Of  these,  165 
were  owned  by  Indian  shipping  companies,  and  the  rest  were 
chartered  foreign  fishing  vessels. 

The  government  provides  subsidies  to  poor  fishermen  so 
that  they  can  motorize  their  traditional  craft  to  increase  the 
range  and  frequency  of  operation,  with  a  consequent  increase 


417 


India:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  catch  and  earnings.  A  total  of  about  26,171  traditional 
craft  had  been  motorized  under  the  program  by  1992. 

The  banning  of  trawling  by  chartered  foreign  vessels  and  the 
speedy  motorization  of  traditional  fishing  craft  in  the  1980s  led 
to  a  quantum  jump  in  marine  fish  production  in  the  late  1980s. 
The  export  of  marine  products  rose  from  97,179  tons  (Rs531 
billion)  in  FY  1987  to  210,800  tons  (Rsl7.4  trillion)  in  FY  1992, 
making  India  one  of  the  world's  leading  seafood  exporting 
nations.  This  achievement  was  largely  a  result  of  significant 
advancements  in  India's  freezing  facilities  since  the  1960s, 
advancements  that  enabled  India's  seafood  products  to  meet 
international  standards.  Frozen  shrimp,  a  high-value  item,  has 
become  the  dominant  seafood  export.  Other  significant  export 
items  are  frozen  frog  legs,  frozen  lobster  tails,  dried  fish,  and 
shark  fins,  much  of  which  is  exported  to  seafood-loving  Japan. 
During  the  eighth  plan,  marine  products  were  identified  as 
having  major  export  potential. 

There  are  several  specialized  institutes  that  train  fishermen. 
The  Central  Institute  of  Fisheries  Nautical  and  Engineering 
Training  in  Kochi  instructs  operators  of  deep-sea  fishing  vessels 
and  technicians  for  shore  establishments.  It  has  facilities  in 
Madras  and  Vishakhapatnam  for  about  500  trainees  a  year.  The 
Integrated  Fisheries  Project,  also  headquartered  in  Kochi,  was 
established  for  the  processing,  popularizing,  and  marketing  of 
unusual  fish.  Another  training  organization,  the  Central  Insti- 
tute of  Coastal  Engineering  for  Fisheries  in  Bangalore,  has 
done  techno-economic  feasibility  studies  on  locations  of  fish- 
ing harbor  sites  and  brackish-water  fish  farms. 

To  improve  returns  to  fishermen  and  provide  better  prod- 
ucts for  consumers,  several  states  have  organized  marketing 
cooperatives  for  fishermen.  Nevertheless,  most  traditional  fish- 
ermen rely  on  household  members  or  local  fish  merchants  for 
the  disposal  of  their  catches.  In  some  places,  marketing  is  car- 
ried on  entirely  by  fisherwomen  who  carry  small  quantities  in 
containers  on  their  heads  to  nearby  places.  Good  wholesale  or 
retail  markets  are  rare. 

Agricultural  Credit 

Credit  institutions  serving  agricultural-sector  needs  devel- 
oped in  three  phases.  In  the  first  phase,  which  lasted  from  1947 
to  1969,  cooperative  agencies  were  the  primary  vehicle  provid- 
ing credit.  In  the  second  phase,  after  nationalization  of  banks 
in  1969,  commercial  banks  were  assigned  a  role  in  providing

agricultural  credit  but  were  supplementary  to  cooperatives  (see 
Fiscal  Administration,  ch.  6).  In  the  last  phase  starting  in  1975, 
regional  rural  banks  were  established  to  provide  credit.  In  the 
1990s,  agricultural  credit  is  provided  through  a  multiagency 
approach  in  the  form  of  cooperatives,  commercial  banks,  and 
regional  rural  banks.  These  institutions  have  gradually  ensured 
that  credit  reaches  the  most  remote  agricultural  and  rural 
areas. 

Since  the  inception  of  central  economic  planning  in  1950, 
the  government  has  favored  cooperative  societies  as  a  channel 
for  providing  credit  and  as  a  means  of  broadening  the  experi- 
ence of  villagers  in  such  activities  as  marketing,  community 
farming,  and  consumer  purchasing.  Credit  societies  were  the 
first  to  be  established  and  continue  to  be  the  most  extensive 
and  important  group  of  cooperatives.  Of  the  roughly  250,000 
cooperatives  in  India  in  1980,  about  100,000  were  primarily 


419 


India:  A  Country  Study 

agricultural  credit  cooperatives.  By  the  late  1980s,  because 
regional  rural  banks  were  doing  more  lending,  the  number  of 
agricultural  credit  cooperatives  had  decreased  to  87,300.  By 
1988  there  were  93,000  primary  agricultural  credit  societies 
operating  in  rural  areas,  with  a  membership  of  89.8  million. 
The  societies  aimed  for  universal  membership  in  order  that 
poorer  members  of  society  could  join  cooperatives  and  use 
their  services.  Total  loans  advanced  by  such  societies  amounted 
to  nearly  Rs36.9  billion  during  FY  1987.  These  agricultural 
credit  societies  had  a  share  capital  of  about  RslO.l  billion  at  the 
end  of  June  1988. 

Cooperatives  played  a  significant  role  in  the  production  and 
distribution  of  agricultural  inputs.  For  example,  during  FY 
1988  nearly  3.5  million  tons,  representing  more  than  33  per- 
cent of  total  fertilizer  (less  cow  dung),  were  distributed 
through  a  network  of  76,000  cooperative  retail  outlets.  Cooper- 
atives also  distributed  other  inputs,  such  as  seeds,  pesticides, 
and  agricultural  implements. 

The  overall  control  of  rural  credit  for  the  development  of 
agriculture  and  the  rural  sector  is  under  the  control  of  the 
National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  which 
was  established  in  July  1980.  It  was  chartered  to  oversee  the 
workings  of  regional  rural  banks,  and  in  the  mid-1990s  was 
slated  to  establish  a  rural  infrastructure  development  fund  to 
provide  loans  to  state  governments  and  state-owned  corpora- 
tions to  enable  completion  of  irrigation,  soil  conservation, 
watershed  management,  and  other  rural  infrastructure 
projects  in  progress.  By  June  1991,  there  were  14,522  regional 
rural  banks  in  India. 

Public-sector  banks,  including  commercial  and  regional 
rural  banks,  increased  their  activities  in  the  countryside  after 
the  nationalization  of  banks.  Many  bank  branches  were  opened 
in  rural  areas.  One  indicator  of  increased  availability  of  credit 
through  public-sector  banks  was  the  increase  in  the  number  of 
accounts.  The  number  went  from  164,000,  with  outstanding 
loans  of  Rsl.6  billion,  to  nearly  21.8  million  accounts,  with  an 
outstanding  balance  of  nearly  Rsl65.2  billion  in  March  1990. 

In  economic  terms,  the  growth  in  credit  supply  has  been  sat- 
isfactory, but  the  growth  in  deposits  has  not  kept  pace  with 
credit  supply  and  there  has  been  a  high  rate  of  loan  defaults. 
Field-level  rural  financial  institutions  have  increased,  however, 
even  though  there  are  fewer  primary  agricultural  credit  societ- 
ies. The  large  increase  in  the  number  of  branches  of  commer- 


420

rial  banks  in  the  rural  areas  and  the  expansion  of  regional 
rural  banks  led  to  the  reduction. 

Agricultural  Taxation 

Agricultural  property  and  some  agricultural  income  were 
being  taxed  in  the  early  1990s,  but  the  revenue  from  these 
taxes  was  negligible.  In  the  early  1950s,  however,  land  revenue 
agricultural  property  taxes  were  a  significant  form  of  govern- 
ment income,  providing  just  under  10  percent  of  the  tax  reve- 
nue of  the  central,  state,  and  union  territory  governments.  At 
the  end  of  the  1980s,  that  proportion  was  less  than  1  percent 
because  land  revenue  had  been  fixed.  For  instance,  land  reve- 
nue was  an  average  of  Rs28  per  hectare  in  Kerala  and  Rs23  per 
hectare  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  the  two  states  with  the  highest  assess- 
ment rates.  The  national  average  was  Rs  16.50  per  hectare.  Agri- 
cultural property  also  was  subject  to  stamp  duties  and 
registration  fees.  (All  property  transactions  have  to  be  made  on 
official,  stamped  forms,  and  registration  fees  have  to  be  paid  to 
register  transactions.)  No  data  were  available  in  early  1993  on 
the  proportion  of  these  fees  that  came  from  the  agricultural 
sector,  but  a  taxation  inquiry  committee  put  it  at  approximately 
20  percent.  Between  1950  and  1990,  only  about  1.5  percent  of 
the  total  taxes  collected  by  the  central,  state,  and  union  terri- 
tory governments  came  from  the  agricultural  sector.  Overall, 
the  impact  of  tax  on  agricultural  property  was  negligible  but 
was  a  likely  target  for  economic  reform  in  the  mid-1990s. 

Since  the  1950s,  agricultural  income  tax  has  been  collected 
as  a  federal  tax,  but  it  has  been  levied  only  on  income  from 
plantations.  All  other  agricultural  income  has  been  exempt 
from  tax.  The  total  collection  from  this  tax  was  less  than  1  per- 
cent of  the  total  taxes  collected  by  the  central,  state,  and  union 
territory  governments  in  FY  1950;  in  the  late  1980s,  it  had 
dropped  below  0.3  percent. 

Marketing,  Trade,  and  Aid 

Marketing  and  Marketing  Services 

The  agricultural  marketing  system  operates  primarily 
according  to  the  forces  of  supply  and  demand  in  the  private 
sector.  Government  intervention  is  limited  to  protecting  the 
interests  of  producers  and  consumers  and  promoting  orga- 
nized marketing  of  agricultural  commodities.  In  1991  there 


421 


India:  A  Country  Study 

were  6,640  regulated  markets  to  which  the  central  government 
provided  assistance  in  the  establishment  of  infrastructure  and 
in  setting  up  rural  warehouses.  Various  central  government 
organizations  are  involved  in  agricultural  marketing,  including 
the  Commission  for  Agricultural  Costs  and  Prices,  the  Food 
Corporation  of  India,  the  Cotton  Corporation  of  India,  and  the 
Jute  Corporation  of  India.  There  also  are  specialized  market- 
ing boards  for  rubber,  coffee,  tea,  tobacco,  spices,  coconut,  oil- 
seeds, vegetable  oil,  and  horticulture. 

A  network  of  cooperatives  at  the  local,  state,  and  national 
levels  assist  in  agricultural  marketing.  The  major  commodities 
handled  are  food  grains,  jute,  cotton,  sugar,  milk,  and  areca 
nuts.  Established  in  1958  as  the  apex  of  the  state  marketing  fed- 
erations, the  National  Agricultural  Cooperative  Marketing  Fed- 
eration of  India  handles  much  of  the  domestic  and  most  of  the 
export  marketing  for  its  member  organizations. 

Large  enterprises,  such  as  cooperative  sugar  factories,  spin- 
ning mills,  and  solvent-extraction  plants  mostly  handle  their 
own  marketing  operations  independently.  Medium-  and  small- 
sized  enterprises,  such  as  rice  mills,  oil  mills,  cotton  ginning 
and  pressing  units,  and  jute  baling  units,  mostly  are  affiliated 
with  cooperative  marketing  societies. 

In  the  late  1980s,  there  were  some  2,400  agroprocessing 
units  in  the  cooperative  sector.  Of  all  the  cooperative  agropro- 
cessing industries,  cooperative  sugar  factories  achieved  the 
most  notable  success.  The  number  of  licensed  or  registered 
units  remained  at  232,  of  which  211  had  been  installed  by 
March  1988.  During  the  October  1987-September  1988  sugar 
season,  196  cooperative  sugar  factories  were  in  production. 
They  produced  nearly  5.3  million  tons  of  sugar,  accounting  for 
about  57.5  percent  of  the  country's  total  production  of  9.2  mil- 
lion tons.  The  National  Federation  of  Cooperative  Sugar  Facto- 
ries rendered  advice  to  member  cooperatives  on  technical 
improvement,  financial  management,  raw  materials  develop- 
ment, and  inventory  control. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  cooperative  marketing  structure  com- 
prised 6,777  primary  marketing  societies:  2,759  general-pur- 
pose societies  at  the  mandi  (wholesale  market)  level  and  4,018 
special  commodities  societies  for  oilseeds  and  other  such  com- 
modities. There  were  also  161  district  or  central  societies  cover- 
ing nearly  all  important  mandis  in  the  country  and  twenty-nine 
general-purpose  state  cooperative  marketing  federations.  The 
total  value  of  agricultural  produce  marketed  by  cooperatives 


422 


Agriculture 


amounted  to  about  Rs54.2  billion  in  FY  1988,  compared  with 
Rsl8  billion  in  FY  1979.  The  total  value  of  food  grains  handled 
by  marketing  cooperatives  increased  from  Rs5  billion  in  FY 
1979  to  about  Rsll.3  billion  in  FY  1986. 

The  Ministry  of  Agriculture's  Directorate  of  Marketing  and 
Inspection  is  responsible  for  administering  federal  statutes  con- 
cerned with  the  marketing  of  agricultural  produce.  Another 
function  is  market  research.  The  directorate  also  works  closely 
with  states  to  provide  agricultural  marketing  services  that  con- 
stitutionally come  under  state  purview. 

Under  the  Agricultural  Produce  (Grading  and  Marketing) 
Act  of  1937,  more  than  forty  primary  commodities  are  compul- 
sorily  graded  for  export  and  voluntarily  graded  for  internal 
consumption.  Although  the  regulation  of  commodity  markets 
is  a  function  of  state  government,  the  Directorate  of  Marketing 
and  Inspection  provides  marketing  and  inspection  services  and 
financial  aid  down  to  the  village  level  to  help  set  up  commodity 
grading  centers  in  selected  markets. 

By  the  1980s,  warehouses  for  storing  agricultural  produce 
and  farm  supplies  played  an  increasing  role  in  government 
price  support  and  price  control  programs  and  in  distributing 
farm  commodities  and  farm  supplies.  Because  the  public  ware- 
houses issue  a  receipt  to  the  owners  of  stored  goods  on  which 
loans  can  be  raised,  warehouses  are  also  becoming  important 
in  agricultural  finance.  The  Central  Warehousing  Corporation, 
an  entity  of  the  central  government,  operates  warehouses  at 
major  points  within  its  jurisdictions,  and  cooperatives  operate 
warehouses  in  towns  and  villages.  The  growth  of  the  warehous- 
ing system  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  weather  damage  to  pro- 
duce and  in  loss  to  rodents  and  other  pests. 

Most  agricultural  produce  is  sold  by  farmers  in  the  private 
sector  to  moneylenders  (to  whom  the  farmer  may  be  indebted) 
or  to  village  traders.  Produce  is  sold  in  various  ways.  It  might  be 
sold  at  a  weekly  village  market  in  the  farmer's  own  village  or  in 
a  neighboring  village.  If  these  outlets  are  not  available,  then 
produce  might  be  sold  at  irregularly  held  markets  in  a  nearby 
village  or  town,  or  in  the  mandi  Farmers  also  can  sell  to  traders 
who  come  to  the  work  site. 

The  government  has  adopted  various  measures  to  improve 
agricultural  marketing.  These  steps  include  establishing  regu- 
lated markets,  constructing  warehouses,  grading  and  standard- 
izing produce,  standardizing  weights  and  measures,  and 
providing  information  on  agricultural  prices  over  All  India

Radio  (Akashvani),  the  national  radio  network  (see  Radio,  ch. 
6;  The  Media,  ch.  8). 

The  government's  objective  of  providing  reasonable  prices 
for  basic  food  commodities  is  achieved  through  the  Public  Dis- 
tribution System,  a  network  of  350,000  fair-price  shops  that  are 
monitored  by  state  governments.  Channeling  basic  food  com- 
modities through  the  Public  Distribution  System  serves  as  a 
conduit  for  reaching  the  truly  needy  and  as  a  system  for  keep- 
ing general  consumer  prices  in  check.  More  than  80  percent  of 
the  supplies  of  grain  to  the  Public  Distribution  System  is  pro- 
vided by  Punjab,  Haryana,  and  western  Uttar  Pradesh. 

The  Food  Corporation  of  India  was  established  in  1965  as 
the  public-sector  marketing  agency  responsible  for  implement- 
ing government  price  policy  through  procurement  and  public 
distribution  operations.  It  was  intended  to  secure  for  the  gov- 
ernment a  commanding  position  in  the  food-grain  trade.  By 
1979  the  corporation  was  operating  in  all  states  as  the  sole 
agent  of  the  central  government  in  food-grain  procurement. 
The  corporation  uses  the  services  of  state  government  agencies 
and  cooperatives  in  its  operations. 

The  Food  Corporation  of  India  is  the  sole  repository  of  food 
grains  reserved  for  the  Public  Distribution  System.  Food  grains, 
primarily  wheat  and  rice,  account  for  between  60  and  75  per- 
cent of  the  corporation's  total  annual  purchases.  Food-grain 
procurement  was  8.9  million  tons  in  FY  1971,  13.0  million  tons 
in  FY  1981,  and  17.8  million  tons  in  FY  1991.  Food  grains  sup- 
plied through  the  Public  Distribution  System  amounted  to  7.8 
million  tons  in  FY  1971,  13.0  million  tons  in  FY  1981,  and  17.0 
million  tons  in  FY  1991.  The  corporation  has  functioned  effec- 
tively in  providing  price  supports  to  farmers  through  its  pro- 
curement scheme  and  in  keeping  a  check  on  large  price 
increases  by  providing  food  grains  through  the  Public  Distribu- 
tion System. 

External  Trade 

Agricultural  exports  were  44  percent  of  total  exports  in  FY 
1960;  they  decreased  to  32  percent  in  FY  1970,  to  31  percent  in 
FY  1980,  to  18.5  percent  in  FY  1988,  and  to  15.3  percent  in  FY 
1993.  This  drop  in  agriculture's  share  was  somewhat  misleading 
because  agricultural  products,  such  as  cotton  and  jute,  that 
were  exported  in  the  raw  form  in  the  1950s,  have  been 
exported  as  cotton  yarn,  fabrics,  ready-made  garments,  coir 
yarn,  and  jute  manufactures  since  the  1960s.

The  composition  of  agricultural  and  allied  products  for 
export  changed  mainly  because  of  the  continuing  growth  of 
demand  in  the  domestic  market.  This  demand  cut  into  the  sur- 
plus available  for  export  despite  a  continuing  desire,  on  the 
part  of  government,  to  shore  up  the  constant  foreign-exchange 
shortage  (see  Foreign-Exchange  System,  ch.  6).  In  FY  1960,  tea 
was  the  principal  export  by  value.  Oil  cakes,  tobacco,  cashew 
kernels,  spices,  and  raw  cotton  were  about  equal  in  value  but 
were  only  one-eighth  of  the  value  of  tea  exports.  By  FY  1980, 
tea  was  still  dominant,  but  coffee,  rice,  fish,  and  fish  products 
came  close,  followed  by  oil  cakes,  cashew  kernels,  and  cotton. 
In  1992-93  fish  and  fish  products  became  the  primary  agricul- 
tural export,  followed  by  oil  meals,  then  cereals,  and  then  tea. 
The  share  of  fish  products  rose  steadily  from  less  than  2  per- 
cent of  all  agricultural  exports  in  FY  1960,  to  10  percent  in  FY 
1980,  to  approximately  15  percent  for  the  three-year  period 


425 


India:  A  Country  Study 


ending  in  FY  1990,  and  to  23  percent  in  FY  1992.  The  share  of 
tea  in  agricultural  exports  fell  from  40  percent  in  FY  1960  to 
roughly  17  percent  in  the  FY  1988-FY1990  period,  and  to  only 
13  percent  by  FY  1992. 

External  Aid 

Foreign  aid — financial  and  technical — since  the  1950s  has 
made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  agricultural  progress  in 
rural  India.  Aid  has  come  from  many  sources:  the  United  States 
government,  the  Ford  Foundation,  the  Rockefeller  Founda- 
tion, the  World  Bank,  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization 
(FAO — see  Glossary)  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  the  Euro- 
pean Economic  Community,  the  former  Soviet  Union,  Britain, 
and  Japan,  among  others  (see  Aid,  ch.  6). 

Agricultural  aid  also  has  come  in  many  forms.  Between  1963 
and  1972,  for  example,  under  a  program  of  the  United  States 
Agency  for  International  Development,  some  400  American 
scientists  and  scholars  served  on  the  faculties  of  India's  agricul- 
tural universities,  while  more  than  500  faculty  members  from 
Indian  institutions  received  advanced  training  in  the  United 
States  and  other  countries.  Several  hundred  agricultural 
research  projects,  financed  with  funds  generated  from  sales  of 
American  farm  commodities  under  the  United  States  Public 
Law  480  program,  fueled  technological  breakthroughs  in 
Indian  agriculture. 

Aid  to  the  agricultural  sector  continued  in  the  late  1980s  and 
the  early  1990s;  the  FAO,  the  European  Union,  the  World 
Bank,  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme 
(UNDP)  provided  the  bulk  of  the  assistance.  The  FAO  pro- 
vided technical  assistance  in  a  number  of  emerging  areas;  it 
provided  quality  control  for  exports;  videos  for  rural  communi- 
cation and  training;  and  market  studies  for  wool  processing, 
mushroom  production,  and  egg  and  poultry  marketing.  Oper- 
ation Flood — a  dairy  development  program — was  jointly  spon- 
sored by  the  European  Economic  Community,  the  World  Bank, 
and  India's  National  Dairy  Development  Board  (see  Livestock 
and  Poultry,  this  ch.).  The  UNDP  provided  technical  assistance 
by  sending  foreign  experts,  consultants,  and  equipment  to 
India.  The  World  Bank  and  its  affiliates  supported  agricultural 
extension,  social  (community-based)  forestry,  agricultural 
credit,  dairy  development,  horticulture,  seed  development, 
rain-fed  fish  farms,  storage,  marketing,  and  irrigation.

Agriculture 


India  has  not  only  been  a  receiver  of  aid.  Increasingly  since 
independence,  India  has  been  sharing  its  agricultural  technol- 
ogy with  other  developing  countries.  Numerous  foreign  scien- 
tists have  received  special  and  advanced  training  in  India; 
hundreds  of  foreign  students  have  attended  Indian  state  agri- 
cultural universities.  Among  other  international  agricultural 
endeavors,  India  has  contributed  scientists,  services,  and  funds 
to  the  work  of  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute,  head- 
quartered in  the  Philippines.  In  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s, 
India  provided  short-  and  long-term  training  courses  to  hun- 
dreds of  foreign  specialists  each  year  under  a  variety  of  pro- 
grams, including  the  Technical  Cooperation  Scheme  of  the 
Colombo  Plan  for  Cooperative  Economic  and  Social  Develop- 
ment in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (Colombo  Plan — see  Glossary) 
and  the  Technical  Cooperation  Scheme  of  the  Commonwealth 
of  Nations  Assistance  Program  (see  Participation  in  Interna- 
tional Organizations,  ch.  9). 

Impact  of  Economic  Reforms  on  Agriculture 

The  serious  foreign-exchange  crisis  in  1990  led  to  a  number 
of  well-publicized  economic  reforms  in  the  early  1990s  dealing 
with  trade,  industrial  licensing,  and  privatization.  The  reforms 
had  an  impact  on  the  agricultural  sector  through  the  central 
government's  effort  to  withdraw  the  fertilizer  subsidy  and  place 
greater  emphasis  on  agricultural  exports.  The  cut  in  the  fertil- 
izer subsidy  was  a  result  of  the  government's  commitment  to 
reduce  New  Delhi's  fiscal  deficit  by  removing  grants  and  subsi- 
dies from  the  budget.  The  government  action  led  to  a  reduc- 
tion in  the  use  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  protests  by  farmers 
and  opposition  political  parties.  The  government  was  forced  to 
continue  the  subsidies  but  at  a  somewhat  lower  level. 

New  import  and  export  policies  aim  at  enhancing  export 
capabilities  of  the  agricultural  sector  by  increasing  productivity 
and  promoting  modernization  and  competitiveness.  The  mea- 
sures to  facilitate  export  growth  include  allowing  the  import  of 
capital  for  the  agricultural  sector,  reducing  the  list  of  agricul- 
tural products  that  cannot  be  exported,  and  removing  the  min- 
imum export  price  from  a  number  of  products.  Agricultural 
exports  increased  by  30  percent  in  FY  1991  and  14  percent  in 
FY  1992  in  terms  of  rupee  value,  but  declined  by  8  percent 
from  FY  1990  to  FY  1992  in  United  States  dollar  terms  because 
of  the  devaluation  of  the  rupee  in  1991.

India:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  mid-1990s,  it  was  expected  that  agriculture  would  con- 
tinue to  be  the  most  important  sector  of  the  economy  for  the 
rest  of  the  decade  in  terms  of  the  proportion  of  GDP.  However, 
even  when  it  is  not  the  sector  providing  the  largest  share  of 
GDP,  the  importance  of  agriculture  is  not  likely  to  diminish 
because  of  its  critical  role  in  providing  food,  wage  goods, 
employment,  and  raw  materials  to  industries.  Despite  their  pre- 
occupation with  industrial  development,  India's  planners  and 
policy  makers  have  had  to  acknowledge  the  critical  role  of  agri- 
culture in  the  early  1990s  by  changing  basic  policy.  The  gains  in 
agricultural  production  should  not  lead  to  complacency,  how- 
ever. Continuing  increases  in  productivity,  developing  allied 
activities  in  rural  areas,  and  building  infrastructure  in  rural 
areas  are  essential  if  India  is  to  continue  to  be  self-reliant  in 
food  and  agricultural  products  and  provide  a  modest  surplus 
for  exports.

There  is  abundant  literature  on  Indian  agriculture,  and 
much  of  it  is  highly  detailed.  A  source  that  brings  together  a 
wide  variety  of  useful  information  is  Subhash  C.  Kashyap's 
National  Policy  Studies,  which  provides  a  good  overview  of  agri- 
cultural policy.  A  critical  review  of  agricultural  development 
and  policy  is  provided  by  B.M.  Bhatia's  Indian  Agriculture:  A  Pol- 
icy Perspective.  N.S.S.  Narayana,  K.S.  Parikh,  and  T.N.  Srini- 
vasan's  Agriculture,  Growth,  and  Redistribution  of  Income  is  a  more 
rigorous  analysis  of  policy  issues  that  also  contains  a  large 
amount  of  descriptive  information.  The  Indian  Ministry  of 
Information  and  Broadcasting's  India:  A  Reference  Annual  is  a 
valuable  source.  The  Ministry  of  Finance's  annual  Economic  Sur- 
vey gives  a  detailed  account  of  developments  in  agriculture. 
The  Economic  and  Political  Weekly  is  India's  premier  source  of 
news  and  analysis  regarding  all  issues  connected  with  agricul- 
ture. (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see  Bib-

INDIAN  POLITICS  ENTERED  a  new  era  at  the  beginning  of 
the  1990s.  The  period  of  political  domination  by  the  Congress 
(I)  branch  of  the  Indian  National  Congress  (see  Glossary) 
came  to  an  end  with  the  party's  defeat  in  the  1989  general  elec- 
tions, and  India  began  a  period  of  intense  multiparty  political 
competition.  Even  though  the  Congress  (I)  regained  power  as 
a  minority  government  in  1991,  its  grasp  on  power  was  precari- 
ous. The  Nehruvian  socialist  ideology  that  the  party  had  used 
to  fashion  India's  political  agenda  had  lost  much  of  its  popular 
appeal.  The  Congress  (I)  polidcal  leadership  had  lost  the  man- 
tle of  moral  integrity  inherited  from  the  Indian  National  Con- 
gress's role  in  the  independence  movement,  and  it  was  widely 
viewed  as  corrupt.  Support  among  key  social  bases  of  the  Con- 
gress (I)  political  coalition  was  seriously  eroding.  The  main 
alternative  to  the  Congress  (I),  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party 
(BJP — Indian  People's  Party),  embarked  on  a  campaign  to 
reorganize  the  Indian  electorate  in  an  effort  to  create  a  Hindu 
nationalist  majority  coalition.  Simultaneously,  such  parties  as 
the  Janata  Dal  (People's  Party),  the  Samajwadi  Party  (Socialist 
Party),  and  the  Bahujan  Samaj  Party  (BSP — Party  of  Society's 
Majority)  attempted  to  ascend  to  power  on  the  crest  of  an  alli- 
ance of  interests  uniting  Dalits  (see  Glossary),  Backward 
Classes  (see  Glossary),  Scheduled  Tribes  (see  Glossary),  and 
religious  minorities. 

The  structure  of  India's  federal — or  union — system  not  only 
creates  a  strong  central  government  but  also  has  facilitated  the 
concentration  of  power  in  the  central  government  in  general 
and  in  particular  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  This  cen- 
tralization of  power  has  been  a  source  of  considerable  contro- 
versy and  political  tension.  It  is  likely  to  further  exacerbate 
political  conflict  because  of  the  increasing  pluralism  of  the 
country's  party  system  and  the  growing  diversity  of  interest- 
group  representation. 

Once  viewed  as  a  source  of  solutions  for  the  country's  eco- 
nomic and  social  problems,  the  Indian  polity  is  increasingly 
seen  by  political  observers  as  the  problem.  When  populist  polit- 
ical appeals  stir  the  passions  of  the  masses,  government  institu- 
tions appear  less  capable  than  ever  before  of  accommodating 
conflicts  in  a  society  mobilized  along  competing  ethnic  and 
religious  lines.  In  addition,  law  and  order  have  become  increas- 


431 


India:  A  Country  Study 

ingly  tenuous  because  of  the  growing  inability  of  the  police  to 
curb  criminal  activities  and  quell  communal  disturbances. 
Indeed,  many  observers  bemoan  the  "criminalization"  of 
Indian  politics  at  a  time  when  politicians  routinely  hire  "muscle 
power"  to  improve  their  electoral  prospects,  and  criminals 
themselves  successfully  run  for  public  office.  These  circum- 
stances have  led  some  observers  to  conclude  that  India  has 
entered  into  a  growing  crisis  of  governability. 

Few  analysts  would  deny  the  gravity  of  India's  problems,  but 
some  contend  they  have  occurred  amidst  the  maturation  of 
civil  society  and  the  emergence  of  new,  more  democratic  politi- 
cal practices.  Backward  Classes,  the  Dalits,  and  tribal  peoples 
increasingly  have  refused  to  rest  content  with  the  patronage 
and  populism  characteristic  of  the  "Congress  system."  Mobiliza- 
tion of  these  groups  has  provided  a  viable  base  for  the  political 
opposition  and  unraveled  the  fabric  of  the  Congress.  Since  the 
late  1970s,  there  has  been  a  proliferation  of  nongovernmental 
organizations.  These  groups  made  new  demands  on  the  politi- 
cal system  that  required  a  substantial  redistribution  of  political 
power,  economic  resources,  and  social  status. 

Whether  or  not  developments  in  Indian  politics  exacerbate 
the  continuing  problems  or  give  birth  to  greater  democracy 
broadly  hinges  on  efforts  to  resolve  three  key  issues.  How  will 
India's  political  system,  now  more  than  ever  based  on  egalitar- 
ian democratic  values,  accommodate  the  changes  taking  place 
in  its  hierarchical  social  system?  How  will  the  state  balance  the 
need  to  recognize  the  interests  of  the  country's  remarkably  het- 
erogeneous society  with  the  imperatives  of  national  unity?  And, 
in  the  face  of  the  declining  legitimacy  of  the  Indian  state  and 
the  continuing  development  of  civil  society,  can  the  Indian 
state  regenerate  its  legitimacy,  and  if  it  is  to  do  so,  how  should  it 
redefine  the  boundaries  between  state  and  society?  India  has 
confronted  these  issues  throughout  much  of  its  history.  These 
issues,  with  their  intrinsic  tensions,  will  continue  to  serve  as 
sources  of  change  in  the  continuing  evolution  of  the  Indian 
polity. 

The  Constitutional  Framework 

The  constitution  of  India  draws  extensively  from  Western 
legal  traditions  in  its  outline  of  the  principles  of  liberal  democ- 
racy. It  is  distinguished  from  many  Western  constitutions,  how- 
ever, in  its  elaboration  of  principles  reflecting  the  aspirations  to 
end  the  inequities  of  traditional  social  relations  and  enhance 


432 


Government  and  Politics 


the  social  welfare  of  the  population.  According  to  constitu- 
tional scholar  Granville  Austin,  probably  no  other  nation's  con- 
stitution "has  provided  so  much  impetus  toward  changing  and 
rebuilding  society  for  the  common  good."  Since  its  enactment, 
the  constitution  has  fostered  a  steady  concentration  of  power 
in  the  central  government — especially  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
Minister.  This  centralization  has  occurred  in  the  face  of  the 
increasing  assertiveness  of  an  array  of  ethnic  and  caste  groups 
across  Indian  society.  Increasingly,  the  government  has 
responded  to  the  resulting  tensions  by  resorting  to  the  formi- 
dable array  of  authoritarian  powers  provided  by  the  constitu- 
tion. Together  with  the  public's  perception  of  pervasive 
corruption  among  India's  politicians,  the  state's  centralization 
of  authority  and  increasing  resort  to  coercive  power  have 
eroded  its  legitimacy.  However,  a  new  assertiveness  shown  by 
the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Election  Commission  suggests  that 
the  remaining  checks  and  balances  among  the  country's  politi- 
cal institutions  continue  to  support  the  resilience  of  Indian 
democracy. 

Adopted  after  some  two  and  one-half  years  of  deliberation 
by  the  Constituent  Assembly  that  also  acted  as  India's  first  legis- 
lature, the  constitution  was  put  into  effect  on  January  26,  1950. 
Bhimrao  Ramji  (B.R.)  Ambedkar,  a  Dalit  who  earned  a  law 
degree  from  Columbia  University,  chaired  the  drafting  com- 
mittee of  the  constitution  and  shepherded  it  through  Constitu- 
ent Assembly  debates.  Supporters  of  independent  India's 
founding  father,  Mohandas  Karamchand  (Mahatma)  Gandhi, 
backed  measures  that  would  form  a  decentralized  polity  with 
strong  local  administration — known  as  panchayat  (pi.,  pan- 
chayats — see  Glossary) — in  a  system  known  as  panchayati  raj, 
that  is  rule  by  panchayats.  However,  the  support  of  more  mod- 
ernist leaders,  such  as  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  ultimately  led  to  a  par- 
liamentary government  and  a  federal  system  with  a  strong 
central  government  (see  Nehru's  Legacy,  ch.  1).  Following  a 
British  parliamentary  pattern,  the  constitution  embodies  the 
Fundamental  Rights,  which  are  similar  to  the  United  States  Bill 
of  Rights,  and  a  Supreme  Court  similar  to  that  of  the  United 
States.  It  creates  a  "sovereign  democratic  republic"  called 
India,  or  Bharat  (after  the  legendary  king  of  the  Mahabharata) , 
which  "shall  be  a  Union  of  States."  India  is  a  federal  system  in 
which  residual  powers  of  legislation  remain  with  the  central 
government,  similar  to  that  in  Canada.  The  constitution  pro- 
vides detailed  lists  dividing  up  powers  between  central  and 


433 


India:  A  Country  Study 


state  governments  as  in  Australia,  and  it  elaborates  a  set  of 
Directive  Principles  of  State  Policy  as  does  the  Irish  constitu- 
tion. 

The  395  articles  and  ten  appendixes,  known  as  schedules,  in 
the  constitution  make  it  one  of  the  longest  and  most  detailed 
in  the  world.  Schedules  can  be  added  to  the  constitution  by 
amendment.  The  ten  schedules  in  force  cover  the  designations 
of  the  states  and  union  territories;  the  emoluments  for  hififh- 
level  officials;  forms  of  oaths;  allocation  of  the  number  of  seats 
in  the  Rajya  Sabha  (Council  of  States — the  upper  house  of  Par- 
liament) per  state  or  territory;  provisions  for  the  administra- 
tion and  control  of  Scheduled  Areas  (see  Glossary)  and 
Scheduled  Tribes  (see  Glossary) ;  provisions  for  the  administra- 
tion of  tribal  areas  in  Assam;  the  union  (meaning  central  gov- 
ernment), state,  and  concurrent  (dual)  lists  of  responsibilities; 
the  official  languages;  land  and  tenure  reforms;  and  the  associ- 
ation of  Sikkim  with  India;  i 

The  Indian  constitution  is  also  one  of  the  most  frequently 
amended  constitutions  in  the  world.  The  first  amendment 
came  onlv  a  year  after  the  adoption  of  the  constitution  and 
instituted  numerous  minor  changes.  Many  more  amendments 
followed,  and  through  June  1995  the  constitution  had  been 
amended  seventy-seven  times,  a  rate  of  almost  two  amend- 
ments per  year  since  1950.  Most  of  the  constitution  can  be 
amended  after  a  quorum  of  more  than  half  of  the  members  of 
each  house  in  Parliament  passes  an  amendment  with  a  two- 
thirds  majority  vote.  Articles  pertaining  to  the  distribution  of 
legislative  authority  between  the  central  and  state  governments 
must  also  be  approved  by  50  percent  of  the  state  legislatures. 

Fundamental  Rights 

The  Fundamental  Rights  embodied  in  the  constitution  are 
guaranteed  to  all  citizens.  These  civil  liberties  take  precedence 
over  any  other  law  of  the  land.  They  include  individual  rights 
common  to  most  liberal  democracies,  such  as  equality  before 
the  law,  freedom  of  speech  and  expression,  freedom  of  associa- 
tion and  peaceful  assembly,  freedom  of  religion,  and  the  right 
to  constitutional  remedies  for  the  protection  of  civil  rights  such 
as  habeas  corpus.  In  addition,  the  Fundamental  Rights  are 
aimed  at  overturning  the  inequities  of  past  social  practices. 
They  abolish  "untouchability";  prohibit  discrimination  on  the 
grounds  of  religion,  race,  caste,  sex,  or  place  of  birth;  and  for- 
bid traffic  in  human  beings  and  forced  labor.  They  go  beyond 


434 


Government  and  Politics 


conventional  civil  liberties  in  protecting  cultural  and  educa- 
tional rights  of  minorities  by  ensuring  that  minorities  may  pre- 
serve their  distinctive  languages  and  establish  and  administer 
their  own  education  institutions.  Originally,  the  right  to  prop- 
erty was  also  included  in  the  Fundamental  Rights;  however,  the 
Forty-fourth  Amendment,  passed  in  1978,  revised  the  status  of 
property  rights  by  stating  that  "No  person  shall  be  deprived  of 
his  property  save  by  authority  of  law."  Freedom  of  speech  and 
expression,  generally  interpreted  to  include  freedom  of  the 
press,  can  be  limited  "in  the  interests  of  the  sovereignty  and 
integrity  of  India,  the  security  of  the  State,  friendly  relations 
with  foreign  States,  public  order,  decency  or  morality,  or  in 
relation  to  contempt  of  court,  defamation  or  incitement  to  an 
offence"  (see  The  Media,  this  ch.). 

Directive  Principles  of  State  Policy 

An  important  feature  of  the  constitution  is  the  Directive 
Principles  of  State  Policy.  Although  the  Directive  Principles  are 
asserted  to  be  "fundamental  in  the  governance  of  the  country," 
they  are  not  legally  enforceable.  Instead,  they  are  guidelines 
for  creating  a  social  order  characterized  by  social,  economic, 
and  political  justice,  liberty,  equality,  and  fraternity  as  enunci- 
ated in  the  constitution's  preamble. 

In  some  cases,  the  Directive  Principles  articulate  goals  that, 
however  admirable,  remain  vague  platitudes,  such  as  the 
injunctions  that  the  state  "shall  direct  its  policy  towards  secur- 
ing .  .  .  that  the  ownership  and  control  of  the  material 
resources  of  the  community  are  so  distributed  to  subserve  the 
common  good"  and  "endeavor  to  promote  international  peace 
and  security."  In  other  areas,  the  Directive  Principles  provide 
more  specific  policy  objectives.  They  exhort  the  state  to  secure 
work  at  a  living  wage  for  all  citizens;  take  steps  to  encourage 
worker  participation  in  industrial  management;  provide  for 
just  and  humane  conditions  of  work,  including  maternity  leave; 
and  promote  the  educational  and  economic  interests  of  Sched- 
uled Castes,  Scheduled  Tribes,  and  other  disadvantaged  sectors 
of  society.  The  Directive  Principles  also  charge  the  state  with 
the  responsibility  for  providing  free  and  compulsory  education 
for  children  up  to  age  fourteen  (see  Administration  and  Fund- 
ing, ch.  2). 

The  Directive  Principles  also  urge  the  nation  to  develop  a 
uniform  civil  code  and  offer  free  legal  aid  to  all  citizens.  They 
urge  measures  to  maintain  the  separation  of  the  judiciary  from 


435 


India:  A  Country  Study 


the  executive  and  direct  the  government  to  organize  village 
panchayats  to  function  as  units  of  self-government.  This  latter 
objective  was  advanced  by  the  Seventy-third  Amendment  and 
the  Seventy-fourth  Amendment  in  December  1992.  The  Direc- 
tive Principles  also  order  that  India  should  endeavor  to  protect 
and  improve  the  environment  and  protect  monuments  and 
places  of  historical  interest. 

The  Forty-second  Amendment,  which  came  into  force  in 
January  1977,  attempted  to  raise  the  status  of  the  Directive 
Principles  by  stating  that  no  law  implementing  any  of  the 
Directive  Principles  could  be  declared  unconstitutional  on  the 
grounds  that  it  violated  anv  of  the  Fundamental  Rigdits.  The 
amendment  simultaneously  stated  that  laws  prohibiting  "anti- 
national  activities"  or  the  formation  of  "antinational  associa- 
tions" could  not  be  invalidated  because  they  infringed  on  any 
of  the  Fundamental  Rights.  It  added  a  new  section  to  the  con- 
stitution on  "Fundamental  Duties"  that  enjoined  citizens  "to 
promote  harmony  and  the  spirit  of  common  brotherhood 
among  all  the  people  of  India,  transcending  religious,  linguis- 
tic and  regional  or  sectional  diversities."  However,  the  amend- 
ment reflected  a  new  emphasis  in  governing  circles  on  order 
and  discipline  to  counteract  what  some  leaders  had  come  to 
perceive  as  the  excessively  freewheeling  style  of  Indian  democ- 
racy. After  the  March  1977  general  election  ended  the  control 
of  the  Congress  (Congress  (R)  from  1969)  over  the  executive 
and  legislature  for  the  first  time  since  independence  in  1947, 
the  new  Janata-dominated  Parliament  passed  the  Forty-third 
Amendment  (1977)  and  Forty-fourth  Amendment  (1978). 
These  amendments  revoked  the  Forty-second  Amendment's 
provision  that  Directive  Principles  take  precedence  over  Fun- 
damental Rights  and  also  curbed  Parliament's  power  to  legis- 
late against  "antinational  activities"  (see  The  Legislature,  this 
ch.). 

Group  Rights 

In  addition  to  stressing;  the  rig-fit  of  individuals  as  citizens, 
Part  XVI  of  the  constitution  endeavors  to  promote  social  jus- 
tice bv  elaborating;  a  series  of  affirmative-action  measures  for 
disadvantaged  groups.  These  "Special  Provisions  Relating  to 
Certain  Classes"  include  the  reservation  of  seats  in  the  Lok 
Sabha  (House  of  the  People)  and  in  state  legislative  bodies  for 
members  of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes.  The  num- 
ber of  seats  set  aside  for  them  is  proportional  to  their  share  of

the  national  and  respective  state  populations.  Part  XVI  also 
reserves  some  government  appointments  for  these  disadvan- 
taged groups  insofar  as  they  do  not  interfere  with  administra- 
tive efficiency.  The  section  stipulates  that  a  special  officer  for 
Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  be  appointed  by  the 
president  to  "investigate  all  matters  relating  to  the  safeguards 
provided"  for  them,  as  well  as  periodic  commissions  to  investi- 
gate the  conditions  of  the  Backward  Classes.  The  president,  in 
consultation  with  state  governors,  designates  those  groups  that 
meet  the  criteria  of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes. 
Similar  protections  exist  for  the  small  Anglo-Indian  commu- 
nity. 

The  framers  of  the  constitution  provided  that  the  special 
provisions  would  cease  twenty  years  after  the  promulgation  of 


437 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  constitution,  anticipating  that  the  progress  of  the  disadvan- 
taged groups  during  that  time  would  have  removed  significant 
disparities  between  them  and  other  groups  in  society.  However, 
in  1969  the  Twenty-third  Amendment  extended  the  affirma- 
tive-action measures  until  1980.  The  Forty-fifth  Amendment  of 
1980  extended  them  again  until  1990,  and  in  1989  the  Sixty- 
second  Amendment  extended  the  provisions  until  2000.  The 
Seventy-seventh  Amendment  of  1995  further  strengthened  the 
states'  authority  to  reserve  government-service  positions  for 
Scheduled  Caste  and  Scheduled  Tribe  members. 

Emergency  Provisions  and  Authoritarian  Powers 

Part  XVIII  of  the  constitution  permits  the  state  to  suspend 
various  civil  liberties  and  the  application  of  certain  federal 
principles  during  presidentially  proclaimed  states  of  emer- 
gency. The  constitution  provides  for  three  categories  of  emer- 
gencies: a  threat  by  "war  or  external  aggression"  or  by  "internal 
disturbances";  a  "failure  of  constitutional  machinery"  in  the 
country  or  in  a  state;  and  a  threat  to  the  financial  security  or 
credit  of  the  nation  or  a  part  of  it.  Under  the  first  two  catego- 
ries, the  Fundamental  Rights,  with  the  exception  of  protection 
of  life  and  personal  liberty,  may  be  suspended,  and  federal 
principles  may  be  rendered  inoperative.  A  proclamation  of  a 
state  of  emergency  lapses  after  two  months  if  not  approved  by 
both  houses  of  Parliament.  The  president  can  issue  a  proclama- 
tion dissolving  a  state  government  if  it  can  be  determined, 
upon  receipt  of  a  report  from  a  governor,  that  circumstances 
prevent  the  government  of  that  state  from  maintaining  law  and 
order  according  to  the  constitution.  This  action  establishes 
what  is  known  as  President's  Rule  because  under  such  a  procla- 
mation the  president  can  assume  any  or  all  functions  of  the 
state  government;  transfer  the  powers  of  the  state  legislature  to 
Parliament;  or  take  other  measures  necessary  to  achieve  the 
objectives  of  the  proclamation,  including  suspension,  in  whole 
or  in  part,  of  the  constitution.  A  proclamation  of  President's 
Rule  cannot  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  authority  by  the 
state's  high  court.  Once  approved,  President's  Rule  normally 
lasts  for  six  months,  but  it  may  be  extended  up  to  one  year  if 
Parliament  approves.  In  exceptional  cases,  such  as  the  violent 
revolt  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  during  the  early  and  mid-1990s, 
President's  Rule  has  lasted  for  a  period  of  more  than  five  years. 

President's  Rule  has  been  imposed  frequently,  and  its  use  is 
often  politically  motivated.  During  the  terms  of  prime  minis-

ters  Nehru  and  Lai  Bahadur  Shastri,  from  1947  to  1966,  it  was 
imposed  ten  times.  Under  Indira  Gandhi's  two  tenures  as 
prime  minister  (1966-77  and  1980-84),  President's  Rule  was 
imposed  forty-one  times.  Despite  Mrs.  Gandhi's  frequent  use  of 
President's  Rule,  she  was  in  office  longer  (187  months)  than 
any  other  prime  minister  except  Nehru  (201  months).  Other 
prime  ministers  also  have  been  frequent  users:  Morarji  Desai 
(eleven  times  in  twenty-eight  months),  Chaudhury  Charan 
Singh  (five  times  in  less  than  six  months),  Rajiv  Gandhi  (eight 
times  in  sixty-one  months),  Vishwanath  Pratap  (V.P.)  Singh 
(two  times  in  eleven  months),  Chandra  Shekhar  (four  times  in 
seven  months),  and  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao  (nine  times  in  his  first 
forty-two  months  in  office). 

State  of  emergency  proclamations  have  been  issued  three 
times  since  independence.  The  first  was  in  1962  during  the 
border  war  with  China.  Another  was  declared  in  1971  when 
India  went  to  war  against  Pakistan  over  the  independence  of 
East  Pakistan,  which  became  Bangladesh.  In  1975  the  third 
Emergency  was  imposed  in  response  to  an  alledged  threat  by 
"internal  disturbances"  stemming  from  the  political  opposition 
to  Indira  Gandhi  (see  The  Rise  of  Indira  Gandhi,  ch.  1; 
National-Level  Agencies,  ch.  10). 

The  Indian  state  has  authoritarian  powers  in  addition  to  the 
constitution's  provisions  for  proclamations  of  Emergency  Rule 
and  President's  Rule.  The  Preventive  Detention  Act  was  passed 
in  1950  and  remained  in  force  until  1970.  Shortly  after  the  start 
of  the  Emergency  in  1962,  the  government  enacted  the 
Defence  of  India  Act.  This  legislation  created  the  Defence  of 
India  Rules,  which  allow  for  preventive  detention  of  individuals 
who  have  acted  or  who  are  likely  to  act  in  a  manner  detrimen- 
tal to  public  order  and  national  security.  The  Defence  of  India 
Rules  were  reimposed  during  the  1971  war  with  Pakistan;  they 
remained  in  effect  after  the  end  of  the  war  and  were  invoked 
for  a  variety  of  uses  not  intended  by  their  framers,  such  as  the 
arrests  made  during  a  nationwide  railroad  strike  in  1974. 

The  Maintenance  of  Internal  Security  Act  promulgated  in 
1971  also  provides  for  preventive  detention.  During  the  1975- 
77  Emergency,  the  act  was  amended  to  allow  the  government 
to  arrest  individuals  without  specifying  charges.  The  govern- 
ment arrested  tens  of  thousands  of  opposition  politicians 
under  the  Defence  of  India  Rules  and  the  Maintenance  of 
Internal  Security  Act,  including  most  of  the  leaders  of  the 
future  Janata  Party  government  (see  Political  Parties,  this  ch.).

India:  A  Country  Study 

Shortly  after  the  Janata  government  came  to  power  in  1977, 
Parliament  passed  the  Forty-fourth  Amendment,  which  revised 
the  domestic  circumstances  cited  in  Article  352  as  justifying  an 
emergency  from  "internal  disturbance"  to  "armed  rebellion." 
Duringjanata  rule,  Parliament  also  repealed  the  Defence  of 
India  Rules  and  the  Maintenance  of  Internal  Security  Act. 
However,  after  the  Congress  (I)  returned  to  power  in  1980, 
Parliament  passed  the  National  Security  Act  authorizing  secu- 
rity forces  to  arrest  individuals  without  warrant  for  suspicion  of 
action  that  subverts  national  security,  public  order,  and  essen- 
tial economic  services.  The  Essential  Services  Maintenance  Act 
of  1981  permits  the  government  to  prohibit  strikes  and  lock- 
outs in  sixteen  economic  sectors  providing  critical  goods  and 
services.  The  Fifty-ninth  Amendment,  passed  in  1988,  restored 
"internal  disturbance"  in  place  of  "armed  rebellion"  as  just 
cause  for  the  proclamation  of  an  emergency. 

The  Sikh  militant  movement  that  spread  through  Punjab 
during  the  1980s  spurred  additional  authoritarian  legislation 
(see  Insurgent  Movements  and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10). 
In  1984  Parliament  passed  the  National  Security  Amendment 
Act  enabling  government  security  forces  to  detain  prisoners  for 
up  to  one  year.  The  1984  Terrorist  Affected  Areas  (Special 
Courts)  Ordinance  provided  security  forces  in  Punjab  with 
unprecedented  powers  of  detention,  and  it  authorized  secret 
tribunals  to  try  suspected  terrorists.  The  1985  Terrorist  and 
Disruptive  Activities  (Prevention)  Act  imposed  the  death  pen- 
alty for  anyone  convicted  of  terrorist  actions  that  led  to  the 
death  of  others.  It  empowered  authorities  to  tap  telephones, 
censor  mail,  and  conduct  raids  when  individuals  are  alleged  to 
pose  a  threat  to  the  unity  and  sovereignty  of  the  nation.  The 
legislation  renewing  the  act  in  1987  provided  for  in  camera  tri- 
als, which  may  be  presided  over  by  any  central  government  offi- 
cer, and  reversed  the  legal  presumption  of  innocence  if  the 
government  produces  specific  evidence  linking  a  suspect  to  a 
terrorist  act.  In  March  1988,  the  Fifty-ninth  Amendment 
increased  the  period  that  an  emergency  can  be  in  effect  with- 
out legislative  approval  from  six  months  to  three  years,  and  it 
eliminated  the  assurance  of  due  process  and  protection  of  life 
and  liberty  with  regard  to  Punjab  found  in  articles  20  and  21. 
These  rights  were  restored  in  1989  by  the  Sixty-third  Amend- 
ment. 

By  June  30,  1994,  more  than  76,000  persons  throughout 
India  had  been  arrested  under  the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive 


440 


Government  and  Politics 


Activities  (Prevention)  Act.  The  act  became  widely  unpopular, 
and  the  Rao  government  allowed  the  law  to  lapse  in  May  1995. 

The  Structure  of  Government 

The  union  government,  as  India's  central  government  is 
known,  is  divided  into  three  distinct  but  interrelated  branches: 
legislative,  executive,  and  judicial  (see  fig.  14).  As  in  the  British 
parliamentary  model,  the  leadership  of  the  executive  is  drawn 
from  and  responsible  to  the  legislative  body.  Although  Article 
50  stipulates  the  separation  of  the  judiciary  from  the  executive, 
the  executive  controls  judicial  appointments  and  many  of  the 
conditions  of  work.  In  addition,  one  of  the  more  dramatic  insti- 
tutional battles  in  the  Indian  polity  has  been  the  struggle 
between  elements  wanting  to  assert  legislative  power  to  amend 
the  constitution  and  those  favoring  the  judiciary's  efforts  to 
preserve  the  constitution's  basic  structure. 

The  Legislature 

Parliament  consists  of  a  bicameral  legislature,  the  Lok  Sabha 
(House  of  the  People — the  lower  house)  and  the  Rajya  Sabha 
(Council  of  States — the  upper  house).  Parliament's  principal 
function  is  to  pass  laws  on  those  matters  that  the  constitution 
specifies  to  be  within  its  jurisdiction.  Among  its  constitutional 
powers  are  approval  and  removal  of  members  of  the  Council  of 
Ministers,  amendment  of  the  constitution,  approval  of  central 
.  government  finances,  and  delimitation  of  state  and  union  terri- 
tory boundaries  (see  State  Governments  and  Union  Territo- 
ries, this  ch.). 

The  president  has  a  specific  authority  with  respect  to  the 
function  of  the  legislative  branch  (see  The  Executive,  this  ch.). 
The  president  is  authorized  to  convene  Parliament  and  must 
give  his  assent  to  all  parliamentary  bills  before  they  become 
law.  The  president  is  empowered  to  summon  Parliament  to 
meet,  to  address  either  house  or  both  houses  together,  and  to 
require  attendance  of  all  of  its  members.  The  president  also 
may  send  messages  to  either  house  with  respect  to  a  pending 
bill  or  any  other  matter.  The  president  addresses  the  first  ses- 
sion of  Parliament  each  year  and  must  give  assent  to  all  provi- 
sions in  bills  passed. 

Lok  Sabha 

The  Lok  Sabha  in  1995  constitutionally  had  545  seats.  For  a

variety  of  reasons,  elections  are  sometimes  not  held  in  all  con- 
stitutiencies,  leaving  some  seats  vacant  and  giving  the  appear- 
ance of  fewer  seats  in  the  lower  house.  A  member  must  be  at 
least  twenty-five  years  of  age.  Two  members  are  nominated  by 
the  president  as  representatives  of  the  Anglo-Indian  commu- 
nity, and  the  rest  are  popularly  elected.  Elections  are  held  on  a 
one-stage,  "first-past-the-post"  system,  similar  to  that  in  the 
United  States.  As  in  the  United  States,  candidates  from  larger 
parties  are  favored  because  each  constituency  elects  only  the 
candidate  winning  the  most  votes.  In  the  context  of  multiple- 
candidate  elections,  most  members  of  Parliament  are  elected 
with  pluralities  of  the  vote  that  amount  to  less  than  a  majority. 
As  a  result,  political  parties  can  gain  commanding  positions  in 
the  Parliament  without  winning  the  support  of  a  majority  of 
the  electorate.  For  instance,  Congress  has  dominated  Indian 
politics  without  ever  winning  a  majority  of  votes  in  parliamen- 
tary elections.  The  best-ever  Congress  performance  in  parlia- 
mentary elections  was  in  1984  when  Congress  (I)  won  48 
percent  of  the  vote  and  garnered  76  percent  of  the  parliamen- 
tary seats.  In  the  1991  elections,  Congress  (I)  won  37.6  percent 
of  the  vote  and  42  percent  of  the  seats. 

The  usual  Lok  Sabha  term  is  five  years.  However,  the  presi- 
dent may  dissolve  the  house  and  call  for  new  elections  should 
the  government  lose  its  majority  in  Parliament.  Elections  must 
be  held  within  six  months  after  Parliament  is  dissolved.  The 
prime  minister  can  choose  electorally  advantageous  times  to 
recommend  the  dissolution  of  Parliament  to  the  president  in 
an  effort  to  maximize  support  in  the  next  Parliament.  The 
term  of  Parliament  can  be  extended  in  yearly  increments  if  an 
emergency  has  been  proclaimed.  This  situation  occurred  in 
1976  when  Parliament  was  extended  beyond  its  five-year  term 
under  the  Emergency  proclaimed  the  previous  year.  The  con- 
stitution stipulates  that  the  Lok  Sabha  must  meet  at  least  twice 
a  year,  and  no  more  than  six  months  can  pass  between  sessions. 
The  Lok  Sabha  customarily  meets  for  three  sessions  a  year.  The 
Council  of  Ministers  is  responsible  only  to  the  Lok  Sabha,  and 
the  authority  to  initiate  financial  legislation  is  vested  exclusively 
in  the  Lok  Sabha. 

The  powers  and  authority  of  the  Lok  Sabha  and  the  Rajya 
Sabha  are  not  differentiated.  The  index  of  the  constitution,  for 
example,  has  a  lengthy  list  of  the  powers  of  Parliament  but  not 
for  each  separate  house.  The  key  differences  between  the  two 
houses  lie  in  their  disparate  authority  in  the  legislative  process. 


443 


India:  A  Country  Study 
Rajya  Sabha 

The  Rajya  Sabha  has  a  maximum  of  250  members.  All  but 
twelve  are  elected  by  state  and  territory  legislatures  for  six-year 
terms.  Members  must  be  at  least  thirty  years  old.  The  president 
nominates  up  to  twelve  members  on  the  basis  of  their  special 
knowledge  or  practical  experience  in  fields  such  as  literature, 
science,  art,  and  social  service.  No  further  approval  of  these 
nominations  is  required  by  Parliament.  Elections  are  staggered 
so  that  one-third  of  the  members  are  elected  every  two  years. 
The  number  of  seats  allocated  to  each  state  and  territory  is 
determined  on  the  basis  of  relative  population,  except  that 
smaller  states  and  territories  are  awarded  a  larger  share  than 
their  population  justifies. 

The  Rajya  Sabha  meets  in  continuous  session.  It  is  not  sub- 
ject to  dissolution  as  is  the  Lok  Sabha.  The  Rajya  Sabha  is 
designed  to  provide  stability  and  continuity  to  the  legislative 
process.  Although  considered  the  upper  house,  its  authority  in 
the  legislative  process  is  subordinate  to  that  of  the  Lok  Sabha. 

Legislative  Process 

The  initiative  for  substantial  legislation  comes  primarily 
from  the  prime  minister,  cabinet  members,  and  high-level  offi- 
cials. Although  all  legislation  except  financial  bills  can  be  intro- 
duced in  either  house,  most  laws  originate  in  the  Lok  Sabha.  A 
legislative  proposal  may  go  through  three  readings  before  it  is 
voted  on.  After  a  bill  has  been  passed  by  the  originating  house, 
it  is  sent  to  the  other  house,  where  it  is  debated  and  voted  on. 
The  second  house  can  accept,  reject,  or  amend  the  bill.  If  the 
bill  is  amended  by  the  second  house,  it  must  be  returned  to  the 
originating  house  in  its  amended  form.  If  a  bill  is  rejected  by 
the  second  house,  if  there  is  disagreement  about  the  proposed 
amendments,  or  if  the  second  house  fails  to  act  on  a  bill  for  six 
months,  the  president  is  authorized  to  summon  a  joint  session 
of  Parliament  to  vote  on  the  bill.  Disagreements  are  resolved  by 
a  majority  vote  of  the  members  of  both  houses  present  in  a 
joint  session.  This  procedure  favors  the  Lok  Sabha  because  it 
has  more  than  twice  as  many  members  as  the  Rajya  Sabha. 

When  the  bill  has  been  passed  by  both  houses,  it  is  sent  to 
the  president,  who  can  refuse  assent  and  send  the  bill  back  to 
Parliament  for  reconsideration.  If  both  houses  pass  it  again, 
with  or  without  amendments,  it  is  sent  to  the  president  a  sec- 
ond time.  The  president  is  then  obliged  to  assent  to  the  legisla- 


444 


Government  and  Politics 


tion.  After  receiving  the  president's  assent,  a  bill  becomes  an 
act  on  the  statute  book. 

The  legislative  procedure  for  bills  involving  taxing  and 
spending — known  as  money  bills — is  different  from  the  proce- 
dure for  other  legislation.  Money  bills  can  be  introduced  only 
in  the  Lok  Sabha.  After  the  Lok  Sabha  passes  a  money  bill,  it  is 
sent  to  the  Rajya  Sabha.  The  upper  house  has  fourteen  days  to 
act  on  the  bill.  If  the  Rajya  Sabha  fails  to  act  within  fourteen 
days,  the  bill  becomes  law.  The  Rajya  Sabha  may  send  an 
amended  version  of  the  bill  back  to  the  Lok  Sabha,  but  the  lat- 
ter is  not  bound  to  accept  these  changes.  It  may  pass  the  origi- 
nal bill  again,  at  which  point  it  will  be  sent  to  the  president  for 
his  signature. 

During  the  1950s  and  part  of  the  1960s,  Parliament  was 
often  the  scene  of  articulate  debate  and  substantial  revisions  of 
legislation.  Prime  ministers  Indira  Gandhi,  Rajiv  Gandhi,  and 
P.V.  Narasimha  Rao,  however,  showed  little  enthusiasm  for  par- 
liamentary debate.  During  the  1975-77  Emergency,  many 
members  of  Parliament  from  the  opposition  as  well  as  dissi- 
dents within  Indira's  own  party  were  arrested,  and  press  cover- 
age of  legislative  proceedings  was  censored.  It  is  generally 
agreed  that  the  quality  of  discourse  and  the  expertise  of  mem- 
bers of  Parliament  have  declined  since  the  1960s.  An  effort  to 
halt  the  decline  of  Parliament  through  a  reformed  committee 
system  giving  Parliament  new  powers  of  oversight  over  the 
executive  branch  has  had  very  limited  impact. 

Under  the  constitution,  the  division  of  powers  between  the 
union  government  and  the  states  is  delimited  into  three  lists: 
the  Union  List,  the  State  List,  and  the  Concurrent  List.  Parlia- 
ment has  exclusive  authority  to  legislate  on  any  of  the  ninety- 
seven  items  on  the  Union  List.  The  list  includes  banking,  com- 
munications, defense,  foreign  affairs,  interstate  commerce,  and 
transportation.  The  State  List  includes  sixty-seven  items  that 
are  under  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  state  legislatures,  includ- 
ing agriculture,  local  government,  police,  public  health,  public 
order,  and  trade  and  commerce  within  the  state.  The  central — 
or  union — government  and  state  governments  exercise  con- 
current jurisdiction  over  forty-four  items  on  the  Concurrent 
List,  including  criminal  law  and  procedure,  economic  and 
social  planning,  electricity,  factories,  marriage  and  divorce, 
price  control,  social  security  and  social  insurance,  and  trade 
unions.  The  purpose  of  the  Concurrent  List  is  to  secure  legal 
and  administrative  unity  throughout  the  country.  Laws  passed 


445 


India:  A  Country  Study 

by  Parliament  relevant  to  Concurrent  List  areas  take  prece- 
dence over  laws  passed  by  state  legislatures. 

The  Executive 

The  executive  branch  is  headed  by  the  president,  in  whom 
the  constitution  vests  a  formidable  array  of  powers.  The  presi- 
dent serves  as  head  of  state  and  the  supreme  commander  of 
the  armed  forces.  The  president  appoints  the  prime  minister, 
cabinet  members,  governors  of  states  and  territories,  Supreme 
Court  and  high  court  justices,  and  ambassadors  and  other  dip- 
lomatic representatives.  The  president  is  also  authorized  to 
issue  ordinances  with  the  force  of  acts  of  Parliament  when  Par- 
liament is  not  in  session.  The  president  can  summon  and  pro- 
rogue Parliament  as  well  as  dissolve  the  Lok  Sabha  and  call  for 
new  elections.  The  president  also  can  dismiss  state  and  terri- 
tory governments.  Exercise  of  these  impressive  powers  has 
been  restricted  by  the  convention  that  the  president  acts  on  the 
advice  of  the  prime  minister.  In  1976  the  Forty-second  Amend- 
ment formally  required  the  president  to  act  according  to  the 
advice  of  the  Council  of  Ministers  headed  by  the  prime  minis- 
ter. The  spirit  of  the  arrangement  is  reflected  in  Ambedkar's 
statement  that  the  president  "is  head  of  the  State  but  not  of  the 
Executive.  He  represents  the  nation  but  does  not  rule  the 
nation."  In  practice,  the  president's  role  is  predominantly  sym- 
bolic and  ceremonial,  roughly  analogous  to  the  president  of 
Germany  or  the  British  monarch. 

The  president  is  elected  for  a  five-year  term  by  an  electoral 
college  consisting  of  the  elected  members  of  both  houses  of 
Parliament  and  the  elected  members  of  the  legislative  assem- 
blies of  the  states  and  territories.  The  participation  of  state  and 
territory  assemblies  in  the  election  is  designed  to  ensure  that 
the  president  is  chosen  to  head  the  nation  and  not  merely  the 
majority  party  in  Parliament,  thereby  placing  the  office  above 
politics  and  making  the  incumbent  a  symbol  of  national  unity. 

Despite  the  strict  constraints  placed  on  presidential  author- 
ity, presidential  elections  have  shaped  the  course  of  Indian  pol- 
itics on  several  occasions,  and  presidents  have  exercised 
important  power,  especially  when  no  party  has  a  clear  parlia- 
mentary majority.  The  presidential  election  of  1969,  for  exam- 
ple, turned  into  a  dramatic  test  of  strength  for  rival  factions 
when  Prime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi  put  up  an  opponent  to  the 
official  Congress  candidate.  The  electoral  contest  contributed 
to  the  subsequent  split  of  the  Congress.  In  1979,  after  the  Ja- 


446 


India's  Parliament,  New  Delhi

nata  Party  began  to  splinter,  President  Neelam  Sanjiva  Reddy 
(1977-82)  first  selected  Janata  member  Chaudhury  Charan 
Singh  as  prime  minister  (1979-80)  to  form  a  minority  govern- 
ment and  then  dissolved  Parliament  and  called  for  new  elec- 
tions while  ignoring  Jagjivan  Ram's  claim  that  he  could 
assemble  a  stable  government  and  become  the  country's  first 
Scheduled  Caste  prime  minister. 

Tensions  between  President  Giani  Zail  Singh  (1982-87)  and 
Prime  Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  (1984-88)  also  illustrate  the 
potential  power  of  the  president.  In  1987  Singh  refused  to  sign 
the  Indian  Post  Office  (Amendment)  Bill,  thereby  preventing 
the  government  from  having  the  authority  to  censor  personal 
mail.  Singh's  public  suggestion  that  the  prime  minister  had  not 
treated  the  office  of  the  president  with  proper  dignity  and  the 
persistent  rumors  that  Singh  was  plotting  the  prime  minister's 
ouster  contributed  to  the  erosion  of  public  confidence  in  Rajiv 
Gandhi  that  ultimately  led  to  his  defeat  in  the  1989  elections. 
In  November  1990,  President  Ramaswami  Venkataraman 
(1987-92)  selected  Chandra  Shekhar  as  India's  eleventh  prime 
minister,  even  though  Chandra  Shekhar's  splinter  Samajwadi 
Janata  Dal  held  only  fifty-eight  seats  in  the  Lok  Sabha.  Chandra 


447 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Shekhar  resigned  in  June  1991  when  the  Congress  (I)  withdrew 
its  support. 

In  the  same  manner  as  the  president,  the  vice  president  is 
elected  by  the  electoral  college  for  a  five-year  term.  The  vice 
president  is  ex  officio  chairman  of  the  Rajya  Sabha  and  acts  as 
president  when  the  latter  is  unable  to  discharge  his  duties 
because  of  absence,  illness,  or  any  other  reason  or  until  a  new 
president  can  be  elected  (within  six  months  of  the  vacancy) 
when  a  vacancy  occurs  because  of  death,  resignation,  or 
removal.  There  have  been  three  instances  since  1969  of  the 
vice  president  serving  as  acting  president. 

The  prime  minister  is  by  far  the  most  powerful  figure  in  the 
government.  After  being  selected  by  the  president,  typically 
from  the  party  that  commands  the  plurality  of  seats  in  Parlia- 
ment, the  prime  minister  selects  the  Council  of  Ministers  from 
other  members  of  Parliament  who  are  then  appointed  by  the 
president.  Indivi duals  who  are  not  members  of  Parliament  may 
be  appointed  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  if  they  become  a 
member  of  Parliament  either  through  election  or  appointment 
within  six  months  of  selection.  The  Council  of  Ministers  is  com- 
posed of  cabinet  ministers  (numbering  seventeen,  represent- 
ing thirty-one  portfolios  in  1995),  ministers  of  state  (forty-five, 
representing  fifty-three  portfolios  in  1995),  and  deputy  minis- 
ters (the  number  varies).  Cabinet  members  are  selected  to 
accommodate  different  regional  groups,  castes,  and  factions 
within  the  ruling  party  or  coalition  as  well  as  with  an  eye  to 
their  administrative  skills  and  experience.  Prime  ministers  fre- 
quently retain  key  ministerial  portfolios  for  themselves. 

Although  the  Council  of  Ministers  is  formally  the  highest 
policy-making  body  in  the  government,  its  powers  have 
declined  as  influence  has  been  increasingly  centralized  in  the 
Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  which  is  composed  of  the  top- 
ranking  administrative  staff.  After  the  Congress  split  to  form 
the  Congress  (R) — Rfor  Requisition — and  the  Congress  (O) — 
O  for  Organisation — in  1969,  Indira  Gandhi  (who  headed  the 
Congress  (R))  increasingly  concentrated  decision-making 
authority  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  When  Rajiv  Gan- 
dhi became  prime  minister  in  1984,  he  promised  to  delegate 
more  authority  to  his  cabinet  members.  However,  power  rap- 
idly shifted  back  to  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  a  small 
coterie  of  Rajiv's  personal  advisers.  Rajiv's  dissatisfaction  with 
his  cabinet  ministers  became  manifest  in  his  incessant  reshuf- 
fling of  his  cabinet.  During  his  five  years  in  office,  he  changed 


448 


Government  and  Politics 


his  cabinet  thirty-six  times,  about  once  every  seven  weeks. 
When  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao  became  prime  minister  in  June 
1991,  he  decentralized  power,  giving  Minister  of  Finance  Man- 
mohan  Singh,  in  particular,  a  large  measure  of  autonomy  to 
develop  a  program  for  economic  reform.  After  a  year  in  office, 
Rao  began  again  to  centralize  authority,  and  by  the  end  of 

1994,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  had  grown  to  be  as  pow- 
erful as  it  ever  was  under  Rao's  predecessors.  As  of  August 

1995,  Rao  himself  held  the  portfolios  in  thirteen  ministries, 
including  those  of  defense,  industry,  and  Kashmir  affairs. 

The  Judiciary 

Supreme  Court 

The  Supreme  Court  is  the  ultimate  interpreter  of  the  consti- 
tution and  the  laws  of  the  land.  It  has  appellate  jurisdiction 
over  all  civil  and  criminal  proceedings  involving  substantial 
issues  concerning  the  interpretation  of  the  constitution.  The 
court  has  the  original  and  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  resolve  dis- 
putes between  the  central  government  and  one  or  more  states 
and  union  territories  as  well  as  between  different  states  and 
union  territories.  And  the  Supreme  Court  is  also  empowered 
to  issue  advisory  rulings  on  issues  referred  to  it  by  the  presi- 
dent. The  Supreme  Court  has  wide  discretionary  powers  to 
hear  special  appeals  on  any  matter  from  any  court  except  those 
of  the  armed  services.  It  also  functions  as  a  court  of  record  and 
supervises  every  high  court. 

Twenty-five  associate  justices  and  one  chief  justice  serve  on 
the  Supreme  Court.  The  president  appoints  the  chief  justice. 
Associate  justices  are  also  appointed  by  the  president  after  con- 
sultation with  the  chief  justice  and,  if  the  president  deems  nec- 
essary, with  other  associate  justices  of  the  Supreme  Court  and 
high  court  judges  in  the  states.  The  appointments  do  not 
require  Parliament's  concurrence.  Justices  may  not  be  removed 
from  office  until  they  reach  mandatory  retirement  at  age  sixty- 
five  unless  each  house  of  Parliament  passes,  by  a  vote  of  two- 
thirds  of  the  members  in  attendance  and  a  majority  of  its  total 
membership,  a  presidential  order  charging  "proved  misbehav- 
ior or  incapacity." 

The  contradiction  between  the  principles  of  parliamentary 
sovereignty  and  judicial  review  that  is  embedded  in  India's  con- 
stitution has  been  a  source  of  major  controversy  over  the  years. 
After  the  courts  overturned  state  laws  redistributing  land  from 


449 


India:  A  Country  Study 


zamindar  (see  Glossary)  estates  on  the  grounds  that  the  laws 
violated  the  zamindars'  Fundamental  Rights,  Parliament 
passed  the  first  (1951),  fourth  (1955),  and  seventeenth  amend- 
ments (1964)  to  protect  its  authority  to  implement  land  redis- 
tribution. The  Supreme  Court  countered  these  amendments  in 
1967  when  it  ruled  in  the  Golaknath  v  State  of  Punjab  case  that 
Parliament  did  not  have  the  power  to  abrogate  the  Fundamen- 
tal Rights,  including  the  provisions  on  private  property.  On 
February  1,  1970,  the  Supreme  Court  invalidated  the  govern- 
ment-sponsored Bank  Nationalization  Bill  that  had  been 
passed  by  Parliament  in  August  1969.  The  Supreme  Court  also 
rejected  as  unconstitutional  a  presidential  order  of  September 
7,  1970,  that  abolished  the  titles,  privileges,  and  privy  purses  of 
the  former  rulers  of  India's  old  princely  states. 

In  reaction  to  Supreme  Court  decisions,  in  1971  Parliament 
passed  the  Twenty-fourth  Amendment  empowering  it  to 
amend  any  provision  of  the  constitution,  including  the  Funda- 
mental Rights;  the  Twenty-fifth  Amendment,  making  legislative 
decisions  concerning  proper  land  compensation  nonjusticia- 
ble; and  the  Twenty-sixth  Amendment,  which  added  a  constitu- 
tional article  abolishing  princely  privileges  and  privy  purses. 
On  April  24,  1973,  the  Supreme  Court  responded  to  the  parlia- 
mentary offensive  by  ruling  in  the  Keshavananda  Bharati  v  the 
State  of  Kerala  case  that  although  these  amendments  were  con- 
stitutional, the  court  still  reserved  for  itself  the  discretion  to 
reject  any  constitutional  amendments  passed  by  Parliament  by 
declaring  that  the  amendments  cannot  change  the  constitu- 
tion's "basic  structure." 

During  the  1975-77  Emergency,  Parliament  passed  the 
Forty-second  Amendment  in  January  1977,  which  essentially 
abrogated  the  Keshavananda  ruling  by  preventing  the  Supreme 
Court  from  reviewing  any  constitutional  amendment  with  the 
exception  of  procedural  issues  concerning  ratification.  The 
Forty-second  Amendment's  fifty-nine  clauses  stripped  the 
Supreme  Court  of  many  of  its  powers  and  moved  the  political 
system  toward  parliamentary  sovereignty.  However,  the  Forty- 
third  and  Forty-fourth  amendments,  passed  by  the  Janata  gov- 
ernment after  the  defeat  of  Indira  Gandhi  in  March  1977, 
reversed  these  changes.  In  the  Minerva  Mills  case  of  1980,  the 
Supreme  Court  reaffirmed  its  authority  to  protect  the  basic 
structure  of  the  constitution.  However,  in  the  Judges  Transfer 
case  on  December  31,  1981,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the

Washington 


government's  authority  to  dismiss  temporary  judges  and  trans- 
fer high  court  justices  without  the  consent  of  the  chief  justice. 

The  Supreme  Court  continued  to  be  embroiled  in  contro- 
versy in  1989,  when  its  US$470  million  judgment  against  Union 
Carbide  for  the  Bhopal  catastrophe  resulted  in  public  demon- 
strations protesting  the  inadequacy  of  the  settlement  (see  The 
Growth  of  Cities,  ch.  5).  In  1991  the  first-ever  impeachment 
motion  against  a  Supreme  Court  justice  was  signed  by  108 
members  of  Parliament.  A  year  later,  a  high-profile  inquiry 
found  Associate  Justice  V.  Ramaswamy  "guilty  of  willful  and 
gross  misuses  of  office  .  .  .  and  moral  turpitude  by  using  public 
funds  for  private  purposes  and  reckless  disregard  of  statutory 
rules"  while  serving  as  chief  justice  of  Punjab  and  Haryana. 
Despite  this  strong  indictment,  Ramaswamy  survived  parlia- 
mentary impeachment  proceedings  and  remained  on  the 
Supreme  Court  after  only  196  members  of  Parliament,  less 
than  the  required  two-thirds,  voted  for  his  ouster. 

During  1993  and  1994,  the  Supreme  Court  took  measures  to 
bolster  the  integrity  of  the  courts  and  protect  civil  liberties  in 
the  face  of  state  coercion.  In  an  effort  to  avoid  the  appearance 
of  conflict  of  interest  in  the  judiciary,  Chief  Justice  Manepalli 
Narayanrao  Venkatachaliah  initiated  a  controversial  model 
code  of  conduct  forjudges  that  required  the  transfer  of  high 
court  judges  having  children  practicing  as  attorneys  in  their 


451 


India:  A  Country  Study 


courts.  Since  1993,  the  Supreme  Court  has  implemented  a  pol- 
icy to  compensate  the  victims  of  violence  while  in  police  cus- 
tody. On  April  27,  1994,  the  Supreme  Court  issued  a  ruling  that 
enhanced  the  rights  of  individuals  placed  under  arrest  by  stipu- 
lating elaborate  guidelines  for  arrest,  detention,  and  interroga- 
tion. 

High  Courts 

There  are  eighteen  high  courts  for  India's  twenty-five  states, 
six  union  territories,  and  one  national  capital  territory.  Some 
high  courts  serve  more  than  one  state  or  union  territory.  For 
example,  the  high  court  of  the  union  territory  of  Chandigarh 
also  serves  Punjab  and  Haryana,  and  the  high  court  in  Gauhati 
(in  Meghalaya)  serves  Assam,  Nagaland,  Meghalaya,  Mizoram, 
Manipur,  Tripura,  and  Arunachal  Pradesh.  As  part  of  the  judi- 
cial system,  the  high  courts  are  institutionally  independent  of 
state  legislatures  and  executives.  The  president  appoints  state 
high  court  chief  justices  after  consulting  with  the  chief  justice 
of  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  governor  of  the  state.  The  presi- 
dent also  consults  with  the  chief  justice  of  the  state  high  court 
before  he  appoints  other  high  court  justices.  Furthermore,  the 
president  may  also  exercise  the  right  to  transfer  high  court  jus- 
tices without  consultation.  These  personnel  matters  are  becom- 
ing more  politicized  as  chief  ministers  of  states  endeavor  to 
exert  their  influence  with  New  Delhi  and  the  prime  minister 
exerts  influence  over  the  president  to  secure  politically  advan- 
tageous appointments. 

Each  high  court  is  a  court  of  record  exercising  original  and 
appellate  jurisdiction  within  its  respective  state  or  territory.  It 
also  has  the  power  to  issue  appropriate  writs  in  cases  involving 
constitutionally  guaranteed  Fundamental  Rights.  The  high 
court  supervises  all  courts  within  its  jurisdiction,  except  for 
those  dealing  with  the  armed  forces,  and  may  transfer  constitu- 
tional cases  to  itself  from  subordinate  courts  (see  Criminal  Law 
and  Procedure,  ch.  10).  The  high  courts  have  original  jurisdic- 
tion on  revenue  matters.  They  try  original  criminal  cases  by  a 
jury,  but  not  civil  cases. 

Lower  Courts 

States  are  divided  into  districts  (zillas),  and  within  each  a 
judge  presides  as  a  district  judge  over  civil  cases.  A  sessions 
judge  presides  over  criminal  cases.  The  judges  are  appointed 


452

by  the  governor  in  consultation  with  the  state's  high  court.  Dis- 
trict courts  are  subordinate  to  the  authority  of  their  high  court. 

There  is  a  hierarchy  of  judicial  officials  below  the  district 
level.  Many  officials  are  selected  through  competitive  examina- 
tion by  the  state's  public  service  commission.  Civil  cases  at  the 
subdistrict  level  are  filed  in  ?7zwrm/(subdistrict)  courts.  Lesser 
criminal  cases  are  entrusted  to  the  courts  of  subordinate  magis- 
trates functioning  under  the  supervisory  authority  of  a  district 
magistrate.  All  magistrates  are  under  the  supervision  of  the 
high  court.  At  the  village  level,  disputes  are  frequently  resolved 
by  panchayats  or  lok  adalats  (people's  courts). 

The  judicial  system  retains  substantial  legitimacy  in  the  eyes 
of  many  Indians  despite  its  politicization  since  the  1970s.  In 
fact,  as  illustrated  by  the  rise  of  social  action  litigation  in  the 
1980s  and  1990s,  many  Indians  turn  to  the  courts  to  redress 


453 


India:  A  Country  Study 


grievances  with  other  social  and  political  institutions.  It  is  fre- 
quently observed  that  Indians  are  highly  litigious,  which  has 
contributed  to  a  growing  backlog  of  cases.  Indeed,  the 
Supreme  Court  was  reported  to  have  more  than  150,000  cases 
pending  in  1990,  the  high  courts  had  some  2  million  cases 
pending,  and  the  lower  courts  had  a  substantially  greater  back- 
log. Research  findings  in  the  early  1990s  show  that  the  backlogs 
at  levels  below  the  Supreme  Court  are  the  result  of  delays  in 
the  litigation  process  and  the  large  number  of  decisions  that 
are  appealed  and  not  the  result  of  an  increase  in  the  number 
of  new  cases  filed.  Coupled  with  public  perceptions  of  politici- 
zation,  the  growing  inability  of  the  courts  to  resolve  disputes 
expeditiously  threatens  to  erode  the  remaining  legitimacy  of 
the  judicial  system. 

Election  Commission 

Article  324  of  the  constitution  establishes  an  independent 
Election  Commission  to  supervise  parliamentary  and  state  elec- 
tions. Supervising  elections  in  the  world's  largest  democracy  is 
by  any  standard  an  immense  undertaking.  Some  521  million 
people  were  eligible  to  vote  in  1991.  Efforts  are  made  to  see 
that  polling  booths  are  situated  no  more  than  two  kilometers 
from  a  voter's  place  of  residence.  In  1991,  this  objective 
required  some  600,000  polling  stations  for  the  country's  3,941 
state  legislative  assembly  and  543  parliamentary  constituencies. 
To  attempt  to  ensure  fair  elections,  the  Election  Commission 
deployed  more  than  3.5  million  officials,  most  of  whom  were 
temporarily  seconded  from  the  government  bureaucracy,  and 
2  million  police,  paramilitary,  and  military  forces. 

Over  the  years,  the  Election  Commission's  enforcement  of 
India's  remarkably  strict  election  laws  grew  increasingly  lax.  As 
a  consequence,  candidates  flagrantly  violated  laws  limiting 
campaign  expenditures.  Elections  became  increasingly  violent 
(350  persons  were  killed  during  the  1991  campaign,  including 
five  Lok  Sabha  and  twenty-one  state  assembly  candidates),  and 
voter  intimidation  and  fraud  proliferated. 

The  appointment  of  T.N.  Seshan  as  chief  election  commis- 
sioner in  1991  reinvigorated  the  Election  Commission  and 
curbed  the  illegal  manipulation  of  India's  electoral  system.  By 
cancelling  or  repolling  elections  where  improprieties  had 
occurred,  disciplining  errant  poll  officers,  and  fighting  for  the 
right  to  deploy  paramilitary  forces  in  sensitive  areas,  Seshan 
forced  candidates  to  take  the  Election  Commission's  code  of 


454 


Government  and  Politics 


conduct  seriously  and  strengthened  its  supervisory  machinery. 
In  Uttar  Pradesh,  where  more  than  100  persons  were  killed  in 
the  1991  elections,  Seshan  succeeded  in  reducing  the  number 
killed  to  two  in  the  November  1993  assembly  elections  by 
enforcing  compulsory  deposit  of  all  licensed  firearms,  banning 
unauthorized  vehicular  traffic,  and  supplementing  local  police 
with  paramilitary  units.  In  state  assembly  elections  in  Andhra 
Pradesh,  Goa,  Karnataka,  and  Sikkim,  after  raising  ceilings  for 
campaign  expenditures  to  realistic  levels,  Seshan  succeeded  in 
getting  candidates  to  comply  with  these  limits  by  deploying  336 
audit  officers  to  keep  daily  accounts  of  the  candidates'  election 
expenditures.  Although  Seshan  has  received  enthusiastic  sup- 
port from  the  public,  he  has  stirred  great  controversy  among 
the  country's  politicians.  In  October  1993,  the  Supreme  Court 
issued  a  ruling  that  confirmed  the  supremacy  of  the  chief  elec- 
tion commissioner,  thereby  deflecting  an  effort  to  rein  in  Ses- 
han by  appointing  an  additional  two  election  commissioners. 
Congress  (I)'s  attempt  to  curb  Seshan's  powers  through  a  con- 
stitutional amendment  was  foiled  after  a  public  outcry  weak- 
ened its  support  in  Parliament. 

State  Governments  and  Territories 

India  has  twenty-five  states,  six  union  territories,  and  one 
national  capital  territory,  with  populations  ranging  from 
406,000  (Sikkim)  to  139  million  (Uttar  Pradesh).  Ten  states 
each  have  more  than  40  million  people,  making  them  country- 
like in  significance  (see  Structure  and  Dynamics,  ch.  2) .  There 
are  eighteen  official  Scheduled  Languages  (see  Glossary), 
clearly  defined  since  the  reorganization  of  states  along  linguis- 
tic lines  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  (see  The  Social  Context  of  Lan- 
guages, ch.  4).  Social  structures  within  states  vary  considerably, 
and  they  encompass  a  great  deal  of  cultural  diversity,  as  those 
who  have  watched  India's  Republic  Day  (January  26)  celebra- 
tions will  attest  (see  Larger  Kinship  Groups,  ch.  5). 

The  constitution  provides  for  a  legislature  in  each  state  and 
territory.  Most  states  have  unicameral  legislatures,  but  Andhra 
Pradesh,  Bihar,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Maharashtra,  Tamil 
Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  bicameral  legislatures.  The 
lower  house,  known  as  the  vidhan  sabha,  or  legislative  assembly, 
is  the  real  seat  of  legislative  power.  Where  an  upper  house 
exists,  it  is  known  as  the  vidhan  parishad,  or  legislative  council; 
council  functions  are  advisory,  and  any  objections  expressed  to 
a  bill  may  be  overridden  if  the  assembly  passes  the  bill  a  second 


455 


India:  A  Country  Study 


time.  Members  of  the  assembly  serve  five-year  terms  after  being 
chosen  by  direct  elections  from  local  constituencies.  Their 
numbers  vary,  from  a  minimum  of  sixty  to  a  maximum  of  500. 
Members  of  the  council  are  selected  through  a  combination  of 
direct  election,  indirect  election,  and  nomination.  Their  six- 
year  terms  are  staggered  so  that  one-third  of  the  membership  is 
renewed  every  two  vears.  Whether  in  the  upper  or  lower  house, 
membership  in  the  assembly  has  come  to  reflect  the  predomi- 
nantly rural  demography  of  most  states  and  the  distribution  of 
social  power  resulting  from  the  state's  agrarian  and  caste  struc- 
tures. 

The  structure  of  state  governments  is  similar  to  that  of  the 
central  government.  In  the  executive  branch,  the  governor 
plays  a  role  analogous  to  that  of  the  president,  and  the  elected 
chief  minister  presides  over  a  council  of  ministers  drawn  from 
the  legislature  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  prime  minister.  Many 
of  the  governor's  duties  are  honorific;  however,  the  governor 
also  has  considerable  power.  Like  the  president,  the  governor 
selects  who  may  attempt  to  form  a  government;  he  may  also 
dismiss  a  state's  government  and  dissolve  its  legislative  assem- 
bly. All  bills  that  the  state  legislature  passes  must  receive  the 
assent  of  the  governor.  The  governor  may  return  bills  other 
than  money  bills  to  the  assembly.  The  governor  may  also 
decide  to  send  a  bill  for  consideration  to  the  president,  who 
has  the  power  to  promulgate  ordinances.  The  governor  may 
also  recommend  to  the  president  that  President's  Rule  be 
invoked.  Governors  are  appointed  to  office  for  a  five-year  term 
by  the  president  on  the  advice  of  the  prime  minister,  and  their 
conduct  is  supposed  to  be  above  politics. 

Since  1967  most  state  legislatures  have  come  under  the  con- 
trol of  parties  in  opposition  to  the  majority  in  Parliament,  and 
governors  have  frequently  acted  as  agents  of  the  ruling  party  in 
New  Delhi.  Increasingly,  governors  are  appointed  more  for 
their  loyalty  to  the  prime  minister  than  for  their  distinguished 
achievements  and  discretion.  The  politicization  of  gubernato- 
rial appointments  has  become  such  a  widespread  practice  that 
in  1989,  shortly  after  the  National  Front  government  replaced 
the  Congress  (I)  government,  Prime  Minister  V.P.  Singh 
(1989-90)  asked  eighteen  governors  to  resign  so  that  he  could 
replace  them  with  his  own  choices.  Governors  not  only  attempt 
to  keep  opposition  state  governments  in  line,  but  also,  while 
keeping  the  state  bureaucracy  in  place,  have  exercised  their 


456 


Government  and  Politics 


power  to  dismiss  the  chief  minister  and  his  or  her  council  of 
ministers. 

The  strength  of  the  central  government  relative  to  the  states 
is  especially  apparent  in  constitutional  provisions  for  central 
intervention  into  state  jurisdictions.  Article  3  of  the  constitu- 
tion authorizes  Parliament,  by  a  simple  majority  vote,  to  estab- 
lish or  eliminate  states  and  union  territories  or  change  their 
boundaries  and  names.  The  emergency  powers  granted  to  the 
central  government  by  the  constitution  enable  it,  under  certain 
circumstances,  to  acquire  the  powers  of  a  unitary  state.  The 
central  government  can  also  dismiss  a  state  government 
through  President's  Rule.  Article  249  of  the  constitution 
enables  a  two-thirds  vote  of  the  Rajya  Sabha  to  empower  Parlia- 
ment to  pass  binding  legislation  for  any  of  the  subjects  on  the 
State  List.  Articles  256  and  257  require  states  to  comply  with 
laws  passed  by  Parliament  and  with  the  executive  authority  of 
the  central  government.  The  articles  empower  the  central  gov- 
ernment to  issue  directives  instructing  states  on  compliance  in 
these  matters.  Article  200  also  enables  a  state  governor,  under 
certain  circumstances,  to  refuse  to  give  assent  to  bills  passed  by 
the  state  legislature  and  instead  refer  them  to  the  president  for 
review. 

The  central  government  exerts  control  over  state  govern- 
ments through  the  financial  resources  at  its  command.  The 
central  government  distributes  taxes  and  grants-in-aid  through 
the  decisions  of  finance  commissions,  usually  convened  every 
five  years  as  stipulated  by  Article  275.  The  central  government 
also  distributes  substantial  grants  through  its  development 
plans  as  elaborated  by  the  Planning  Commission.  The  depen- 
dence of  state  governments  on  grants  and  disbursements  grew 
throughout  the  1980s  as  states  began  to  run  up  fiscal  deficits 
and  the  share  of  transfers  from  New  Delhi  increased.  The 
power  and  influence  of  central  government  finances  also  can 
be  seen  in  the  substantial  funds  allocated  under  the  central 
government's  five-year  plans  to  such  areas  as  public  health  and 
agriculture  that  are  constitutionally  under  the  State  List  (see 
Health  Care,  ch.  2;  Development  Programs,  ch.  7). 

Besides  its  twenty-five  states,  India  has  seven  centrally  super- 
vised territories.  Six  are  union  territories;  one  is  the  National 
Capital  Territory  of  Delhi.  Jurisdictions  for  territories  are 
smaller  than  states  and  less  populous.  The  central  government 
administers  union  territories  through  either  a  lieutenant  gov- 
ernor or  a  chief  commissioner  who  is  appointed  by  the  presi-

dent  on  the  advice  of  the  prime  minister.  Each  territory  also 
has  a  council  of  ministers,  a  legislature,  and  a  high  court;  how- 
ever, Parliament  may  also  pass  legislation  on  issues  in  union  ter- 
ritories that  in  the  case  of  states  are  usually  reserved  for  state 
assemblies.  The  Sixty-ninth  Amendment,  passed  in  December 
1991,  made  Delhi  the  national  capital  territory  effective  Febru- 
ary 1,  1992.  Although  not  having  the  same  status  as  statehood, 
Delhi  was  given  the  power  of  direct  election  of  members  of  its 
legislative  assembly  and  the  power  to  pass  its  own  laws. 

Local  Government 

The  district  is  the  principal  subdivision  within  the  state 
(union  territories  are  not  subdivided).  There  are  476  districts 
in  India;  the  districts  vary  in  size  and  population.  The  average 
size  of  a  district  is  approximately  4,300  square  kilometers,  and 
the  average  population  numbered  nearly  1.8  million  in  the 
early  1990s.  The  district  collector,  a  member  of  the  Indian 
Administrative  Service,  is  the  preeminent  official  in  the  district 
(see  The  Civil  Service,  this  ch.).  During  the  colonial  period, 
the  collector  was  responsible  for  collecting  revenue  and  main- 
taining law  and  order.  In  the  1990s,  the  collector's  role  in  most 
states  is  confined  to  heading  the  district  revenue  department 
and  coordinating  the  efforts  of  the  other  departments,  such  as 
agriculture,  irrigation,  public  works,  forestry,  and  public 
health,  that  are  responsible  for  promoting  economic  develop- 
ment and  social  welfare. 

Districts  are  subdivided  into  taluqs  or  tehsils,  areas  that  con- 
tain from  200  to  600  villages.  The  taluqdar  or  tehsildar,  who 
serves  in  much  the  same  capacity  as  the  collector,  is  the  chief 
member  of  the  taluq  revenue  department  and  is  the  preemi- 
nent official  at  this  level.  Economic  development  and  social 
welfare  departments  are  also  likely  to  have  offices  at  the  taluq 
level.  Although  the  revenue  department  may  have  village  rep- 
resentatives, generally  known  as  patwaris  (village  record-keep- 
ers), to  maintain  land  records,  the  development  and  welfare 
departments  generally  do  not  have  offices  below  the  taluq  level. 

Article  40  of  the  constitution  directs  the  government  to 
establish  panchayats  to  serve  as  institutions  of  local  self-govern- 
ment. Most  states  began  implementing  this  Directive  Principle 
along  the  lines  of  the  recommendations  of  the  government's 
Balwantrai  Mehta  Commission  report.  According  to  these  rec- 
ommendations, the  popularly  elected  village  council  (gram  pan- 
chayat)  is  the  basic  unit.  Village  council  chairs,  elected  by  the 


458 


The  Vidhana  Saudha,  the  seat  of  the  Karnataka  state 

legislature,  Bangalore

members  of  the  village  council,  serve  as  members  of  the  block 
council  (panchayat  samiti).  A  block  is  a  large  subunit  of  a  dis- 
trict. In  some  states,  blocks  are  coterminous  with  taluqs  or  teh- 
sils.  In  other  states,  taluqs  or  tehsils  are  divided  into  blocks.  The 
district  council  (zilla  parishad)  is  the  top  level  of  the  system.  Its 
jurisdiction  includes  all  village  and  block  councils  within  a  dis- 
trict. Its  membership  includes  the  block  council  chairs. 

Deficient  in  funds  and  authority,  the  panchayats  in  most 
states  were  largely  inactive  until  the  late  1970s.  However,  efforts 
were  then  initiated  to  reinvigorate  the  panchayats.  West  Bengal 
led  the  way  by  transferring  substantial  funds  and  authority  over 
rural  development  projects  to  the  panchayats  and  then  holding 
popular  elections  for  panchayat  representatives  at  all  three  lev- 
els in  which  political  parties  were  allowed  to  field  candidates 
for  the  first  time.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  state  of  Karnataka  also 
made  important  efforts  to  revive  the  panchayats. 

In  1989  Rajiv  Gandhi's  government  took  two  major  initia- 
tives designed  to  enhance  the  panchayats'  role  in  local  govern- 
ment and  economic  development.  It  initiated  the  Jawahar 
Employment  Plan  (Jawahar  Rozgar  Yojana),  which  provided 
funding  directly  to  village  councils  to  create  jobs  for  the  unem- 


459 


India:  A  Country  Study 

ployed  through  public  works  projects.  Rajiv  Gandhi's  govern- 
ment also  proposed  the  Sixty-fourth  Amendment  Bill  to  make 
it  mandatory  for  all  states  to  establish  a  three-tiered  (village, 
block,  and  district)  system  of  panchayats  in  which  representa- 
tives would  be  directly  elected  for  five-year  terms.  Panchayats 
were  to  be  given  expanded  authority  and  funding  over  local 
development  efforts.  Despite  the  popular  appeal  of  transfer- 
ring power  to  panchayats,  the  Sixty-fourth  Amendment  Bill  was 
rejected  by  the  Rajya  Sabha.  Its  hasty  introduction  in  an  elec- 
tion year  made  it  appear  to  be  a  popular  gimmick.  Opposition 
to  the  bill  also  arose  from  those  who  feared  that  the  transfer  of 
authority  from  state  governments  to  panchayats  was  designed  to 
reduce  the  power  of  state  legislatures  under  opposition  control 
and  promote  "greater  centralization  through  decentralization" 
by  enabling  the  central  government  to  establish  direct  relations 
with  panchayats. 

On  December  22,  1992,  the  Congress  (I)  government  passed 
the  Seventy-third  Amendment,  which  gave  panchayats  constitu- 
tional status  (previously  panchayat  matters  were  considered  a 
state  subject).  The  amendment  also  institutionalized  a  three- 
tiered  system  of  panchayats  (except  for  states  with  a  population 
of  less  than  2  million),  with  panchayats  at  the  village,  block,  and 
district  levels.  The  amendment  also  stipulated  that  all  panchayat 
members  be  elected  for  five-year  terms  in  elections  supervised 
by  state  election  commissions. 

The  26  percent  of  the  population  living  in  urban  areas  are 
governed  by  municipal  corporations  and  municipal  councils. 
The  municipal  corporations  governing  the  larger  cities  are 
composed  of  elected  councils  and  a  president  or  mayor  elected 
from  within  the  council.  The  state  governor  appoints  a  com- 
missioner who  acts  as  the  chief  executive  of  the  municipal  cor- 
poration. The  municipal  councils  administering  the  smaller 
cities  have  elected  committees  or  boards.  The  municipal  gov- 
ernment is  responsible  for  education,  health,  sanitation,  safety, 
and  maintaining  roads  and  other  public  facilities.  The  coun- 
try's municipal  governments  have  long  been  troubled,  in  part 
because  of  their  limited  authority  and  lack  of  funds.  The  fre- 
quent intervention  of  state  governments  to  suspend  the  activi- 
ties of  municipal  administrations  has  also  undermined  them. 
For  instance,  state  or  union  territory  governments  suspended 
the  elected  bodies  of  forty-four  out  of  sixty-six  municipal  corpo- 
rations in  1986.  The  Seventy-fourth  Amendment  was  passed  in 
December  1992  in  order  to  revive  municipal  governments. 


460 


Government  and  Politics 


Among  other  things,  it  mandates  that  elections  for  municipal 
bodies  must  be  held  within  six  months  of  the  date  of  their  dis- 
solution. The  amendment  also  provides  for  financial  review  of 
the  municipalities  in  order  to  enable  recommendations  con- 
cerning the  distribution  of  proceeds  from  taxes,  duties,  tolls, 
and  fees. 

The  Civil  Service 

During  the  colonial  period,  the  British  built  up  the  elite 
Indian  Civil  Service,  often  referred  to  as  the  "steel  frame"  of 
the  British  Raj.  Nehru  and  other  leaders  of  the  independence 
movement  initially  viewed  the  colonial  civil  service  as  an  instru- 
ment of  foreign  domination,  but  by  1947  they  had  come  to 
appreciate  the  advantages  of  having  a  highly  qualified  institu- 
tionalized administration  in  place,  especially  at  a  time  when 
social  tensions  threatened  national  unity  and  public  order. 

The  constitution  established  the  Indian  Administrative  Ser- 
vice to  replace  the  colonial  Indian  Civil  Service  and  ensure  uni- 
form and  impartial  standards  of  administration  in  selected 
fields,  promote  effective  coordination  in  social  and  economic 
development,  and  encourage  a  national  point  of  view.  In  the 
early  1990s,  this  small  elite  accounted  for  fewer  than  5,000  of 
the  total  17  million  central  government  employees.  Recruits 
appointed  by  the  Union  Public  Service  Commission  are  univer- 
sity graduates  selected  through  a  rigorous  system  of  written  and 
oral  examinations.  In  1988  only  about  150  out  of  a  candidate 
pool  of  approximately  85,000  recruits  received  appointments 
in  the  Indian  Administrative  Service.  Indian  Administrative 
Service  officers  are  primarily  from  the  more  affluent  and  edu- 
cated classes.  However,  efforts  to  recruit  women  and  individu- 
als from  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  have 
enhanced  the  diversity  of  the  civil  service. 

Recruits  are  trained  as  administrative  generalists  at  an  acad- 
emy at  Mussoorie  (in  Uttar  Pradesh).  After  a  period  of  appren- 
ticeship and  probation  in  the  central  and  state  governments, 
an  Indian  Administrative  Service  officer  is  assigned  to  increas- 
ingly more  responsible  positions,  such  as  a  district  collector 
after  six  or  seven  years.  Approximately  70  percent  of  all  officers 
serve  in  state  administrations;  the  rest  serve  in  the  central  gov- 
ernment. 

A  larger  organization,  the  Central  Public  Services,  staffs  a 
broad  variety  of  administrative  bureaus  ranging  from  the 
Indian  Foreign  Service  to  the  Audits  and  Accounts  Service  and 


461 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  Postal  Service.  The  states  (but  not  Delhi  or  the  union  terri- 
tories) have  independent  services  within  their  own  jurisdic- 
tions that  are  regulated  by  local  laws  and  public  service 
commissions.  The  governor  usually  appoints  members  of  the 
state  public  services  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  state 
public  service  commission.  To  a  large  extent,  states  depend 
upon  nationwide  bodies,  such  as  the  Indian  Administrative  Ser- 
vice and  Indian  Police  Service,  to  staff  top  administrative  posts. 

Although  the  elite  public  services  continue  to  command 
great  prestige,  their  social  status  declined  in  the  decades  after 
independence.  In  the  1990s,  India's  most  capable  youths 
increasingly  are  attracted  to  private-sector  employment  where 
salaries  are  substantially  higher.  Public  opinion  of  civil  servants 
has  also  been  lowered  by  popular  perceptions  that  bureaucrats 
are  unresponsive  to  public  needs  and  are  corrupt.  Although 
the  ranks  of  the  civil  service  are  filled  with  many  dedicated 
individuals,  corruption  has  been  a  growing  problem  as  civil  ser- 
vants have  become  subject  to  intense  political  pressures. 

The  Political  Process 

The  decline  of  the  Congress  (I)  since  the  late  1980s  has 
brought  an  end  to  the  dominant  single-party  system  that  had 
long  characterized  India's  politics.  Under  the  old  system,  con- 
flict within  the  Congress  was  often  a  more  important  political 
dynamic  than  was  conflict  between  the  Congress  and  the  oppo- 
sition. The  Congress  had  set  the  political  agenda  and  the  oppo- 
sition responded.  A  new  party  system,  in  which  the  Congress 
(I)  is  merely  one  of  several  major  participants,  was  in  place  by 
1989  (see  fig.  15).  As  often  as  not  in  the  mid-1990s,  the  Con- 
gress (I)  seems  to  respond  to  the  initiatives  of  other  parties 
rather  than  set  its  own  political  agenda. 

Elections 

At  least  once  every  five  years,  India's  Election  Commission 
supervises  one  of  the  largest,  most  complex  exercises  of  collec- 
tive action  in  the  world.  India's  elections  in  the  1990s  involve 
overseeing  an  electorate  of  about  521  million  voters  who  travel 
to  nearly  600,000  polling  stations  to  chose  from  some  8,950 
candidates  representing  roughly  162  parties.  The  elections 
reveal  much  about  Indian  society.  Candidates  span  a  wide  spec- 
trum of  backgrounds,  including  former  royalty,  cinema  super- 
stars, religious  holy  men,  war  heroes,  and  a  growing  number  of 


462 


Government  and  Politics 


farmers.  Campaigns  utilize  communications  technologies  rang- 
ing from  the  latest  video  van  with  two-way  screens  to  the  tradi- 
tional rumor  traveling  by  word  of  mouth.  Increasing  violence 
also  has  come  to  characterize  elections.  In  1991,  some  350  peo- 
ple, including  former  Prime  Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi,  four  other 
parliamentary  candidates,  and  twenty-one  candidates  running 
in  state  legislative  assembly  elections,  were  killed  in  election- 
related  violence. 

Political  Parties 

India's  party  system  is  in  the  throes  of  historic  change.  The 
1989  general  elections  brought  the  era  of  Congress  dominance 
to  an  end.  Even  though  the  Congress  (I)  regained  power  in 
1991,  it  was  no  longer  the  pivot  around  which  the  party  system 
revolved.  Instead,  it  represented  just  one  strategy  for  organiz- 
ing a  political  majority,  and  a  declining  one  at  that.  While  the 
Congress  (I)  was  encountering  growing  difficulties  in  maintain- 
ing its  coalition  of  upper-caste  elites,  Muslims,  Scheduled 
Castes,  and  Scheduled  Tribes,  the  BJP  was  endeavoring  to  orga- 
nize a  new  majority  around  the  appeal  of  Hindu  nationalism. 
The  Janata  Dal  and  the  BSP,  among  others,  were  attempting  to 
fashion  a  new  majority  out  of  the  increasingly  assertive  Back- 
ward Classes,  Dalits,  Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled  Tribes,  and 
religious  minorities. 

The  Congress 

The  Congress  has,  by  any  standards,  remarkable  political 
accomplishments  to  its  credit.  As  the  Indian  National  Con- 
gress, its  guidance  fashioned  a  nation  out  of  an  extraordinarily 
heterogeneous  ensemble  of  peoples.  The  party  has  played  an 
important  role  in  establishing  the  foundations  of  perhaps  the 
most  durable  democratic  political  system  in  the  developing 
world.  As  scholars  Francis  Robinson  and  Paul  R.  Brass  point 
out,  the  Congress  constituted  one  of  the  few  political  organiza- 
tions in  the  annals  of  decolonialization  to  "make  the  transition 
from  being  sole  representative  of  the  nationalist  cause  to  being 
just  one  element  of  a  competitive  party  system." 

The  Congress  dominated  Indian  politics  from  indepen- 
dence until  1967.  Prior  to  1967,  the  Congress  had  never  won 
less  than  73  percent  of  the  seats  in  Parliament.  The  party  won 
every  state  government  election  except  two — most  often  exclu- 
sively, but  also  through  coalitions — and  until  1967  it  never  won 


463 


India:  A  Country  Study 


464 


Government  and  Politics 


less  than  60  percent  of  all  elections  for  seats  in  the  state  legisla- 
tive assemblies. 

There  were  four  factors  that  accounted  for  this  dominance. 
First,  the  party  acquired  a  tremendous  amount  of  good  will  and 
political  capital  from  its  leadership  of  the  nationalist  struggle. 
Party  chiefs  gained  substantial  popular  respect  for  the  years  in 
jail  and  other  deprivations  that  they  personally  endured.  The 
shared  experience  of  the  independence  struggle  fostered  a 
sense  of  cohesion,  which  was  important  in  maintaining  unity  in 
the  face  of  the  party's  internal  pluralism. 

The  second  factor  was  that  the  Congress  was  the  only  party 
with  an  organization  extending  across  the  nation  and  down  to 
the  village  level.  The  party's  federal  structure  was  based  on  a 
system  of  internal  democracy  that  functioned  to  resolve  dis- 
putes among  its  members  and  maintain  party  cohesion.  Inter- 
nal party  elections  also  served  to  legitimate  the  party 
leadership,  train  party  workers  in  the  skills  of  political  competi- 
tion, and  create  channels  of  upward  mobility  that  rewarded  its 
most  capable  members. 

A  third  factor  was  that  the  Congress  achieved  its  position  of 
political  dominance  by  creating  an  organization  that  adjusted 
to  local  circumstances  rather  than  transformed  them,  often 
reaching  the  village  through  local  "big  men"  (bare  admi)  who 
controlled  village  "vote  banks."  These  local  elites,  who  owed 
their  position  to  their  traditional  social  status  and  their  control 
over  land,  formed  factions  that  competed  for  power  within  the 
Congress.  The  internal  party  democracy  and  the  Congress's 
subsequent  electoral  success  ultimately  reinforced  the  local 
power  of  these  traditional  elites  and  enabled  the  party  to  adjust 
to  changes  in  local  balances  of  power.  The  nonideological 
pragmatism  of  local  party  leadership  made  it  possible  to  coopt 
issues  that  contributed  to  opposition  party  success  and  even 
incorporate  successful  opposition  leaders  into  the  party.  Intra- 
party  competition  served  to  channel  information  about  local 
circumstances  up  the  party  hierarchy. 

Fourth,  patronage  was  the  oil  that  lubricated  the  party 
machine.  As  the  state  expanded  its  development  role,  it  accu- 
mulated more  resources  that  could  be  distributed  to  party 
members.  The  growing  pool  of  opportunities  and  resources 
facilitated  the  party's  ability  to  accommodate  conflict  among  its 
members.  The  Congress  enjoyed  the  benefits  of  a  "virtuous 
cycle,"  in  which  its  electoral  success  gave  it  access  to  economic 


465 


Ind i  a :  A  Cou  n  try  St  u  dy 

and  political  resources  that  enabled  the  partv  to  attract  new 

supporters. 

The  halcvon  days  of  what  Indian  political  scientist  Rajni 
Kothari  has  called  "the  Congress  svstem"  ended  with  the  een- 
eral  elections  in  1967.  The  party  lost  seventy-eight  seats  in  the 
Tok  Sabha.  retaining  a  majority  of  onlv  twentv-three  seats.  Even 
more  indicative  of  the  Congress  setback  was  its  loss  of  control 
over  six  of  the  sixteen  state  legislatures  that  held  elections.  The 
proximate  causes  of  the  reversal  included  the  failure  of  the 
monsoons  in  1965  and  1966  and  the  subsequent  hardship 
throughout  northern  and  eastern  India,  and  the  unpopular 
currency  devaluation  in  1966.  However,  profound  changes  in 
India's  polity  also  contributed  to  the  decline  of  the  Congress. 
The  rapid  .growth  of  the  electorate,  which  increased  by  45  per- 
cent from  1952  to  1967.  brought  an  influx  of  new  voters  less 
appreciative  of  the  Congress's  role  in  the  independence  move- 
ment. Moreover,  the  simultaneous  spread  of  democratic  values 
produced  a  political  awakening  that  mobilized  new  groups  and 
created  a  more  pluralistic  constellation  of  political  interests. 
The  development  of  new  and  more-differentiated  identities 
and  patterns  of  political  cleavage  made  it  virtually  impossible 
for  the  Congress  to  contain  the  competition  of  its  members 
within  its  organization.  Dissidence  and  ultimately  defection 
greatlv  weakened  the  Congress's  electoral  performance. 

It  was  in  this  context  that  Indira  Gandhi  asserted  her  inde- 
pendence from  the  leaders  of  the  partv  organization  by 
attempting  to  take  the  partv  in  a  more  populist  direction.  She 
ordered  the  nationalization  of  India's  fourteen  largest  banks  in 
1969..  and  then  she  supported  former  labor  leader  and  Acting 
President  Yarahagiri  Yenkata  Giri's  candidacy  for  president 
despite  the  fact  that  the  partv  organization  had  already  nomi- 
nated the  more  conservative  Xeelam  Sanjiva  Reddv  .After  Giri's 
election,  the  partv  organization  expelled  Indira  Gandhi  from 
the  Congress  and  ordered  the  parliamentary  partv  to  choose  a 
new  prime  minister.  Instead.  226  of  the  291  Congress  members 
of  Parliament  continued  to  support  Indira  Gandhi.  The  Con- 
gress split  into  two  in  1969.  the  new  factions  being  the  Con- 
gress (O) — for  Organisation — and  Mrs.  Gandhi's  Congress 
(R) — for  Requisition.  The  Congress  (R)  continued  in  power 
with  the  support  of  non-Congress  groups,  principally  the  Com- 
munist Partv  of  India  I  CPI )  and  the  Dravida  Munnetra 
Kazhagam  (DMK — Dravidian  Progressive  Federation).

Government  and  Politics 


With  the  Congress  (O)  controlling  most  of  the  party  organi- 
zation, Indira  Gandhi  adopted  a  new  strategy  to  mobilize  popu- 
lar support.  For  the  first  time  ever,  she  ordered  parliamentary 
elections  to  be  held  separately  from  elections  for  the  state  gov- 
ernment. This  delinking  was  designed  to  reduce  the  power  of 
the  Congress  (O)'s  state-level  political  machines  in  national 
elections.  Mrs.  Gandhi  traveled  throughout  the  country,  ener- 
getically campaigning  on  the  slogan  "garibi  hatao"  (eliminate 
poverty),  thereby  bypassing  the  traditional  Congress  networks 
of  political  support.  The  strategy  proved  successful,  and  the 
Congress  (R)  won  a  dramatic  victory.  In  the  1971  elections  for 
the  Lok  Sabha,  the  Congress  (R)  garnered  44  percent  of  the 
vote,  earning  it  352  seats.  The  Congress  (O)  won  only  sixteen 
seats  and  10  percent  of  the  vote.  The  next  year,  after  leading 
India  to  victory  over  Pakistan  in  the  war  for  Bangladesh's  inde- 
pendence, Indira  Gandhi  and  the  Congress  (R)  further  consol- 
idated their  control  over  the  country  by  winning  fourteen  of 
sixteen  state  assembly  elections  and  victories  in  70  percent  of 
all  seats  contested. 

The  public  expected  Indira  Gandhi  to  deliver  on  her  man- 
date to  remove  poverty.  However,  the  country  experienced  a 
severe  drought  in  1971  and  1972,  leading  to  food  shortages, 
and  the  price  of  food  rose  20  percent  in  the  spring  of  1973. 
The  decision  by  the  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting 
Countries  (OPEC)  to  quadruple  oil  prices  in  1973-74  also  led 
to  inflation  and  increased  unemployment.  Jayaprakash  (J.P) 
Narayan,  a  socialist  leader  in  the  preindependence  Indian 
National  Congress  who,  after  1947,  left  to  conduct  social  work 
in  the  Sarvodaya  movement  (sarvodaya  means  uplift  of  all), 
came  out  of  retirement  to  lead  what  eventually  became  widely 
known  as  the  'J.P.  movement."  Under  Narayan's  leadership,  the 
movement  toppled  the  government  of  Gujarat  and  almost 
brought  down  the  government  in  Bihar;  Narayan  advocated  a 
radical  regeneration  of  public  morality  that  he  labelled  "total 
revolution." 

After  the  Allahabad  High  Court  ruled  that  Mrs.  Gandhi  had 
committed  electoral  law  violations  and  Narayan  addressed  a 
massive  demonstration  in  New  Delhi,  at  Indira  Gandhi's 
behest,  the  president  proclaimed  an  Emergency  on  June  25, 
1975.  That  night,  Indira  Gandhi  ordered  the  arrest  of  almost 
all  the  leaders  of  the  opposition,  including  dissidents  within 
the  Congress.  In  all,  more  than  110,000  persons  were  detained 
without  trial  during  the  Emergency.

Indira  Gandhi's  rule  during  the  Emergency  alienated  her 
popular  support.  After  postponing  elections  for  a  year  follow- 
ing the  expiration  of  the  five-year  term  of  the  Lok  Sabha,  she 
called  for  new  elections  in  March  1977.  The  major  opposition 
party  leaders,  many  of  whom  had  developed  a  rapport  while 
they  were  imprisoned  together  under  the  Emergency  regime, 
united  under  the  banner  of  the  Janata  Party.  By  framing  the 
key  issue  of  the  election  as  "democracy  versus  dictatorship,"  the 
Janata  Party — the  largest  opposition  party — appealed  to  the 
public's  democratic  values  to  rout  the  Congress  (R).  The  vote 
share  of  the  Congress  (R)  dropped  to  34.5  percent,  and  the 
number  of  its  seats  in  Parliament  plunged  from  352  to  154. 
Indira  Gandhi  lost  her  seat. 

The  inability  of  Janata  Party  factions  to  agree  proved  the 
party's  undoing.  Indira  Gandhi  returned  to  win  the  January 
1980  elections  after  forming  a  new  party,  the  Congress  (I — for 
Indira),  in  1978. 

The  Congress  (I)  largely  succeeded  in  reconstructing  the 
traditional  Congress  electoral  support  base  of  Brahmans  (see 
Glossary),  Muslims,  Scheduled  Castes,  and  Scheduled  Tribes 
that  had  kept  Congress  in  power  in  New  Delhi  during  the  three 
decades  prior  to  1977.  The  Congress  (I)'s  share  of  the  vote 
increased  by  8.2  percent  to  42.7  percent  of  the  total  vote,  and 
its  number  of  seats  in  the  Lok  Sabha  grew  to  353,  a  majority  of 
about  two-thirds.  This  success  approximated  the  levels  of  sup- 
port of  the  Congress  dominance  from  1947  to  1967.  Yet,  as 
political  scientist  Myron  Weiner  observed,  "The  Congress  party 
that  won  in  1980  was  not  the  Congress  party  that  had  governed 
India  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  or  even  the  early  1970s.  The  party 
was  organizationally  weak  and  the  electoral  victory  was  prima- 
rily Mrs.  Gandhi's  rather  than  the  party's."  As  a  consequence, 
the  Congress's  appeal  to  its  supporters  was  much  more  tenuous 
than  it  had  been  in  previous  decades. 

Indira  Gandhi's  dependence  on  her  flamboyant  son  Sanjay 
and,  after  his  accidental  death  in  1980,  on  her  more  reserved 
son  Rajiv  gives  testimony  to  the  personalization  and  centraliza- 
tion of  power  within  the  Congress  (I).  Having  developed  a 
means  to  mobilize  support  without  a  party  organization,  she 
paid  little  attention  to  maintaining  that  support.  Rather  than 
allowing  intraparty  elections  to  resolve  conflicts  and  select 
party  leaders,  Indira  Gandhi  preferred  to  fill  party  posts  herself 
with  those  loyal  to  her.  As  a  result,  party  leaders  at  the  state 
level  lost  their  legitimacy  among  the  rank  and  file  because  their

positions  depended  on  the  whims  of  Indira  Gandhi  rather  than 
on  the  extent  of  their  popular  support.  In  addition,  centraliza- 
tion and  the  demise  of  democracy  within  the  party  disrupted 
the  flow  of  information  about  local  circumstances  to  party  lead- 
ers and  curtailed  the  ability  of  the  Congress  (I)  to  adjust  to 
social  change  and  incorporate  new  leaders. 

When  Rajiv  Gandhi  took  control  after  his  mother's  assassina- 
tion in  November  1984,  he  attempted  to  breathe  new  life  into 
the  Congress  (I)  organization.  However,  the  massive  electoral 
victory  that  the  Congress  (I)  scored  under  Rajiv's  leadership 
just  two  months  after  his  mother's  assassination  gave  him  nei- 
ther the  skill  nor  the  authority  to  succeed  in  this  endeavor. 
Rajiv  did,  however,  attempt  to  remove  the  more  unsavory  ele- 
ments within  the  party  organization.  He  denied  nominations  to 
one-third  of  the  incumbent  members  of  Parliament  during  the 
1984  Lok  Sabha  campaign,  and  he  refused  to  nominate  two  of 
every  five  incumbents  in  the  state  legislative  assembly  elections 
held  in  March  1985. 

Another  of  Rajiv's  early  successes  was  the  passage  of  the  Anti- 
Defection  Bill  in  January  1985  in  an  effort  to  end  the  bribery 
that  lured  legislators  to  cross  partisan  lines.  Speaking  at  the 
Indian  National  Congress  centenary  celebrations  in  Bombay 


469 


India:  A  Country  Study 

(officially  called  Mumbai  as  of  1995),  Rajiv  launched  a  vitriolic 
attack  on  the  "culture  of  corruption"  that  had  become  so  per- 
vasive in  the  Congress  (I).  However,  the  old  guard  showed  little 
enthusiasm  for  reform.  As  time  passed,  Rajiv's  position  was 
weakened  by  the  losses  that  the  party  suffered  in  a  series  of 
state  assembly  elections  and  by  his  government's  involvement 
in  corruption  scandals.  Ultimately,  Rajiv  was  unable  to  over- 
come the  resistance  within  the  party  to  internal  elections  and 
reforms.  Ironically,  as  Rajiv's  position  within  the  party  weak- 
ened, he  turned  for  advice  to  many  of  the  wheelers  and  dealers 
of  his  mother's  regime  whom  he  had  previously  banished. 

The  frustration  of  Rajiv  Gandhi's  promising  early  initiatives 
meant  that  the  Congress  (I)  had  no  issues  on  which  to  cam- 
paign as  the  end  of  his  five-year  term  approached.  On  May  15, 
1989,  just  months  before  its  term  was  to  expire,  the  Congress 
(I)  introduced  amendments  that  proposed  to  decentralize  gov- 
ernment authority  to  panchayat  and  municipal  government 
institutions.  Opposition  parties,  many  of  whom  were  on  record 
as  favoring  decentralization  of  government  power,  vehemently 
resisted  the  Congress  (I)  initiative.  They  charged  that  the  ini- 
tiative did  not  truly  decentralize  power  but  instead  enabled  the 
central  government  to  circumvent  state  governments  (many  of 
which  were  controlled  by  the  opposition)  by  transferring 
authority  from  state  to  local  government  and  strengthening 
the  links  between  central  and  local  governments.  After  the 
Congress  (I)  failed  to  win  the  two-thirds  vote  required  to  pass 
the  legislation  in  the  Rajya  Sabha  on  October  13,  1989,  it  called 
for  new  parliamentary  elections  and  made  "jana  shakti"  (power 
to  the  people)  its  main  campaign  slogan. 

The  Congress  (I)  retained  formidable  campaign  advantages 
over  the  opposition.  The  October  17,  1989,  announcement  of 
elections  took  the  opposition  parties  by  surprise  and  gave  them 
little  time  to  form  electoral  alliances.  The  Congress  (I)  also  bla- 
tantly used  the  government-controlled  television  and  radio  to 
promote  Rajiv  Gandhi.  In  addition,  the  Congress  (I)  campaign 
once  again  enjoyed  vastly  superior  financing.  It  distributed 
some  100,000  posters  and  15,000  banners  to  each  of  its  510 
candidates.  It  provided  every  candidate  with  six  or  seven  vehi- 
cles, and  it  commissioned  advertising  agencies  to  make  a  total 
of  ten  video  films  to  promote  its  campaign. 

The  results  of  the  1989  elections  were  more  of  a  rebuff  to 
the  Congress  (I)  than  a  mandate  for  the  opposition.  Although 
the  Congress  (I)  remained  the  largest  party  in  Parliament  with 


470 


Government  and  Politics 


197  seats,  it  was  unable  to  form  a  government.  Instead,  the  Ja- 
nata Dal,  which  had  143  seats,  united  with  its  National  Front 
allies  to  form  a  minority  government  precariously  dependent 
on  the  support  of  the  BJP  (eighty-five  seats)  and  the  commu- 
nist parties  (forty-five  seats).  Although  the  Congress  (I)  lost 
more  than  50  percent  of  its  seats  in  Parliament,  its  share  of  the 
vote  dropped  only  from  48.1  percent  to  39.5  percent  of  the 
vote.  The  Congress  (I)  share  of  the  vote  was  still  more  than 
double  that  of  the  next  largest  party,  the  Janata  Dal,  which 
received  support  from  17.8  percent  of  the  electorate.  More 
grave  for  the  long-term  future  of  the  Congress  (I)  was  the  ero- 
sion of  vital  elements  of  the  traditional  coalition  of  support  for 
the  Congress  (I)  in  North  India.  Alienated  by  the  Congress 
(I)'s  cultivation  of  Hindu  activists,  Muslims  defected  to  the  Jan- 
ata Dal  in  large  numbers.  The  Congress  (I)  simultaneously  lost 
a  substantial  share  of  Scheduled  Caste  voters  to  the  BSP  in 
Haryana,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  and  to  the 
Indian  People's  Front  in  Bihar. 

To  offset  these  losses,  the  Congress  (I)  attempted  to  play  a 
"Hindu  card."  On  August  14,  1989,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled 
that  no  parties  or  groups  could  disturb  the  status  quo  of  the 
Babri  Masjid,  a  sixteenth-century  mosque  in  Ayodhya,  Uttar 
Pradesh.  The  mosque  was  controversial  because  Hindu  nation- 
alists claim  it  was  on  the  site  of  the  birthplace  of  the  Hindu  god 
Ram  and  that,  as  such,  the  use  by  Muslims  was  sacrilegious  (see 
Vishnu,  ch.  3).  Despite  the  court  ruling,  in  September  the  Con- 
gress (I)  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Vishwa  Hindu 
Parishad  (VHP — World  Hindu  Council),  a  conservative  reli- 
gious organization  with  close  ties  to  Hindu  nationalists,  to 
allow  the  VHP  to  proceed  with  a  ceremony  to  lay  the  founda- 
tion for  the  Ramjanmabhumi  (birthplace  of  Ram)  Temple. 
(The  VHP  had  been  working  toward  this  goal  since  1984.)  In 
return,  the  Congress  (I)  secured  the  VHP's  agreement  to  per- 
form the  ceremony  on  property  adjacent  to  the  Babri  Masjid 
that  was  not  in  dispute.  By  reaching  this  agreement,  the  Con- 
gress (I)  attempted  to  appeal  to  Hindu  activists  while  retaining 
Muslim  support.  Rajiv  Gandhi's  decision  to  kick  off  his  cam- 
paign less  than  six  kilometers  from  the  Babri  Masjid  and  his 
appeal  to  voters  that  they  vote  for  the  Congress  (I)  if  they 
wished  to  bring  about  "Ram  Rajya"  (the  rule  of  Ram)  were 
other  elements  of  the  Congress  (I)'s  strategy  to  attract  the 
Hindu  vote  (see  Political  Issues,  this  ch.) 


471 


India:  A  Country  Study 


The  1991  elections  returned  the  Congress  (I)  to  power  but 
did  not  reverse  important  trends  in  the  party's  decline.  The 
Congress  (I)  won  227  seats,  up  from  197  in  1989,  but  its  share 
of  the  vote  dropped  from  39.5  percent  in  1989  to  37.6  percent. 
Greater  division  within  the  opposition  rather  than  growing 
popularity  of  the  Congress  (I)  was  the  key  element  in  the 
party's  securing  an  increased  number  of  seats.  Also  troubling 
was  the  further  decline  of  the  Congress  (I)  in  heavily  popu- 
lated Bihar  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  which  together  account  for 
more  than  25  percent  of  all  seats  in  Parliament.  In  Uttar 
Pradesh,  the  number  of  seats  that  the  Congress  (I)  was  able  to 
win  went  down  from  fifteen  to  two,  and  its  share  of  the  vote 
dropped  from  32  percent  to  20  percent.  In  Bihar  the  seats  won 
by  the  Congress  (I)  fell  from  four  to  one,  and  the  Congress  (I) 
share  of  the  vote  was  reduced  from  28  percent  to  22  percent. 
The  Congress  (I)  problems  in  these  states,  which  until  1989 
had  been  bastions  of  its  strength,  were  reinforced  by  the  party's 
poor  showing  in  the  November  1993  state  elections.  These 
elections  were  characterized  by  the  further  disintegration  of 
the  traditional  Congress  coalition,  with  Brahmans  and  other 
upper  castes  defecting  to  the  BJP  and  Scheduled  Castes  and 
Muslims  defecting  to  the  Janata  Dal,  the  Samajwadi  Party 
(Socialist  Party),  and  the  BSP. 

Strong  evidence  indicates  that  the  Congress  (I)  would  have 
fared  significantly  worse  had  it  not  been  for  the  assassination  of 
Rajiv  Gandhi  in  the  middle  of  the  elections.  A  wave  of  sympathy 
similar  to  that  which  helped  elect  Rajiv  after  the  assassination 
of  his  mother  increased  the  Congress  (I)  support.  In  the  round 
of  voting  that  took  place  before  Rajiv's  death,  the  Congress  (I) 
won  only  26  percent  of  the  seats  and  33  percent  of  the  vote.  In 
the  votes  that  occurred  after  Rajiv's  death,  the  Congress  (I) 
won  58  percent  of  the  seats  and  40  percent  of  the  popular  vote. 
It  may  also  be  that  Rajiv's  demise  ended  the  "anti-Congressism" 
that  had  pervaded  the  political  system  as  a  result  of  his  family's 
dynastic  domination  of  Indian  politics  through  its  control  over 
the  Congress. 

Rajiv  Gandhi  was  assassinated  by  a  Tamil  suicide  bomber 
affiliated  with  the  Sri  Lankan  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil  Eelam 
(LTTE)  during  a  political  campaign  in  May  1991.  Only  after  his 
assassination  did  hope  for  reforming  the  Congress  (I)  reap- 
pear. The  end  of  three  generations  of  Nehru-Gandhi  family 
leadership  left  Rajiv's  coterie  of  political  manipulators  in 
search  of  a  new  kingpin.  The  bankruptcy  of  the  Congress  (I) 


472 


Government  and  Politics 


leadership  was  highlighted  by  the  fact  that  they  initially  turned 
to  Sonia  Gandhi,  Rajiv's  Italian-born  wife,  to  lead  the  party. 
Sonia's  primary  qualification  was  that  she  was  Rajiv's  widow. 
She  had  never  held  elected  office  and,  during  her  early  years  in 
India,  she  had  expressed  great  disdain  for  political  life.  How- 
ever, although  she  did  not  assume  a  leadership  role,  she  contin- 
ued to  be  seen  as  a  "kingmaker"  in  the  Congress  (I).  Her  advice 
was  sought  after,  and  she  was  called  on  to  lead  the  party  in  the 
mid-1990s.  An  unusual  public  speech  by  Sonia  Gandhi  criticiz- 
ing the  government  of  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao  in  August  1995  fur- 
ther fueled  speculation  that  she  was  a  candidate  for  political 
leadership. 

Sonia  Gandhi's  refusal  in  1991  to  become  president  of  the 
Congress  (I)  led  the  mantle  of  party  leadership  to  fall  on  Rao. 
Rao  was  a  septuagenarian  former  professor  who  had  retired 
from  politics  before  the  1991  elections  .after  undergoing  heart- 
bypass  surgery.  Rao  had  a  conciliatory  demeanor  and  was 
acceptable  to  the  party's  contending  factions.  Paradoxically, 
the  precariously  positioned  Rao  was  able  to  take  more  substan- 
tial steps  in  the  direction  of  party  reform  than  his  predecessors. 
First,  Rao  had  to  demonstrate  that  he  could  mobilize  popular 
support  for  himself  and  the  party,  a  vital  currency  of  power  for 
any  Congress  (I)  leader.  He  did  so  in  the  November  15,  1991, 
by-elections  by  winning  his  own  seat  in  Andhra  Pradesh  unop- 
posed and  leading  the  party  to  victory  in  a  total  of  eight  of  the 
fifteen  parliamentary  by-elections.  By  the  end  of  1991,  Rao  had 
succeeded  in  initiating  the  first  intraparty  elections  in  the  Con- 
gress in  almost  twenty  years.  Although  there  was  widespread 
manipulation  by  local  party  bosses,  the  elections  enhanced  the 
legitimacy  of  party  leaders  and  held  forth  the  prospect  of  a 
rejuvenated  party  organization.  The  process  culminated  in 
April  1992  at  the  All-India  Congress  (I)  Committee  at  Tirupati, 
Andhra  Pradesh,  where  elections  were  held  for  the  ten  vacant 
seats  in  the  Congress  Working  Committee. 

In  the  wake  of  the  Tirupati  session,  Rao  became  less  inter- 
ested in  promoting  party  democracy  and  more  concerned  with 
consolidating  his  own  position.  The  change  was  especially 
apparent  in  the  1993  All-India  Congress  (I)  Committee  session 
at  Surajkund  (in  Haryana),  where  Rao's  supporters  lavishly 
praised  the  prime  minister  and  coercively  silenced  his  oppo- 
nents. However,  Rao's  image  was  damaged  in  July  1993  after 
Harshad  Mehta,  a  stockbroker  under  indictment  for  allegedly 
playing  a  leading  role  in  a  US$2  billion  stock  scam  in  1992, 


473 


India:  A  Country  Study 

accused  Rao  of  personally  accepting  a  bribe  that  he  had  deliv- 
ered on  November  4,  1991.  The  extent  of  the  press  coverage  of 
the  charges  and  their  apparent  credibility  among  the  public 
was  evidence  of  the  pervasive  public  cynicism  toward  politi- 
cians. Rao's  stock  in  the  party  and  Congress  (I)'s  position 
within  Parliament  were  greatly  weakened.  On  July  28,  1993,  his 
government  barely  survived  a  no-confidence  motion  in  the  Lok 
Sabha.  Rao's  position  was  temporarily  strengthened  at  the  end 
of  1993  when  he  was  able  to  cobble  together  a  parliamentary 
majority.  However,  support  for  Rao  and  the  Congress  (I) 
declined  again  in  1994.  The  party  was  rocked  by  a  scandal  relat- 
ing to  the  procurement  of  sugar  stocks  that  cost  the  govern- 
ment an  estimated  Rs6.5  billion  (US$210  million;  for  value  of 
the  rupee — see  Glossary)  and  by  losses  in  legislative  assembly 
elections  in  Andhra  Pradesh — Rao's  home  state,  where  he  per- 
sonally took  control  over  the  campaign — and  Karnataka.  The 
Congress  (I)  again  lost  in  three  of  four  major  states  in  elecdons 
held  in  the  spring  of  1995.  The  political  fallout  in  New  Delhi 
was  an  increase  in  dissident  activity  within  the  Congress  (I)  led 
by  former  cabinet  members  Narain  Dutt  Tiwari  and  Arjun 
Singh  and  other  Rao  rivals  who  sought  to  split  the  Congress 
and  form  a  new  party. 

Opposition  Parties 

Opposition  to  the  Congress  has  always  been  fragmented. 
Opposition  parties  range  from  Hindu  nationalist  parties  such 
as  the  BJP  on  the  right  to  communist  parties  on  the  left  (see 
table  33,  Appendix).  The  divisiveness  of  the  opposition,  com- 
bined with  the  "first-past-the-post"  electoral  system,  has  enabled 
the  Congress  to  dominate  Indian  politics  without  ever  winning 
a  majority  of  the  vote  from  the  national  electorate.  The  extent 
of  electoral  alliances  among  the  opposition  is  an  important 
predictor  of  its  ability  to  win  seats  in  Parliament.  The  first  two 
instances  when  the  opposition  succeeded  in  forming  a  govern- 
ment at  the  center  occurred  after  it  united  under  the  Janata 
Party  banner  in  1977  and  after  the  formation  of  the  Janata  Dal 
and  the  National  Front  in  1988.  In  each  of  these  cases,  the 
unity  that  was  facilitated  by  anti-Congress  sentiment  prior  to 
the  elections  collapsed  in  the  face  of  rivalry  and  ambition  once 
the  opposition  came  into  power. 

The  Rise  and  Decline  of  "Janata  Politics" 

Prior  to  1967,  the  opposition  was  divided  into  an  array  of 


474

small  parties.  While  the  Congress  garnered  between  45  percent 
and  48  percent  of  the  vote,  no  opposition  party  gained  as  much 
as  11  percent,  and  during  the  entire  period,  only  two  parties 
won  10  percent.  Furthermore,  in  each  election,  independent 
candidates  won  between  12  percent  and  20  percent  of  the  vote. 

The  opposition's  first  significant  attempt  to  achieve  electoral 
unity  occurred  during  the  1967  elections  when  opposition 
party  alliances  won  control  of  their  state  governments  in  Bihar, 
Kerala,  Orissa,  Punjab,  and  West  Bengal.  In  Rajasthan  an  oppo- 
sition coalition  prevented  the  Congress  from  winning  a  major- 
ity in  the  state  legislature  and  forced  it  to  recruit  independents 
to  form  a  government.  The  Congress  electoral  debacle  encour- 
aged even  more  dissidence  within  the  party,  and  in  a  matter  of 
weeks  after  the  elections,  defections  brought  down  Congress 
governments  in  Haryana,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar  Pradesh. 


475 


India:  A  Country  Study 

By  July  1967,  state  governments  of  two-thirds  of  the  country 
were  under  opposition  rule.  However,  opposition  rule  in  many 
cases  was  short-lived.  The  aftermath  of  the  1967  elections  initi- 
ated a  climate  of  politics  by  defection  in  which  the  Congress, 
and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  opposition,  attempted  to  overthrow 
governments  by  winning  over  their  state  legislators  with  prom- 
ises of  greater  political  power  and  outright  bribes.  Needless  to 
say,  this  period  seriously  undermined  the  ability  of  most  parties 
to  discipline  their  members.  The  increase  in  opposition-ruled 
state  governments  after  1967  also  prompted  the  Congress  to 
use  President's  Rule  to  dismiss  opposition-led  state  govern- 
ments with  increasing  frequency  (see  Emergency  Provisions 
and  Authoritarian  Powers,  this  ch.). 

Although  the  centrist  and  right-wing  opposition  formed  a 
"grand  alliance"  during  the  1971  parliamentary  elections,  it 
was  not  until  the  general  elections  of  1977  that  opposition 
efforts  culminated  in  electoral  success  at  the  national  level. 
Imprisoned  together  under  the  authoritarian  measures  of  the 
Emergency,  India's  senior  opposition  leaders  found  their  per- 
sonal animosity  toward  Indira  Gandhi  and  the  Congress  to  be  a 
powerful  motivation  to  overcome  their  division  and  rivalry.  In 
January  1977,  opposition  parties  reactivated  a  pre-Emergency 
multiparty  front,  campaigned  under  the  banner  of  the  Janata 
Party,  and  won  a  dramatic  electoral  victory  in  March  1977.  The 
Janata  Party  was  made  up  of  the  Congress  (O),  thejana  Sangh, 
the  Bharatiya  Lok  Dal  (Indian  People  Party),  the  Samajwadi 
Party  (Socialist  Party),  a  handful  of  imprisoned  Congress  dissi- 
dents, and  the  Congress  for  Democracy — a  group  led  by  Sched- 
uled Caste  leader  Jagjivan  Ram  that  had  splintered  off  from  the 
Congress  during  the  election  campaign. 

Despite  the  diversity  of  this  assemblage  of  parties  and  the  dif- 
ferent social  strata  that  they  represented,  members  of  the  Ja- 
nata Party  achieved  surprising  ideological  and  programmatic 
consensus  by  passing  a  program  stressing  decentralization, 
development  of  rural  industries,  and  employment  opportuni- 
ties. It  was  not  ideology,  but  rather  an  inability  to  consolidate 
partisan  organizations  and  political  rivalry  among  the  leader- 
ship that  led  to  the  demise  of  the  Janata  government  in  1979. 
The  Janata's  three  most  senior  leaders — Morarji  Desai,  Charan 
Singh,  and  Jagjivan  Ram — each  aspired  to  be  prime  minister. 
The  rivalry  continued  during  Desai's  tenure  (March  1977-July 
1979).  Desai,  Charan  Singh,  and  Ram  continually  conspired  to 
discredit  each  other.  Their  connivances  ultimately  discredited

Government  and  Politics 


the  Janata  Party  and  allowed  the  Congress  (I)  to  return  to 
power  in  1980. 

Just  as  key  defections  from  the  Congress  were  essential  to  the 
Janata  electoral  success  in  1977,  so  too  did  V.P.  Singh's  defec- 
tion from  the  Congress  (I)  in  1987  enable  opposition  factions 
from  the  Janata  Party  and  Bharatiya  Lok  Dal  to  unite  the  Janata 
Dal  in  1988.  Regional  parties,  such  as  the  Telugu  Desam  Party 
(Telugu  National  Party),  the  DMK,  and  the  Asom  Gana  Pa- 
rishad  (AGP — Assam  People's  Assembly),  together  formed  the 
National  Front,  led  by  Janata  Dal,  which  defeated  Rajiv  Gan- 
dhi's Congress  (I)  in  the  1989  parliamentary  elections.  With 
V.P.  Singh  as  prime  minister,  the  National  Front  government 
earned  the  appellation  of  "the  crutch  government"  because  it 
depended  on  the  support  of  the  Communist  Party  of  India 
(Marxist — CPI  (M))  on  its  left  and  the  BJP  on  the  right. 

On  August  7,  1990,  V.P.  Singh  suddenly  announced  that  his 
government  would  implement  the  recommendations  of  the 
Mandal  Commission  (see  Glossary)  to  reserve  27  percent  of 
central  government  jobs  for  the  Backward  Classes,  defined  to 
include  around  52  percent  of  the  population.  Although  Singh's 
Janata  Dal  had  pledged  to  implement  the  Mandal  Commission 
recommendations  as  part  of  its  election  manifesto,  his 
announcement  led  to  riots  throughout  North  India.  Some  sev- 
enty-five upper-caste  youths  died  after  resorting  to  self-immola- 
tion to  dramatize  their  opposition,  and  almost  200  others  were 
killed  in  clashes  with  the  police. 

BJP  president  Lai  Kishan  (L.K.)  Advani  announced  that  he 
would  traverse  the  country  on  a  pilgrimage  to  Ayodhya  where 
he  would  lead  Hindu  activists  in  the  construction  of  the  Ram- 
janmabhumi  Temple  on  the  site  of  the  Babri  Masjid.  As  the  pil- 
grimage progressed,  riots  between  Hindus  and  Muslims  broke 
out  throughout  the  country.  The  National  Front  government 
decided  to  end  the  agitation,  and  Janata  Dal  chief  minister  of 
Bihar,  Laloo  Prasad  Yadav,  arrested  Advani  on  October  23, 
1990.  On  October  30,  religious  militants  attempted  to  storm 
the  Babri  Masjid  despite  a  massive  military  presence,  and  as 
many  as  twenty-six  activists  were  killed.  The  BJP's  withdrawal  of 
support  for  the  National  Front  government  proved  fatal,  and 
V.P.  Singh  lost  a  parliamentary  vote  of  confidence  on  Novem- 
ber 7,  1990. 

Two  days  before  the  vote,  Chandra  Shekhar,  an  ambitious 
Janata  Dal  rival  who  had  been  kept  out  of  the  National  Front 
government,  joined  with  Devi  Lai,  a  former  deputy  prime  min-

ister  under  V.P.  Singh,  to  form  the  Samajwadi  Janata  Party — 
Samajwadi  meaning  socialist — with  a  total  of  sixty  Lok  Sabha 
members.  The  day  after  the  collapse  of  the  National  Front  gov- 
ernment, Chandra  Shekhar  informed  the  president  that  by 
gaining  the  backing  of  the  Congress  (I)  and  its  electoral  allies 
he  enjoyed  the  support  of  280  members  of  the  Lok  Sabha,  and 
he  demanded  the  right  to  constitute  a  new  government.  Even 
though  his  rump  party  accounted  for  only  one-ninth  of  the 
members  of  the  Lok  Sabha,  Chandra  Shekhar  succeeded  in 
forming  a  new  minority  government  and  becoming  prime  min- 
ister (with  Devi  Lai  as  deputy  prime  minister) .  However,  Chan- 
dra Shekhar's  government  fell  less  than  four  months  later,  after 
the  Congress  (I)  withdrew  its  support. 

The  Janata  Dal  and  the  Samajwadi  Janata  Party  declined 
after  the  fall  of  the  Chandra  Shekhar  government.  In  the  May- 
June  1991  parliamentary  elections,  their  share  of  the  vote 
dropped  from  17.8  percent  to  15.1  percent,  and  the  number  of 
seats  in  Parliament  that  they  won  fell  from  142  to  sixty-one. 
The  parties  were  able  to  win  seats  only  in  Bihar,  Orissa,  and 
Uttar  Pradesh.  The  factional  rivalry  and  ineffectiveness  that 
impeded  the  National  Front  government's  efforts  to  provide 
effective  government  tarnished  the  Janata  Dal  image.  In  the 
absence  of  strong  national  leadership,  the  party  was  rendered  a 
confederation  of  ambitious  regional  leaders  whose  rivalry  pre- 
vented the  establishment  of  a  united  party  organization.  The 
Janata  Dai's  persistent  backing  of  the  Mandal  Commission  rec- 
ommendations made  the  party  highly  unpopular  among  high- 
caste  people  in  the  middle  and  upper  classes,  creating  fund- 
raising  difficulties.  Although  the  Janata  Dal  won  state  elections 
in  Karnataka  in  1994  and  Bihar  in  the  spring  of  1995,  its  poor 
showing  in  most  other  states  gave  the  impression  that  its  sup- 
port was  receding  to  a  few  regional  bastions. 

The  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  and  the  Rise  of  Hindu  Nationalism 

The  BJP  is  unique  among  India's  political  parties  in  that  nei- 
ther it  nor  its  political  predecessors  were  ever  associated  with 
the  Congress.  Instead,  it  grew  out  of  an  alternative  nationalist 
organization — the  Rashtriya  Swayamsevak  Sangh  (RSS — 
National  Volunteer  Organisation).  The  BJP  still  is  affiliated 
with  the  network  of  organizations  popularly  referred  to  as  the 
RSS  family.  The  RSS  was  founded  in  1925  by  Keshav  Baliram 
Hedgewar.  Until  1928  a  member  of  the  Congress  with  radical 
nationalist  political  leanings,  Hedgewar  had  grown  increasingly 


478 


Government  and  Politics 


disenchanted  with  the  leadership  of  Mahatma  Gandhi. 
Hedgewar  was  particularly  critical  of  Gandhi's  emphasis  on 
nonviolence  and  civil  disobedience,  which  he  felt  discouraged 
the  forceful  political  action  necessary  to  gain  independence. 
He  established  the  RSS  as  an  organization  that  would  provide 
training  in  martial  arts  and  spiritual  matters  to  rejuvenate  the 
spiritual  life  of  the  Hindu  community  and  build  its  unity. 

Hedgewar  and  his  successor,  M.S.  Golwalkar,  scrupulously 
endeavored  to  define  the  RSS's  identity  as  a  cultural  organiza- 
tion that  was  not  directly  involved  in  politics.  However,  its  rap- 
idly growing  membership  and  the  paramilitary-like  uniforms 
and  discipline  of  its  activists  made  the  political  potential  of  the 
RSS  apparent  to  everyone  on  the  political  scene.  There  was 
considerable  sentiment  within  the  Congress  that  RSS  members 
should  be  permitted  to  join,  and,  in  fact,  on  October  7,  1947, 
the  Congress  Working  Committee  voted  to  allow  in  RSS  mem- 
bers. But  in  November  1947,  the  Congress  passed  a  rule  requir- 
ing RSS  members  to  give  up  their  affiliation  before  joining. 
The  RSS  was  banned  in  1948  after  Nathuram  Godse,  a  former 
RSS  member,  assassinated  Mahatma  Gandhi.  The  ban  was 
lifted  in  1949  only  after  the  RSS  drafted  an  organizational  con- 
stitution that  was  acceptable  to  the  government.  Intensely  loyal 
RSS  members  refused  to  give  up  their  affiliation  to  join  the 
Congress  and,  instead,  channeled  their  political  energies  to  the 
Jana  Sangh  (People's  Union)  after  its  founding  in  1951. 

The  Jana  Sangh  grew  slowly  during  the  1950s  and  1960s, 
despite  the  efforts  of  RSS  members,  who  quickly  took  control 
of  the  party's  organization.  Although  the  Jana  Sangh  suc- 
ceeded in  displacing  the  Hindu  Mahasabha  (a  communal  party 
established  in  1914  as  a  counter  to  Muslim  separatists)  as  the 
preeminent  party  of  Hindu  activists  in  the  Indian  political  sys- 
tem, it  failed  to  develop  into  a  major  rival  to  the  Congress. 
According  to  political  scientist  Bruce  Graham,  this  failure 
occurred  because  of  the  Jana  Sangh's  inability  "to  transcend 
the  limitations  of  its  origins,"  in  particular,  its  identification 
with  the  Hindi-speaking,  northern  heartland  and  its  Brahmani- 
cal  interpretation  of  Hinduism  rather  than  the  more  inclusive 
and  syncretic  values  of  popular  Hinduism.  However,  the  experi- 
ence of  the  Jana  Sangh  during  the  1970s,  especially  its  increas- 
ing resort  to  populism  and  agitational  tactics,  provided 
essential  ingredients  for  the  success  of  the  BJP  in  the  1980s. 

In  1977  the  Jana  Sangh  joined  the  Janata  Party,  which 
defeated  Indira  Gandhi  and  the  Congress  (I)  in  parliamentary 


479

elections  and  formed  a  government  through  the  end  of  1979. 
The  rapid  expansion  of  the  RSS  under  Janata  rule  soon 
brought  calls  for  all  members  of  the  RSS  family  to  merge  with 
Janata  Party  affiliates.  Ultimately,  intraparty  tensions  impelled 
those  affiliated  with  the  Jana  Sangh  to  leave  the  Janata  Party 
and  establish  a  new  party — the  BJP. 

The  BJP  was  formed  in  April  1980,  under  the  leadership  of 
Atal  Behari  Vajpayee.  Although  the  party  welcomed  members 
of  the  RSS,  the  BJP's  effort  to  draw  from  the  legacies  of  the  Ja- 
nata Party  as  well  as  that  of  the  Jana  Sangh  were  suggested  by  its 
new  name,  its  choice  of  a  green  and  saffron  flag  similar  to  that 
of  the  Janata  Party  rather  than  the  solid  saffron  flag  of  the  old 
Jana  Sangh,  its  adoption  of  a  decentralized  organizational 
structure  along  the  lines  of  the  Janata  Party  rather  than  the 
more  centralized  model  of  the  Jana  Sangh,  and  its  inclusion  in 
its  working  committee  of  several  non-Jana  Sangh  individuals, 
including  Sikandar  Bakht — a  Muslim.  The  invocation  of  Gan- 
dhian  socialism  as  one  of  the  guiding  principles  of  the  BJP 
rather  than  the  doctrine  of  "integral  humanism"  associated 
with  the  Jana  Sangh  was  another  indication  of  the  impact  of 
the  party  members'  experience  in  the  Janata  Party  and  "J. P. 
movement." 

The  new  synthesis,  however,  failed  to  achieve  political  suc- 
cess. In  1984  the  BJP  won  only  two  seats  in  the  parliamentary 
elections.  In  the  wake  of  the  1984  elections,  the  BJP  shifted 
course.  Advani  replaced  Vajpayee  as  party  president.  Under 
Advani's  leadership,  the  BJP  appealed  to  Hindu  activists  by  crit- 
icizing measures  it  construed  as  pandering  to  minorities  and 
advocating  the  repeal  of  the  special  status  given  to  the  Muslim 
majority  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  Simultaneously,  it  coop- 
erated more  closely  with  other  RSS  affiliates,  particularly  the 
VHP.  During  the  1980s,  the  BJP-VHP  combine  developed  into  a 
dynamic  political  force  through  its  brilliant  use  of  religious 
symbolism  to  rouse  the  passions  of  the  public.  The  BJP  and 
VHP  attained  national  prominence  through  their  campaign  to 
convert  back  to  Hinduism  members  of  the  Scheduled  Castes 
who  had  converted  to  Islam.  The  VHP  also  agitated  to  reclaim 
the  Babri  Masjid  site  and  encouraged  villagers  throughout  the 
country  to  hold  religious  ceremonies  to  consecrate  bricks 
made  out  of  their  own  clay  and  send  them  to  be  used  in  the 
construction  of  the  Ramjanmabhumi  Temple  in  Ayodhya. 

In  the  general  elections  of  1991,  the  BJP  expanded  its  sup- 
port more  than  did  any  other  party.  Its  number  of  seats  in  the 


480 


Government  and  Politics 


Lok  Sabha  increased  from  eighty-five  to  119,  and  its  vote  share 
grew  from  11.4  percent  to  21.0  percent.  The  party  was  particu- 
larly successful  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  where  it  increased  its  share  of 
the  vote  from  7.6  percent  (eight  seats)  in  1989  to  35.3  percent 
(fifty  seats)  in  1991,  and  in  Gujarat,  where  its  votes  and  seats 
climbed  from  30  percent  (twelve  seats)  to  52  percent  (twenty 
seats).  In  addition,  BJP  support  appeared  to  be  spreading  into 
new  areas.  In  Karnataka,  its  vote  rose  from  2.6  percent  to  28.1 
percent,  and  in  West  Bengal  the  BJP's  share  of  the  vote 
expanded  from  1.6  to  12.0  percent.  However,  the  elections  also 
revealed  some  of  the  limitations  of  the  BJP  juggernaut.  Exit 
polls  showed  that  while  the  BJP  received  more  upper-caste  sup- 
port than  all  other  parties  and  made  inroads  into  the  constitu- 
ency of  Backward  Classes,  it  did  poorly  among  Scheduled 
Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes,  constituencies  that  it  had  long 
attempted  to  cultivate.  In  Himachal  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh, 
and  Rajasthan,  three  state  governments  run  by  the  BJP  since 
1990,  the  BJP  lost  parliamentary  seats  although  its  share  of  the 
vote  increased.  In  Uttar  Pradesh,  where  the  BJP  also  won  con- 
trol of  the  state  government  in  1991,  veteran  political  analyst 
Paul  R.  Brass  cogently  argued  that  the  BJP  had  reached  the  lim- 
its of  its  social  base  of  support. 

The  limits  of  the  BJP's  Hindu  nationalist  strategy  were  fur- 
ther revealed  by  its  losses  in  the  November  1993  state  elections. 
The  party  lost  control  over  the  state-level  governments  of 
Himachal  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  while 
winning  power  in  Gujarat  and  the  National  Capital  Territory  of 
Delhi.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Hindu  activists'  dismantling  of 
the  Babri  Masjid  in  December  1992,  the  evocative  symbolism  of 
the  Ramjanmabhumi  controversy  had  apparently  lost  its  capac- 
ity to  mobilize  popular  support.  Nevertheless,  the  BJP,  by  giving 
more  emphasis  to  anticorruption  and  social  issues,  achieved 
unprecedented  success  in  South  India,  where  it  won  28  percent 
of  the  vote  and  came  in  second  in  elections  in  Karnataka  in 
November  1994.  In  the  spring  of  1995,  the  BJP  won  state  elec- 
tions in  Gujarat  and  became  the  junior  partner  of  a  coalition 
with  Shiv  Sena  (Army  of  Shivaji — Shivaji  Bhonsle  was  a  seven- 
teenth-century Maratha  guerrilla  leader  who  kept  Mughal 
armies  at  bay)  in  Maharashtra  (see  The  Marathas,  ch.  1).  In 
view  of  the  potential  demise  of  the  Congress  (I),  the  BJP  stands 
poised  to  emerge  as  India's  largest  party  in  the  1990s.  However, 
it  is  likely  to  have  to  play  down  the  more  divisive  aspects  of 


481

Hindu  nationalism  and  find  other  issues  to  expand  its  support 
if  it  is  to  win  a  majority  in  the  Lok  Sabha. 

Communist  Parties 

The  Communist  Party  of  India  (CPI)  was  founded  on 
December  26,  1925,  at  an  all-India  conference  held  at  Kanpur, 
Uttar  Pradesh,  in  late  December  1925  and  early  January  1926. 
Communists  participated  in  the  independence  struggle  and,  as 
members  of  the  Congress  Socialist  Party,  became  a  formidable 
presence  on  the  socialist  wing  of  the  Indian  National  Congress. 
They  were  expelled  from  the  Congress  Socialist  Party  in  March 
1940,  after  allegations  that  the  communists  had  disrupted  party 
activities  and  were  intent  on  coopting  party  organizations. 
Indeed,  by  the  time  the  communists  were  expelled,  they  had 
gained  control  over  the  entire  Congress  Socialist  Party  units  in 
what  were  to  become  the  southern  states  of  Kerala,  Tamil 
Nadu,  and  Andhra  Pradesh.  Communists  remained  members 
of  the  Indian  National  Congress  although  their  support  of  the 
British  war  effort  after  the  German  invasion  of  the  Soviet 
Union  and  their  nationalist  policy  supporting  the  right  of  reli- 
gious minorities  to  secede  from  India  were  diametrically 
opposed  to  Congress  policies.  As  a  result,  the  communists 
became  isolated  within  the  Congress.  After  independence, 
communists  organized  a  peasant  uprising  in  the  Telangana 
region  in  the  northern  part  of  what  was  to  become  Andhra 
Pradesh.  The  uprising  was  suppressed  only  after  the  central 
government  sent  in  the  army.  Starting  in  1951,  the  CPI  shifted 
to  a  more  moderate  strategy  of  seeking  to  bring  communism  to 
India  within  the  constraints  of  Indian  democracy.  In  1957  the 
CPI  was  elected  to  rule  the  state  government  of  Kerala  only  to 
have  the  government  dismissed  and  President's  Rule  declared 
in  1959. 

In  1964,  in  conjunction  with  the  widening  rift  between 
China  and  the  Soviet  Union,  a  large  leftist  faction  of  the  CPI 
leadership,  based  predominantly  in  Kerala  and  West  Bengal, 
split  from  the  party  to  form  the  Communist  Party  of  India 
(Marxist),  or  CPI  (M).  The  CPI  (M)-led  coalition  victory  in  the 
1967  West  Bengal  state  elections  spurred  dissension  within  the 
party  because  a  Maoist  faction  headed  a  peasant  rebellion  in 
the  Naxalbari  area  of  the  state,  just  south  of  Darjiling  (Darjee- 
ling).  The  suppression  of  the  Naxalbari  uprising  under  the 
direction  of  the  CPI  (M) -controlled  Home  Ministry  of  the  state 
government  led  to  denunciations  by  Maoist  revolutionary  fac-

tions  across  the  country.  These  groups — commonly  referred  to 
as  Naxalites — sparked  new  uprisings  in  the  Srikakulam  region 
of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Bihar,  and  other  parts  of  West  Bengal.  In 
1969  several  Naxalite  factions  joined  together  to  form  a  new 
party — the  Communist  Party  of  India  (Marxist-Leninist) — CPI 
(M-L).  However,  pursuit  of  insurrectionary  tactics  in  the  face  of 
harsh  repression  by  the  government  along  with  an  array  of 
ideological  disputes  kept  Naxalite  factions  isolated  in  their 
local  bases. 

In  the  1990s,  the  CPI  (M)  enjoys  the  most  political  strength 
of  any  communist  group.  Nationally,  its  share  of  the  vote  has 
gradually  increased  from  4.2  percent  in  1967  to  6.7  percent  in 
1991,  but  it  has  largely  remained  confined  to  Kerala,  Tripura, 
and  West  Bengal.  In  Kerala  the  CPI  (M)  in  coalition  with  other 
parties  wrested  control  from  the  Congress  and  its  allies  (fre-

quently  including  the  CPI)  in  1967,  in  1980,  and  in  1987.  Sup- 
port for  the  CPI  (M)  in  Kerala  in  general  elections  has  ranged 
from  19  percent  to  26  percent,  but  the  party  has  never  won 
more  than  nine  of  Kerala's  twenty  seats  in  Parliament.  From 
1977  to  1989,  the  CPI  (M)  dominated  Tripura's  state  govern- 
ment. It  won  two  parliamentary  seats  in  1971,  1980,  and  1984, 
but  it  lost  all  of  its  seats  in  1977,  1989,  and  1991.  In  West  Ben- 
gal, the  CPI  (M)  has  ruled  the  state  government  with  a  coali- 
tion of  other  leftist  parties  since  1977,  and,  since  that  time,  the 
party  has  also  dominated  West  Bengal's  parliamentary  delega- 
tion. 

Support  for  the  CPI  is  more  evenly  spread  nationwide,  but  it 
is  weak  and  in  decline.  The  CPI  share  of  the  parliamentary  vote 
has  more  than  halved  from  5.2  percent  in  1967  to  2.5  percent 
in  1991. 

In  1982  a  CPI  (M-L)  faction  entered  the  parliamentary 
arena  by  forming  the  Indian  People's  Front.  In  the  1989  gen- 
eral elections,  the  front  won  a  parliamentary  seat  in  western 
Bihar,  and  in  1990  it  won  seven  seats  in  the  Bihar  legislative 
assembly.  However,  the  Indian  People's  Front  lost  its  parlia- 
mentary seat  in  the  1991  parliamentary  elections  when  its  vote 
in  Bihar  declined  by  some  20  percent. 

Regional  Parties 

Given  India's  social,  cultural,  and  historical  diversity,  it  is 
only  natural  that  regional  parties  play  an  important  role  in  the 
country's  political  life.  Because  of  India's  federal  system,  state 
assembly  votes  are  held  in  an  electoral  arena  that  often  enables 
regional  parties  to  obtain  power  by  espousing  issues  of  regional 
concern.  Simultaneously,  the  single-member  district,  first-past- 
the-post  electoral  system  has  given  the  advantage  to  national 
parties,  such  as  the  Congress,  which  possess  a  realistic  chance 
of  gaining  or  retaining  power  at  the  national  level  and  the 
opportunity  to  use  central  government  resources  to  reward 
their  supporters.  Although  regional  parties  have  exercised 
authority  at  the  state  level,  collectively  they  receive  only  from  5 
to  10  percent  of  the  national  vote  in  parliamentary  elections. 
Only  during  the  governments  of  the  Janata  Party  (1977-79) 
and  the  National  Front  (1989-90)  have  they  participated  in 
forming  the  central  government.  However,  as  India's  party  sys- 
tem becomes  more  fragmented  with  the  decline  of  the  Con- 
gress (I),  the  regional  parties  are  likely  to  play  an  important 
role  at  the  national  level.

Government  and  Politics 


Regional  political  parties  have  been  strongest  in  Tamil 
Nadu,  where  they  have  dominated  state  politics  since  1967. 
Regional  parties  in  the  state  trace  their  roots  to  the  establish- 
ment of  the  Justice  Party  by  non-Brahman  social  elites  in  1916 
and  the  development  of  the  non-Bhraman  Self-Respect  Move- 
ment, founded  in  1925  by  E.V.  Ramaswamy  Naicker.  As  leader 
of  the  Justice  Party,  in  1944  Ramaswamy  renamed  the  party  the 
Dravida  Kazhagam  (DK — Dravidian  Federation)  and 
demanded  the  establishment  of  an  independent  state  called 
Dravidasthan.  In  1949,  charismatic  film  script  writer  C.N.  Anna- 
durai,  who  was  chafing  under  Ramaswamy's  authoritarian  lead- 
ership, split  from  the  DK  to  found  the  DMK  in  an  attempt  to 
achieve  the  goals  of  Tamil  nationalism  through  the  electoral 
process.  The  DMK  dropped  its  demand  for  Dravidasthan  in 
1963  but  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  agitations  that  success- 
fully defeated  attempts  to  impose  the  northern  Indian  lan- 
guage of  Hindi  as  the  official  national  language  in  the  mid- 
1960s.  The  DMK  routed  the  Congress  in  the  1967  elections  in 
Tamil  Nadu  and  took  control  of  the  state  government.  With 
the  deterioration  of  Annadurai's  health,  another  screen  writer, 
M.  Karunanidhi,  became  chief  minster  in  1968  and  took  con- 
trol of  the  party  after  Annadurai's  death  in  1969. 

Karunanidhi's  control  over  the  party  was  soon  challenged  by 
M.G.  Ramachandran  (best  known  by  his  initials,  M.G.R.),  one 
of  South  India's  most  popular  film  stars.  In  1972  M.G.R.  split 
from  the  DMK  to  form  the  All-India  Anna  Dravida  Munnetra 
Kazhagam  (AIADMK).  Under  his  leadership,  the  AIADMK 
dominated  Tamil  politics  at  the  state  level  from  1977  through 
1989.  The  importance  of  personal  charisma  in  Tamil  politics 
was  dramatized  by  the  struggle  for  control  over  the  AIADMK 
after  M.G.R's  death  in  1988.  His  widow,  Janaki,  herself  a  former 
film  star,  vied  for  control  with  Jayalalitha,  an  actress  who  had 
played  M.G.R.  s  leading  lady  in  several  films.  The  rivalry 
allowed  the  DMK  to  gain  control  over  the  state  government  in 
1989.  The  AIADMK,  securely  under  the  control  of  Jayalalitha, 
who  was  cast  as  a  "revolutionary  leader,"  recaptured  the  state 
government  in  1991.  However,  since  1980,  the  Congress  (I), 
usually  in  alliance  with  the  AIADMK,  has  won  a  majority  of 
Tamil  Nadu's  seats  in  Parliament. 

After  three  decades  of  Congress  rule,  the  politics  of  Andhra 
Pradesh  during  the  1980s  also  became  dominated  by  a  charis- 
matic film  star  who  stressed  regional  issues.  In  1982  N.T  Rama 
Rao  (popularly  known  as  N.T.R.),  an  actor  who  frequently 


485

played  Hindu  deities  in  Telugu-language  films,  formed  the  Te- 
lugu Desam.  The  party  ruled  the  state  from  1983  to  1989.  It 
also  won  thirty  of  Andhra  Pradesh's  forty-two  parliamentary 
seats  in  1984.  With  the  objective  of  enhancing  Andhra 
Pradesh's  regional  autonomy,  N.T.R.  played  a  key  role  in  the 
formation  of  the  National  Front  coalition  government  in  1989. 
However,  in  the  1989  elections,  the  Telugu  Desam  won  only 
two  parliamentary  seats  and  lost  control  over  the  state  govern- 
ment to  the  Congress  (I).  It  was  able  to  improve  its  showing  to 
thirteen  seats  in  Parliament  in  the  1991  elections.  The  Telugu 
Desam  returned  to  power  in  Andhra  Pradesh  after  winning  the 
state  legislative  assembly  elections  in  November  1994. 

The  Akali  Dal  (Eternal  Party)  claims  to  represent  India's 
Sikhs,  who  are  concentrated  primarily  in  Punjab.  It  was  first 
formed  in  the  early  1920s  to  return  control  of  gurdwaras  (Sikh 
places  of  worship)  to  the  orthodox  Sikh  religious  community. 
During  the  1960s,  the  Akali  Dal  played  an  important  role  in  the 
struggle  for  the  creation  of  Punjab  as  a  separate  state  with  a 
Sikh  majority.  Even  with  the  majority  Sikh  population,  the 
Akali  Dai's  political  success  has  been  limited  by  the  Congress's 
ability  to  win  votes  from  the  Sikh  community.  The  Akali  Dal 
won  nine  of  Punjab's  thirteen  parliamentary  seats  in  the  gen- 
eral elections  of  1977  and  seven  in  1984  but  only  one  in  the 
1971  and  1980  elections.  Similarly,  the  Akali  Dal  headed  coali- 
tion state  governments  in  1967  and  1977  and  formed  the  state 
government  in  1985,  but  it  lost  state  government  elections  to 
the  Congress  (R)  in  1972,  and  to  Congress  (I)  in  1980  and  in 
1992.  As  the  1980s  progressed,  the  Akali  Dal  became  increas- 
ingly factionalized.  In  1989  three  Akali  Dal  factions  ran  in  the 
elections,  winning  a  total  of  seven  seats.  The  Akali  Dal  factions 
boycotted  parliamentary  and  state  legislative  elections  that 
were  held  in  February  1992.  As  a  result,  voter  turnout  dropped 
to  21.6  percent,  and  the  Congress  (I)  won  twelve  of  Punjab's 
thirteen  seats  in  Parliament  and  a  majority  of  seats  in  the  legis- 
lative assembly  (see  Twentieth-Century  Developments,  ch.  3). 

The  National  Conference,  based  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  is  a 
regional  party,  which,  despite  its  overwhelmingly  Muslim  fol- 
lowing, refused  to  support  the  All-India  Muslim  League  (Mus- 
lim League — see  Glossary)  during  the  independence 
movement;  instead  it  allied  itself  with  the  Indian  National  Con- 
gress. The  National  Conference  was  closely  identified  with  its 
leader,  Sheikh  Mohammed  Abdullah,  a  personal  friend  of 
Nehru,  and,  after  Abdullah's  death  in  1982,  with  his  son, 


486 


Government  and  Politics 


Farooq  Abdullah.  Friendship,  however,  did  not  prevent  Nehru 
from  imprisoning  Sheikh  Abdullah  when  he  became  con- 
cerned that  the  "Lion  of  Kashmir"  was  disposed  to  demand 
independence  for  his  state.  Ultimately,  Sheikh  Abdullah  struck 
a  deal  with  Indira  Gandhi,  and  in  1975  he  became  chief  minis- 
ter of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  The  National  Conference 
remained  Jammu  and  Kashmir's  dominant  party  through  the 
1980s  and  maintained  control  over  the  state  government  for 
most  of  the  period.  In  parliamentary  elections,  it  won  one  of 
Kashmir's  six  parliamentary  seats  in  1967,  none  in  1971,  two  in 
1977,  and  three  in  1980,  1984,  and  1989.  However,  popular 
support  for  the  National  Conference  was  badly  eroded  by  alle- 
gations of  electoral  fraud  in  the  1987  state  elections — which 
were  won  by  the  National  Conference  in  alliance  with  the  Con- 
gress (I) — and  the  widespread  corruption  of  the  subsequent 
state  government  under  the  leadership  of  Farooq  Abdullah. 
There  was  little  popular  sympathy  for  Farooq  Abdullah  and  the 
National  Conference  even  after  the  government  was  dissolved 
and  President's  Rule  declared  in  1990.  Jammu  and  Kashmir 
remained  under  President's  Rule  through  1995,  and  the 
absence  of  elections  makes  it  difficult  to  ascertain  the  extent  of 
the  National  Conference's  popular  support.  Nevertheless,  it 
appears  that  Farooq  and  the  National  Conference  remain  dis- 
credited. 

During  the  late  1980s,  the  AGP  rose  to  power  in  Assam  on 
the  crest  of  Assamese  nationalism.  Immigration  to  Assam — pri- 
marily by  Muslim  Bengalis  from  neighboring  Bangladesh — had 
aroused  concern  that  the  Assamese  would  become  a  minority 
in  their  own  state.  By  1979  attention  was  focused  on  the  contro- 
versial issue  of  determining  how  many  immigrants  would  be 
allowed  on  the  state's  list  of  eligible  voters.  The  Congress  (I), 
which  gained  a  substantial  share  of  the  immigrants'  votes,  took 
a  more  expansive  view  of  who  should  be  included  while  the 
Assamese  nationalist  organizations  demanded  a  more  restric- 
tive position.  An  attempt  to  hold  state  elections  in  February 
1983,  and  in  effect  to  force  the  Assamese  nationalists  to  accept 
the  status  quo,  resulted  in  a  breakdown  of  law  and  order  and 
the  deaths  of  more  than  3,000  people.  The  subsequent  forma- 
tion of  a  Congress  (I)  government  led  by  Hiteshwar  Saikia  was 
widely  viewed  in  Assam  as  illegitimate,  and  it  was  dissolved  as 
part  of  the  terms  of  the  Assam  Accord  that  was  signed  between 
Rajiv  Gandhi  and  Assamese  nationalists  on  August  15,  1985. 
The  Assam  Accord  also  included  a  compromise  on  the  voter 


487 


India:  A  Country  Study 

eligibility  issue,  settled  the  issue  of  the  citizenship  status  of 
immigrants,  and  stipulated  that  new  elections  were  to  be  held 
in  December.  The  AGP  was  formed  by  Assamese  student  lead- 
ers after  the  signing  of  the  accord,  and  the  new  party  won  the 
December  1985  elections  with  35  percent  of  the  vote  and  sixty- 
four  of  108  seats  in  the  state  legislature. 

The  victory  of  the  AGP  did  not  end  the  controversy  over 
Assamese  nationalism.  The  AGP  was  unable  to  implement  the 
accord's  provisions  for  disenfranchising  and  expelling  illegal 
aliens,  in  part  because  Parliament  passed  legislation  making  it 
more  difficult  to  prove  illegal  alien  status.  The  AGP's  failure  to 
implement  the  accord  along  with  the  general  ineffectiveness 
with  which  it  operated  the  state  government  undercut  its  popu- 
lar support,  and  in  November  1990  it  was  dismissed  and  Presi- 
dent's Rule  declared.  As  the  AGP  floundered,  other  nationalist 
groups  of  agitators  flourished.  The  United  Liberation  Front  of 
Assam  (ULFA)  became  the  primary  torchbearer  of  militant 
Assamese  nationalism  while  the  All  Bodo  Students'  Union 
(ABSU)  and  Bodo  People's  Action  Committee  (BPAC)  led  an 
agitation  for  a  separate  homeland  for  the  central  plain  tribal 
people  of  Assam  (often  called  Bodos).  By  1990  ULFA  militants 
ran  virtually  a  parallel  government  in  the  state,  extorting  huge 
sums  from  businesses  in  Assam,  especially  the  Assamese  tea 
industry.  The  ULFA  was  ultimately  subdued  through  a  shrewd 
combination  of  ruthless  military  repression  and  generous 
terms  of  surrender  for  many  of  its  leaders.  The  ABSU/BPAC- 
led  mass  agitation  lasted  from  March  1987  until  February  1993 
when  the  ABSU  signed  an  accord  with  the  state  government 
that  had  been  under  the  Congress  (I)  control  since  1991.  The 
accord  provided  for  the  creation  of  a  Bodoland  Autonomous 
Council  with  jurisdiction  over  an  area  of  5,186  square  kilome- 
ters and  2.1  million  people  within  Assam.  Nevertheless,  Bodo 
agitation  continued  in  the  mid-1990s  as  a  result  of  the  demands 
of  many  Bodo  leaders,  who  insisted  that  more  territory  be 
included  under  the  Bodoland  Autonomous  Council. 

Caste-Based  Parties 

One  irony  of  Indian  politics  is  that  its  modern  secular 
democracy  has  enhanced  rather  than  reduced  the  political 
salience  of  traditional  forms  of  social  identity  such  as  caste. 
Part  of  the  explanation  for  this  development  is  that  India's 
political  parties  have  found  the  caste-based  selection  of  candi- 
dates and  appeals  to  the  caste-based  interests  of  the  Indian

electorate  to  be  an  effective  way  to  win  popular  support.  More 
fundamental  has  been  the  economic  development  and  social 
mobility  of  those  groups  officially  designated  as  Backward 
Classes  and  Scheduled  Castes.  Accounting  for  52  and  15  per- 
cent of  the  population,  respectively,  the  Backward  Classes  and 
Scheduled  Castes,  or  Dalits  as  they  prefer  to  be  called,  consti- 
tute a  diverse  range  of  middle,  lower,  and  outcaste  groups  who 
have  come  to  wield  substantial  power  in  most  states.  Indeed, 
one  of  the  dramas  of  modern  Indian  politics  has  been  the 
Backward  Classes  and  Dalits' jettisoning  of  their  political  subor- 
dination to  upper  castes  and  their  assertion  of  their  own  inter- 
ests. 

The  Backward  Classes  are  such  a  substantial  constituency 
that  almost  all  parties  vie  for  their  support.  For  instance,  the 
Congress  (I)  in  Maharashtra  has  long  relied  on  Backward 
Classes'  backing  for  its  political  success.  The  1990s  have  seen  a 
growing  number  of  cases  where  parties,  relying  primarily  on 
Backward  Classes'  support,  often  in  alliance  with  Dalits  and 
Muslims,  catapult  to  power  in  India's  states.  Janata  Dal  govern- 
ments in  Bihar  and  Karnataka  are  excellent  examples  of  this 
strategy.  An  especially  important  development  is  the  success  of 
the  Samajwadi  Party,  which  under  the  leadership  of  Mulayam 
Singh  Yadav  won  the  1993  assembly  elections  in  India's  most 
populous  state,  Uttar  Pradesh,  relying  almost  exclusively  on 
Backward  Classes  and  Muslim  support  in  a  coalition  with  the 
Dalit-supported  BSP. 

The  growing  support  of  the  BSP  also  reflects  the  importance 
of  caste-based  politics  and  the  assertiveness  of  the  Dalits  in  par- 
ticular. The  BSP  was  founded  by  Kanshi  Ram  on  April  13,  1984, 
the  birthday  of  B.R.  Ambedkar.  Born  as  a  Dalit  in  Punjab,  Kan- 
shi Ram  resigned  from  his  position  as  a  government  employee 
in  1964  and,  after  working  in  various  political  positions, 
founded  the  All-India  Backward,  Scheduled  Caste,  Scheduled 
Tribe,  Other  Backward  Classes,  and  Minority  Communities 
Employees  Federation  (BAMCEF)  in  1978.  Although  both  the 
BAMCEF  and  BSP  pursue  strategies  of  building  support  among 
Backward  Classes,  Scheduled  Tribes,  and  Muslims  as  well  as 
Dalits,  Kanshi  Ram  has  been  most  successful  in  building  sup- 
port among  the  Dalit  Chamar  (Leatherworker)  caste  in  North 
India.  In  the  November  1993  Uttar  Pradesh  state  elections, 
Ram's  BSP  achieved  the  best  showing  of  any  Dalit-based  party 
by  winning  sixty-seven  seats.  At  the  same  time,  the  BSP 
increased  its  representation  in  the  Madhya  Pradesh  state  legis-

Government  and  Politics 


lature  from  two  to  twelve  seats.  On  June  1,  1995,  the  BSP  with- 
drew from  the  state  government  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and,  with  the 
support  of  the  BJP,  formed  a  new  government,  making  its 
leader,  Mayawati,  the  first  Dalit  ever  to  become  a  chief  minister 
of  Uttar  Pradesh.  The  alliance,  however,  was  seen  by  observers 
as  doomed  because  of  political  differences. 

Political  Issues 

Punjab  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir 

Conflicts  in  Punjab  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir  are  each  the 
result  of  centralized  power  operating  in  a  predominantly  heter- 
ogeneous society.  Although  tensions  in  the  two  states  have 
important  historical  roots,  they  have  been  fueled  by  contro- 
versy over  the  policies  of  India's  central  government.  Opposi- 
tion is  built  upon  the  feeling  that  political  power  in  New  Delhi 
is  inaccessible  and  unresponsive  to  local  needs.  Furthermore, 
in  each  case,  the  Congress  (I)  leadership  has  attempted  to 
intervene  in  the  conflicts  to  advance  its  partisan  interests  only 
to  have  its  intervention  backfire  and  aggravate  regional  ten- 
sions. 

The  confrontation  in  Punjab  began  in  1973  when  the  Akali 
Dal  issued  the  Anandpur  Sahib  Resolution  calling  for  the  estab- 
lishment of  a  "Sikh  Autonomous  Region"  with  its  own  constitu- 
tion. It  also  called  for  the  transfer  of  Chandigarh,  a  union 
territory,  to  Punjab  as  the  state's  capital — promised  by  the  cen- 
tral government  in  1970 — and  demanded  that  the  central  gov- 
ernment establish  a  more  favorable  allocation  of  river  waters 
used  for  irrigation.  A  particular  concern  was  the  shared  distri- 
bution of  water  from  the  Beas  and  Sutlej  rivers  with  neighbor- 
ing Haryana  (see  Rivers,  ch.  2).  The  Akali  Dal  further 
demanded  changes  involving  greater  symbolic  recognition  of 
Sikhism.  These  demands  included  the  recognition  of  Amritsar, 
the  site  of  the  Sikhs'  Golden  Temple,  as  a  holy  city;  exemption 
from  antihijacking  regulations  to  enable  Sikhs  flying  on  Indian 
airlines  to  wear  their  kirpan  (ceremonial  saber);  and  the  pas- 
sage of  the  All-India  Gurdwara  Act  to  place  the  management  of 
all  gurdwaras  in  the  country  under  a  single  administration  (see 
Early  History  and  Tenets,  ch.  3). 

Akali  Dal  members  were  engaged  in  a  heated  competition 
with  the  Congress  (I)  over  control  of  the  Punjab  assembly.  It 
was  in  this  context  that  the  Congress  (I)  found  it  advantageous 
to  encourage  Sikh  fundamentalism.  Giani  Zail  Singh,  who  was

India:  A  Country  Study 

the  Congress  (I)  chief  minister  in  Punjab  from  1972  to  1977 
and  minister  of  home  affairs  in  the  central  government  from 
1980  to  1982,  developed  links  with  the  fiery  Sikh  militant  Sant 
Jarnail  Singh  Bhindranwale.  By  encouraging  Bhindranwale, 
the  Congress  (I)  hoped  to  reap  advantage  from  sowing  division 
in  the  already  fractious  Akali  Dal.  However,  what  may  have 
been  good  for  the  interests  of  the  Congress  (I)  turned  out  to 
be  bad  for  the  country.  By  the  spring  of  1984,  Bhindranwale 
and  his  followers  had  taken  over  the  Akal  Takht  (Throne  of  the 
Eternal  God)  shrine  facing  the  Golden  Temple  and  trans- 
formed it  into  a  headquarters  and  armory  for  Sikh  militants. 
Indira  Gandhi  sent  in  the  army,  which,  during  a  bloody  three- 
day  siege,  almost  destroyed  the  Akal  Takht,  did  some  damage 
to  the  Golden  Temple,  and  killed  Bhindranwale  and  hundreds 
of  his  followers  (see  Insurgent  Movements  and  External  Sub- 
version, ch.  10).  The  army's  action  generated  widespread 
resentment  among  India's  Sikhs.  The  subsequent  assassination 
of  Indira  Gandhi  by  Sikh  members  of  her  bodyguard  on  Octo- 
ber 31,  1984,  unleashed  a  wave  of  riots  throughout  India  in 
which  more  than  2,700  Sikhs  were  killed. 

Rajiv  Gandhi  attempted  to  put  an  end  to  the  crisis  by  signing 
an  agreement  with  Akali  Dal  moderate  Harchand  Singh  Lon- 
gowal  in  August  1985.  The  Gandhi-Longowal  Accord  acqui- 
esced to  many  Akali  Dal  demands  and  called  for  elections  to 
put  an  end  to  central  government  control  over  the  state  gov- 
ernment through  President's  Rule,  which  had  been  in  effect 
since  October  1983.  Although  the  accord  was  criticized  by  Sikh 
activists  as  being  a  sellout,  it  apparently  had  widespread  sup- 
port, as  evidenced  by  the  public's  defiance  of  the  militants'  call 
for  a  boycott  of  the  ensuing  elections  and  the  mandate  given  to 
Akali  Dal  moderates  to  form  a  new  government.  Public  support 
for  the  Akali  Dal  government,  however,  was  soon  undermined 
by  Rajiv  Gandhi's  failure  to  fulfill  his  commitments,  such  as  the 
transfer  of  Chandigarh  to  Punjab,  as  enunciated  in  the  Gandhi- 
Longowal  Accord.  With  the  failure  to  implement  the  accord, 
the  popularity  of  the  Akali  Dal  state  government  led  by  Surjit 
Singh  Barnala  declined,  and  its  internal  divisions  grew.  As  a 
result,  its  efforts  to  combat  the  militants'  increasing  violence 
became  ineffective.  In  May  1987,  the  Punjab  assembly  was  dis- 
solved and  replaced  with  President's  Rule. 

The  violence  of  Sikh  militants  spread  throughout  Punjab 
during  the  1980s.  In  many  cases,  activist  groups  became  undis- 
ciplined or  were  taken  over  by  criminals.  Armed  robbery,

Government  and  Politics 


extortion,  and  murder  became  a  way  of  life.  Police  actions  also 
became  more  repressive.  The  residents  of  Punjab  were  caught 
in  a  vise  of  indiscriminate  militant  and  police  violence.  After  an 
unprecedented  five  years  of  President's  Rule,  the  central  gov- 
ernment gambled  by  holding  elections  for  Parliament  and  the 
state  legislative  assembly  in  February  1992.  Most  Akali  Dal 
groups  and  militants  called  for  a  boycott  of  the  poll,  and  the 
election  turnout  was  a  record  low  of  20  percent.  Not  surpris- 
ingly, the  Congress  (I)  emerged  victorious,  winning  twelve  of 
thirteen  seats  in  Parliament  and  control  over  the  state  govern- 
ment. After  the  elections,  the  police  and  paramilitary  forces 
under  the  leadership  of  K.P.S.  Gill  scored  a  series  of  successes 
in  infiltrating  activist  groups  and  capturing  or  killing  their 
members.  Popular  participation  in  the  conventional  political 
process  increased;  voter  turnout  for  municipal  elections  in  Sep- 
tember 1992  and  gram  panchayats  in  January  1993  exceeded  70 
percent.  Although  violence  diminished  during  1993  and  1994, 
the  sources  of  many  of  the  tensions  remained,  and  resentments 
among  the  Sikhs  continue  to  simmer  in  the  mid-1990s. 

Ethnic  and  regional  tensions  also  raged  out  of  control  in  the 
strategically  sensitive  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  The  conflict 
assumes  considerable  symbolic  as  well  as  strategic  importance 
because,  as  India's  only  Muslim-majority  state,  Jammu  and 
Kashmir  validates  India's  national  identity  as  a  religiously  and 
culturally  diverse  society  held  together  by  a  common  history 
and  cultural  heritage.  The  roots  of  the  Kashmir  conflict  extend 
at  least  as  far  back  as  1947  when  Maharaja  Hari  Singh,  the 
princely  state's  Hindu  ruler,  decided  to  cede  his  domain  with 
its  predominantly  Muslim  population  to  the  Indian  Union  at  a 
time  when  Kashmir  was  under  attack  by  a  Muslim  paramilitary 
force  supported  by  Pakistan.  Tensions  persisted  through  the 
mid-1980s.  The  National  Conference,  led  by  Sheikh  Abdullah 
until  his  death  in  1983,  first  supported  the  accession  to  India 
and  its  provisions  under  Article  370  of  the  constitution  for  spe- 
cial autonomy,  but  later  made  demands  for  greater  autonomy 
as  popular  resentment  against  India's  central  government 
began  to  spread.  The  status  of  Kashmir  was  the  cause  of  two 
wars  between  India  and  Pakistan,  in  1947  and  1965,  and  was  an 
issue  in  the  third  war,  in  1971  (see  The  Experience  of  Wars,  ch. 
10). 

The  Kashmir  crisis  of  the  1990s  is  reflective  of  trends  occur- 
ring throughout  the  Indian  polity:  the  increasing  intervention 
of  the  central  government  in  local  affairs,  the  resort  to  coer- 


493 


India:  A  Country  Study 

cion  to  resolve  social  conflict  and  maintain  social  order,  and 
the  increasing  political  assertiveness  of  the  Indian  public.  The 
National  Conference  government,  which  had  been  elected  in 
1983  under  the  leadership  of  Farooq  Abdullah,  son  of  Sheikh 
Abdullah,  was  brought  down  in  1984  after  leaders  of  the  Con- 
gress (I)  supported  Ghulam  Mohammad  Shah's  split  of  the 
National  Conference  and  formation  of  a  separate  government. 
The  Congress  (I)  switched  its  support  back  to  Farooq  in  1986, 
and  the  National  Conference  under  Farooq's  leadership  partic- 
ipated in  the  1987  state  elections  in  alliance  with  the  Congress 
(I).  The  alliance  served  to  discredit  Farooq  and  the  National 
Conference  in  the  eyes  of  many  Kashmiris,  and  the  coalition 
faced  stiff  competition  from  an  alliance  of  Muslim  activists 
under  the  banner  of  the  Muslim  United  Front.  The  National 
Conference-Congress  (I)  coalition  won  the  election,  but  only 
after  creating  a  popular  perception  of  widespread  election  rig- 
ging. Farooq's  government  proved  to  be  inept  and  corrupt,  fur- 
ther alienating  the  Kashmiri  public.  The  activists,  feeling  that 
they  had  been  electorally  defrauded,  incited  an  increasing 
number  of  demonstrations,  strikes,  bombings,  and  assassina- 
tions. 

The  problem  reached  a  climax  in  December  1989  when  mil- 
itants took  as  hostage  the  daughter  of  Mufti  Mohammed 
Sayeed,  the  minister  of  home  affairs  of  the  newly  formed 
National  Front  government.  When  the  militants  exchanged 
their  hostage  for  the  release  of  five  jailed  militant  leaders,  a 
jubilant  public  showed  its  support  for  the  militants  with  massive 
demonstrations  in  Srinagar,  the  capital.  It  became  obvious  to 
all  that  Farooq's  government  had  lost  control  over  the  state, 
and  President's  Rule  was  declared.  Insurgency  broke  out  as 
fighting  spread  between  the  Kashmiri  militants  and  paramili- 
tary forces.  Reports  by  human  rights  groups  left  little  doubt 
that  each  side  had  perpetrated  gross  atrocities  and  that  victims 
included  large  numbers  of  innocent  civilians.  The  issue  was  fur- 
ther complicated  by  charges  that  the  insurgents  had  received 
sanctuary  and  support  from  Pakistan  and  from  movements  like 
the  Ekta  Yatra  (Unity  Pilgrimage— a  BJP  political  pilgrimage 
from  the  southern  tip  of  India  to  Srinagar  from  December 
1991  to  January  1992). 

The  conflict  raged  through  1994  as  the  government  sent  in 
paramilitary  and  army  troops  in  an  effort  to  break  the  back  of 
the  resistance  and  convince  the  Kashmiri  public  of  the  futility 
of  the  struggle.  By  then  the  militants  had  fragmented  into 


494 


Government  and  Politics 


more  than  100  groups.  The  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Liberation 
Front,  which  demands  independence  from  both  India  and 
Pakistan,  had  the  widest  support,  but  a  number  of  heavily 
armed  groups,  the  most  prominent  being  the  Hezb-ul  Muja- 
hideen,  which  favored  union  with  Pakistan,  also  had  support. 
Events  offered  a  glimmer  of  hope  that  the  crisis  might  be 
resolved  through  negotiation.  Earlier,  in  November  1993,  the 
government  had  successfully  negotiated  the  settlement  of  a  cri- 
sis at  the  Hazratbal — a  Srinagar  mosque,  which  is  one  of  the 
holiest  Muslim  shrines  in  India  because  it  is  believed  to  house  a 
hair  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad.  The  government  negotiated 
the  settlement  with  the  All-Party  Hurriyat  Conference  by  agree- 
ing to  the  departure  of  the  occupying  militant  forces.  In  April 
1994,  the  leaders  of  the  conference  further  raised  hopes  by 
coming  to  New  Delhi  to  discuss  ways  of  resolving  the  conflict 
with  the  leaders  of  non-Muslim  communities  in  Kashmir.  The 
government  responded  by  releasing  more  moderate  activist 
leaders  from  prison  and  beginning  preparations  for  elections. 
But  with  tension  growing  and  the  destruction  in  May  1995  by 
fire  of  a  Sufi  mausoleum  and  mosque  in  the  town  of  Charar 
Sharif — each  side  blamed  the  other  for  the  conflagration — the 
central  government  postponed  plans  for  elections.  This  event 
posed  new  impediments  to  resolving  the  conflict. 

Hindu-Muslim  Tensions 

The  kindling  of  Hindu-Muslim  tensions  during  the  1990s 
was  neither  a  reawakening  of  ancient  hatreds  nor  a  conse- 
quence of  religious  fundamentalism.  Rather  it  occurred 
because  of  the  interaction  between  the  various  socioeconomic 
developments  in  India  during  the  1980s  and  1990s  and  the 
strategies  and  tactics  of  India's  politicians. 

Rapid  urbanization  has  uprooted  individuals  from  their  pre- 
vious occupations  and  communities  and  placed  many  in  com- 
petition for  new  livelihoods.  Newcomers  who  succeed 
frequently  arouse  resentment,  and  many  riots  have  targeted 
successful  Muslim  merchants,  business  owners,  and  Muslim 
returnees  from  the  Persian  Gulf  states,  where  they  often  earn 
incomes  many  times  higher  than  they  would  have  earned  in 
India.  High-caste  Hindus,  fearing  the  loss  of  their  social  pres- 
tige, have  provided  an  important  social  base  for  Hindu  mili- 
tancy. Hard-pressed  members  of  these  high-caste  groups  have 
been  an  especially  receptive  constituency  for  appeals  to  curtail 
the  "special  privileges  of  pampered  minorities."  In  addition, 


495 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  economy  was  unable  to  provide  jobs  for  all  who  wanted  to 
enter  the  labor  market,  and  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  saw  an 
increase  in  the  ranks  of  the  unemployed.  Some  of  the  unem- 
ployed have  become  involved  in  gangs  whose  strong-arm  tactics 
are  used  by  politicians  wishing  to  intimidate  or  incite  commu- 
nal tensions.  Other  unemployed  youths  join  militant  religious 
organizations  like  the  Bajrang  Dal  (Party  of  the  Adamani  [Dia- 
mond]-Bodied,  a  reference  to  Bajrang,  a  Hindu  god)  and  Shiv 
Sena.  The  militant  groups  provide  security  for  temples  and 
members  of  their  religion  but  are  also  sources  of  communal 
violence. 

Changes  in  the  nature  of  India's  political  process  also  have 
contributed  to  the  rise  of  religious  tensions.  Analysts  from  a 
variety  of  perspectives  have  commented  on  the  increasing  will- 
ingness of  India's  politicians  to  exploit  religious  and  ethnic  ten- 
sions for  short-term  political  gain,  regardless  of  their  longer- 
term  social  consequences.  Political  scientist  Rajni  Kothari,  for 
example,  charges  that  there  has  been  a  general  decline  in  the 
morality  of  Indian  politicians.  He  alleges  that  politicians  play  a 
"numbers  game,"  in  which  they  appeal  to  chauvinistic  caste  and 
religious  sentiments  to  win  elections,  despite  the  longer-term 
social  tensions  that  their  campaigns  create.  The  support  of  the 
Congress  for  Article  370  in  the  constitution,  which  provides  a 
special  status  for  the  Muslim  majority  state  of  Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir, and  the  measures  taken  to  provide  India's  Muslim  commu- 
nity with  distinctive  rights  have  contributed  to  the  popular 
resonance  of  the  BJP's  charges  that  the  Congress  (I)  stands  for 
minority  appeasement  and  "pseudo-secularism."  The  violence 
of  religious  militants  in  Punjab  and  Jammu  and  Kashmir  has 
also  contributed  to  sentiment  among  the  Hindu  majority  that 
religious  minorities  employ  aggressive  tactics  to  win  special 
concessions  from  the  government. 

The  1985  Shah  Bano  controversy  put  state-religion  relations 
in  the  forefront  of  the  political  agenda.  Shah  Bano  was  a  sev- 
enty-three-year-old Muslim  woman  from  Madhya  Pradesh  who 
filed  for  alimony  after  being  divorced  according  to  Muslim  law 
by  her  husband  after  forty-three  years  of  marriage.  The 
Supreme  Court  ruled  in  Shah  Bano's  favor,  creating  outrage 
among  sectors  of  the  Muslim  community  who  felt  that  the 
sharia  (Islamic  law),  which  does  not  provide  for  alimony,  had 
been  slighted.  In  apparent  capitulation  to  this  important  politi- 
cal constituency,  Rajiv  Gandhi  pushed  the  Muslim  Women 
(Protection  of  Rights  on  Divorce)  Bill,  which  removed  Muslim 


496 


Government  and  Politics 


divorce  cases  from  India's  civil  law  and  recognized  the  jurisdic- 
tion of  sharia.  The  legislation,  in  turn,  enraged  large  sectors  of 
Hindus,  whose  personal  conduct  is  judged  under  India's  secu- 
lar civil  code. 

Shortly  thereafter,  in  a  ploy  that  Rajiv  Gandhi  may  have  mis- 
guidedly  conceived  to  placate  Hindu  militants,  the  courts  ruled 
that  the  doors  of  the  Babri  Masjid  should  be  opened  to  Hindu 
worshipers.  The  VHP  was  joined  by  the  BJP  in  a  campaign  to 
reclaim  the  disputed  birthplace  of  Ram.  In  1989  the  VHP 
launched  a  campaign  encouraging  Hindu  devotees  from  across 
India  each  to  bring  a  brick  from  their  villages  to  Ayodhya.  Out- 
breaks of  violence  between  Hindus  and  Muslims  spread  as  the 
campaign  progressed,  and  the  BJP  successfully  prevailed  upon 
the  VHP  to  withdraw  the  campaign  before  the  1989  elections. 
Tensions  heated  up  again  in  the  summer  of  1990  when  BJP 
leader  Advani  embarked  on  a  10,000-kilometer  tour  of  the 
country  in  a  Toyota  van  decorated  to  resemble  the  mythologi- 
cal chariot  of  Ram.  Advani's  arrest  did  not  prevent  clashes  at 
Ayodhya  between  paramilitary  forces  and  Hindu  activists;  the 
clashes  sparked  a  wave  of  communal  violence  and  left  more 
than  300  dead. 

The  Ramjanmabhumi  Temple  mobilization  appeared  to  pay 
substantial  dividends  in  terms  of  the  BJP's  remarkable  growth 
of  support  in  North  India  in  the  1991  elections,  and  the  VHP 
and  BJP  kept  the  issue  alive  despite  the  fact  that  their  actions 
put  tremendous  pressure  on  the  newly  elected  BJP  state  gov- 
ernment in  Uttar  Pradesh.  Its  July  1992  kar  sewa  (mass  mobili- 
zation force  work  service)  to  build  the  temple  ended  peacefully 
only  through  last-minute  negotiations  with  Prime  Minister  Rao; 
Rao  had  been  promised  by  BJP  leader  L.K.  Advani  that  the 
December  6,  1992,  kar  sewa  would  also  be  peaceful.  Despite 
Advani's  promise,  thousands  of  Hindu  activists  broke  through  a 
police  cordon  and  destroyed  the  Babri  Masjid  (see  Public  Wor- 
ship, ch.  3).  This  event  and  the  subsequent  riots  throughout 
the  country  left  no  doubt  that  tensions  between  Hindus  and 
Muslims  had  reached  a  high  pitch. 

During  the  following  week,  riots  spread  throughout  the 
countryside,  killing  some  1,700  people.  Riots  broke  out  again 
in  Bombay  from  January  9  through  January  11,  killing  500 
more  people.  In  March  1993,  the  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  and 
other  prominent  places  in  the  city  were  shaken,  and  some  200 
people  were  killed  by  bombs  that  the  central  government 
alleges  were  placed  by  members  of  India's  criminal  underworld 


497 


India:  A  Country  Study 


at  the  behest  of  Pakistan's  intelligence  service.  The  manipula- 
tion of  India's  religious  tensions  by  militants,  criminals,  and 
politicians  highlighted  the  extent  to  which  religious  sentiments 
in  India  had  become  an  object  of  exploitation.  Religious  ten- 
sions eased  somewhat  and  incidents  of  communal  violence 
declined  during  the  remainder  of  1993  and  through  1994,  but 
the  persistence  of  the  social  conditions  that  gave  birth  to  vio- 
lence and  the  continued  opportunism  of  India's  politicians 
suggest  that  the  relative  peace  may  be  only  an  interlude. 

Corruption  and  the  Anti-Establishment  Vote 

Corruption  not  only  has  become  a  pervasive  aspect  of 
Indian  politics  but  also  has  become  an  increasingly  important 
factor  in  Indian  elections.  The  extensive  role  of  the  Indian 
state  in  providing  services  and  promoting  economic  develop- 
ment has  always  created  the  opportunity  for  using  public 
resources  for  private  benefit.  As  government  regulation  of  busi- 
ness was  extended  in  the  1960s  and  corporate  donations  were 
banned  in  1969,  trading  economic  favors  for  under-the-table 
contributions  to  political  parties  became  an  increasingly  wide- 
spread political  practice.  During  the  1980s  and  1990s,  corrup- 
tion became  associated  with  the  occupants  of  the  highest 
echelons  of  India's  political  system.  Rajiv  Gandhi's  government 
was  rocked  by  scandals,  as  was  the  government  of  P.V. 
Narasimha  Rao.  Politicians  have  become  so  closely  identified 
with  corruption  in  the  public  eye  that  a  Times  of  India  poll  of 
1,554  adults  in  six  metropolitan  cities  found  that  98  percent  of 
the  public  is  convinced  that  politicians  and  ministers  are  cor- 
rupt, with  85  percent  observing  that  corruption  is  on  the 
increase. 

The  prominence  of  political  corruption  in  the  1990s  is 
hardly  unique  to  India.  Other  countries  also  have  experienced 
corruption  that  has  rocked  their  political  systems.  What  is 
remarkable  about  India  is  the  persistent  anti-incumbent  senti- 
ment among  its  electorate.  Since  Indira's  victory  in  her  1971 
"garibi  hatao"  election,  only  one  ruling  party  has  been  reelected 
to  power  in  the  central  government.  In  an  important  sense,  the 
exception  proves  the  rule  because  the  Congress  (I)  won  reelec- 
tion in  1984  in  no  small  measure  because  the  electorate  saw  in 
Rajiv  Gandhi  a  "Mr.  Clean"  who  would  lead  a  new  generation  of 
politicians  in  cleansing  the  political  system.  Anti-incumbent 
sentiment  is  just  as  strong  at  the  state  level,  where  the  ruling 
parties  of  all  political  persuasions  in  India's  major  states  lost 


498 


eleven  of  thirteen  legislative  assembly  elections  held  from  1991 
through  spring  1995. 

The  Media 
The  Press 

Compared  with  many  other  developing  countries,  the 
Indian  press  has  flourished  since  independence  and  exercises 
a  large  degree  of  independence.  British  colonialism  allowed 
for  the  development  of  a  tradition  of  freedom  of  the  press,  and 
many  of  India's  great  English-language  newspapers  and  some 
of  its  Indian-language  press  were  begun  during  the  nineteenth 
century.  As  India  became  independent,  ownership  of  India's 
leading  English-language  newspapers  was  transferred  from 
British  to  Indian  business  groups,  and  the  fact  that  most 
English-language  newspapers  have  the  backing  of  large  busi- 
ness houses  has  contributed  to  their  independence  from  the 
government.  The  press  has  experienced  impressive  growth 
since  independence.  In  1950  there  were  214  daily  newspapers, 
with  forty-four  in  English  and  the  rest  in  Indian  languages.  By 
1990  the  number  of  daily  newspapers  had  grown  to  2,856,  with 
209  in  English  and  2,647  in  indigenous  languages.  The  expan- 
sion of  literacy  and  the  spread  of  consumerism  during  the 


499 


India:  A  Country  Study 

1980s  fueled  the  rapid  growth  of  news  weeklies  and  other  peri- 
odicals. By  1993  India  had  35,595  newspapers — of  which  3,805 
were  dailies — and  other  periodicals.  Although  the  majority  of 
publications  are  in  indigenous  languages,  the  English-language 
press,  which  has  widespread  appeal  to  the  expanding  middle 
class,  has  a  wide  multicity  circulation  throughout  India. 

There  are  four  major  publishing  groups  in  India,  each  of 
which  controls  national  and  regional  English-language  and  ver- 
nacular publications.  They  are  the  Times  of  India  Group,  the 
Indian  Express  Group,  the  Hindustan  Times  Group,  and  the 
Anandabazar  Patrika  Group.  The  Times  oflndiais  India's  largest 
English-language  daily,  with  a  circulation  of  656,000  published 
in  six  cities.  The  Indian  Express,  with  a  daily  circulation  of 
519,000,  is  published  in  seventeen  cities.  There  also  are  seven 
other  daily  newspapers  with  circulations  of  between  134,000 
and  477,000,  all  in  English  and  all  competitive  with  one 
another.  Indian-language  newspapers  also  enjoy  large  circula- 
tions but  usually  on  a  statewide  or  citywide  basis.  For  example, 
the  Malayalam-language  daily  Malayala  Manorama  circulates 
673,000  copies  in  Kerala;  the  Hindi-language  Dainik  Jagran  cir- 
culates widely  in  Uttar  Pradesh  and  New  Delhi,  with  580,000 
copies  per  day;  Punjab  Kesari,  also  published  in  Hindi  and  avail- 
able throughout  Punjab  and  New  Delhi,  has  a  daily  circulation 
of  562,000;  and  the  Anandabazar  Patrika,  published  in  Calcutta 
in  Bengali,  has  a  daily  circulation  of  435,000.  There  are  also 
numerous  smaller  publications  throughout  the  nation.  The 
combined  circulation  of  India's  newspapers  and  periodicals  is 
in  the  order  of  60  million,  published  daily  in  more  than  ninety 
languages. 

India  has  more  than  forty  domestic  news  agencies.  The 
Express  News  Service,  the  Press  Trust  of  India,  and  the  United 
News  of  India  are  among  the  major  news  agencies.  They  are 
headquartered  in  Delhi,  Bombay,  and  New  Delhi,  respectively, 
and  employ  foreign  correspondents. 

Although  freedom  of  the  press  in  India  is  the  legal  norm— it 
is  constitutionally  guaranteed — the  scope  of  this  freedom  has 
often  been  contested  by  the  government.  Rigid  press  censor- 
ship was  imposed  during  the  Emergency  starting  in  1975  but 
quickly  retracted  in  1977.  The  government  has  continued, 
however,  to  exercise  more  indirect  controls.  Government 
advertising  accounts  for  as  much  as  50  percent  of  all  advertise- 
ments in  Indian  newspapers,  providing  a  monetary  incentive  to 
limit  harsh  criticism  of  the  administration.  Until  1992,  when 


500 


Government  and  Politics 


government  regulation  of  access  to  newsprint  was  liberalized, 
controls  on  the  distribution  of  newsprint  could  also  be  used  to 
reward  favored  publications  and  threaten  those  that  fell  into 
disfavor.  In  1988,  at  a  time  when  the  Indian  press  was  publish- 
ing investigative  reports  about  corruption  and  abuse  of  power 
in  government,  Parliament  passed  a  tough  defamation  bill  that 
mandated  prison  sentences  for  offending  journalists.  Vocifer- 
ous protests  from  journalists  and  opposition  party  leaders  ulti- 
mately forced  the  government  to  withdraw  the  bill.  Since  the 
late  1980s,  the  independence  of  India's  press  has  been  bol- 
stered by  the  liberalization  of  government  economic  policy  and 
the  increase  of  private-sector  advertising  provided  by  the 
growth  of  India's  private  sector  and  the  spread  of  consumer- 
ism. 

Broadcast  Media 

The  national  television  (Doordarshan)  and  radio  (All  India 
Radio,  or  Akashwani)  networks  are  state-owned  and  managed 
by  the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Broadcasting.  Their  news 
reporting  customarily  presents  the  government's  point  of  view. 
For  example,  coverage  of  the  1989  election  campaign  blatantly 
favored  the  government  of  Rajiv  Gandhi,  and  autonomy  of  the 
electronic  media  became  a  political  issue.  V.R  Singh's  National 
Front  government  sponsored  the  Prasar  Bharati  (Indian 
Broadcasting)  Act,  which  Parliament  considered  in  1990,  to 
provide  greater  autonomy  to  Doordarshan  and  All  India  Radio. 
The  changes  that  resulted  were  limited.  The  bill  provided  for 
the  establishment  of  an  autonomous  corporation  to  run  Door- 
darshan and  All  India  Radio.  The  corporation  was  to  operate 
under  a  board  of  governors  to  be  in  charge  of  appointments 
and  policy  and  a  broadcasting  council  to  respond  to  com- 
plaints. However,  the  legislation  required  that  the  corporation 
prepare  and  submit  its  budget  within  the  framework  of  the  cen- 
tral budget  and  stipulated  that  the  personnel  of  the  new  broad- 
casting corporation  be  career  civil  servants  to  facilitate 
continued  government  control.  In  the  early  1990s,  increasing 
competition  from  television  broadcasts  transmitted  via  satellite 
appeared  the  most  effective  manner  of  limiting  the  progovern- 
ment  bias  of  the  government-controlled  electronic  media  (see 
Telecommunications,  ch.  6). 

Since  the  1980s,  India  has  experienced  a  rapid  proliferation 
of  television  broadcasting  that  has  helped  shape  popular  cul- 
ture and  the  course  of  politics.  Although  the  first  television 


501 


India:  A  Country  Study 

program  was  broadcast  in  1959,  the  expansion  of  television  did 
not  begin  in  earnest  until  the  extremely  popular  telecast  of  the 
Ninth  Asian  Games,  which  were  held  in  New  Delhi  in  1982. 
Realizing  the  popular  appeal  and  consequent  influence  of  tele- 
vision broadcasting,  the  government  undertook  an  expansion 
that  by  1990  was  planned  to  provide  television  access  to  90  per- 
cent of  the  population.  In  1993,  about  169  million  people  were 
estimated  to  have  watched  Indian  television  each  week,  and,  by 
1994,  it  was  reported  that  there  were  some  47  million  house- 
holds with  televisions.  There  also  is  a  growing  selection  of  satel- 
lite transmission  and  cable  services  available  (see  Television, 
ch.  6). 

Television  programming  was  initially  kept  tightly  under  the 
control  of  the  government,  which  embarked  on  a  self-con- 
scious effort  to  construct  and  propagate  a  cultural  idea  of  the 
Indian  nation.  This  goal  is  especially  clear  in  the  broadcasts  of 
such  megaseries  as  the  Hindu  epics  Ramayana  and  Maha- 
bharata.  In  addition  to  the  effort  at  nation-building,  the  politi- 
cians of  India's  ruling  party  have  not  hesitated  to  use  television 
to  build  political  support.  In  fact,  the  political  abuse  of  Indian 
television  led  to  demands  to  increase  the  autonomy  of  Door- 
darshan;  these  demands  ultimately  resulted  in  support  for  the 
Prasar  Bharati  Act. 

The  1990s  have  brought  a  radical  transformation  of  televi- 
sion in  India.  Transnational  satellite  broadcasting  made  its 
debut  in  January  1991,  when  owners  of  satellite  dishes — ini- 
tially mostly  at  major  hotels — began  receiving  Cable  News  Net- 
work (CNN)  coverage  of  the  Persian  Gulf  War.  Three  months 
later,  Star  TV  began  broadcasting  via  satellite.  Its  fare  initially 
included  serials  such  as  "The  Bold  and  the  Beautiful"  and  MTV 
programs.  Satellite  broadcasting  spread  rapidly  through  India's 
cities  as  local  entrepreneurs  erected  dishes  to  receive  signals 
and  transmitted  them  through  local  cable  systems.  After  its 
October  1992  launch,  Zee  TV  offered  stiff  competition  to  Star 
TV.  However,  the  future  of  Star  TV  was  bolstered  by  billionaire 
Rupert  Murdock,  who  acquired  the  network  for  US$525  mil- 
lion in  July  1993.  CNN  International,  part  of  the  Turner  Broad- 
casting System,  was  slated  to  start  broadcasting  entertainment 
programs,  including  top  Hollywood  films,  in  1995. 

Competition  from  the  satellite  stations  brought  radical 
change  to  Doordarshan  by  cutting  its  audience  and  threaten- 
ing its  advertising  revenues  at  a  time  when  the  government  was 
pressuring  it  to  pay  for  expenditures  from  internal  revenues.  In 


502 


Government  and  Politics 


response,  Doordarshan  decided  in  1993  to  start  five  new  chan- 
nels in  addition  to  its  original  National  Channel.  Programming 
was  radically  transformed,  and  controversial  news  shows,  soap 
operas,  and  coverage  of  high-fashion  events  proliferated.  Of 
the  new  Doordarshan  channels,  however,  only  the  Metro  Chan- 
nel, which  carries  MTV  music  videos  and  other  popular  shows, 
has  survived  in  the  face  of  the  new  trend  for  talk  programs  that 
engage  in  a  potpourri  of  racy  topics. 

The  Rise  of  Civil  Society 

Political  participation  in  India  has  been  transformed  in 
many  ways  since  the  1960s.  New  social  groups  have  entered  the 
political  arena  and  begun  to  use  their  political  resources  to 
shape  the  political  process.  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled 
Tribes,  previously  excluded  from  politics  because  of  their  posi- 
tion at  the  bottom  of  India's  social  hierarchy,  have  begun  to 
take  full  advantage  of  the  opportunities  presented  by  India's 
democracy.  Women  and  environmentalists  constitute  new  polit- 
ical categories  that  transcend  traditional  distinctions.  The 
spread  of  social  movements  and  voluntary  organizations  has 
shown  that  despite  the  difficulties  of  India's  political  parties 
and  state  institutions,  India's  democratic  tendency  continues  to 
thrive. 

An  important  aspect  of  the  rise  of  civil  society  is  the  prolifer- 
ation of  voluntary  or  nongovernmental  organizations.  Esti- 
mates of  their  number  ranged  from  50,000  to  100,000  in  1993. 
To  some  extent,  the  rise  of  voluntary  organizations  has  been 
sponsored  by  the  Indian  state.  For  instance,  the  central  govern- 
ment's Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  of  fiscal  years  (FY — see  Glossary) 
1985-89  recognized  the  contributions  of  voluntary  organiza- 
tions in  accelerating  development  and  substantially  increased 
their  funding.  A  1987  survey  of  1,273  voluntary  agencies 
reported  that  47  percent  received  some  form  of  funding  from 
the  central  government.  Voluntary  organizations  also  have 
thrived  on  foreign  donations,  which  in  1991-92  contributed 
more  than  US$400  million  to  some  15,000  organizations.  Some 
nongovernmental  organizations  cooperate  with  the  central 
government  in  a  manner  that  augments  its  capacity  to  imple- 
ment public  policy,  such  as  poverty  alleviation,  for  example,  in 
a  decentralized  manner.  Other  nongovernmental  organiza- 
tions also  serve  as  watchdogs,  attempting  to  pressure  govern- 
ment agencies  to  uphold  the  spirit  of  the  state's  laws  and 
implement  policies  in  accord  with  their  stated  objectives.  Non- 


503 


India:  A  Country  Study 


governmental  organizations  also  endeavor  to  raise  the  political 
consciousness  of  various  social  groups,  encouraging  them  to 
demand  their  rights  and  challenge  social  inequities.  Finally, 
some  social  groups  serve  as  innovators,  experimenting  with 
new  approaches  to  solving  social  problems. 

Beginning  in  the  1970s,  activists  began  to  form  broad-based 
social  movements,  which  proved  powerful  advocates  for  inter- 
ests that  they  perceived  as  neglected  by  the  state  and  political 
parties.  Perhaps  the  most  powerful  has  been  the  farmers'  move- 
ment, which  has  organized  hundreds  of  thousands  of  demon- 
strators in  New  Delhi  and  has  pressured  the  government  for 
higher  prices  on  agricultural  commodities  and  more  invest- 
ment in  rural  areas.  Members  of  Scheduled  Castes  led  by  the 
Dalit  Panthers  have  moved  to  rearticulate  the  identity  of 
former  Untouchables.  Women  from  an  array  of  diverse  organi- 
zations now  interact  in  conferences  and  exchange  ideas  in 
order  to  define  and  promote  women's  issues.  Simultaneously, 
an  environmental  movement  has  developed  that  has  attempted 
to  compel  the  government  to  be  more  responsive  to  environ- 
mental concerns  and  has  attempted  to  redefine  the  concept  of 
"development"  to  include  respect  for  indigenous  cultures  and 
environmental  sustainability. 

With  its  highly  competitive  elections,  relatively  independent 
judiciary,  boisterous  media,  and  thriving  civil  society,  India  con- 
tinues to  possess  one  of  the  most  democratic  political  systems 
of  all  developing  countries.  Nevertheless,  Indian  democracy  is 
under  stress.  Political  power  within  the  Indian  state  has 
become  increasingly  centralized  at  a  time  when  India's  civil 
society  has  become  mobilized  along  lines  that  reflect  the  coun- 
try's remarkable  social  diversity.  The  country's  political  parties, 
which  might  aggregate  the  country's  diverse  social  interests  in  a 
way  that  would  ensure  the  responsiveness  of  state  authority,  are 
in  crisis.  The  Congress  (I)  has  been  in  a  state  of  decline,  as 
reflected  in  the  erosion  of  its  traditional  coalition  of  support 
and  the  implication  of  Congress  (I)  governments  in  a  series  of 
scandals.  The  party  has  failed  to  generate  an  enlightened  lead- 
ership that  might  rejuvenate  it  and  replace  the  increasingly  dis- 
credited Nehruvian  socialism  with  a  novel  programmatic 
appeal.  The  Congress  (I)'s  split  in  May  1995  added  a  new 
impediment  to  efforts  to  reinvigorate  the  party. 

The  BJP,  although  it  has  a  stronger  party  organization,  in 
1995  had  yet  to  find  a  way  to  transcend  the  limits  of  its  militant 
Hindu  nationalism  and  fashion  a  program  that  would  appeal  to 


504 


Government  and  Politics 

diverse  social  groups  and  enable  it  to  build  a  majority  coalition 
in  India.  The  Janata  Dal  continued  to  suffer  from  lack  of  lead- 
ership, inadequate  resources,  and  incessant  factionalism.  As  its 
bases  of  power  shrink,  it  stood  in  danger  of  being  reduced  to  a 
party  with  only  a  few  regional  strongholds.  As  regional  group- 
ings and  members  of  the  lower  echelons  of  India's  caste  system 
become  more  assertive,  regional  and  caste  parties  may  play  a 
more  prominent  role  in  India's  political  system.  At  this  point, 
however,  it  is  difficult  to  envision  how  they  might  stabilize 
India's  political  system. 

The  unresponsiveness  of  India's  political  parties  and  govern- 
ment has  encouraged  the  Indian  public  to  mobilize  through 
nongovernmental  organizations  and  social  movements.  The 
consequent  development  of  India's  civil  society  has  made  Indi- 
ans less  confident  of  the  transformative  power  of  the  state  and 
more  confident  of  the  power  of  the  individual  and  local  com- 
munity. This  development  is  shifting  a  larger  share  of  the  initia- 
tive for  resolving  India's  social  problems  from  the  state  to 
society.  Fashioning  party  and  state  institutions  that  will  accom- 
modate the  diverse  interests  that  are  now  mobilized  in  Indian 
society  is  the  major  challenge  confronting  the  Indian  polity  in 
the  1990s.

Chapter  9.  Foreign  Relations 


Depiction  of  a  boat  from  a  coastal  area  of  South  India 


INDIA'S  FOREIGN  RELATIONS  reflect  a  traditional  policy  of 
nonalignment  (see  Glossary),  the  exigencies  of  domestic  eco- 
nomic reform  and  development,  and  the  changing  post-Cold 
War  international  environment.  India's  relations  with  the 
world  have  evolved  considerably  since  the  British  colonial 
period  (1757-1947),  when  a  foreign  power  monopolized  exter- 
nal relations  and  defense  relations.  On  independence  in  1947, 
few  Indians  had  experience  in  making  or  conducting  foreign 
policy.  However,  the  country's  oldest  political  party,  the  Indian 
National  Congress  (the  Congress — see  Glossary),  had  estab- 
lished a  small  foreign  department  in  1925  to  make  overseas 
contacts  and  to  publicize  its  freedom  struggle.  From  the  late 
1920s  on,  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  who  had  the  most  long-standing 
interest  in  world  affairs  among  independence  leaders,  formu- 
lated the  Congress  stance  on  international  issues.  As  a  member 
of  the  interim  government  in  1946,  Nehru  articulated  India's 
approach  to  the  world. 

During  Nehru's  tenure  as  prime  minister  (1947-64),  he 
achieved  a  domestic  consensus  on  the  definition  of  Indian 
national  interests  and  foreign  policy  goals — building  a  unified 
and  integrated  nation-state  based  on  secular,  democratic  prin- 
ciples; defending  Indian  territory  and  protecting  its  security 
interests;  guaranteeing  India's  independence  internationally 
through  nonalignment;  and  promoting  national  economic 
development  unencumbered  by  overreliance  on  any  country 
or  group  of  countries.  These  objectives  were  closely  related  to 
the  determinants  of  India's  foreign  relations:  the  historical  leg- 
acy of  South  Asia;  India's  geopolitical  position  and  security 
requirements;  and  India's  economic  needs  as  a  large  develop- 
ing nation.  From  1947  until  the  late  1980s,  New  Delhi's  foreign 
policy  goals  enabled  it  to  achieve  some  successes  in  carving  out 
an  independent  international  role.  Regionally,  India  was  the 
predominant  power  because  of  its  size,  its  population  (the 
world's  second-largest  after  China),  and  its  growing  military 
strength.  However,  relations  with  its  neighbors,  Pakistan  in  par- 
ticular, were  often  tense  and  fraught  with  conflict.  In  addition, 
globally  India's  nonaligned  stance  was  not  a  viable  substitute 
for  the  political  and  economic  role  it  wished  to  play. 

India's  international  influence  varied  over  the  years  after 
independence.  Indian  prestige  and  moral  authority  were  high 


509 


India:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  1950s  and  facilitated  the  acquisition  of  developmental 
assistance  from  both  East  and  West.  Although  the  prestige 
stemmed  from  India's  nonaligned  stance,  the  nation  was 
unable  to  prevent  Cold  War  politics  from  becoming  inter- 
twined with  interstate  relations  in  South  Asia.  In  the  1960s  and 
1970s,  New  Delhi's  international  position  among  developed 
and  developing  countries  faded  in  the  course  of  wars  with 
China  and  Pakistan,  disputes  with  other  countries  in  South 
Asia,  and  India's  attempt  to  balance  Pakistan's  support  from 
the  United  States  and  China  by  signing  the  Treaty  of  Peace, 
Friendship,  and  Cooperation  with  the  Soviet  Union  in  August 
1971.  Although  India  obtained  substantial  Soviet  military  and 
economic  aid,  which  helped  to  strengthen  the  nation,  India's 
influence  was  undercut  regionally  and  internationally  by  the 
perception  that  its  friendship  with  the  Soviet  Union  prevented 
a  more  forthright  condemnation  of  the  Soviet  presence  in 
Afghanistan.  In  the  1980s,  New  Delhi  improved  relations  with 
the  United  States,  other  developed  countries,  and  China  while 
continuing  close  ties  with  the  Soviet  Union.  Relations  with  its 
South  Asian  neighbors,  especially  Pakistan,  Sri  Lanka,  and 
Nepal,  occupied  much  of  the  energies  of  the  Ministry  of  Exter- 
nal Affairs. 

In  the  1990s,  India's  economic  problems  and  the  demise  of 
the  bipolar  world  political  system  have  forced  New  Delhi  to 
reassess  its  foreign  policy  and  to  adjust  its  foreign  relations. 
Previous  policies  proved  inadequate  to  cope  with  the  serious 
domestic  and  international  problems  facing  India.  The  end  of 
the  Cold  War  gutted  the  core  meaning  of  nonalignment  and 
left  Indian  foreign  policy  without  significant  direction.  The 
hard,  pragmatic  considerations  of  the  early  1990s  were  still 
viewed  within  the  nonaligned  framework  of  the  past,  but  the 
disintegration  of  the  Soviet  Union  removed  much  of  India's 
international  leverage,  for  which  relations  with  Russia  and  the 
other  post-Soviet  states  could  not  compensate. 

Pragmatic  security,  economic  considerations,  and  domestic 
political  influences  have  reinforced  New  Delhi's  reliance  on 
the  United  States  and  other  developed  countries;  caused  New 
Delhi  to  abandon  its  anti-Israeli  policy  in  the  Middle  East;  and 
resulted  in  the  courtship  of  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  the 
newly  industrializing  economies  of  East  and  Southeast  Asia. 
Although  India  shares  the  concerns  of  Russia,  China,  and 
many  members  of  the  Nonaligned  Movement  (see  Glossary) 
about  the  preeminent  position  of  the  United  States  and  other 


510 


Foreign  Relations 


developed  countries,  different  national  interests  and  percep- 
tions make  it  improbable  that  India  can  turn  cooperation  with 
these  countries  to  its  advantage  on  most  international  issues. 
Furthermore,  although  Cold  War  politics  have  ceased  to  be  a 
factor  in  South  Asia,  the  most  intractable  problems  in  India's 
relations  with  Pakistan — conflict  over  Kashmir,  support  for  sep- 
aratists, and  nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  programs — still  face 
the  two  countries. 

Foreign  Policy  Formulation 

Role  of  the  Prime  Minister 

Nehru  set  the  pattern  for  the  formation  of  Indian  foreign 
policy:  a  strong  personal  role  for  the  prime  minister  but  a  weak 
institutional  structure.  Nehru  served  concurrently  as  prime 
minister  and  minister  of  external  affairs;  he  made  all  major  for- 
eign policy  decisions  himself  after  consulting  with  his  advisers 
and  then  entrusted  the  conduct  of  international  affairs  to 
senior  members  of  the  Indian  Foreign  Service.  His  successors 
continued  to  exercise  considerable  control  over  India's  inter- 
national dealings,  although  they  generally  appointed  separate 
ministers  of  external  affairs. 

India's  second  prime  minister,  Lai  Bahadur  Shastri  (1964- 
66),  expanded  the  Office  of  Prime  Minister  (sometimes  called 
the  Prime  Minister's  Secretariat)  and  enlarged  its  powers  (see 
The  Executive,  ch.  8).  By  the  1970s,  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
Minister  had  become  the  de  facto  coordinator  and  supraminis- 
try  of  the  Indian  government.  The  enhanced  role  of  the  office 
strengthened  the  prime  minister's  control  over  foreign  policy 
making  at  the  expense  of  the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs. 
Advisers  in  the  office  provided  channels  of  information  and 
policy  recommendations  in  addition  to  those  offered  by  the 
Ministry  of  External  Affairs.  A  subordinate  part  of  the  office — 
the  Research  and  Analysis  Wing — functioned  in  ways  that  sig- 
nificantly expanded  the  information  available  to  the  prime 
minister  and  his  advisers.  The  Research  and  Analysis  Wing 
gathered  intelligence,  provided  intelligence  analysis  to  the 
Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  and  conducted  covert  operations 
abroad. 

The  prime  minister's  control  and  reliance  on  personal  advis- 
ers in  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  was  particularly  strong 
under  the  tenures  of  Indira  Gandhi  (1966-77  and  1980-84) 
and  her  son,  Rajiv  (1984-89),  who  succeeded  her,  and  weaker

during  the  periods  of  coalition  governments  under  Morarji 
Desai  (1977-79),  Viswanath  Pratap  (V.P.)  Singh  (1989-90), 
Chandra  Shekhar  (1990-91),  and  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao  (starting 
in  June  1991).  Although  observers  find  it  difficult  to  determine 
whether  the  locus  of  decision-making  authority  on  any  particu- 
lar issue  lies  with  the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs,  the  Council 
of  Ministers,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  or  the  prime 
minister  himself,  nevertheless  in  the  1990s  India's  prime  minis- 
ters retain  their  dominance  in  the  conduct  of  foreign  relations. 

Ministry  of  External  Affairs 

The  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  is  the  governmental  body 
most  concerned  with  foreign  affairs,  with  responsibility  for 
some  aspects  of  foreign  policy  making,  actual  implementation 
of  policy,  and  daily  conduct  of  international  relations.  The 
ministry's  duties  include  providing  timely  information  and 
analysis  to  the  prime  minister  and  minister  of  external  affairs, 
recommending  specific  measures  when  necessary,  planning 
policy  for  the  future,  and  maintaining  communications  with 
foreign  missions  in  New  Delhi.  In  1994  the  ministry  adminis- 
tered 149  diplomatic  missions  abroad,  which  were  staffed 
largely  by  members  of  the  Indian  Foreign  Service.  The  ministry 
is  headed  by  the  minister  of  external  affairs,  who  holds  cabinet 
rank  and  is  assisted  by  a  deputy  minister  and  a  foreign  secre- 
tary, and  secretaries  of  state  from  the  Indian  Foreign  Service. 

In  1994  the  total  cadre  strength  of  the  Indian  Foreign  Ser- 
vice numbered  3,490,  of  which  some  1,890  held  posts  abroad 
and  1,600  served  at  the  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  headquar- 
ters in  New  Delhi.  Members  of  the  Indian  Foreign  Service  are 
recruited  through  annual  written  and  oral  competitive  exami- 
nations and  come  from  a  great  variety  of  regional,  economic, 
and  social  backgrounds.  The  Foreign  Service  Training  Institute 
provides  a  wide  range  of  courses  for  foreign  service  officers, 
including  a  basic  professional  course,  a  comprehensive  course 
in  diplomacy  and  international  relations  for  foreign  service 
recruits,  a  refresher  course  for  commercial  representatives, 
and  foreign  language  training. 

The  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  has  thirteen  territorial  divi- 
sions, each  covering  a  large  area  of  the  world,  such  as  Eastern 
Europe  and  the  post-Soviet  states,  or  smaller  areas  on  India's 
periphery,  such  as  Afghanistan,  Iran,  and  Pakistan.  The  minis- 
try also  has  functional  divisions  dealing  with  external  publicity, 
protocol,  consular  affairs,  Indians  abroad,  the  United  Nations

(UN)  and  other  international  organizations,  and  international 
conferences.  Two  of  the  eighteen  specialized  divisions  and 
units  of  the  ministry  are  of  special  note.  The  Policy  Planning 
and  Research  Division  conducts  research  and  prepares  briefs 
and  background  papers  for  top  policy  makers  and  ministry  offi- 
cials. The  briefs  cover  wide-ranging  issues  relating  to  India's 
foreign  policy  and  role  in  the  changing  international  environ- 
ment, and  background  papers  provide  information  on  issues 
concerning  international  developments.  The  Economic  Divi- 
sion has  the  important  task  of  handling  foreign  economic  rela- 
tions. This  division  augments  its  activities  to  reflect  changes  in 
the  government's  economic  policy  and  the  international  eco- 
nomic environment  (see  Liberalization  in  the  Early  1990s,  ch. 
6).  In  1990  the  division  established  the  Economic  Coordina- 
tion Unit  to  assess  the  impact  on  India  of  the  Persian  Gulf  crisis 
arising  from  Iraq's  invasion  of  Kuwait,  changes  in  Eastern 
Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union,  and  formation  of  a  single  mar- 
ket in  the  European  Economic  Community  (after  1993  the 
European  Union),  as  well  as  to  promote  foreign  investment. 
The  Economic  Division  also  runs  India's  foreign  aid  programs, 
including  the  Indian  Technical  and  Economic  Cooperation 
Programme,  the  Special  Commonwealth  African  Assistance 
Programme,  and  aid  to  individual  developing  countries  in 
South  Asia  and  elsewhere.  The  ministry  runs  the  Indian  Coun-

cil  for  Cultural  Relations,  which  arranges  exhibits,  visits,  and 
cultural  exchanges  with  other  countries  and  oversees  the  activi- 
ties of  foreign  cultural  centers  in  India. 

The  Ministry  of  External  Affairs  had  a  budget  of  Rs8.8  bil- 
lion (for  value  of  the  rupee — see  Glossary)  for  fiscal  year  (FY — 
see  Glossary)  1994.  The  largest  single  expense  was  the  mainte- 
nance of  missions  abroad:  Rs3.8  billion,  or  close  to  44  percent 
of  the  ministry's  expenditures.  Foreign  aid  totaled  Rsl.3  bil- 
lion, or  15.1  percent  of  the  ministry's  expenditures.  The  single 
largest  recipient — as  in  most  previous  years — was  Bhutan 
(Rs690  million),  whose  government  operations  and  develop- 
ment are  heavily  subsidized  by  India. 

Other  Government  Organizations 

Besides  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Ministry  of 
External  Affairs,  there  are  other  government  agencies  that 
have  foreign  policy-making  roles.  In  theory,  the  ministers  of 
defence,  commerce,  and  finance  provide  input  to  foreign  pol- 
icy decisions  discussed  in  cabinet  meetings,  but  their  influence 
in  practical  terms  is  overshadowed  by  the  predominant  posi- 
tion of  the  prime  minister  and  his  advisers.  The  armed  forces 
are  removed  from  policy  making  and  have  influence  only 
through  the  minister  of  defence,  to  whom  they  are  subordinate 
(see  Organization  and  Equipment  of  the  Armed  Forces,  ch. 
10). 

Only  a  limited  role  in  foreign  policy  making  is  provided  for 
India's  bicameral  Parliament  (see  The  Legislature,  ch.  8). 
Negotiated  treaties  and  international  agreements  become 
legally  binding  on  the  state  but  are  not  part  of  domestic  law 
unless  passed  by  an  act  of  Parliament,  which  also  has  no  say  in 
the  appointment  of  diplomats  and  other  government  represen- 
tatives dealing  with  foreign  affairs.  For  the  most  part,  because 
of  the  widespread  domestic  support  for  India's  foreign  policy, 
Parliament  has  endorsed  government  actions  or  sought  infor- 
mation. The  most  important  official  link  between  Parliament 
and  the  executive  in  the  mid-1990s  is  the  Committee  on  Exter- 
nal Affairs  of  the  Lok  Sabha  (House  of  the  People),  the  lower 
chamber  of  Parliament.  The  committee  meets  regularly  and 
draws  its  membership  from  many  parties.  Usually  it  has  served 
either  as  a  forum  for  government  briefings  or  as  a  deliberative 
body.

Foreign  Relations 


The  Role  of  Political  and  Interest  Groups 

Institutional  connections  between  public  opinion  and  for- 
eign policy  making  are  tenuous  in  the  mid-1990s,  as  they  have 
been  since  independence.  Although  international  issues 
receive  considerable  attention  in  the  media  and  in  academic 
circles,  the  views  expressed  by  journalists  and  scholars  in  these 
publications  have  little  impact  on  foreign  policy  making.  Inter- 
est groups  concerned  with  foreign  relations  exist  inside  and 
outside  Parliament  but  are  less  organized  or  articulate  than  in 
most  other  democracies.  These  organizations  include  such 
business  groups  as  the  Federation  of  Indian  Chambers  of  Com- 
merce International;  religious  groups,  especially  among  Mus- 
lims; and  various  friendship  or  cultural  societies  promoting 
closer  ties  with  specific  countries.  Among  the  latter  are  infor- 
mal groups  known  as  the  "Russian"  and  "American"  lobbies. 

Opposition  political  parties  often  have  more  effectively  artic- 
ulated differing  views  regarding  foreign  policy,  but  even  these 
views  had  little  impact  on  policy  making  until  the  1990s.  Other 
than  the  Congress  (I) — (I  for  Indira),  only  the  communist  par- 
ties, the  Janata  Party,  and  the  Jana  Sangh  and  one  of  its  succes- 
sors, the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP — Indian  People's  Party), 
developed  coherent  platforms  on  foreign  policy  (see  Political 
Parties,  ch.  8).  After  the  mid-1950s,  the  communist  parties 
were  broadly  supportive  of  Indian  foreign  policy.  At  the  begin- 
ning of  Janata  Party  rule  (1977-79),  Prime  Minister  Desai 
promised  to  return  to  "genuine  nonalignment."  However,  secu- 
rity considerations  forced  Desai  and  his  minister  of  external 
affairs,  Jana  Sangh  stalwart  Atal  Behari  Vajpayee,  to  adhere  to 
the  foreign  policy  path  carved  out  by  the  Congress  (I) — non- 
alignment  with  a  pro-Soviet  orientation.  BJP  foreign  policy 
positions  differed  most  strongly  from  those  of  the  Congress  (I). 
The  BJP  criticized  nonalignment  and  advocated  a  more  vigor- 
ous use  of  India's  power  to  defend  national  interests  from  ero- 
sion at  the  hands  of  Pakistan  and  China.  The  BJP  also  favored 
the  overt  acquisition  of  nuclear  weapons.  By  the  early  1990s, 
the  rising  political  fortunes  of  the  BJP  had  an  impact  on  the 
conduct  of  foreign  policy,  forcing  the  coalition  government  of 
V.P.  Singh,  which  depended  on  BJP  support,  to  take  a  hard  line 
in  the  Kashmir  crisis  in  1990.  Pressure  from  the  Congress  (I) 
also  had  an  impact  on  India's  response  to  the  Persian  Gulf  cri- 
sis (see  Middle  East;  Central  Asia,  this  ch.).

Determinants  of  Foreign  Relations 

Historical  Legacy 

During  the  British  colonial  period,  India  was  a  large  political 
entity  bordered  by  the  buffer  states  of  Afghanistan,  Nepal,  Sik- 
kim,  Bhutan,  and  Tibet  to  the  north  and  Ceylon  (as  Sri  Lanka 
was  then  called)  to  the  south.  The  withdrawal  of  the  British  and 
partition  in  1947,  which  created  India  and  Pakistan,  resulted  in 
geographical  boundaries  that  cut  across  regional  religious, 
social,  ethnic,  and  linguistic  groups,  and  disrupted  economic 
and  cultural  ties.  A  slice  of  eastern  India  and  the  westernmost 
part  of  India  became  the  East  Wing  and  West  Wing  of  Pakistan, 
respectively,  and  in  1971  the  East  Wing  became  Bangladesh. 

After  independence  India's  leaders  attempted  to  build  a  sec- 
ular state  in  which  national  identity  would  supersede  regional, 
religious,  or  cultural  identities.  They  regarded  the  movements 
for  regional  autonomy  or  independence  in  Punjab,  Jammu  and 
Kashmir,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Assam  as  threats  to  Indian  unity,  par- 
ticularly because  Indian  leaders  believed  that  their  neigh- 
bors— Pakistan,  later  Bangladesh,  and  Sri  Lanka — supported 
these  movements.  Furthermore,  despite  the  commitment  of 
Congress  (I)  leaders  to  the  secular  ideal,  communal  tensions 
and  the  rising  influence  of  Hindu  political  parties  pushed  the 
Indian  government  increasingly  to  identify  Indian  greatness 
with  Hinduism.  The  inability  of  Indian  leaders  to  restrain  anti- 
Muslim  communal  violence  and  the  Kashmir  policy  of  the 
Indian  government  resulted  in  continual  tensions  in  relations 
with  its  Muslim  neighbors.  Thus,  internal  security  and  domes- 
tic political  considerations,  which  stemmed  from  the  perceived 
goals  of  building  national  identity  and  preserving  national 
unity,  permeated  India's  relations  with  its  neighbors. 

Security  Perceptions 

The  British  colonial  rulers  regarded  most  of  South  Asia  as  a 
strategic  unit  and  endeavored  to  exclude  external  powers  from 
the  region  (see  The  British  Empire  in  India,  ch.  1).  In  defend- 
ing this  strategic  unit,  the  British  established  a  barrier  of  buffer 
states  around  India,  attempting  to  cut  off  India  from  Russia 
and  China,  which  could  threaten  from  the  north,  and  used 
naval  power  to  protect  India  from  the  south.  India's  postinde- 
pendence  leaders  adapted  this  concept  by  defining  a  position 
in  cultural  as  well  as  geographical  terms.  This  view  led  them  to 


516 


Foreign  Relations 


view  India  as  the  region's  preeminent  power  whose  right  to 
involve  itself  in  its  neighbor's  affairs  was  justified  in  terms  of 
the  common  ethnicity  and  common  security  needs  of  South 
Asia. 

This  geostrategic  perception  affected  India's  foreign  rela- 
tions in  three  ways.  First,  India  endeavored,  by  treaty,  alliance, 
or  threats  of  force  or  economic  embargo,  to  overturn  any  move 
by  its  neighbors  that  it  deemed  inimical  to  its  own  security 
interests.  Of  its  neighbors,  only  Pakistan  and  China  have  been 
able  to  resist  or  thwart  Indian  actions.  The  Indian  elite 
regarded  their  country  as  a  regional  peacekeeper  whose  moves 
were  entirely  defensive,  rather  than  as  a  regional  enforcer  who 
imposed  onerous  conditions  on  its  neighbors  by  virtue  of  its 
size  and  military  might.  Second,  India  viewed  the  intrusion  of 
extraregional  powers  into  South  Asia  as  a  threat  to  Indian  secu- 
rity and  to  India's  position  as  the  predominant  country  in  the 
region.  India  opposed  any  attempts  by  powers  external  to  the 
region,  whether  by  invitation  of  New  Delhi's  neighbors  or  not, 
to  involve  themselves  or  to  establish  a  presence  in  the  region. 
Therefore  India  was  critical  of  Pakistan's  alliance  with  China, 
the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan,  and  the  United  States  naval 
presence  on  Diego  Garcia  in  the  central  Indian  Ocean  and  its 
military  relations  with  Pakistan.  India  also  resisted  Moscow's 
entreaties  to  grant  the  Soviet  navy  base  rights  despite  the  1971 
friendship  treaty  with  the  Soviet  Union. 

India's  program  to  build  the  military  might  necessary  to 
defend  its  territory  and  security  interests  became  intertwined 
in  its  foreign  policy.  New  Delhi's  defense  buildup — particularly 
its  covert  nuclear  weapons  program  and  its  drive  to  develop 
ballistic  missiles — affected  relations  with  Pakistan,  China,  and 
the  United  States.  India's  refusal  to  sign  the  1968  Treaty  on  the 
Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  stemmed  as  much  from 
Pakistan's  similar  stance  as  from  India's  belief  that  the  treaty 
discriminated  against  the  development  of  peaceful  nuclear 
technology  by  nonnuclear  weapons  states  and  failed  to  prevent 
the  qualitative  and  quantitative  vertical  proliferation  of  nuclear 
weapons  among  the  nations  already  possessing  nuclear  arms. 
In  1995,  when  174  other  nations  approved  an  indefinite  exten- 
sion of  the  treaty,  India  continued  to  refuse  to  sign,  denounc- 
ing the  treaty  as  "perpetuating  nuclear  discrimination."  In 
addition,  in  the  early  1990s  India's  sizable  defense  expendi- 
tures became  an  issue  in  New  Delhi's  attempts  to  secure  assis- 


517

tance  from  developed  countries  and  multilateral  lending 
bodies  (see  Defense  Spending,  ch.  10). 

Nonalignment 

Nonalignment  had  its  origins  in  India's  colonial  experience 
and  the  nonviolent  independence  struggle  led  by  the  Con- 
gress, which  left  India  determined  to  be  the  master  of  its  fate  in 
an  international  system  dominated  politically  by  Cold  War  alli- 
ances and  economically  by  Western  capitalism.  The  principles 
of  nonalignment,  as  articulated  by  Nehru  and  his  successors, 
were  preservation  of  India's  freedom  of  action  internationally 
through  refusal  to  align  India  with  any  bloc  or  alliance,  particu- 
larly those  led  by  the  United  States  or  the  Soviet  Union;  nonvi- 
olence and  international  cooperation  as  a  means  of  settling 
international  disputes;  the  Panch  Shila  (see  Glossary),  or  the 
five  principles  of  peaceful  coexistence,  as  the  basis  for  relations 
between  states;  opposition  to  colonialism  and  racism;  and 
international  cooperation  to  alleviate  poverty  and  promote 
economic  development  (see  Nehru's  Legacy,  ch.  1).  Nonalign- 
ment was  a  consistent  feature  of  Indian  foreign  policy  by  the 
late  1940s  and  enjoyed  strong,  almost  unquestioning  support 
among  the  Indian  elite. 

In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  Nehru's  concept  of  nonalignment 
brought  India  considerable  international  prestige  among 
newly  independent  states  that  shared  India's  concerns  about 
the  military  confrontation  between  the  superpowers  and  the 
influence  of  the  former  colonial  powers.  New  Delhi  used  non- 
alignment  to  establish  a  significant  role  for  itself  as  a  leader  of 
the  Third  World  in  such  multilateral  organizations  as  the 
United  Nations  (UN)  and  the  Nonaligned  Movement  (see  Par- 
ticipation in  International  Organizations,  this  ch.).  The  signing 
of  the  Treaty  of  Peace,  Friendship,  and  Cooperation  between 
India  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  1971  and  India's  involvement  in 
the  internal  affairs  of  its  smaller  neighbors  in  the  1970s  and 
1980s  tarnished  New  Delhi's  image  as  a  nonaligned  nation  and 
led  some  observers  to  note  that  in  practice,  nonalignment 
applied  only  to  India's  relations  with  countries  outside  South 
Asia. 

The  early  1990s  demise  of  the  bipolar  world  system,  which 
had  existed  since  the  end  of  World  War  II,  shook  the  underpin- 
nings of  India's  foreign  policy.  The  Cold  War  system  of  alli- 
ances had  been  rendered  meaningless  by  the  collapse  of  the 
East  European  communist  states,  the  dissolution  of  the  Warsaw 


518 


Foreign  Relations 


Treaty  Organization  (Warsaw  Pact),  and  the  demise  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  In  the  early  1990s,  most  colonies  had  become 
independent,  and  apartheid  in  South  Africa  was  being  disman- 
tled, diminishing  the  value  of  anticolonialism  and  making  it 
impossible  for  antiracism  to  serve  as  a  rallying  point  for  inter- 
national political  action  (India  and  South  Africa  restored  full 
diplomatic  relations  in  1993  after  a  thirty-nine-year  lapse).  The 
Panch  Shila,  peaceful  resolution  of  international  disputes,  and 
international  cooperation  to  spur  economic  development — 
which  was  being  enhanced  by  domestic  economic  reforms — 
were  broad  objectives  in  a  changing  world.  Thus,  the  1990s  saw 
India  redefining  nonalignment  and  the  view  of  India's  place  in 
the  world. 

Overview  of  Foreign  Relations 
South  Asia 

Pakistan 

Relations  with  Pakistan  have  demanded  a  high  proportion  of 
India's  international  energies  and  undoubtedly  will  continue 
to  do  so.  India  and  Pakistan  have  divergent  national  ideologies 
and  have  been  unable  to  establish  a  mutually  acceptable  power 
equation  in  South  Asia.  The  national  ideologies  of  pluralism, 
democracy,  and  secularism  for  India  and  of  Islam  for  Pakistan 
grew  out  of  the  preindependence  struggle  between  the  Con- 
gress and  the  All-India  Muslim  League  (Muslim  League — see 
Glossary),  and  in  the  early  1990s  the  line  between  domestic 
and  foreign  politics  in  India's  relations  with  Pakistan  remained 
blurred.  Because  great-power  competition — between  the 
United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  and  between  the  Soviet 
Union  and  China — became  intertwined  with  the  conflicts 
between  India  and  Pakistan,  India  was  unable  to  attain  its  goal 
of  insulating  South  Asia  from  global  rivalries.  This  superpower 
involvement  enabled  Pakistan  to  use  external  force  in  the  face 
of  India's  superior  endowments  of  population  and  resources. 

The  most  difficult  problem  in  relations  between  India  and 
Pakistan  since  partition  in  August  1947  has  been  their  dispute 
over  Kashmir.  Pakistan's  leaders  did  not  accept  the  legality  of 
the  Instrument  of  Accession  of  Kashmir  to  India,  and  unde- 
clared war  broke  out  in  October  1947  (see  The  Experience  of 
Wars,  ch.  10).  It  was  the  first  of  three  conflicts  between  the  two 
countries.  Pakistan's  representatives  ever  since  have  argued 


519 


India:  A  Country  Study 

that  the  people  of  Kashmir  should  be  allowed  to  exercise  their 
right  to  self-determination  through  a  plebiscite,  as  promised  by 
Nehru  and  required  by  UN  Security  Council  resolutions  in 
1948  and  1949.  The  inconclusive  fighting  led  to  a  UN-arranged 
cease-fire  starting  on  January  1,  1949.  On  July  18,  1949,  the  two 
sides  signed  the  Karachi  Agreement  establishing  a  cease-fire 
line  that  was  to  be  supervised  by  the  UN.  The  demarcation  left 
Srinagar  and  almost  139,000  square  kilometers  under  Indian 
control  and  83,807  square  kilometers  under  Pakistani  control. 
Of  these  two  areas,  China  occupied  37,555  square  kilometers  in 
India's  Ladakh  District  (part  of  which  is  known  as  Aksai  Chin) 
in  1962  and  Pakistan  ceded,  in  effect,  5,180  square  kilometers 
in  the  Karakoram  area  to  China  when  the  two  countries  demar- 
cated their  common  border  in  1961-65,  leaving  India  with 
101,387  square  kilometers  and  Pakistan  with  78,387  square 
kilometers.  Starting  in  January  1949,  and  still  in  place  in  1995, 
the  UN  Military  Observer  Group  in  India  and  Pakistan  was 
tasked  with  supervising  the  cease-fire  in  Kashmir.  The  group 
comprises  thirty-eight  observers — from  Belgium,  Chile,  Den- 
mark, Finland,  Italy,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  Uruguay — who 
rotate  their  headquarters  every  six  months  between  Srinagar 
(summer)  and  Rawalpindi,  Pakistan  (winter). 

In  1952  the  elected  and  overwhelmingly  Muslim  Constituent 
Assembly  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  led  by  the  popular  Sheikh 
Mohammed  Abdullah,  voted  in  favor  of  confirming  accession 
to  India.  Thereafter,  India  regarded  this  vote  as  an  adequate 
expression  of  popular  will  and  demurred  on  holding  a  plebi- 
scite. After  1953 Jammu  and  Kashmir  was  identified  as  standing 
for  the  secular,  pluralistic,  and  democratic  principles  of  the 
Indian  polity.  Nehru  refused  to  discuss  the  subject  bilaterally 
until  1963,  when  India,  under  pressure  from  the  United  States 
and  Britain,  engaged  in  six  rounds  of  secret  talks  with  Pakistan 
on  "Kashmir  and  other  related  issues."  These  negotiations 
failed,  as  did  the  1964  attempt  at  mediation  made  by  Abdullah, 
who  recently  had  been  released  from  a  long  detention  by  the 
Indian  government  because  of  his  objections  to  Indian  control. 

Armed  infiltrators  from  Pakistan  crossed  the  cease-fire  line, 
and  the  number  of  skirmishes  between  Indian  and  Pakistani 
troops  increased  in  the  summer  of  1965.  Starting  on  August  5, 
1965,  India  alleged,  Pakistani  forces  began  to  infiltrate  the 
Indian-controlled  portion  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  India  made 
a  countermove  in  late  August,  and  by  September  1,  1965,  the 
second  conflict  had  fully  erupted  as  Pakistan  launched  an 


520 


Foreign  Relations 


attack  across  the  international  line  of  control  in  southwest 
Jammu  and  Kashmir.  Indian  forces  retaliated  on  September  6 
in  Pakistan's  Punjab  Province  and  prevailed  over  Pakistan's 
apparent  superiority  in  tanks  and  aircraft.  A  cease-fire  called  by 
the  UN  Security  Council  on  September  23  was  observed  by 
both  sides.  At  Tashkent,  Uzbekistan,  in  January  1966,  the  bel- 
ligerents agreed  to  restore  the  status  quo  ante  and  to  resolve 
outstanding  issues  by  negotiation. 

The  third  war  between  India  and  Pakistan,  in  December 

1971,  centered  in  the  east  over  the  secession  of  East  Pakistan 
(which  became  Bangladesh),  but  it  also  included  engagements 
in  Kashmir  and  elsewhere  on  the  India-West  Pakistan  front. 
India's  military  victory  was  complete.  The  independence  of 
Bangladesh  was  widely  interpreted  in  India — but  not  in  Paki- 
stan— as  an  ideological  victory  disproving  the  "Two  Nations 
Theory"  pushed  by  the  Muslim  League  and  that  led  to  parti- 
tion in  1947.  At  Shimla  (Simla),  Himachal  Pradesh,  on  July  2, 

1972,  Indira  Gandhi  and  Pakistan's  President  Zulfikar  Ali 
Bhutto  signed  the  Simla  Accord  by  which  India  would  return 
all  personnel  and  captured  territory  in  the  west  and  the  two 
countries  would  "settle  their  differences  by  peaceful  means 
through  bilateral  negotiations."  External  bodies,  including  the 
UN,  were  excluded  from  the  process.  The  fighting  had  resulted 
in  the  capture  of  each  other's  territory  at  various  points  along 
the  cease-fire  line,  but  the  Simla  Accord  defined  a  new  line  of 
control  that  deviated  in  only  minor  ways  from  the  1949  cease- 
fire line.  The  two  sides  agreed  not  to  alter  the  actual  line  of 
control  unilaterally  and  promised  to  respect  it  "without  preju- 
dice to  the  recognized  position  of  either  side."  Both  sides  fur- 
ther undertook  to  "refrain  from  the  threat  or  use  of  force  in 
violation  of  the  line." 

During  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  Jammu  and  Kashmir 
prospered  under  a  virtually  autonomous  government  led  first 
by  Sheikh  Abdullah  and  then  by  his  son  Farooq  Abdullah.  In 
the  summer  of  1984,  differences  between  Srinagar  and  New 
Delhi  led  to  the  dismissal  of  Farooq's  government  by  highly 
questionable  means.  Kashmir  once  again  became  an  irritant  in 
bilateral  relations.  Indian  diplomats  consistently  accused  Paki- 
stan of  trying  to  "internationalize"  the  Kashmir  dispute  in  viola- 
tion of  the  Simla  Accord. 

In  the  mid-  to  late  1980s,  the  political  situation  in  Kashmir 
became  increasingly  unstable.  In  March  1986,  New  Delhi 
invoked  President's  Rule  to  remove  Farooq's  successor,  Ghulam 


521 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Mohammed  Shah,  as  chief  minister,  and  replace  his  rule  with 
that  of  Governor  Jagmohan,  who  had  been  appointed  by  the 
central  government  in  1984.  In  state  elections  held  in  1987, 
Farooq's  political  party,  the  National  Conference,  forged  an 
alliance  with  Rajiv  Gandhi's  Congress  (I),  which  won  a  majority 
in  the  state  elections.  Farooq's  government  failed  to  deal  with 
Kashmir's  economic  problems  and  the  endemic  corruption  of 
its  public  institutions,  providing  fertile  ground  for  militant 
Kashmiris  who  demanded  either  independence  or  association 
with  Pakistan. 

A  rising  spiral  of  unrest,  demonstrations,  armed  attacks  by 
Kashmiri  separatists,  and  armed  suppression  by  Indian  security 
forces  started  in  1988  and  was  still  occurring  in  the  mid-1990s. 
New  Delhi  charged  Islamabad  (Pakistan's  capital)  with  assisting 
insurgents  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  and  Prime  Minister  V.P. 
Singh  warned  that  India  should  be  psychologically  prepared 
for  war.  In  Pakistan  Prime  Minister  Benazir  Bhutto  stated  that 
Pakistan  was  willing  to  fight  a  "thousand-year  war"  for  control 
of  Kashmir.  Under  pressure  from  the  United  States,  the  Soviet 
Union,  and  China  to  avoid  a  military  conflict  and  solve  their 
dispute  under  the  terms  of  the  Simla  Accord,  India  and  Paki- 
stan backed  off  in  May  1990  and  engaged  in  a  series  of  talks  on 
confidence-building  measures  for  the  rest  of  the  year.  Tensions 
reached  new  heights  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s  with  increasing 
internal  unrest  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  charges  of  human 
rights  abuses,  and  repeated  clashes  between  Indian  paramili- 
tary forces  and  Kashmiri  militants,  allegedly  armed  with  Paki- 
stani-supplied weapons  (see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8;  Insurgent 
Movements  and  External  Subversion,  ch.  10). 

A  concurrent  irritant  related  to  the  Kashmir  dispute  was  the 
confrontation  over  the  Siachen  Glacier  near  the  Karakoram 
Pass,  which  is  located  in  northeast  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  In 
1984,  Indian  officials,  citing  Pakistan's  "cartographic  aggres- 
sion" extending  the  line  of  control  northeast  toward  the  Kara- 
koram Pass,  contended  that  Pakistan  intended  to  occupy  the 
Siachen  Glacier  in  order  to  stage  an  attack  into  Indian-con- 
trolled Kashmir.  After  New  Delhi  airlifted  troops  into  the  west- 
ern parts  of  the  Saltoro  Mountains,  Islamabad  deployed  troops 
opposite  them.  Both  sides  maintained  5,000  troops  in  tempera- 
tures averaging  -40°C.  The  estimated  cost  for  India  was  about 
10  percent  of  the  annual  defense  budget  for  FY  1992.  After  sev- 
eral skirmishes  between  the  opposing  troops,  negotiations  to 
resolve  this  confrontation  began  with  five  rounds  of  talks 


522 


Foreign  Relations 


between  1986  and  1989.  After  a  three-year  hiatus  because  of 
tensions  caused  by  the  other  Kashmir  conflict,  a  sixth  round  of 
talks  was  held  in  November  1992.  Some  progress  was  made  on 
the  details  of  an  agreement.  In  March  1994,  Indian  diplomats 
garnered  enough  support  at  the  UN  Human  Rights  Commis- 
sion to  force  Pakistan  to  withdraw  a  resolution  charging  India 
with  human  rights  violations  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  The  two 
sides  were  encouraged  to  resolve  their  dispute  through  bilat- 
eral talks. 

After  the  Soviet  Union  invaded  Afghanistan  in  December 
1979  and  Indira  Gandhi  returned  to  power  in  1980,  she  quickly 
dispatched  a  special  emissary  to  assure  Pakistani  president 
General  Mohammad  Zia  ul  Haq  that  he  could  remove  as  many 
divisions  as  he  wished  from  the  Indian  border  without  fear  of 
any  advantage  being  taken  by  India  and  suggested  talks  on 
reduction  of  force  levels.  Indian  officials  worked  hard  to  pre- 
vent Zia  from  using  the  Afghan  crisis  as  an  opportunity  to  alter 
the  regional  balance  of  power  by  acquiring  advanced  weapons 
from  the  United  States.  In  addition,  Indira  Gandhi  attempted 
to  avoid  antagonizing  the  Soviet  Union,  democratic  elements 
in  Pakistan,  and  the  substantial  anti-Pakistan  lobby  within 
India.  These  largely  secret  efforts  culminated  in  the  visit  of 
Minister  of  External  Affairs  PV.  Narasimha  Rao  to  Pakistan  in 
June  1981,  during  which  time  he  declared  publicly  that  India 
was  "unequivocally  committed  to  respect  Pakistan's  national 
unity,  territorial  integrity,  and  sovereign  equality"  as  well  as  its 
right  to  obtain  arms  for  self-defense. 

Despite  the  setback  suffered  when  the  United  States  and 
Pakistan  announced  a  new  security  and  military  assistance  pro- 
gram, regular  meetings  took  place  between  high  Indian  and 
Pakistani  officials.  These  meetings  were  institutionalized  in  late 
1982  in  the  Indo-Pakistan  Joint  Commission,  which  included 
subcommissions  for  trade,  economics,  information,  and  travel. 
Indira  Gandhi  also  received  Zia  on  November  1,  1982,  in  New 
Delhi,  and  during  their  meeting  they  authorized  their  foreign 
ministers  and  foreign  secretaries  to  proceed  with  talks  leading 
to  the  establishment  of  the  South  Asian  Association  for 
Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC — see  Glossary). 

In  the  mid-  and  late  1980s,  India-Pakistan  relations  settled 
into  a  pattern  of  ups  and  downs.  Despite  the  signing  of  an  eco- 
nomic and  trade  agreement,  little  progress  was  made  in  con- 
cluding a  comprehensive,  long-term  economic  agreement  to 
have  nondiscriminatory  bilateral  trade.  In  addition,  New  Delhi 


523 


India:  A  Country  Study 

charged  Islamabad  with  arming  and  training  Sikh  terrorists  in 
Punjab.  The  government's  1984  White  Paper  on  the  Punjab  Agita- 
tion stated  that  India's  strength,  unity,  and  secularism  were  tar- 
gets of  attack.  The  December  1985  visit  of  Zia  to  India,  during 
which  both  sides  agreed  not  to  attack  each  other's  nuclear  facil- 
ities, ushered  in  a  brief  phase  of  cordiality,  in  which  another 
agreement  expanding  trade  was  signed.  The  cordiality  evapo- 
rated in  early  1986,  with  further  Indian  unhappiness  over  Paki- 
stan's alleged  interference  in  Punjab  and  the  bungled  Pakistani 
handling  of  the  terrorist  seizure  of  a  Pan  American  airliner  in 
which  many  Indians  died.  For  its  part,  Pakistan  was  disturbed 
by  anti-Muslim  riots  in  India,  and  Zia  accused  India  of  assisting 
the  political  campaign  of  Benazir  Bhutto. 

Between  November  1986  and  February  1987,  first  India, 
then  Pakistan,  conducted  provocative  military  maneuvers 
along  their  border  that  raised  tensions  considerably.  India's 
"Operation  Brass  Tacks"  took  place  in  Rajasthan,  across  from 
Pakistan's  troubled  Sindh  Province,  and  Pakistan's  maneuvers 
were  located  close  to  India's  state  of  Punjab.  The  crisis  atmo- 
sphere was  heightened  when  Pakistan's  premier  nuclear  scien- 
tist Abdul  Qadir  Khan  revealed  in  a  March  1987  interview  that 
Pakistan  had  manufactured  a  nuclear  bomb.  Although  Khan 
later  retracted  his  statement,  India  stated  that  the  disclosure 
was  "forcing  us  to  review  our  option."  The  tensions  created  by 
the  military  exercises  and  the  nuclear  issue  were  defused  fol- 
lowing talks  at  the  foreign  secretary  level  in  New  Delhi  (Janu- 
ary 31-February  4)  and  Islamabad  (February  27-March  2), 
during  which  the  two  sides  agreed  to  a  phased  troop  with- 
drawal to  peacetime  positions. 

The  sudden  death  of  Zia  in  an  air  crash  in  August  1988  and 
the  assumption  of  the  prime  ministership  by  Benazir  Bhutto  in 
December  1988  after  democratic  elections  provided  the  two 
countries  with  an  unexpected  opportunity  to  improve  rela- 
tions. Rajiv  Gandhi's  attendance  at  the  SAARC  summit  in 
Islamabad  in  December  1988  permitted  the  two  prime  minis- 
ters to  establish  a  personal  rapport  and  to  sign  three  bilateral 
agreements,  including  one  proscribing  attacks  on  each  other's 
nuclear  facilities.  Despite  the  personal  sympathy  between  the 
two  leaders  and  Bhutto's  initial  emphasis  on  the  1972  Simla 
Accord  as  the  basis  for  warmer  bilateral  ties,  domestic  political 
pressures,  particularly  relating  to  unrest  in  Sindh,  Punjab,  and 
Kashmir  effectively  destroyed  the  chances  for  improved  rela- 
tions  in  1989  and  1990.  For  her  part,  Bhutto  backed  away  from 


524 


her  comments  on  the  Simla  Accord  by  continuing  to  press  the 
Kashmir  issue  internationally,  and  Indian  public  opinion 
forced  Rajiv  Gandhi  and  his  successor,  V.P.  Singh,  to  take  a 
hard  line  on  events  relating  to  Kashmir. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Indian-Pakistani  relations  remained  trou- 
bled despite  bilateral  efforts  and  changes  in  the  international 
environment.  High-level  dialogue  on  a  range  of  bilateral  issues 
took  place  between  foreign  ministers  and  prime  ministers  at 
the  UN  and  at  other  international  meetings.  However,  discus- 
sions over  confidence-building  measures,  begun  in  the  summer 
of  1990  as  a  response  to  the  Kashmir  confrontation,  were  can- 
celed in  June  1992  following  mutual  expulsions  of  diplomats 
for  alleged  espionage  activities.  In  June  1991,  Pakistani  prime 
minister  Mian  Nawaz  Sharif  proposed  talks  by  India,  Pakistan, 
the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union,  and  China  to  consider 
making  South  Asia  a  nuclear-free  zone,  but  the  minority  gov- 
ernments of  Chandra  Shekhar  and  subsequently  that  of 
Narasimha  Rao  declined  to  participate.  Nevertheless,  negotia- 
tions concerning  the  Siachen  Glacier  resumed  in  November 
1992  after  a  hiatus  of  three  years.  By  the  mid-1990s,  little  had 
occurred  to  improve  bilateral  relations  as  unrest  in  Jammu  and 
Kashmir  accelerated  and  domestic  politics  in  both  nations  were 
unsettled.

India:  A  Country  Study 


Bangladesh 

Although  India  played  a  major  role  in  the  establishment  of 
an  independent  Bangladesh  on  April  17.  1971.  New  Delhi's 
relations  with  Dhaka,  the  capital  of  Bangladesh,  were  neither 
close  nor  free  from  dispute  (see  The  Rise  of  Indira  Gandhi,  ch. 
1).  In  1975  Bangladesh  began  to  move  awav  from  the  linguistic 
nadonalism  that  had  marked  its  liberation  struggle  and  linked 
it  to  India's  West  Bengal  state.  Instead.  Dhaka  stressed  Islam  as 
the  binding  force  in  Bangladeshi  nationalism.  The  new  empha- 
sis on  Islam.,  combined  with  Bangladeshi  concern  over  India's 
military  buildup  and  bilateral  disputes  over  riparian  borders, 
shared  water  resources,,  and  illegal  immigration  of  Bang- 
ladeshis into  West  Bengal,  made  for  fluctuations  in  India-Ban- 
gladesh  relations. 

Relations  are  generally  orood.  nevertheless:  the  two  countries 
have  maintained  a  dialogue  on  a  variety  of  issues  and  initiated  a 
modest  program  of  joint  economic  cooperation.  In  1977  New 
Delhi  and  Dhaka  signed  an  agreement — that  is  renewed  annu- 
ally— on  sharing  the  waters  of  the  Ganga  (Ganges)  River  dur- 
ing the  drv  season,  but  the  two  sides  made  little  progress  in 
achieving  a  permanent  solution  to  their  other  problems.  The 
main  item  of  contention  is  the  Farakka  Barrage,  where  the 
Gan^a  divides  into  two  branches  and  India  has  built  a  feeder 
canal  that  controls  the  flow  by  rechanneling  water  on  the 
Indian  side  of  the  river.  The  two  nations  were  still  at  odds, 
despite  high-level  talks,  in  the  mid-1990s. 

In  the  mid-  and  late  1980s.  India's  plan  to  erect  a  fence  to 
prevent  cross-border  migration  from  Bangladesh  and  Ban- 
gladesh's desire  that  Chakma  insurgents  not  receive  Indian 
covert  assistance  and  refuge  in  India  were  major  irritants  in 
bilateral  relations.  As  agreed  eighteen  years  earlier,  in  June 
1992  India  granted  a  perpetual  lease  to  Bangladesh  for  the  nar- 
row. 1.5-hectare  Tin  Bigha  corridor  in  the  Ganga's  delta  that 
had  long  separated  an  enclave  of  Bangladeshis  from  their 
homeland.  The  two  countries  signed  new  agreements  to 
enhance  economic  cooperation.  Bangladesh  also  received 
Indian  developmental  assistance,  but  that  aid  was  minor  com- 
pared with  the  amounts  India  granted  to  Nepal,.  Bhutan.  Sri 
Lanka,  and  Maldives.  The  year  1991  also  witnessed  the  first- 
ever  visit  of  an  Indian  armv  chief  of  staff  to  Dhaka. 

Sri  Lanka

Lanka  have  been  security  and  the  shared  ethnicity  of  Tamils  liv- 
ing in  southern  India  and  in  northern  and  eastern  Sri  Lanka. 
Before  1980  common  security  perceptions  and  New  Delhi's 
reluctance  to  intervene  in  internal  affairs  in  Sri  Lanka's  capital 
of  Colombo  made  for  relatively  close  ties  between  the  two 
countries'  governments.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1950s,  and  coin- 
ciding with  the  withdrawal  of  Britain's  military  presence  in  the 
Indian  Ocean,  India  and  Sri  Lanka  increasingly  came  to  share 
regional  security  interests.  In  the  1970s,  New  Delhi  and 
Colombo  enjoyed  close  ties  on  the  strength  of  the  relationship 
between  Indira  Gandhi  and  Sri  Lanka's  prime  minister,  Mrs. 
Sirimavo  Ratwatte  Dias  (S.R.D.)  Bandaranaike.  India  fully 
approved  Sri  Lanka's  desire  to  replace  the  British  security 
umbrella  with  an  Indian  one,  and  both  sides  pursued  a  policy 
of  nonalignment  and  cooperated  to  minimize  Western  influ- 
ence in  the  Indian  Ocean. 

In  the  1980s,  ethnic  conflict  between  Sri  Lankan  Sinhalese 
in  the  south  and  Sri  Lankan  Tamils  in  the  north  escalated,  and 
Tamil  separatists  established  bases  and  received  funding,  weap- 
ons, and,  reportedly,  training  in  India.  The  clandestine  assis- 
tance came  from  private  sources  and,  according  to  some 
observers,  the  state  government  of  Tamil  Nadu,  and  was  toler- 
ated by  the  central  government  until  1987.  Anti-Tamil  violence 
in  Colombo  in  July  1983  prompted  India  to  intervene  in  the 
Tamil-Sinhalese  conflict,  but  mediatory  efforts  failed  to  pre- 
vent the  deterioration  of  the  situation.  In  May  1987,  after  the 
Sri  Lankan  government  attempted  to  regain  control  of  the 
Jaffna  region,  in  the  extreme  northern  area  of  the  island,  by 
means  of  an  economic  blockade  and  military  action,  India  sup- 
plied food  and  medicine  by  air  and  sea  to  the  region.  On  July 
29,  1987,  Indian  prime  minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  and  Sri  Lankan 
president  Junius  Richard  (J.R.)  Jayawardene  signed  an  accord 
designed  to  settle  the  conflict  by  sending  the  Indian  Peace 
Keeping  Force  (IPKF)  to  establish  order  and  disarm  Tamil  sep- 
aratists, to  establish  new  administrative  bodies  and  hold  elec- 
tions to  accommodate  Tamil  demands  for  autonomy,  and  to 
repatriate  Tamil  refugees  in  India  and  Sri  Lanka.  The  accord 
also  forbade  the  military  use  of  Sri  Lankan  ports  or  broadcast- 
ing facilities  by  outside  powers.  The  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil 
Eelam  (LTTE),  the  most  militant  separatist  group,  refused  to 
disarm,  and  Indian  troops  sustained  heavy  casualties  while  fail- 
ing to  destroy  the  LTTE.  In  June  1989,  newly  elected  Sri  Lan- 
kan president  Ranasinghe  Premadasa  demanded  the 


527 


India:  A  Country  Study 

withdrawal  of  the  IPKF.  Despite  the  tensions  between  the  two 
countries  created  by  this  request,  New  Delhi  completed  the 
withdrawal  in  March  1990  (see  Peacekeeping  Operations,  ch. 
10). 

Bilateral  relations  improved  somewhat  in  the  early  1990s,  as 
the  government  attempted  to  expand  economic,  scientific,  and 
cultural  cooperation.  India  continued  to  take  an  interest  in  the 
status  of  Sri  Lankan  Tamils,  but  without  the  direct  intervention 
that  characterized  the  1980s.  The  May  1991  assassination  of 
Rajiv  Gandhi,  allegedly  by  the  LTTE,  forced  New  Delhi  to  crack 
down  on  the  LTTE  presence  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  to  institute 
naval  patrols  in  the  Palk  Strait  to  interdict  LTTE  movements  to 
India.  In  January  1992,  repatriation  of  Tamil  refugees  to  Sri 
Lanka  commenced  and  was  still  underway  in  1994. 

Nepal 

Relations  between  India  and  Nepal  are  close  yet  fraught  with 
difficulties  stemming  from  geography,  economics,  the  prob- 
lems inherent  in  big  power-small  power  relations,  and  common 
ethnic  and  linguistic  identities  that  overlap  the  two  countries' 
borders.  In  1950  New  Delhi  and  Kathmandu  initiated  their 
intertwined  relationship  with  the  Treaty  of  Peace  and  Friend- 
ship and  accompanying  letters  that  defined  security  relations 
between  the  two  countries,  and  an  agreement  governing  both 
bilateral  trade  and  trade  transiting  Indian  soil.  The  1950  treaty 
and  letters  stated  that  "neither  government  shall  tolerate  any 
threat  to  the  security  of  the  other  by  a  foreign  aggressor"  and 
obligated  both  sides  "to  inform  each  other  of  any  serious  fric- 
tion or  misunderstanding  with  any  neighboring  state  likely  to 
cause  any  breach  in  the  friendly  relations  subsisting  between 
the  two  governments."  These  accords  cemented  a  "special  rela- 
tionship" between  India  and  Nepal  that  granted  Nepal  prefer- 
ential economic  treatment  and  provided  Nepalese  in  India  the 
same  economic  and  educational  opportunities  as  Indian  citi- 
zens. 

In  the  1950s,  Nepal  welcomed  close  relations  with  India,  but 
as  the  number  of  Nepalese  living  and  working  in  India 
increased  and  the  involvement  of  India  in  Nepal's  economy 
deepened  in  the  1960s  and  after,  so  too  did  Nepalese  discom- 
fort with  the  special  relationship.  Tensions  came  to  a  head  in 
the  mid-1970s,  when  Nepal  pressed  for  substantial  amend- 
ments in  its  favor  in  the  trade  and  transit  treaty  and  openly  crit- 
icized India's  1975  annexation  of  Sikkim  as  an  Indian  state.  In

1975  King  Birendra  Bir  Bikram  Shah  Dev  proposed  that  Nepal 
be  recognized  internationally  as  a  zone  of  peace;  he  received 
support  from  China  and  Pakistan.  In  New  Delhi's  view,  if  the 
king's  proposal  did  not  contradict  the  1950  treaty  and  was 
merely  an  extension  of  nonalignment,  it  was  unnecessary;  if  it 
was  a  repudiation  of  the  special  relationship,  it  represented  a 
possible  threat  to  India's  security  and  could  not  be  endorsed. 
In  1984  Nepal  repeated  the  proposal,  but  there  was  no  reaction 
from  India.  Nepal  continually  promoted  the  proposal  in  inter- 
national forums,  with  Chinese  support;  by  1990  it  had  won  the 
support  of  112  countries. 

In  1978  India  agreed  to  separate  trade  and  transit  treaties, 
satisfying  a  long-term  Nepalese  demand.  In  1988,  when  the  two 
treaties  were  up  for  renewal,  Nepal's  refusal  to  accommodate 
India's  wishes  on  the  transit  treaty  caused  India  to  call  for  a  sin- 
gle trade  and  transit  treaty.  Thereafter,  Nepal  took  a  hard-line 
position  that  led  to  a  serious  crisis  in  India-Nepal  relations. 
After  two  extensions,  the  two  treaties  expired  on  March  23, 
1989,  resulting  in  a  virtual  Indian  economic  blockade  of  Nepal 
that  lasted  until  late  April  1990.  Although  economic  issues 
were  a  major  factor  in  the  two  countries'  confrontation,  Indian 
dissatisfaction  with  Nepal's  1988  acquisition  of  Chinese  weap- 
onry played  an  important  role.  New  Delhi  perceived  the  arms 
purchase  as  an  indication  of  Kathmandu's  intent  to  build  a  mil- 


529

itary  relationship  with  Beijing,  in  violation  of  the  1950  treaty 
and  letters  exchanged  in  1959  and  1965,  which  included  Nepal 
in  India's  security  zone  and  precluded  arms  purchases  without 
India's  approval.  India  linked  security  with  economic  relations 
and  insisted  on  reviewing  India-Nepal  relations  as  a  whole. 
Nepal  had  to  back  down  after  worsening  economic  conditions 
led  to  a  change  in  Nepal's  political  system,  in  which  the  king 
was  forced  to  institute  a  parliamentary  democracy.  The  new 
government  sought  quick  restoration  of  amicable  relations 
with  India. 

The  special  security  relationship  between  New  Delhi  and 
Kathmandu  was  reestablished  during  the  June  1990  New  Delhi 
meeting  of  Nepal's  prime  minister  Krishna  Prasad  Bhattarai 
and  Indian  prime  minister  V.P.  Singh.  During  the  December 
1991  visit  to  India  by  Nepalese  prime  minister  Girijad  Prasad 
Koirala,  the  two  countries  signed  new,  separate  trade  and  tran- 
sit treaties  and  other  economic  agreements  designed  to  accord 
Nepal  additional  economic  benefits. 

Indian-Nepali  relations  appeared  to  be  undergoing  still 
more  reassessment  when  Nepal's  prime  minister  Man  Mohan 
Adhikary  visited  New  Delhi  in  April  1995  and  insisted  on  a 
major  review  of  the  1950  peace  and  friendship  treaty.  In  the 
face  of  benign  statements  by  his  Indian  hosts  relating  to  the 
treaty,  Adhikary  sought  greater  economic  independence  for 
his  landlocked  nation  while  simultaneously  striving  to  improve 
ties  with  China. 

Bhutan 

Despite  the  long  and  substantial  involvement  of  India  in 
Bhutan's  economic,  educational,  and  military  affairs,  and 
India's  advisory  role  in  foreign  affairs  embodied  in  the  August 
8,  1949,  Treaty  of  Friendship  Between  the  Government  of 
India  and  the  Government  of  Bhutan,  Thimphu's  autonomy 
has  been  fully  respected  by  New  Delhi.  Bhutan's  geographic 
isolation,  its  distinctive  Buddhist  culture,  and  its  deliberate 
restriction  on  the  number  and  kind  of  foreigners  admitted 
have  helped  to  protect  its  separate  identity.  Furthermore,  Bhu- 
tan's relationship  with  China,  unlike  Nepal's,  has  not  become 
an  issue  in  relations  with  India.  Bhutanese  subjects  have  the 
same  access  to  economic  and  educational  opportunities  as 
Indian  citizens,  and  Indian  citizens  have  the  right  to  carry  on 
trade  in  Bhutan,  with  some  restrictions  that  protect  Bhutanese 
industries.  India  also  provides  Bhutan  with  developmental 


530 


Foreign  Relations 


assistance  and  cooperation  in  infrastructure,  telecommunica- 
tions, industry,  energy,  medicine,  and  animal  husbandry.  Since 
joining  the  UN  in  1971,  Bhutan  has  increasingly  established  its 
international  status  in  a  concerted  effort  to  avoid  the  fate  of 
Sikkim's  absorption  into  India  following  the  reduction  of  Sik- 
kim's  indigenous  people  to  minority  status. 

Maldives 

India  and  Maldives  have  enjoyed  close  and  friendly  relations 
since  Maldives  became  independent  in  1965.  Disputes  between 
the  two  countries  have  been  few,  and  both  sides  amicably  set- 
tled their  maritime  boundary  in  1976.  In  November  1988,  at 
the  behest  of  the  Maldivian  government,  Indian  paratroopers 
and  naval  forces  crushed  a  coup  attempt  by  mercenaries. 
India's  action,  viewed  by  some  critics  as  an  indication  of  Indian 
ambitions  to  be  a  regional  police  officer,  were  regarded  by  the 
United  States,  the  Soviet  Union,  Britain,  Nepal,  and  Ban- 
gladesh as  legitimate  assistance  to  a  friendly  government  and 
in  keeping  with  India's  strategic  role  in  South  Asia.  In  the  1980s 
and  1990s,  Indian  and  Maldivian  leaders  maintained  regular 
consultations  at  the  highest  levels.  New  Delhi  also  has  provided 
developmental  assistance  to  Male  (Maldives'  capital)  and  has 
participated  in  bilateral  cooperation  programs  in  infrastruc- 
ture development,  health  and  welfare,  civil  aviation,  telecom- 
munications, and  labor  resources  development. 

China 

Although  India  and  China  had  relatively  little  political  con- 
tact before  the  1950s,  both  countries  have  had  extensive  cul- 
tural contact  since  the  first  century  A.D.,  especially  with  the 
transmission  of  Buddhism  from  India  to  China  (see  Buddhism, 
ch.  3).  Although  Nehru  based  his  vision  of  "resurgent  Asia"  on 
friendship  between  the  two  largest  states  of  Asia,  the  two  coun- 
tries had  a  conflict  of  interest  in  Tibet  (which  later  became 
China's  Xizang  Autonomous  Region),  a  geographical  and 
political  buffer  zone  where  India  had  inherited  special  privi- 
leges from  the  British  colonial  government.  At  the  end  of  its 
civil  war  in  1949,  China  wanted  to  reassert  control  over  Tibet 
and  to  "liberate"  the  Tibetan  people  from  Lamaism  (Tibetan 
Buddhism)  and  feudalism,  which  it  did  by  force  of  arms  in 
1950.  To  avoid  antagonizing  China,  Nehru  informed  Chinese 
leaders  that  India  had  neither  political  nor  territorial  ambi- 
tions, nor  did  it  seek  special  privileges  in  Tibet,  but  that  tradi- 


531 


India:  A  Country  Study 

tional  trading  rights  must  continue.  With  Indian  support, 
Tibetan  delegates  signed  an  agreement  in  May  1951  recogniz- 
ing Chinese  sovereignty  and  control  but  guaranteeing  that  the 
existing  political  and  social  system  in  Tibet  would  continue. 
Direct  negotiations  between  India  and  China  commenced  in 
an  atmosphere  improved  by  India's  mediatory  efforts  in  end- 
ing the  Korean  War  (1950-53). 

In  April  1954,  India  and  China  signed  an  eight-year  agree- 
ment on  Tibet  that  set  forth  the  basis  of  their  relationship  in 
the  form  of  the  Panch  Shila.  Although  critics  called  the  Panch 
Shila  naive,  Nehru  calculated  that  in  the  absence  of  either  the 
wherewithal  or  a  policy  for  defense  of  the  Himalayan  region, 
India's  best  guarantee  of  security  was  to  establish  a  psychologi- 
cal buffer  zone  in  place  of  the  lost  physical  buffer  of  Tibet. 
Thus  the  catch  phrase  of  India's  diplomacy  with  China  in  the 
1950s  was  Hindi-Chini  bhai-bhai  (Hindi  for  "India  and  China  are 
brothers").  Up  to  1959,  despite  border  skirmishes  and  discrep- 
ancies between  Indian  and  Chinese  maps,  Chinese  leaders  ami- 
cably had  assured  India  that  there  was  no  territorial  contro- 
versy on  the  border. 

When  an  Indian  reconnaissance  party  discovered  a  com- 
pleted Chinese  road  running  through  the  Aksai  Chin  region  of 
the  Ladakh  District  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  border  clashes  and 
Indian  protests  became  more  frequent  and  serious.  In  January 
1959,  Chinese  premier  Zhou  Enlai  wrote  to  Nehru,  rejecting 
Nehru's  contention  that  the  border  was  based  on  treaty  and 
custom  and  pointing  out  that  no  government  in  China  had 
accepted  as  legal  the  McMahon  Line,  which  in  the  1914  Simla 
Convention  defined  the  eastern  section  of  the  border  between 
India  and  Tibet.  The  Dalai  Lama — spiritual  and  temporal  head 
of  the  Tibetan  people — sought  sanctuary  in  Dharmsala,  Hima- 
chal  Pradesh,  in  March  1959,  and  thousands  of  Tibetan  refu- 
gees settled  in  northwestern  India,  particularly  in  Himachal 
Pradesh.  China  accused  India  of  expansionism  and  imperial- 
ism in  Tibet  and  throughout  the  Himalayan  region.  China 
claimed  104,000  square  kilometers  of  territory  over  which 
India's  maps  showed  clear  sovereignty,  and  demanded  "rectifi- 
cation" of  the  entire  border. 

Zhou  proposed  that  China  relinquish  its  claim  to  most  of 
India's  northeast  in  exchange  for  India's  abandonment  of  its 
claim  to  Aksai  Chin.  The  Indian  government,  constrained  by 
domestic  public  opinion,  rejected  the  idea  of  a  settlement 


532 


Foreign  Relations 


based  on  uncompensated  loss  of  territory  as  being  humiliating 
and  unequal. 

Chinese  forces  attacked  India  on  October  20,  1962.  Having 
pushed  the  unprepared,  ill-equipped,  and  inadequately  led 
Indian  forces  to  within  forty-eight  kilometers  of  the  Assam 
plains  in  the  northeast  and  having  occupied  strategic  points  in 
Ladakh,  China  declared  a  unilateral  cease-fire  on  November  21 
and  withdrew  twenty  kilometers  behind  its  new  line  of  control 
(see  The  Experience  of  Wars,  ch.  10). 

Relations  with  China  worsened  during  the  rest  of  the  1960s 
and  the  early  1970s  as  Chinese-Pakistani  relations  improved 
and  Chinese-Soviet  relations  worsened.  China  backed  Pakistan 
in  its  1965  war  with  India.  Between  1967  and  1971,  an  all- 
weather  road  was  built  across  territory  claimed  by  India,  link- 
ing China's  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  with  Pakistan; 
India  could  do  no  more  than  protest.  China  continued  an 
active  propaganda  campaign  against  India  and  supplied  ideo- 
logical, financial,  and  other  assistance  to  dissident  groups, 
especially  to  tribes  in  northeastern  India.  China  accused  India 
of  assisting  the  Khampa  rebels  in  Tibet.  Diplomatic  contact 
between  the  two  governments  was  minimal  although  not  for- 
mally severed.  The  flow  of  cultural  and  other  exchanges  that 
had  marked  the  1950s  ceased  entirely.  In  August  1971,  India 
signed  its  Treaty  of  Peace,  Friendship,  and  Cooperation  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  and  the  United  States  and  China  sided  with 
Pakistan  in  its  December  1971  war  with  India.  By  this  time, 
Beijing  was  seated  at  the  UN,  where  its  representatives 
denounced  India  as  being  a  "tool  of  Soviet  expansionism." 

India  and  China  renewed  efforts  to  improve  relations  after 
the  Soviet  Union  invaded  Afghanistan  in  December  1979. 
China  modified  its  pro-Pakistan  stand  on  Kashmir  and 
appeared  willing  to  remain  silent  on  India's  absorption  of  Sik- 
kim  and  its  special  advisory  relationship  with  Bhutan.  China's 
leaders  agreed  to  discuss  the  boundary  issue — India's  prior- 
ity— as  the  first  step  to  a  broadening  of  relations.  The  two  coun- 
tries hosted  each  others'  news  agencies,  and  Kailash 
(Kangrinboge  Feng)  and  Mansarowar  Lake  (Mapam  Yumco 
Lake)  in  Tibet — the  mythological  home  of  the  Hindu  pan- 
theon— were  opened  to  annual  pilgrimages  from  India.  In 
1981  Chinese  minister  of  foreign  affairs  Huang  Hua  was  invited 
to  India,  where  he  made  complimentary  remarks  about  India's 
role  in  South  Asia.  Chinese  premier  Zhao  Ziyang  concurrently 
toured  Pakistan,  Nepal,  and  Bangladesh. 


533 


India:  A  Country  Study 


After  the  Huang  visit,.  India  and  China  held  eight  rounds  of 
border  negotiations  between  December  1981  and  November 
19S7.  These  talks  initiallv  raised  hopes  that  progress  could  be 
made  on  the  border  issue.  However,  in  1985  China  stiffened  its 
position  on  the  border  and  insisted  on  mutual  concessions 
without  defining  the  exact  terms  of  its  "package  proposal"  or 
where  the  actual  line  of  control  lay.  In  1986  and  1987.  the 
negotiations  achieved  nothing,  given  the  charges  exchanged 
between  the  two  countries  of  militarv  encroachment  in  the 
Sumdorune  Chu  vallev  of  the  Tawane  tract  on  the  eastern  sec- 
tor  of  the  border.  China's  construction  of  a  militarv  post  and 
helicopter  pad  in  the  area  in  1986  and  India's  grant  of  state- 
hood to  Arunachal  Pradesh  (formerly  the  North-East  Frontier 
Agencv)  in  February  1987  caused  both  sides  to  deplov  new 
troops  to  the  area,  raising  tensions  and  fears  of  a  new  border 
war.  China  relayed  warnings  that  it  would  "teach  India  a  lesson" 
if  it  did  not  cease  "nibbling"  at  Chinese  territorv.  By  the  sum- 
mer of  1987,  however,  both  sides  had  backed  away  from  con- 
flict and  denied  that  militarv  clashes  had  taken  place. 

A  warming  trend  in  relations  was  facilitated  bv  Rajiv  Gan- 
dhi's visit  to  China  in  December  1988.  The  two  sides  issued  a 
joint  communique  that  stressed  the  need  to  restore  friendlv 
relations  on  the  basis  of  the  Panch  Shila  and  noted  the  impor- 
tance of  the  first  visit  bv  an  Indian  prime  minister  to  China 
since  Nehru's  1954  visit.  India  and  China  agreed  to  broaden 
bilateral  ties  in  various  areas,  working  to  achieve  a  "fair  and  rea- 
sonable settlement  while  seeking  a  mutually  acceptable  solu- 
tion' to  the  border  dispute.  The  communique  also  expressed 
China's  concern  about  agitation  by  Tibetan  separatists  in  India 
and  reiterated  China's  position  that  Tibet  was  an  integral  part 
of  China  and  that  anti-China  political  activities  bv  expatriate 
Tibetans  was  not  to  be  tolerated.  Rajiv  Gandhi  signed  bilateral 
agreements  on  science  and  technology  cooperation,  on  civil 
aviation  to  establish  direct  air  links,  and  on  cultural  exchanges. 
The  two  sides  also  agreed  to  hold  annual  diplomatic  consulta- 
tions between  foreign  ministers,  and  to  set  up  a  joint  ministe- 
rial committee  on  economic  and  scientific  cooperation  and  a 
joint  working  group  on  the  boundarv  issue.  The  latter  group 
was  to  be  led  bv  the  Indian  foreign  secretary  and  the  Chinese 
vice  minister  of  foreign  affairs. 

As  the  mid-1990s  approached,  slow  but  steadv  improvement 
in  relations  with  China  was  visible.  Top-level  dialogue  contin- 
ued with  the  December  1991  visit  of  Chinese  premier  Li  Peng 


534 


Foreign  Relations 


to  India  and  the  May  1992  visit  to  China  of  Indian  president 
Ramaswami  Venkataraman.  Six  rounds  of  talks  of  the  Indian- 
Chinese  Joint  Working  Group  on  the  Border  Issue  were  held 
between  December  1988  and  June  1993.  Progress  was  also 
made  in  reducing  tensions  on  the  border  via  confidence-build- 
ing measures,  including  mutual  troop  reductions,  regular 
meetings  of  local  military  commanders,  and  advance  notifica- 
tion of  military  exercises.  Border  trade  resumed  in  July  1992 
after  a  hiatus  of  more  than  thirty  years,  consulates  reopened  in 
Bombay  (or  Mumbai  in  the  Marathi  language)  and  Shanghai 
in  December  1992,  and,  in  June  1993,  the  two  sides  agreed  to 
open  an  additional  border  trading  post.  During  Sharad  Pawar's 
July  1992  visit  to  Beijing,  the  first  ever  by  an  Indian  minister  of 
defence,  the  two  defense  establishments  agreed  to  develop  aca- 
demic, military,  scientific,  and  technological  exchanges  and  to 
schedule  an  Indian  port  call  by  a  Chinese  naval  vessel. 

Substantial  movement  in  relations  continued  in  1993.  The 
sixth-  round  joint  working  group  talks  were  held  in  June  in 
New  Delhi  but  resulted  in  only  minor  developments.  However, 
as  the  year  progressed  the  long-standing  border  dispute  was 
eased  as  a  result  of  bilateral  pledges  to  reduce  troop  levels  and 
to  respect  the  cease-fire  line  along  the  India-China  border. 
Prime  Minister  Narasimha  Rao  and  Chinese  premier  Li  Peng 
signed  the  border  agreement  and  three  other  agreements  (on 
cross-border  trade,  and  on  increased  cooperation  on  the  envi- 
ronment and  in  radio  and  television  broadcasting)  during  the 
former's  visit  to  Beijing  in  September.  A  senior-level  Chinese 
military  delegation  made  a  six-day  goodwill  visit  to  India  in 
December  1993  aimed  at  "fostering  confidence-building  mea- 
sures between  the  defense  forces  of  the  two  countries."  The 
visit,  however,  came  at  a  time  when  press  reports  revealed  that, 
as  a  result  of  improved  relations  between  China  and  Burma, 
China  was  exporting  greater  amounts  of  military  materiel  to 
Burma's  army,  navy,  and  air  force  and  sending  an  increasing 
number  of  technicians  to  Burma.  Of  concern  to  Indian  secu- 
rity officials  was  the  presence  of  Chinese  radar  technicians  in 
Burma's  Coco  Islands,  which  border  India's  Union  Territory  of 
the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Islands.  Nevertheless,  movement 
continued  in  1994  on  troop  reductions  along  the  Himalayan 
frontier.  Moreover,  in  January  1994  Beijing  announced  that  it 
not  only  favored  a  negotiated  solution  on  Kashmir,  but  also 
opposed  any  form  of  independence  for  the  region. 


535 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Talks  were  held  in  New  Delhi  in  February  1994  aimed  at  con- 
firming established  "confidence-building  measures"  and  dis- 
cussing clarification  of  the  "line  of  actual  control,"  reduction  of 
armed  forces  along  the  line,  and  prior  information  about 
forthcoming  military  exercises.  China's  hope  for  settlement  of 
the  boundary  issue  was  reiterated. 

The  1993  Chinese  military  visit  to  India  was  reciprocated  by 
Indian  army  chief  of  staff  General  B.C.  Joshi.  During  talks  in 
Beijing  in  July  1994,  the  two  sides  agreed  that  border  problems 
should  be  resolved  peacefully  through  "mutual  understanding 
and  concessions."  The  border  issue  was  raised  in  September 
1994  when  Chinese  minister  of  national  defense  Chi  Haotian 
visited  New  Delhi  for  extensive  talks  with  high-level  Indian 
trade  and  defense  officials.  Further  talks  in  New  Delhi  in 
March  1995  by  the  India-China  Expert  Group  led  to  an  agree- 
ment to  set  up  two  additional  points  of  contact  along  the  4,000- 
kilometer  border  to  facilitate  meetings  between  military  per- 
sonnel. The  two  sides  also  were  reported  as  "seriously  engaged" 
in  defining  the  McMahon  Line  and  the  line  of  actual  control 
vis-a-vis  military  exercises  and  prevention  of  air  intrusion.  Talks 
in  Beijing  in  July  1995  aimed  at  better  border  security  and  com- 
bating cross-border  crimes  and  in  New  Delhi  in  August  1995  on 
additional  troop  withdrawals  from  the  border  made*  further 
progress  in  reducing  tensions. 

Possibly  indicative  of  the  further  relaxation  of  India-China 
relations — at  least  there  was  little  notice  taken  in  Beijing — was 
the  April  1995  announcement,  after  a  year  of  consultation,  of 
the  opening  of  the  Taipei  Economic  and  Cultural  Center  in 
New  Delhi.  The  center  serves  as  the  representative  office  of 
Taiwan  and  is  the  counterpart  of  the  India-Taipei  Association 
in  Taiwan;  both  institutions  have  the  goal  of  improving  rela- 
tions between  the  two  sides,  which  have  been  strained  since 
New  Delhi's  recognition  of  Beijing  in  1950. 

Southeast  Asia 

In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  India's  close  ties  with  the  Soviet 
Union  and  its  pro-Soviet,  pro-Vietnamese  policies  toward  Cam- 
bodia precluded  development  of  any  constructive  relations 
between  India  on  the  one  hand  and  the  countries  of  the  Associ- 
ation of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN — see  Glossary)  on 
the  other.  Furthermore,  India's  military  buildup,  particularly 
of  its  naval  capabilities  and  naval  installations  in  the  Andaman 
and  Nicobar  Islands,  worried  ASEAN  policy  makers,  who  saw 


536 


Foreign  Relations 


India  as  a  potential  threat  to  regional  security.  Indian-ASEAN 
relations  improved  in  the  1990s  as  the  result  of  the  end  of  the 
bipolar  world  system,  the  UN-brokered  peace  settlement  in 
Cambodia,  and  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union.  For  its  part, 
New  Delhi  sought  to  boost  economic  and  trade  ties  with  the 
region  and  to  establish  closer  political  and  defense  ties  in  order 
to  counteract  China's  growing  influence  in  Southeast  Asia. 
ASEAN  countries  grew  less  concerned  with  India's  regional 
ambitions  after  New  Delhi's  decision  to  curtail  its  naval  buildup 
because  of  financial  restraints.  In  January  1992,  ASEAN 
accepted  India's  proposal  to  become  a  "sectoral  dialogue  part- 
ner" in  the  areas  of  trade,  technical  and  labor  development, 
technology,  and  tourism.  India's  new  role  was  expected  to  facil- 
itate economic  cooperation.  In  January  1993,  India  and  Malay- 
sia signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  defense 
cooperation. 

India  has  had  close  ties  with  Cambodia,  Laos,  and  Vietnam 
as  a  result  of  its  1954-73  chairmanship  of  the  International 
Commissions  of  Control  and  Supervision  established  by  the 
1954  Geneva  Accords  on  Indochina.  These  relations  were 
enhanced  by  India's  friendship  with  the  Soviet  Union,  particu- 
larly after  1971  and,  in  the  case  of  Vietnam,  shared  perceptions 
of  the  threat  from  China.  With  regard  to  Cambodia,  India  rec- 
ognized the  Vietnamese-installed  regime  in  1980  and  worked 
to  avert  censure  of  the  regime  in  the  annual  UN  General 
Assembly  and  triennial  Nonaligned  Movement  summit  meet- 
ings. In  the  late  1980s,  Indian  diplomats  attempted  to  facilitate 
the  search  for  peace  in  Cambodia,  and  India  participated  in 
the  1989  Paris  Peace  Conference  on  Cambodia  and  in  subse- 
quent efforts  to  find  a  solution  to  the  Cambodian  situation. 
New  Delhi  played  a  minor  but  nevertheless  constructive  role 
before  and  after  the  Agreement  on  a  Comprehensive  Political 
Settlement  of  the  Cambodia  Conflict  and  three  other  docu- 
ments were  signed  in  Paris  on  October  23,  1991.  India  contrib- 
uted more  than  1,700  civilian,  military,  and  police  personnel  to 
the  United  Nations  Advanced  Mission  in  Cambodia  and  the 
United  Nations  Transitional  Authority  in  Cambodia. 

Middle  East 

India  has  traditionally  pursued  a  pro-Arab  policy  regarding 
the  Arab-Israeli  conflict  in  order  to  counteract  Pakistani  influ- 
ence in  the  region  and  to  secure  access  to  Middle  East  petro- 
leum resources.  In  the  1950s  and  early  1960s,  this  pro-Arab 


537 


India:  A  Country  Study 

stance  did  not  help  India  in  establishing  good  relations  with  all 
Arab  countries  but  may  have  served  to  keep  peace  with  its  own 
Muslim  minority.  India  concentrated  on  developing  a  close 
relationship  with  Egypt  on  the  strength  of  Nehru's  ties  with 
Egyptian  president  Gamel  Abdul  Nasser.  But  the  New  Delhi- 
Cairo  friendship  was  insufficient  to  counteract  Arab  sympathy 
for  Pakistan  in  its  dispute  with  India.  Furthermore,  Indian- 
Egyptian  ties  came  at  the  expense  of  cultivating  relations  with 
such  countries  as  Saudi  Arabia  and  Jordan  and  thus  limited 
India's  influence  in  the  region. 

In  the  late  1960s  and  in  the  1970s,  India  successfully 
improved  bilateral  relations  by  developing  mutually  beneficial 
economic  exchanges  with  a  number  of  Islamic  countries,  par- 
ticularly Iran,  Iraq,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  the  other  Persian  Gulf 
states.  The  strength  of  India's  economic  ties  enabled  it  to  build 
strong  relationships  with  Iran  and  Iraq,  which  helped  India 
weather  the  displeasure  of  Islamic  countries  stemming  from 
India's  war  with  Pakistan  in  1971.  Indian-Middle  Eastern  rela- 
tions were  further  strengthened  by  New  Delhi's  anti-Israeli 
stance  in  the  Arab-Israeli  wars  of  1967  and  1973  and  by  Indian 
support  for  the  fourfold  oil  price  rise  in  1973  by  the  Organiza- 
tion of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC).  Closer  ties 
with  Middle  Eastern  countries  were  dictated  by  India's  depen- 
dency on  petroleum  imports.  Oil  represented  8  percent  of 
India's  total  imports  in  1971;  42  percent  in  1981;  and  28  per- 
cent in  1991.  India  purchased  oil  from  Iran,  Iraq,  Saudi  Arabia, 
the  United  Arab  Emirates,  and  Kuwait  and,  in  return,  provided 
engineering  services,  manufactured  goods,  and  labor.  The 
1980-88  Iran-Iraq  War  forced  India  to  shift  its  oil  purchases 
from  Iran  and  Iraq  to  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  Persian  Gulf  states. 
Saudi  Arabia  and  the  Gulf  states  also  have  received  large  num- 
bers of  Indian  workers  and  manufactures  and  have  become  the 
regional  base  for  Indian  business  operations. 

Two  events  in  1978  and  1979 — the  installation  of  the  Islamic 
regime  under  Ayatollah  Sayyid  Ruhollah  Musavi  Khomeini  in 
Iran  and  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  in  support  of  the 
pro-Soviet  Marxist  regime  in  Kabul — complicated  India's  rela- 
tions with  Middle  East  countries.  From  the  Indian  perspective, 
these  two  events  and  the  Iran-Iraq  War  changed  the  balance  of 
power  in  West  Asia  by  weakening  Iran  as  a  regional  power  and 
a  potential  supporter  of  Pakistan,  a  situation  favorable  to  India. 
At  the  same  time,  proxy  superpower  competition  in  Afghani- 
stan strengthened  the  hand  of  India's  adversary  Pakistan  by  vir-

tue  of  the  military  support  Pakistan  received  from  the  United 
States,  China,  and  Arab  states  led  by  Saudi  Arabia.  In  the  1980s, 
India  performed  a  delicate  diplomatic  balancing  act.  New 
Delhi  took  a  position  of  neutrality  in  the  Iran-Iraq  War,  main- 
tained warm  ties  with  Baghdad,  and  built  workable  political 
and  economic  relations  with  Tehran  despite  misgivings  about 
the  foreign  policy  goals  of  the  Khomeini  regime.  India  man- 
aged to  improve  relations  with  Middle  Eastern  countries  that 
provided  support  to  the  Afghan  mujahideen  and  Pakistan  by 
redirecting  Indian  petroleum  purchases  to  Saudi  Arabia  and 
the  Persian  Gulf  countries.  New  Delhi,  which  traditionally  had 
had  close  relations  with  Kabul,  condemned  the  Soviet  invasion 
only  in  the  most  perfunctory  manner  and  provided  diplomatic, 
economic,  and  logistic  support  for  the  Marxist  regime. 

In  the  early  1990s,  India  stepped  back  from  its  staunch  anti- 
Israeli  stance  and  support  for  the  Palestinian  cause.  Besides 
practical  economic  and  security  considerations  in  the  post- 
Cold  War  world,  domestic  politics — especially  those  influenced 
by  Hindu  nationalists — played  a  role  in  this  reversal.  In  Decem- 
ber 1991,  India  voted  with  the  UN  majority  to  repeal  the  UN 
resolution  equating  Zionism  with  racism.  In  1992,  following 
the  example  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  China,  India  established 
diplomatic  relations  with  Israel. 

During  the  1990-91  Persian  Gulf  War,  Indian  policy  makers 
were  torn  between  adopting  a  traditional  nonaligned  policy 
sympathetic  to  Iraq  or  favoring  the  coalition  of  moderate  Arab 
and  Western  countries  that  could  benefit  Indian  security  and 
economic  interests.  India  initially  adopted  an  ambivalent 
approach,  condemning  both  the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait  and 
the  intrusion  of  external  forces  into  the  region.  When  the 
National  Front  government  led  by  V.P.  Singh  was  replaced  by 
the  Chandra  Shekhar  minority  government  in  November  1990, 
the  Indian  response  changed.  Wary  of  incurring  the  displea- 
sure of  the  United  States  and  other  Western  nations  on  whom 
India  depended  to  obtain  assistance  from  the  International 
Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary),  New  Delhi  voted  for  the 
UN  resolution  authorizing  the  use  of  force  to  expel  Iraqi 
troops  from  Kuwait  and  rejected  Iraq's  linkage  of  the  Kuwaiti 
and  Palestinian  problems.  In  January  1991,  India  also  permit- 
ted United  States  military  aircraft  to  refuel  in  Bombay.  The 
refueling  decision  stirred  such  domestic  controversy  that  the 
Chandra  Shekhar  government  withdrew  the  refueling  privi- 
leges in  February  1991  to  deflect  the  criticism  of  Rajiv  Gandhi's 


539

Congress  (I),  which  argued  that  India's  nominal  pro-United 
States  tilt  betrayed  the  country's  nonaligned  principles. 

Prime  Minister  Narasimha  Rao's  September  1993  visit  to 
Iran  was  hailed  as  "successful  and  useful"  by  the  Indian  media 
and  seen  as  a  vehicle  for  speeding  up  the  improvement  of  bilat- 
eral relations.  Kev  developments  included  discussions  on  the 
construction  of  a  pipeline  to  supply  Iranian  natural  gas  to 
India  and  allowing  India  to  develop  transit  facilities  in  Iran  for 
Indian  products  destined  for  the  landlocked  Central  Asian 
republics.  India  also  sought  to  assuage  its  concerns  over  a  possi- 
ble Iranian-Central  Asian  republics  nuclear  nexus,  which  some 
saw  as  a  potential  and  very  serious  threat  to  India  should  Paki- 
stan also  join  in  an  Islamic  nuclear  front  aimed  at  India  and 
Israel,  When  Iranian  president  Hashemi  Rafsanjani  visited 
India  m  April  1995  to  sign  a  major  trade  accord  (the  accord 
also  was  signed  by  the  minister  of  foreign  affairs  of  Turkmeni- 
stan' and  five  bilateral  agreements,  India-Iranian  relations 
could  be  seen  to  be  on  the  upswing. 

Central  Asia 

Until  large  parts  of  Central  Asia  were  incorporated  into  the 
Russian  Empire  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  relations 
between  India  and  Central  Asia  had  been  close.  During  the 
post-1971  era  of  close  Indian-Soviet  relations,  cultural 
exchanges  flourished  between  India  and  the  Central  Asian 
republics.  The  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  forced  India  to 
construct  policies  to  deal  with  the  new  political  situation  in  the 
Central  Asian  republics.  In  1991  and  1992,  India  established 
diplomatic  relations  with  Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan  and  worked  with  these  newly 
independent  states  to  develop  frameworks  for  diplomatic,  eco- 
nomic.  and  cultural  cooperation.  Besides  its  long  historical 
connections  with  this  region,  India  sought  good  relations  for 
several  reasons:  to  prevent  Pakistan  from  developing  an  anti- 
India  coalition  with  the  Central  Asian  states  in  the  dispute  over 
Kashmir,  to  persuade  those  states  not  to  provide  Pakistan  with 
assistance  in  its  nuclear  program,  to  ensure  continued  contacts 
with  long-standing  commercial  and  military  suppliers,  and  to 
provide  new  opportunities  to  Indian  businesses. 

Normal  diplomatic  and  trade  relations  are  an  Indian  goal  in 
relations  with  the  Central  Asian  republics.  For  example,  eco- 
nomic and  cultural  affairs  were  the  focal  point  of  Indian  prime 
minister  P.V.  Narahimsa  Rao's  official  visit  to  Uzbekistan  and 


540 


Foreign  Relations 


Kazakstan  in  May  1993.  Security  matters  also  are  important  as 
witnessed  by  a  February  1995  visit  to  India  by  Kazakstan's 
defense  minister.  Adherence  to  democracy  and  secularism  by 
these  countries  also  was  regarded  by  India  as  desirable  in  order 
to  ensure  stability  and  social  progress.  The  geopolitical  compe- 
tition between  India  and  Pakistan  for  influence  in  these  coun- 
tries is  likely  to  be  a  long-tern  factor. 

With  regard  to  Afghanistan,  India  supported  the  Marxist 
regime  in  Kabul  until  its  collapse  in  the  spring  of  1992.  India 
then  attempted  to  regain  some  influence  in  the  country  by 
cooperating  with  Iran  to  provide  assistance  to  Dari-speaking 
and  other  minorities  against  the  Pashtun  groups  backed  by 
Pakistan  in  the  ensuing  civil  war. 

Russia 

Despite  the  disintegration  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  1991,  the 
relationship  between  India  and  Russia  remains  one  of  consid- 
erable importance  to  both  countries.  Since  the  early  1950s, 
New  Delhi  and  Moscow  had  built  friendly  relations  on  the  basis 
of  realpolitik.  India's  nonalignment  enabled  it  to  accept  Soviet 
support  in  areas  of  strategic  congruence,  as  in  disputes  with 
Pakistan  and  China,  without  subscribing  to  Soviet  global  poli- 
cies or  proposals  for  Asian  collective  security.  Close  and  coop- 
erative ties  were  forged  in  particular  in  the  sectors  of  Indian 
industrial  development  and  defense  production  and  pur- 
chases. But  the  relationship  was  circumscribed  by  wide  differ- 
ences in  domestic  and  social  systems  and  the  absence  of 
substantial  people-to-people  contact — in  contrast  to  India's 
relations  with  the  United  States  (see  United  States,  this  ch.). 

Ties  between  India  and  the  Soviet  Union  initially  were  dis- 
tant. Nehru  had  expressed  admiration  for  the  Soviet  Union's 
rapid  economic  transformation,  but  the  Soviet  Union  regarded 
India  as  a  "tool  of  Anglo-American  imperialism."  After  Josef 
Stalin's  death  in  1953,  the  Soviet  Union  expressed  its  hopes  for 
"friendly  cooperation"  with  India.  This  aim  was  prompted  by 
the  Soviet  decision  to  broaden  its  international  contacts  and  to 
cultivate  the  nonaligned  and  newly  independent  countries  of 
Asia  and  Africa.  Nehru's  state  visit  to  the  Soviet  Union  in  June 
1955  was  the  first  of  its  kind  for  an  Indian  prime  minister.  It  was 
followed  by  the  trip  of  Premier  Nikolai  Bulganin  and  General 
Secretary  Nikita  Khrushchev  to  India  in  November  and  Decem- 
ber 1955.  The  Soviet  leaders  endorsed  the  entire  range  of 
Indian  foreign  policy  based  on  the  Panch  Shila  and  supported 


541 


India:  A  Country  Study 


India's  position  against  Pakistan  on  Kashmir.  The  Soviet  Union 
also  supported  India's  position  vis-a-vis  Portugal  on  Goa,  which 
was  territorially  integrated  into  India  as  a  union  territory  by  the 
Indian  armed  forces  in  December  1961  (it  became  a  state  in 
May  1987). 

The  Soviet  Union  and  some  East  European  countries 
offered  India  new  avenues  of  trade  and  economic  assistance. 
By  1965  the  Soviet  Union  was  the  second  largest  national  con- 
tributor to  India's  development.  These  new  arrangements  con- 
tributed to  India's  emergence  as  a  significant  industrial  power 
through  the  construction  of  plants  to  produce  steel,  heavy 
machinery  and  equipment,  machine  tools,  and  precision 
instruments,  and  to  generate  power  and  extract  and  refine 
petroleum.  Soviet  investment  was  in  India's  public-sector  indus- 
try, which  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  and  Western  indus- 
trial powers  had  been  unwilling  to  assist  until  spurred  by  Soviet 
competition.  Soviet  aid  was  extended  on  the  basis  of  long-term, 
government-to-government  programs,  which  covered  succes- 
sive phases  of  technical  training  for  Indians,  supply  of  raw 
materials,  progressive  use  of  Indian  inputs,  and  markets  for  fin- 
ished products.  Bilateral  arrangements  were  made  in  noncon- 
vertible  national  currencies,  helping  to  conserve  India's  scarce 
foreign  exchange.  Thus  the  Soviet  contribution  to  Indian  eco- 
nomic development  was  generally  regarded  by  foreign  and 
domestic  observers  as  positive  (see  Foreign  Economic  Rela- 
tions, ch.  6). 

Nehru  obtained  a  Soviet  commitment  to  neutrality  on  the 
India-China  border  dispute  and  war  of  1962.  During  the  India- 
Pakistan  war  of  1965,  the  Soviet  Union  acted  with  the  United 
States  in  the  UN  Security  Council  to  bring  about  a  cease-fire. 
Soviet  premier  Aleksei  N.  Kosygin  went  further  by  offering  his 
good  offices  for  a  negotiated  settlement,  which  took  place  at 
Tashkent  on  January  10,  1966.  Until  1969  the  Soviet  Union 
took  an  evenhanded  position  in  South  Asia  and  supplied  a  lim- 
ited quantity  of  arms  to  Pakistan  in  1968.  From  1959  India  had 
accepted  Soviet  offers  of  military  sales.  Indian  acquisition  of 
Soviet  military  equipment  was  important  because  purchases 
were  made  against  deferred  rupee  payments,  a  major  conces- 
sion to  India's  chronic  shortage  of  foreign  exchange.  Simulta- 
neous provisions  were  made  for  licensed  manufacture  and 
modification  in  India,  one  criterion  of  self-reliant  defense  on 
which  India  placed  increasing  emphasis.  In  addition,  Soviet 
sales  were  made  without  any  demands  for  restricted  deploy- 


542

ment,  adjustments  in  Indian  policies  toward  other  countries, 
adherence  to  Soviet  global  policies,  or  acceptance  of  Soviet 
military  advisers.  In  this  way,  Indian  national  autonomy  was  not 
compromised. 

The  most  intimate  phase  in  relations  between  India  and  the 
Soviet  Union  was  the  period  between  1971  and  1976:  its  high- 
light was  the  twenty-year  Treaty  of  Peace,  Friendship,  and 
Cooperation  of  August  1971.  Articles  8,  9,  and  10  of  the  treaty 
committed  the  parties  "to  abstain  from  providing  any  assistance 
to  any  third  party  that  engages  in  armed  conflict  with  the 
other"  and  "in  the  event  of  either  party  being  subjected  to  an 
attack  or  threat  thereof  ...  to  immediately  enter  into  mutual 
consultations."  India  benefited  at  the  time  because  the  Soviet 
Union  came  to  support  the  Indian  position  on  Bangladesh  and 
because  the  treaty  acted  as  a  deterrent  to  China.  New  Delhi 
also  received  accelerated  shipments  of  Soviet  military  equip- 
ment in  the  last  quarter  of  1971.  The  first  state  visit  of  Soviet 
president  Leonid  Brezhnev  to  India  in  November  1973  was 
conducted  with  tremendous  fanfare  and  stressed  the  theme  of 
economic  cooperation.  By  the  late  1970s,  the  Soviet  Union  was 
India's  largest  trading  partner. 

The  friendship  treaty  notwithstanding,  Indira  Gandhi  did 
not  alter  important  principles  of  Indian  foreign  policy.  She 
made  it  clear  that  the  Soviet  Union  would  not  receive  any  spe- 
cial privileges — much  less  naval  base  rights — in  Indian  ports, 
despite  the  major  Soviet  contribution  to  the  construction  of 
shipbuilding  and  ship-repair  facilities  at  Bombay  on  the  west 
coast  and  at  Vishakhapatnam  on  the  east  coast.  India's  advo- 
cacy of  the  Indian  Ocean  as  a  zone  of  peace  was  directed 
against  aggrandizement  of  the  Soviet  naval  presence  as  much 
as  that  of  other  extraregional  powers.  By  repeatedly  emphasiz- 
ing the  nonexclusive  nature  of  its  friendship  with  the  Soviet 
Union,  India  kept  open  the  way  for  normalizing  relations  with 
China  and  improving  ties  with  the  West. 

After  the  Soviet  intervention  in  Afghanistan,  Indian  diplo- 
mats avoided  condemnatory  language  and  resolutions  as  use- 
less Cold  War  exercises  that  could  only  antagonize  the  Soviet 
Union  and  postpone  political  settlement.  They  called  instead 
for  withdrawal  of  all  foreign  troops  and  negotiation  among 
concerned  parties.  In  meetings  with  Soviet  leaders  in  New 
Delhi  in  1980  and  in  Moscow  in  1982,  Indira  Gandhi  privately 
pressed  harder  for  the  withdrawal  of  Soviet  troops  and  for  the 


543

restoration  of  .Afghanistan's  traditional  nonalignment  and 
independence. 

Rajiv  Gandhi  journeyed  to  the  Soviet  Union  in  1985,  1986,. 
1987,  and  1989,  and  Soviet  president  Mikhail  S.  Gorbachev 
traveled  to  India  in  1986  and  1988.  These  visits  and  those  of 
other  high  officials  evoked  effusive  references  to  the  "exem- 
plary" (in  Gorbachev's  term)  friendship  between  the  two  coun- 
tries and  also  achieved  the  conclusion  of  agreements  to  expand 
economic,  cultural,  and  scientific  and  technological  coopera- 
tion.  In  1985  and  1986,  and  again  in  1988,  both  nations  signed 
pacts  to  boost  bilateral  trade  and  provide  Soviet  investment 
and  technical  assistance  for  Indian  industrial,  telecommunica- 
tions, and  transportation  projects.  In  1985  and  1988,  the  Soviet 
Union  also  extended  to  India  credits  of  1  billion  rubles  and  3 
billion  rubles,  respectively  (a  total  of  about  USS2.4  billion),  for 
the  purchase  of  Soviet  machinery  and  goods.  Protocols  for  sci- 
entific cooperation,  signed  in  1985  and  1987,  provided  the 
framework  for  joint  research  and  projects  in  space  science  and 
such  high-technology  areas  as  biotechnology,  computers,  and 
lasers.  The  flow  of  advanced  Soviet  military  equipment  also 
continued  in  the  mid-  and  late  1980s  (see  The  Air  Force,  ch. 
10). 

When  the  Soviet  Union  disintegrated,  India  was  faced  with 
the  difficult  task  of  reorienting  its  external  affairs  and  forging 
relations  with  the  fifteen  Soviet  successor  states,  of  which  Rus- 
sia was  the  most  important  (see  Central  Asia,  this  ch.).  In  1993 
New  Delhi  and  Moscow  worked  to  redefine  their  relationship 
according  to  post-Cold  War  realities.  During  the  Januarv  1993 
visit  of  Russian  president  Boris  Yeltsin  to  India,  the  two  coun- 
tries signed  agreements  that  signaled  a  new  emphasis  on  eco- 
nomic cooperation  in  bilateral  relations.  The  1971  treaty  was 
replaced  with  the  new  Treaty  of  Friendship  and  Cooperation, 
wrhich  dropped  securitv  clauses  that  in  the  Cold  War  were 
directed  against  the  United  States  and  China.  Yeltsin  stated 
that  Russia  would  deliver  cryogenic  engines  and  space  technol- 
ogy for  India's  space  program  under  a  USS350  million  deal 
between  the  Indian  Space  Research  Organisation  (ISRO)  and 
the  Russian  space  agency,  Glavkosmos,  despite  the  imposition 
of  sanctions  on  both  organizations  by  the  United  States.  In 
addition,  Yeltsin  expressed  strong  support  for  India's  stand  on 
Kashmir.  A  defense  cooperation  accord  aimed  at  ensuring  the 
continued  supply  of  Russian  arms  and  spare  parts  to  satisfy  the 
requirements  of  India's  military  and  at  promoting  the  joint 


544 


Foreign  Relations 


production  of  defense  equipment.  Bilateral  trade,  which  had 
fallen  drastically  during  the  1990-92  period,  was  expected  to 
revive  following  the  resolution  of  the  dispute  over  New  Delhi's 
debt  to  Moscow  and  the  May  1992  decision  to  abandon  the 
1978  rupee-ruble  trade  agreement  in  favor  of  the  use  of  hard 
currency. 

Pressure  from  the  United  States,  which  believed  the  engines 
and  technology  could  be  diverted  to  ballistic  missile  develop- 
ment, led  the  Russians  to  cancel  most  of  the  deal  in  July  1993. 
Russia  did,  however,  supply  rockets  to  help  India  to  develop  the 
technology  to  launch  geostationary  satellites,  and,  with  cryo- 
genic engine  plans  already  in  hand,  the  ISRO  was  determined 
to  produce  its  own  engines  by  1997  (see  Space  and  Nuclear 
Programs,  ch.  10). 

Despite  Yeltsin's  call  for  a  realignment  of  Russia,  India,  and 
China  to  balance  the  West,  Russia  shares  interests  with  the 
developed  countries  on  nuclear  proliferation  issues.  In  Novem- 
ber 1991,  Moscow  voted  for  a  Pakistani-sponsored  UN  resolu- 
tion calling  for  the  establishment  of  a  South  Asian  nuclear-free 
zone.  Russia  urged  India  to  support  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Pro- 
liferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  and  decided  in  March  1992  to 
apply  "full-scope  safeguards"  to  future  nuclear  supply  agree- 
ments. Russia  also  shares  interests  with  the  United  States  in 
cooling  antagonisms  between  India  and  Pakistan,  particularly 
with  regard  to  Kashmir,  thus  making  it  unlikely  that  India 
could  count  on  Russia  in  a  future  dispute  with  Pakistan. 

Rao  reciprocated  Yeltsin's  visit  in  July  1994.  The  two  leaders 
signed  declarations  assuring  international  and  bilateral  good- 
will and  continuation  of  Russian  arms  and  military  equipment 
exports  to  India.  Rao's  Moscow  visit  lacked  the  controversy  that 
characterized  his  May  1994  visit  to  the  United  States  and  was 
deemed  an  important  success  because  of  the  various  accords, 
one  of  which  restored  the  sale  of  cryogenic  engines  to  India. 

Bilateral  relations  between  India  and  Russia  improved  as  a 
result  of  eight  agreements  signed  in  December  1994.  The 
agreements  cover  military  and  technical  cooperation  from 
1995  to  2000,  merchant  shipping,  and  promotion  and  mutual 
protection  of  investments,  trade,  and  outer  space  cooperation. 
Political  observers  saw  the  visit  of  Russian  prime  minister  Vik- 
tor Chernomyrdin  that  occasioned  the  signing  of  the  eight 
agreements  as  a  sign  of  a  return  to  the  earlier  course  of  warm 
relations  between  New  Delhi  and  Moscow.  In  March  1995, 
India  and  Russia  signed  agreements  aimed  at  suppressing  ille- 


545

gal  weapons  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking.  And  when  Rus- 
sian nationalist  Vladimir  V.  Zhirinovsky  visited  India  in  March 
1995,  he  declared  that  he  would  give  India  large  supplies  of 
arms  and  military  hardware  if  he  were  elected  president  of  Rus- 
sia. 

United  States 

With  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  and  the  emergence  of  India's 
more  outward-looking  economic  policies,  the  United  States 
became  increasingly  important  for  India.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the 
United  States  was  India's  largest  trading  partner  and  a  major 
source  of  technology  and  investment  (see  Aid;  Trade,  ch.  6). 
Indian  students  more  than  ever  sought  higher  education  in  the 
United  States,  especially  in  the  areas  of  science  and  engineer- 
ing. Moreover,  the  presence  of  the  more  than  1  million  Indians 
and  Indian  Americans  residing  in  the  United  States  was  a  factor 
in  the  relationship.  Some  foreign  policy  makers  also  saw  India's 
strong  democratic  tradition,  although  much  younger  than  that 
of  the  United  States,  as  an  important  ingredient  in  India- 
United  States  relations.  Despite  the  asymmetrical  relationship 
that  had  existed  since  1947,  the  areas  of  common  interest  con- 
verged in  the  early  1990s  as  the  benefits  of  good  relations  were 
perceived  on  both  sides.  Some  Indian  observers,  however,  felt 
that  the  United  States  had  a  "negative  agenda"  concerning 
India  with  respect  to  human  rights,  the  nuclear  program,  and 
the  pace  of  economic  reforms.  Furthermore,  India's  long 
adherence  to  the  principles  of  nonalignment  has  had  an  inhib- 
iting effect  on  its  evolving  relations  with  the  United  States.  Nev- 
ertheless, some  opinion  makers  believed  that  an  India-United 
States  strategic  alliance  later  in  the  1990s  was  a  possibility. 

Until  1971  nonalignment  had  a  dual  effect  on  United  States 
policies  in  South  Asia.  On  the  one  hand,  Washington  consid- 
ered Indian  economic  and  political  stability  necessary  to  pre- 
vent that  important  regional  player  from  succumbing  to 
communism  and  Soviet  influence;  hence  the  United  States 
gave  economic  assistance  and  support  to  India  during  its  1962 
war  with  China  (see  External  Aid,  ch.  7).  On  the  other  hand, 
India's  nonalignment  had  led  the  United  States  in  1954  to  ally 
itself  with  Pakistan,  which  appeared  to  support  Western  secu- 
rity interests.  The  United  States-Pakistan  alliance  was  renewed 
in  1959,  with  accompanying  assurances  from  President  Dwight 
D.  Eisenhower  to  Nehru  that  the  arms  supplied  to  Pakistan 
would  not  be  used  in  any  aggressive  war.  When  Pakistan  and

Foreign  Relations 


India  went  to  war  in  1965,  the  United  States  government 
refused  to  support  India  and  suspended  military  transfers  to 
both  countries. 

In  1971  the  intertwining  of  the  United  States-Soviet,  Chi- 
nese-Soviet, and  Indian-Pakistani  conflicts  dragged  India- 
United  States  relations  to  the  nadir.  That  year,  while  Washing- 
ton initiated  a  new  relationship  with  Beijing,  New  Delhi  signed 
a  friendship  treaty  with  Moscow  to  counteract  United  States 
and  Chinese  influence  in  South  Asia.  As  the  situation  in  East 
Pakistan  deteriorated,  India  was  unable  to  convince  the  United 
States  to  cease  arms  deliveries  to  Pakistan  and  persuade  Paki- 
stan's leaders  to  reach  a  political  settlement  with  East  Pakistan's 
elected  representatives.  Indira  Gandhi's  November  1971  visit  to 
Washington  failed  to  alter  President  Richard  M.  Nixon's  pro- 
Pakistan  stance.  When  war  formally  began  after  Pakistani 
strikes  on  Indian  airfields  in  early  December  1971,  the  United 
States  and  China  voted  for  a  cease-fire  in  the  UN  Security 
Council,  but  the  Soviet  Union's  veto  prevented  any  resolution 
from  coming  into  effect.  Washington's  subsequent  deployment 
of  a  naval  task  force  to  the  Bay  of  Bengal  left  many  in  India  con- 
vinced that  the  United  States  was  a  major  security  threat. 

Relations  between  India  and  the  United  States  verged  on  the 
antagonistic  throughout  the  1970s.  After  Nixon  abruptly  termi- 
nated US$82  million  in  economic  assistance,  India  closed 
down  a  large  United  States  Agency  for  International  Develop- 
ment program.  The  Indian  government  also  restricted  the  flow 
of  American  scholars  and  students  to  India.  India's  criticisms  of 
United  States  policies  in  Vietnam  and  Cambodia  increased, 
and  it  upgraded  its  representation  in  Hanoi.  When  the  United 
States  expanded  its  naval  base  on  the  island  of  Diego  Garcia 
and  engaged  in  naval  exercises  with  Pakistan  in  the  Indian 
Ocean  in  1974,  India  saw  its  security  further  threatened.  Both 
governments,  however,  attempted  to  limit  the  damage  to  bilat- 
eral relations.  A  1973  agreement  defused  a  dispute  over  United 
States  rupee  holdings  by  writing  off  more  than  50  percent  of 
the  debt  and  directing  use  of  the  remainder  to  mutually  accept- 
able programs.  In  1974  the  Indo-United  States  Joint  Commis- 
sion was  established  to  insulate  bilateral  dealings  in  education 
and  culture,  economics,  and  science  and  technology  from 
political  controversy  and  to  provide  mechanisms  for  regular 
exchanges  at  high  levels  of  public  life. 

Hopes  for  improved  relations  were  expressed  in  1977  when 
Jimmy  Carter  became  president  of  the  United  States  and  the 


547 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Janata  Party  government  led  by  Morarji  Desai  took  over  in 
India  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8).  These  expectations  came  to 
an  abrupt  end  two  years  later  when  the  Soviet  Union  invaded 
Afghanistan.  The  promulgation  of  the  Carter  Doctrine,  estab- 
lishment of  the  Rapid  Deployment  Force  (later  called  the 
United  States  Central  Command)  and  an  Indian  Ocean  fleet, 
planned  expansion  of  the  naval  base  at  Diego  Garcia,  and 
arrangements  to  supply  Pakistan  with  US$3.2  billion  in  military 
and  economic  aid  over  five  years  all  appeared  as  direct  United 
States  intervention  in  the  countries  of  the  Persian  Gulf  and 
Indian  Ocean.  These  actions  fueled  instability  in  the  region 
and,  in  India's  view,  threatened  India's  security. 

The  personal  rapport  between  Indira  Gandhi  and  United 
States  president  Ronald  Reagan,  established  during  a  series  of 
meetings  in  the  early  1980s,  enabled  the  two  countries  gradu- 
ally to  begin  improving  bilateral  relations.  The  Reagan  admin- 
istration reassessed  its  policy  toward  India  and  decided  to 
expand  areas  of  cooperation,  particularly  in  the  economic  and 
scientific  realms,  as  a  means  of  counteracting  Soviet  influence 
in  the  region.  Washington  also  regarded  New  Delhi's  status  as 
the  major  regional  power  in  South  Asia  in  a  more  favorable 
light.  For  her  part,  Gandhi  realized  that  India  was  unable  to 
block  United  States  arms  sales  to  Pakistan,  but  that  improved 
dialogue  with  the  United  States  could  open  other  areas  of 
interaction  that  could  benefit  Indian  interests.  Indira  Gandhi's 
highly  successful  1982  state  visit  to  the  United  States  was  fol- 
lowed by  a  series  of  high-level  exchanges,  including  the  visits  of 
Vice  President  George  Bush  and  Secretary  of  State  George 
Shultz  to  India.  In  addition,  in  1982  the  two  sides  resolved  their 
dispute  concerning  supplies  of  fuel  and  spare  parts  for  the 
nuclear  power  plant  at  Tarapur.  In  1984  the  United  States 
decided  to  expand  technology  transfers  to  India. 

The  warming  trend  in  relations  between  New  Delhi  and 
Washington  continued  with  the  1985  and  1987  visits  by  Prime 
Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  to  Washington.  Furthermore,  as  the 
United  States  appreciation  of  India's  role  as  a  force  for  stability 
in  South  Asia  grew,  Washington  supported  New  Delhi's  moves 
in  Sri  Lanka  in  1987  and  in  Maldives  in  1988.  In  the  mid-  and 
late  1980s,  visits  exchanged  by  the  United  States  secretary  of 
defense  and  the  Indian  minister  of  defence  symbolized  a  mod- 
est but  growing  program  of  cooperation  in  military  technology 
and  other  defense  matters.  In  1988  Washington  and  New  Delhi 
finalized  an  accord  to  provide  United  States  technology  for 


548 


Foreign  Relations 


India's  light  combat  aircraft  program  and  also  agreed  to  trans- 
fer technology  for  the  F-5  fighter.  Cooperation  between  India 
and  the  United  States  in  a  variety  of  scientific  fields  followed 
the  signing  of  a  bilateral  agreement  on  scientific  and  techno- 
logical exchanges  in  1985.  Nonmilitary  technology  transfers 
also  accelerated,  and  in  1987  India  purchased  a  Cray  super- 
computer for  agricultural  research  and  weather  forecasting 
and  accepted  stringent  United  States  safeguards  to  preclude 
military  uses.  Furthermore,  economic  liberalization  measures 
paved  the  way  for  increased  trade  and  United  States  investment 
in  India.  In  1988  the  improved  economic  climate  resulted  in 
the  conclusion  of  a  deal  for  a  Pepsi-Cola  plant  and  the  signing 
of  a  bilateral  tax  treaty.  In  1989  United  States  investment  in 
India  reached  US$1  billion. 

In  the  1980s,  the  Indian  and  United  States  governments  had 
divergent  views  on  a  wide  range  of  international  issues,  includ- 
ing Afghanistan,  Cambodia,  the  Middle  East,  and  Central 
America.  Serious  differences  also  remained  over  United  States 
policy  toward  Pakistan  and  the  issue  of  nuclear  proliferation. 
India  was  repeatedly  incensed  in  the  1980s  when  the  United 
States  provided  advanced  military  technology  and  other  assis- 
tance to  Pakistan.  New  Delhi  also  found  objectionable  Wash- 
ington's unwillingness  to  cut  off  military  assistance  to 
Islamabad  despite  United  States  concerns  about  Pakistan's 
covert  nuclear  program.  For  its  part,  Washington  continued  to 
urge  New  Delhi  to  sign  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of 
Nuclear  Weapons  and,  after  the  successful  test  launch  of  the 
Indian  Agni  intermediate-range  ballistic  missile  in  May  1989, 
called  on  New  Delhi  to  refrain  from  developing  a  ballistic  mis- 
sile capability  by  adhering  to  the  restrictions  of  the  Missile 
Technology  Control  Regime.  India  rejected  these  appeals  on 
the  grounds  that  it  had  a  right  to  develop  such  technology  and 
that  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons 
and  the  United  States-sponsored  Missile  Technology  Control 
Regime  discriminated  against  nonnuclear  states. 

Bureaucratic  and  private-sector  resistance  to  foreign  partici- 
pation in  the  economy,  infrastructure  problems,  bureaucratic 
red  tape,  and  legal  problems  remained  formidable  obstacles  to 
significant  Indian-United  States  economic  cooperation.  In  the 
late  1980s,  India  had  differences  with  the  United  States  over 
improving  its  legal  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights, 
opening  its  markets  to  American  service  industries,  and  liberal- 
izing its  foreign  investment  regulations.  In  April  1991,  the 


549 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Office  of  the  United  States  Trade  Representative  placed  India 
on  Washington's  watch  list  over  intellectual  property  rights 
issues.  Six  months  later,  the  United  States  gave  India  a  three- 
month  grace  period  before  imposing  retaliatory  sanctions 
against  India's  pharmaceutical  industry  for  inadequate  patent 
protection.  India  resisted  United  States  pressure  to  adopt  a  less 
protectionist  stance  in  the  Uruguay  Round  of  negotiations  to 
renew  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT). 

In  the  early  1990s,  economic  reforms  permitted  a  qualitative 
breakthrough  in  relations  between  India  and  the  United 
States.  Washington  was  instrumental  in  speeding  a  US$1.8  bil- 
lion IMF  credit  that  New  Delhi  obtained  in  January  1991  to 
deal  with  a  severe  external-debt-payments  crisis.  In  1990  India 
and  the  United  States  signed  a  double  taxation  pact  designed 
to  facilitate  American  investment  in  India,  further  breaking  a 
thirty-year  deadlock  in  economic  relations.  The  United  States 
provided  only  modest  bilateral  economic  assistance  in  the  form 
of  food  aid  but  was  India's  largest  trading  partner  and  an 
important  source  of  investments  and  technology.  In  December 
1990,  the  United  States  approved  the  export  of  a  second  Cray 
supercomputer  for  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science  in  Banga- 
lore, Karnataka,  although  the  deal  fell  through  two  years  later 
because  of  India's  unwillingness  to  accept  safeguards  to  pre- 
vent the  computer's  diversion  to  military  uses. 

The  Soviet  withdrawal  from  Afghanistan  in  1989  had  led 
Washington  to  reassess  its  relationship  with  Pakistan,  with  posi- 
tive ramifications  for  New  Delhi.  Without  containment  of  the 
Soviet  Union  as  the  driving  factor  behind  close  Pakistani- 
United  States  ties,  and  concerns  mounting  about  Pakistan's 
nuclear  weapons  program,  the  United  States  suspended  mili- 
tary and  economic  assistance  to  that  country  in  October  1990. 
New  Delhi  appreciated  this  action  and  was  relieved  in  summer 
1991  when  the  United  States  Congress  voted  not  to  include 
India  in  the  Pressler  Amendment,  which  forbade  United  States 
assistance  to  Pakistan  if  it  violated  nuclear  nonproliferation  cri- 
teria. Washington  also  took  a  more  evenhanded  approach  to 
the  Kashmir  problem  in  1990,  urging  both  antagonists  to 
resolve  their  dispute  peacefully  under  the  terms  of  the  Simla 
Accord.  Furthermore,  the  United  States  began  pressuring  Paki- 
stan to  end  its  support  for  Kashmiri  and  Punjabi  Sikh  separat- 
ists. This  pressure  was  in  addition  to  efforts  initiated  in  the 
1980s  to  prevent  assistance  to  Sikh  terrorists  from  the  Sikh 
expatriate  community  in  the  United  States  (see  Rajiv  Gandhi, 


550 


Foreign  Relations 


ch.  1).  In  the  wake  of  terrorist  bombings  in  Bombay  in  March 
1993 — widely  believed  in  India  to  have  been  instigated  by  Paki- 
stanis— and  stepped-up  activities  among  Kashmiri  militants, 
Indian  politicians  and  the  media  reveled  in  the  possibility  that 
the  United  States  might  declare  Pakistan  a  practitioner  of  state- 
sponsored  terrorism.  Washington's  decision  in  July  1993  not  to 
declare  Pakistan  a  terrorist-supporting  state  displeased  many 
prominent  Indians,  and  Indian  political  analysts  accused  the 
United  States  of  having  a  "double  standard"  in  regard  to  spe- 
cific states  sponsoring  terrorism. 

Military  cooperation  also  grew.  Exchanges  of  senior  military 
officials  became  frequent,  a  high-level  bilateral  conference  on 
regional  security  affairs  was  held,  and  Minister  of  Defence 
Sharad  Pawar  journeyed  to  Washington  in  April  1992  to  discuss 
arms  supplies  and  military  technology.  Not  only  did  United 
States  navy  ships  make  occasional  ports  calls  in  India,  but  the 
two  navies  conducted  their  first-ever  joint  exercise  in  May  1992. 
Indian  officials  came  to  have  a  greater  appreciation  of  United 
States  interests  in  maintaining  a  military  presence  on  Diego 
Garcia  and  in  the  Persian  Gulf. 

In  1993,  India  and  the  United  States  appeared  committed  to 
improve  relations  and  bilateral  cooperation  despite  differences 
over  India's  refusal  to  sign  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation 
of  Nuclear  Weapons  and  to  participate  in  discussions  with  the 
United  States,  Russia,  China,  and  Pakistan  on  establishing  a 
South  Asian  nuclear-free  zone.  Nevertheless,  Washington 
directed  its  efforts  to  creating  a  climate  of  restraint  between 
New  Delhi  and  Islamabad  in  order  to  freeze  or  roll  back  their 
nuclear  weapons  programs.  However,  India  and  the  United 
States  remained  wary  of  each  other's  long-term  strategy  region- 
ally and  globally. 

Some  Indian  political  analysts  criticize  the  United  States  for 
following  a  "two-track  policy."  On  the  one  hand,  Washington 
has  supported  New  Delhi's  economic  reform  and  has  facili- 
tated international  loans  to  India,  but,  on  the  other,  it  has 
relentlessly  pursued  an  agenda  to  force  India's  accession  to 
United  States  nonproliferation  goals  and  has  used  human 
rights  issues  to  try  to  force  India  to  meet  Washington's  political 
objections.  Moreover,  many  Indians  have  expressed  worries 
that,  with  the  emergence  of  the  United  States  as  the  sole  super- 
power, and  as  the  leader  of  a  Western-dominated  coalition  after 
the  Persian  Gulf  War,  Washington  might  attempt  to  impose  its 
own  standards  for  democratic  values,  human  rights,  and  free 


551

markets.  India  fears  that  a  United  States  vision  of  a  new  world 
order  not  only  would  hurt  the  interests  of  Third  World  coun- 
tries economically  and  politically,  but  also  would  damage 
India's  drive  to  become  a  leading  power  in  a  multipolar  system. 
Washington's  decision  not  to  place  Pakistan  on  its  list  of 
nations  that  sponsor  terrorism  and  its  successful  efforts  in  get- 
ting Russia  to  cancel  the  sale  of  cryogenic  engines  to  India  are 
seen  as  detrimental  to  good  Indian-United  States  relations. 

In  the  midst  of  increasing  anti-United  States  political  rheto- 
ric and  newspaper  headlines,  Indian  and  United  States  officials 
have  seemed  to  agree  on  only  one  thing,  that  bilateral  relations 
had  reached  their  lowest  point  in  two  decades.  Observers  in 
both  countries  believe  that  the  administration  of  President  Wil- 
liam Clinton  places  a  low  priority  on  relations  with  India 
despite  the  fact  that  the  United  States  has  become  India's 
prime  trade  partner.  Against  this  backdrop,  Prime  Minister  Rao 
visited  the  United  States  in  May  1994  for  an  uneventful  round 
of  talks  with  President  Clinton,  who  encouraged  India's  eco- 
nomic reforms.  Six  memorandums  of  understanding  were 
signed  with  the  intent  of  expanding  official  contacts,  reviewing 
and  updating  a  1984  understanding  on  high-technology  trans- 
fer, enhancing  defense  cooperation,  stimulating  bilateral  ties, 
and  establishing  a  business  partnership  initiative. 

High-level  visits  to  India  in  early  1995  portended  greater  sta- 
bility in  India-United  States  relations.  Secretary  of  Defense  Wil- 
liam J.  Perry  visited  New  Delhi  in  January  to  sign  a  "landmark 
agreement"  on  military  cooperation  that  was  seen  by  some 
local  observers  as  a  convergence  in  India-United  States  security 
perceptions  after  nearly  fifty  years  of  divergent  viewpoints  (see 
National  Security  Challenges,  ch.  10).  Following  the  Perry  visit 
was  a  commercial  mission  led  by  Secretary  of  Commerce 
Ronald  H.  Brown  that  also  occurred  in  January.  Agreements 
signed  by  Indian  and  United  States  businesses  during  the  visit 
resulted  in  US$7  billion  in  contracts  and  investments  in  the 
communications,  health  care,  insurance,  finance,  and  automo- 
tive sectors.  Some  of  the  deals  consummated  were  intended  to 
build  the  infrastructure  needed  by  foreign  firms  to  do  business 
in  India.  In  March  1995,  Hilary  Rodham  Clinton,  the  wife  of 
the  United  States  president,  toured  India  as  part  of  an  exten- 
sive South  Asian  goodwill  tour.  In  April,  Secretary  of  the  Trea- 
sury Robert  E.  Rubin  visited  New  Delhi  to  sign  a  bilateral 
investment  protection  treaty  reflecting  the  substantial  increases 
in  United  States  investment  in  India  since  1991  and  Washing-

ton's  encouragement  to  India  to  apply  for  Agency  for  Interna- 
tional Development  loans. 

Britain,  Australia,  Canada,  Western  Europe,  and  Japan 

From  the  late  1940s  to  the  mid-1960s,  independent  India's 
most  important  relationship  was  with  Britain.  New  Delhi  and 
London  had  special  relations  because  of  common  historical 
ties,  political  institutions,  interest  in  economic  development, 
high  levels  of  trade  between  India  and  Britain,  and  British 
investment  in  India.  Despite  this  special  relationship,  Nehru's 
policy  of  nonalignment  was  designed,  in  part,  to  prevent  India 
from  becoming  too  dependent  on  Britain  and  other  former 
colonial  powers.  In  spite  of  cooperation  with  Australia,  Britain, 
and  Canada  in  the  Commonwealth  of  Nations — which  was 


553 


India:  A  Country  Study 


established  by  Britain  in  1931 — India's  nonaligned  stance  fre- 
quently put  India  at  odds  with  Britain,  the  United  States,  and 
other  Western  countries  on  Cold  War  and  anticolonial  issues 
(see  Commonwealth  of  Nations,  this  ch.).  Nevertheless,  com- 
mon democratic  principles  and  the  willingness  of  the  devel- 
oped countries  to  provide  economic  assistance  prompted  India 
to  build  modest  but  constructive  relations  with  these  countries. 

India's  relations  with  Britain  remain  important.  India  has  so 
successfully  diversified  its  economic  ties  that  London's  domina- 
tion is  no  longer  a  consideration  for  New  Delhi;  British  trade, 
investment,  and  aid,  however,  are  still  significant.  A  substantial 
community  of  people  of  Indian  origin  live  in  Britain,  contribut- 
ing to  the  business  and  intellectual  life  of  the  country.  Eco- 
nomic relations  were  improving  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s 
with  the  implementation  of  India's  economic  reforms.  Political 
differences  stemming  from  India's  nonaligned  stance  tended 
to  dissipate  with  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  and  the  collapse  of 
the  apartheid  system  in  South  Africa. 

From  the  mid-1960s  until  the  early  1980s,  the  difficulties 
encountered  in  conducting  trade  and  investing  in  India  caused 
countries  such  as  Japan  and  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 
(West  Germany)  to  seek  more  fruitful  commercial  opportuni- 
ties elsewhere  in  the  developing  world.  In  the  sphere  of  inter- 
national politics,  the  intricacies  of  balancing  ties  with  India  and 
Pakistan,  India's  tilt  toward  the  Soviet  Union  beginning  in 
1971,  divergent  views  on  nuclear  proliferation  issues,  and  the 
situations  in  Afghanistan  and  Cambodia  left  little  room  for 
improvement  of  relations  with  Japan  and  Western  Europe. 
Modest  moves  taken  to  liberalize  the  Indian  economy  in  the 
early  and  mid-1980s  and  increased  availability  of  private  invest- 
ment and  official  developmental  assistance  from  developed 
countries,  however,  provided  India  with  the  opportunity  to 
increase  trade  and  obtain  aid  and  investment  from  Japan  and 
Europe.  Indian  trade  with  countries  of  the  European  Eco- 
nomic Community  rose  dramatically,  and  Japan  became  India's 
largest  aid  donor.  By  the  late  1980s,  Indian,  West  European, 
and  Japanese  leaders  exchanged  regular  visits. 

In  the  early  1990s,  expanding  Indian  exports  and  attracting 
investment  from  developed  countries  became  a  major  priority 
in  India's  bilateral  relations.  India  developed  closer  ties  with 
Berlin — now  the  capital  of  a  united  Germany — Tokyo,  and  the 
European  Economic  Community  (later  the  European  Union) 
to  promote  Indian  economic  interests  and  enhance  its  diplo-

matic  maneuverability.  Japan  remained  India's  major  source  of 
bilateral  assistance,  and  Berlin  was  New  Delhi's  largest  trading 
partner  in  the  European  Economic  Community.  Nevertheless, 
India  and  the  developed  countries  had  differences  over  secu- 
rity and  nuclear  issues  and  the  attachment  of  political  criteria 
to  developmental  assistance. 

Relations  with  Australia  suffered  in  1990  and  1991  as  India 
expressed  its  displeasure  with  Australia's  sale  of  Mirage  fighters 
to  Pakistan.  In  1991  the  German  government  announced  it  was 
cutting  official  aid  to  India  because  of  "excessive  armament," 
while  the  British,  Canadian,  and  Japanese  governments  warned 
India  that  future  assistance  would  be  cut  back  if  India  did  not 
curtail  its  high  levels  of  military  spending,  which  the  developed 
countries  contend  suppressed  economic  development.  In  addi- 
tion, Britain,  France,  and  Germany  also  increased  pressure  on 
India  to  sign  the  nonproliferation  treaty,  and  France  cautioned 
India  that  any  future  agreements  to  supply  India  with  nuclear 
material  and  technology  must  adhere  to  "full-scope  safeguards" 
to  prevent  diversion  to  nuclear  weapons  production.  Finally, 
India  remained  concerned  that  developed  countries  would 
impose  human  rights  conditions  as  criteria  for  economic  aid. 

Participation  in  International  Organizations 

United  Nations 

During  the  Cold  War,  India's  participation  in  the  UN  was 
notable  for  its  efforts  to  resist  the  imposition  of  superpower  dis-

putes  on  UN  General  Assembly  debates  and  to  focus  interna- 
tional attention  on  the  problems  of  economic  development.  In 
the  early  1950s,  India  attempted  unsuccessfully  to  help  China 
join  the  UN.  India's  mediatory  role  in  resolving  the  stalemate 
over  prisoners  of  war  in  Korea  led  to  the  signing  of  the  armi- 
stice ending  the  Korean  War.  India  chaired  the  five-member 
Neutral  Nations  Repatriation  Commission  while  the  Indian 
Custodian  Force  supervised  the  process  of  interviews  and  repa- 
triation that  followed.  The  UN  entrusted  Indian  armed  forces 
with  subsequent  peace  missions  in  the  Middle  East,  Cyprus, 
and  the  Congo  (since  1971,  Zaire).  India  also  served  as  chair  of 
the  three  international  commissions  for  supervision  and  con- 
trol for  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  and  Laos  established  by  the  1954 
Geneva  Accords  on  Indochina  (see  Peacekeeping  Operations, 
ch.  10). 

Although  not  a  permanent  member  of  the  UN  Security 
Council,  India  has  been  elected  periodically  to  fill  a  nonperma- 
nent  seat,  and  during  the  1991-92  period  served  in  that  capac- 
ity. In  the  early  1990s,  New  Delhi  supported  reform  of  the  UN 
in  the  hope  of  securing  a  permanent  seat  on  the  Security 
Council.  This  development  would  recognize  India's  position  as 
the  second-largest  population  (possibly  the  largest  in  the  early 
twenty-first  century)  in  the  world,  with  an  economy  projected 
by  some  to  become  the  fourth  largest,  after  China,  the  United 
States,  and  Japan,  by  2020. 

India  also  has  served  as  a  member  of  many  UN  bodies — 
including  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  the  Human  Rights 
Commission,  and  the  Disarmament  Commission — and  on  the 
board  of  governors  of  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency. 
In  addition,  India  played  a  prominent  role  in  articulating  the 
economic  concerns  of  developing  countries  in  such  UN-spon- 
sored conferences  as  the  triennial  UN  Conference  on  Trade 
and  Development  and  the  1992  Conference  on  the  Environ- 
ment and  Development  in  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

Commonwealth  of  Nations 

India  is  a  member  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Nations,  the 
multinational  association  of  Britain  and  its  former  colonies. 
Although  Nehru  initially  considered  withdrawal  from  this  orga- 
nization, he  decided  to  retain  membership  to  prevent  isolation 
in  the  bipolar  international  system,  to  prevent  the  Common- 
wealth from  becoming  pro-Pakistan,  to  have  access  to  Western 
economic  assistance  and  military  equipment  without  excessive

dependence  on  the  United  States,  and  to  convert  the  Com- 
monwealth from  an  extension  of  the  British  Empire  to  a  multi- 
racial association  of  equal  states.  India  actively  participates  m 
Commonwealth  affairs  and  has  found  the  organization  a  useful 
forum  in  which  to  voice  its  concerns  on  such  matters  as  apart- 
heid, race  relations,  and  citizenship  rights,  as  well  as  a  source  oi 
economic  assistance  under  the  Colombo  Plan  for  Cooperative 
Economic  and  Social  Development  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific 
(Colombo  Plan-see  Glossary).  In  1989  the  Indian  govern- 
ment under  Rajiv  Gandhi  sponsored  Pakistan's  reapphcation 
for  Commonwealth  membership  under  the  civilian  leadership 
of  Benazir  Bhutto.  In  the  early  1990s,  with  Indian  approval, 
Commonwealth  priorities  were  enlarged  to  include  the  impor- 
tance of  democratic  institutions  and  human  rights. 

Nonaligned  Movement 

India  played  an  important  role  in  the  multilateral  move- 


557 


India:  A  Country  Study 

ments  of  colonies  and  newly  independent  countries  that  devel- 
oped into  the  Nonaligned  Movement.  The  movement  had  its 
origins  in  the  1947  Asian  Relations  Meeting  in  New  Delhi  and 
the  1955  Asian-African  Conference  in  Bandung,  Indonesia. 
India  also  participated  in  the  1961  Belgrade  Conference  that 
officially  established  the  Nonaligned  Movement,  but  Nehru's 
declining  prestige  limited  his  influence.  In  the  1960s  and 
1970s,  New  Delhi  concentrated  on  internal  problems  and  bilat- 
eral relations,  yet  retained  membership  in  an  increasingly  fac- 
tionalized  and  radicalized  movement.  During  the  contentious 
1979  Havana  summit,  India  worked  with  moderate  nations  to 
reject  Cuban  president  Fidel  Castro's  proposition  that  "social- 
ism" (that  is,  the  Soviet  Union)  was  the  "natural  ally"  of  non- 
alignment. 

Under  Indira  Gandhi  in  the  early  1980s,  India  attempted  to 
reassert  its  prominent  role  in  the  Nonaligned  Movement  by 
focusing  on  the  relationship  between  disarmament  and  eco- 
nomic development.  By  appealing  to  the  economic  grievances 
of  developing  countries,  Indira  Gandhi  and  her  successors 
exercised  a  moderating  influence  on  the  Nonaligned  Move- 
ment, diverting  it  from  some  of  the  Cold  War  issues  that 
marred  the  controversial  1979  Havana  meeting.  Although  host- 
ing the  1983  summit  boosted  Indian  prestige  within  the  move- 
ment, its  close  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  pro- 
Soviet  positions  on  Afghanistan  and  Cambodia  limited  its  influ- 
ence. 

The  end  of  the  Cold  War  left  the  Nonaligned  Movement 
without  its  original  raison  d'etre,  and  its  membership  became 
deeply  divided  over  international  disputes,  strategy,  and  orga- 
nization. During  the  1992  Jakarta  summit,  India  took  a  middle 
position  between  countries  favoring  confrontation  with  devel- 
oped nations  on  international  economic  issues,  such  as  Malay- 
sia, and  those  that  favored  a  more  cooperative  approach,  such 
as  Indonesia.  Although  New  Delhi  played  a  minor  role  com- 
pared with  Kuala  Lumpur  and  Jakarta  on  most  issues  facing  the 
summit,  India  formulated  the  Nonaligned  Movement  position 
opposing  developed  countries'  linkage  of  foreign  aid  to  human 
rights  criteria. 

India  also  is  a  founding  member  of  the  Group  of  Fifteen 
(see  Glossary) ,  a  group  of  developing  nations  established  at  the 
ninth  Nonaligned  Movement  summit  in  Belgrade  in  1989  to 
facilitate  dialogue  with  the  industrialized  countries.  India 
played  host  to  the  fourth  Group  of  Fifteen  summit  in  March

Foreign  Relations 


1994.  At  the  summit,  Prime  Minister  Rao  and  other  leaders 
expressed  concern  over  new  trade  barriers  being  raised  by  the 
industrialized  countries  despite  the  conclusion  of  a  new  world 
trade  agreement. 

South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation 

India  is  a  member  of  SAARC,  along  with  Pakistan,  Ban- 
gladesh, Nepal,  Bhutan,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Maldives.  SAARC, 
which  slowly  emerged  out  of  the  initiative  of  Bangladesh  in 
1980,  was  formally  inaugurated  in  1985.  SAARC,  which  has  a 
permanent  secretariat  in  Kathmandu,  is  funded  by  voluntary 
contributions  and  operates  on  the  principle  of  unanimity  in 
decision  making.  Discussion  of  contentious  bilateral  issues  is 
excluded  from  the  SAARC  charter  at  Indian  insistence. 
Instead,  SAARC  programs  exist  in  the  areas  of  agriculture, 
rural  development,  transportation  and  telecommunications, 
meteorology,  health  and  population  control,  postal  services, 
science  and  technology,  culture  and  sports,  women  in  develop- 
ment, drug  trafficking  and  abuse,  and  terrorism.  By  the  mid- 
1990s,  SAARC  had  yet  to  become  an  effective  regional  organi- 
zation, largely  because  of  mutual  distrust  between  India  and  its 
neighbors.  India's  lukewarm  support  for  SAARC  stems  from 
the  concern  that  its  neighbors  might  coalesce  against  it  to  the 
detriment  of  Indian  interests.  The  reluctance  of  India  and 
other  South  Asian  countries  to  turn  SAARC  into  a  forum  for 
resolving  major  regional  disputes  hampers  SAARC's  ability  to 
deal  with  many  of  South  Asia's  economic  and  political  prob- 
lems. Nonetheless,  when  SAARC's  eighth  summit  was  held  in 
New  Delhi  in  May  1995,  the  conferees  declared  their  nations' 
commitment  to  eradicating  poverty  in  South  Asia  by  2002.

There  is  an  extensive  English-language  literature  on  India's 
foreign  relations.  Indian  government  publications — the  Minis-

Affairs  Record,  and  the  Parliament's  Compendium  of  Policy  State- 
ments Made  in  the  Parliament:  External  Affairs — are  important 
official  sources  of  information.  The  annual  edition  of  Yearbook 
on  India' s  Foreign  Policy  contains  a  useful  survey  of  foreign  pol- 
icy trends  as  well  as  articles  on  bilateral  relations.  The  Economic

A  large  number  of  books  and  articles  are  published  each 
year  on  specific  subjects  such  as  nonalignment,  foreign  aid, 
nuclear  issues,  and  specific  bilateral  relations.  The  speeches 
and  writings  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  offer  considerable  insight 
into  the  rationale  and  direction  of  Indian  foreign  policy  during 
the  Cold  War  period.  Norman  D.  Palmer's  The  United  States  and

after  the  Cold  War,  Robert  C.  Horn's  Soviet-Indian  Relations,  and 
Peter  J. S.  Duncan's  The  Soviet  Union  and  India  are  good  analyti- 
cal studies  of  India's  relations  with  the  superpowers.  Compre- 
hensive surveys  of  Indian  foreign  relations  before  the  end  of 
the  Cold  War  are  found  in  Charles  Heimseth  and  Surjit

Chapter  10.  National  Security 


Battling  horseman  from  a  nineteenth-century  wall  painting,  Gujarat 


THE  INDIAN  ARMED  FORCES  have  undergone  a  substantial 
metamorphosis  since  the  emergence  of  India  and  Pakistan 
from  the  British  Indian  Empire  in  1947.  India's  first  prime  min- 
ister, Jawaharlal  Nehru  (1947-64),  had  deliberately  limited  the 
expansion  and  modernization  of  the  armed  forces.  The  ratio- 
nale was  twofold:  Nehru  was  acutely  concerned  about  the 
accelerating  costs  of  defense  spending,  and  he  feared  that  an 
excessive  emphasis  on  the  armed  forces  would  lead  to  the  mili- 
tarization of  society  and  undermine  the  nation's  fledgling  dem- 
ocratic institutions.  The  disastrous  performance  of  the  Indian 
army  during  the  1962  border  war  with  China,  however,  led  to  a 
reappraisal  of  defense  strategy  and  spending.  Nehru's  legacy 
eroded  rapidly  as  increasing  emphasis  was  placed  on  defense 
needs.  The  success  of  the  Indian  military  against  Pakistan  dur- 
ing their  1971  war  contributed  to  restoring  the  morale  and 
standing  in  society  of  the  armed  forces.  During  the  rest  of  the 
1970s  and  in  the  1980s,  India  bolstered  its  regional  preemi- 
nence with  wide-ranging  arms  transfers  from  the  Soviet  Union. 
In  the  late  1980s,  in  an  effort  to  reduce  its  dependence  on 
Soviet  weaponry,  India  began  to  diversify  its  arms  sources.  It 
purchased  aircraft,  submarines,  and  long-range  artillery  pieces 
from  France,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Ger- 
many), Sweden,  and  Britain.  Simultaneously,  it  continued  its 
efforts  to  expand  and  strengthen  domestic  capabilities  to  man- 
ufacture a  range  of  weaponry  to  maximize  self-reliance.  The 
results  of  these  purchases  and  self-reliance  efforts  have  been 
mixed. 

The  1980s  saw  not  only  substantial  growth  in  Indian  defense 
expenditures  but  also  the  use  of  the  armed  forces  in  support  of 
larger  foreign  and  security  policy  goals.  Specifically,  the  army 
saw  action  against  Pakistani  military  personnel  in  disputed 
areas  along  the  Siachen  Glacier  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir, 
deployed  at  considerable  cost  as  diplomatic  efforts  failed.  All 
three  branches  of  the  armed  forces,  but  particularly  the  army, 
were  used  to  pursue  India's  security  and  foreign  policy  objec- 
tives in  Sri  Lanka  in  the  late  1980s  (see  South  Asia,  ch.  9).  More 
than  60,000  soldiers  were  deployed  in  Sri  Lanka  as  part  of  the 
Indian  Peace  Keeping  Force  (IPKF)  to  enforce  the  terms  of  the 
1987  Indo-Sri  Lankan  Accord.  Designed  to  serve  as  a  neutral 
force  between  contending  ethnic  forces,  the  IPKF  became 


563

enmeshed  in  operations  against  the  Liberation  Tigers  of  Tamil 
Eelam  (LTTE).  In  1989  the  new  Sri  Lankan  president,  Rana- 
singhe  Premadasa,  ended  a  five-and-a-half-year  state  of  emer- 
gency and  asked  India  to  withdraw  the  IPKF.  Accordingly, 
Indian  army  units  returned  home  with  most  goals  unmet. 

In  1988  a  smaller,  much  shorter-lived  Indian  expedition  suc- 
cessfully ended  a  military  coup  attempt  in  Maldives  and  dem- 
onstrated the  military's  effective  use  of  airborne  and  naval 
forces  in  a  joint  operation. 

India  is  the  preeminent  military  power  in  South  Asia,  but  its 
margin  of  superiority  over  Pakistan — its  principal  South  Asian 
rival — has  eroded  because  the  central  government  of  India  is 
faced  with  severe  budgetary  constraints.  In  addition,  the  armed 
forces  are  no  longer  able  to  obtain  sophisticated  weaponry  at 
highly  subsidized  prices  from  Russia,  and  substantial  numbers 
of  army  units  are  tied  down  in  various  internal  security  duties. 
Insurgencies  in  Assam,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  and  Punjab  have 
necessitated  the  use  of  the  army  in  "aid-to-the-civil  power" 
when  the  local  police  and  central  paramilitary  forces  are 
unable  to  maintain  public  order.  Increasingly  frequent  out- 
breaks of  communal  violence  also  have  necessitated  the  use  of 
the  army  to  restore  calm. 

The  increased  reliance  on  the  army  for  internal  security 
duties  generated  concern  among  senior  officers  in  the  early 
1990s.  Then  chief  of  army  staff  General  Sunith  Francis  Rod- 
rigues  repeatedly  expressed  his  misgivings  about  the  inordinate 
use  of  the  army  to  deal  with  civil  problems  because  such  actions 
increased  the  risk  of  politicizing  the  armed  forces  and  reduced 
their  battle  readiness.  Moreover,  the  very  nature  of  counterin- 
surgent  and  counterterrorist  operations  exposed  the  army  to 
charges  of  human  rights  violations.  In  1993,  at  the  insistence  of 
the  army,  the  government  agreed  to  examine  this  growing 
problem.  Discussions  focused  on  improving  the  recruitment, 
training,  and  organization  of  the  various  central  paramilitary 
forces. 

The  air  force  and  the  navy  underwent  considerable  growth 
and  modernization  during  the  1980s,  although  their  plans  for 
modernization  and  expansion,  like  those  of  the  army,  were 
hobbled  by  financial  constraints.  Nevertheless,  the  navy  has 
adequate  capabilities  for  coastal  defense  as  well  as  the  protec- 
tion of  offshore  union  territories  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  and  the 
Arabian  Sea.  The  air  force  is  equipped  with  modern  combat 
aircraft  and  has  moderate  airlift  capabilities. 


564 


National  Security 


Human  rights  violations  in  Assam,  Jammu  and  Kashmir, 
Punjab,  and  other  parts  of  the  country  have  largely  been  attrib- 
uted to  the  paramilitary  forces.  The  army  has  willingly  acknowl- 
edged that  some  lapses  have  occurred  within  its  own  ranks.  It 
also  has  court-martialed  officers  and  enlisted  personnel 
charged  with  breaches  of  proper  discipline  and  conduct.  How- 
ever, the  army  has  refused  to  divulge  any  details  about  the 
extent  of  these  problems.  The  numbers  of  individuals  prose- 
cuted, their  ranks,  and  their  names  remain  outside  the  public 
domain.  Nevertheless,  Amnesty  International  and  Asia  Watch 
have  reported  on  incidents  they  have  been  able  to  document. 

Colonial-Era  Developments 

Company  Armies 

The  roots  of  the  modern  Indian  army  are  traced  to  the 
forces  employed  by  the  English  (later  British)  East  India  Com- 
pany, chartered  in  1600,  and  the  French  East  India  Company 
(Compagnie  des  Indes  Orientales),  established  in  1664.  The 
French,  headquartered  at  Pondicherry  (Puduchcheri)  by  the 
1670s,  were  the  first  to  raise  Indian  companies  and  use  them  in 
conjunction  with  European  soldiers.  Subsequently,  in  the 
1740s,  the  British  started  to  organize  and  train  Indian  units. 
British  units  were  divided  into  three  armies  corresponding  to 
the  company's  centers  of  Bengal  (headquartered  at  Fort  Will- 
iam in  Calcutta),  Bombay  (or  Mumbai  in  the  Marathi  lan- 
guage), and  Madras  (headquartered  at  Fort  Saint  George).  In 
1748  the  East  India  Company  armies  were  brought  under  the 
command  of  Stringer  Lawrence,  who  is  regarded  by  historians 
as  the  progenitor  of  the  modern  Indian  army.  Under  his  guid- 
ance, British  officers  recruited,  trained,  and  deployed  these 
forces.  Although  formally  under  a  unified  command,  the  three 
armies  in  practice  exercised  considerable  autonomy  because  of 
the  great  distances  that  separated  them. 

Toward  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  century,  the  vast  majority 
of  the  soldiers  of  each  army  was  composed  of  Indian  troops 
known  as  sepoys  (from  the  Hindi  sipahi,  meaning  police  offi- 
cer, or,  later,  soldier).  Sepoy  units  had  Indian  junior  commis- 
sioned officers  who  could  exercise  only  low-level  command. 
British  officers  held  all  senior  positions.  No  Indian  had  any 
authority  over  non-Indians.  In  addition  to  these  all-Indian 
units,  the  British  deployed  some  units  of  the  British  Army.

The  Indian  Military  under  the  British  Raj 

Post-Sepoy  Rebellion  Reorganization 

Shortly  after  the  Sepoy  Rebellion  of  1857-58,  the  role  of  the 
presidency  armies  was  reevaluated  (see  The  British  Raj,  1858- 
1947,  ch.  1).  In  1861  the  Bengal  Army  was  disbanded,  and  the 
total  number  of  sepoys  was  reduced  from  230,000  to  150,000 
while  the  British  element  was  increased  from  40,000  to  75,000. 
Most  Indian  artillery  units  were  disbanded,  and  artillery  was 
placed  under  British  control.  Under  the  aegis  of  the  imperial 
"divide  and  rule"  policy,  which  had  its  inception  at  this  time, 
the  British  ensured  that  a  sense  of  nationality  would  not  be 
allowed  to  develop  among  the  sepoys.  The  growth  of  such  feel- 
ings, it  was  feared,  would  undermine  the  prospects  of  imperial 
control.  Accordingly,  Indian  regiments  increasingly  were  orga- 
nized on  a  territorial  basis;  individual  companies — and  in  some 
cases  entire  regiments — were  drawn  from  the  same  religious, 
tribal,  or  caste  backgrounds.  When  companies  from  several 
regiments  were  grouped  into  battalions,  considerable  efforts 
were  made  to  promote  cultural  and  social  distinctions  among 
companies  of  different  compositions. 

"Martial Races"  Theory 

By  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  recruitment  was  con- 
fined to  certain  social  classes  and  communities — principally 
those  in  the  northern  border  areas  and  Punjab.  The  narrowing 
recruitment  base  was  a  response  to  the  Sepoy  Rebellion  and 
reflected  the  needs  of  prevailing  security  requirements.  The 
bulk  of  the  rebels  in  the  Bengal  Army  came  from  the  Indo- 
Gangetic  Plain  while  those  that  had  remained  loyal  were  mostly 
from  Punjab. 

The  experience  of  the  mutiny  also  gave  rise  to  a  pseudo-eth- 
nological construction,  the  concept  of  "martial  races"  in  South 
Asia.  The  popularization  of  this  notion  was  widely  attributed  to 
Frederick  Sleigh  Roberts,  Earl  of  Kandahar,  Pretoria,  and 
Waterford;  Roberts  was  an  Indian-born  veteran  of  the  British 
forces  that  put  down  the  Sepoy  Rebellion  and  the  commander 
in  chief  of  the  British  Indian  Army  from  1885  to  1893.  Roberts 
believed  that  the  most  martial  races  were  located  in  northwest- 
ern India.  He  regarded  Bengalis,  Marathas,  and  southern  eth- 
nic groups  as  lacking  in  martial  virtues.  Their  warlike 
propensities,  he  contended,  had  dissipated  because  of  the  ease 
of  living  and  the  hot,  enervating  climate  of  these  regions. 


566 


National  Security 


Roberts's  views  profoundly  influenced  the  composition  of 
the  British  Indian  army  in  the  last  decades  of  the  nineteenth 
century.  For  example,  when  the  Bengal  Army  was  reestablished 
in  1885,  its  new  units  were  drawn  from  Punjab.  In  1892  army 
policy  was  changed  significantly.  Units  were  no  longer  raised 
on  a  territorial  basis  but  along  what  was  referred  to  as  "class" 
lines.  In  effect,  regiments  admitted  only  those  having  similar 
ethnic,  religious,  or  caste  backgrounds.  Between  1892  and 
1914,  recruitment  was  confined  almost  entirely  to  the  martial 
races.  These  modes  of  recruitment  and  organization  created  a 
professional  force  profoundly  shaped  by  caste  and  regional  fac- 
tors and  loyal  and  responsive  to  British  command.  The  proce- 
dures also  perpetuated  regional  and  communal  ties  and 
produced  an  army  that  was  not  nationally  based. 

Administrative  Reform  and  World  War  I 

Administrative  reforms  in  1895  abolished  the  presidency 
armies,  and  command  was  centralized  under  the  aegis  of  a  sin- 
gle army  headquarters  at  Delhi.  In  the  early  twentieth  century, 
the  process  of  centralization  continued;  and  during  this 
period,  the  separation  between  military  and  civilian  spheres  of 
influence  and  the  ultimate  primacy  of  civilian  authority  gained 
final  acceptance  in  both  civilian  and  military  circles. 

During  World  War  I,  India's  contribution  of  troops,  money, 
and  supplies  to  the  Allied  cause  was  substantial.  More  than  1 
million  Indian  soldiers  were  sent  abroad,  and  more  than 
100,000  were  either  killed  or  wounded. 

The  mobilization  for  the  war  effort  revealed  a  number  of 
shortcomings  in  the  military  establishment.  Officer  casualties 
had  a  particularly  pernicious  effect  on  military  formations 
because  only  the  British  officers  assigned  to  a  battalion  had  the 
authority  and  standing  to  exercise  overall  command.  In  addi- 
tion, Indian  officers  from  one  company  could  rarely  be  trans- 
ferred to  another  having  a  different  ethnic,  religious,  or  caste 
makeup.  As  a  consequence,  after  the  war  most  battalions  were 
reorganized  to  ease  reinforcement  among  component  compa- 
nies. Strong  pressure  from  the  Indian  public  also  drove  the 
British  to  begin  training  a  small  complement  of  Indians  for 
commissions  as  a  first  step  in  the  Indianization  of  the  officer 
corps.  The  Royal  Indian  Air  Force  was  established  in  1932,  and 
a  small  Indian  marine  unit  was  reorganized  into  the  Royal 
Indian  Navy  in  1934.  Indian  artillery  batteries  were  first  formed 
only  in  1936.  Although  the  practice  of  limiting  recruitment  to 


567 


India:  A  Country  Study 

the  martial  races  had  proved  inadequate  during  World  War  I 
and  entry  had  been  opened  to  "nonmartial"  groups,  the  tradi- 
tional recruitment  emphasis  on  martial  races  was  nonetheless 
resumed  after  demobilization. 

World  WarU 

The  political  situation  in  India  underwent  a  fundamental 
transformation  at  the  time  of  Britain's  entry  into  World  War  II 
(see  Political  Impasse  and  Independence,  ch.  1).  The  viceroy 
and  governor  general  of  India,  Victor  Alexander  John  Hope, 
Marquis  of  Linlithgow,  without  consulting  Indian  political  lead- 
ers, declared  India  to  be  at  war  with  Germany  on  September  3, 
1939.  The  legislature  sustained  the  viceregal  decree  and  passed 
the  Defence  of  India  Bill  without  opposition,  as  the  representa- 
tives of  the  Indian  National  Congress  (the  Congress — see  Glos- 
sary) boycotted  the  session.  Between  1939  and  mid-1945,  the 
British  Indian  Army  expanded  from  about  175,000  to  more 
than  2  million  troops — entirely  through  voluntary  enlistment. 
The  incipient  naval  and  air  forces  were  also  expanded,  and  the 
Indian  officer  corps  grew  from  600  to  more  than  14,000. 
Indian  troops  were  deployed  under  overall  British  command  in 
Africa,  Italy,  the  Middle  East,  and  particularly  in  Burma  and 
Southeast  Asia.  The  great  expansion  in  strength,  the  overseas 
service  of  Indian  forces,  and  the  demonstrated  soldierly  ability 
of  Indians  from  all  groups  did  much  to  dispel  the  martial  races 
theory. 

In  Asia  the  Japanese  sought  to  exploit  Indian  nationalism 
and  anti-British  sentiment  by  forming  and  supporting  the 
Indian  National  Army  (INA — Azad  Hind  Fauj),  which  was  com- 
posed primarily  of  25,000  of  the  60,000  Indian  troops  who  had 
surrendered  to  the  Japanese  in  Singapore  in  February  1942. 
The  army  was  led  by  Subhas  Chandra  Bose,  a  former  militant 
president  of  the  Congress,  who  also  appointed  himself  head  of 
the  Provisional  Government  of  Azad  India  (Free  India).  An 
unusual  feature  of  the  INA  was  an  all-woman,  intercaste  regi- 
ment composed  of  some  1,500  Indian  women  from  Burma, 
Malaya,  and  Singapore.  Both  the  women  and  the  25,000-strong 
male  contingent  were  organized  to  fight  alongside  the  Japa- 
nese in  Burma,  but  they  actually  saw  little  action.  Only  8,000 
were  sent  to  the  front.  Japanese  and  INA  troops  invaded 
Manipur  in  March  1944  and  fought  and  were  defeated  in  bat- 
tles at  Imphal  and  Kohima  (see  fig.  1).  By  May  1945,  the  INA 
had  disintegrated  because  of  acute  logistical  problems,  defec-

tions,  and  superior  British-led  forces.  It  is  widely  held  that  Bose 
was  killed  in  an  air  crash  in  Taiwan  as  he  fled  at  the  end  of  the 
war.  The  British  court  martialed  three  INA  officers.  Nationalist- 
minded  lawyers,  including  Nehru,  defended  them  as  national 
heroes,  and  the  British,  feeling  intense  public  pressure,  found 
them  guilty  but  cashiered  them  without  any  further  punish- 
ment. However,  after  independence  Nehru  refused  to  reinstate 
them  into  the  Indian  armed  forces,  fearing  that  they  might  sow 
discord  among  the  ranks. 

Postindependence  Developments 

The  National  Forces 

Following  independence  in  1947,  important  organizational 
changes  strengthened  civilian  control  over  the  military.  The 
position  of  commander  in  chief  was  abolished  in  1955,  and  the 
three  service  chiefs  were  placed  on  an  equal  footing  beneath 
the  civilian  Ministry  of  Defence.  These  changes  significantly 
reduced  the  influence  of  the  numerically  superior  army,  to 
which  the  other  services  had  been  subordinate,  and  limited  the 
service  chiefs  to  advisory  roles  in  the  defense  decision-making 
process.  The  changes  reflected  the  ambiguous  feelings  of  the 
civilian  leadership  toward  the  military.  Nehru  and  other  Indian 
nationalists  saw  the  military  as  an  institution  strongly  wedded 
to  the  colonial  past.  The  heritage  of  nonviolence  (ahimsa)  of 
Mohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi  also  was  important  to  the 
national  political  leadership  (see  Mahatma  Gandhi,  ch.  1). 

Independence  and  the  partition  from  Pakistan  imposed  sig- 
nificant costs  on  the  Indian  defense  establishment  that  took 
years  to  redress.  The  partition  of  the  country  had  entailed  the 
division  of  the  armed  forces  personnel  and  equipment.  Pre- 
dominantly Muslim  units  went  to  Pakistan,  followed  later  by 
individual  transfers.  Close  to  two-thirds  of  all  army  personnel 
went  to  India.  As  a  secular  state,  India  accepted  all  armed 
forces  personnel  without  regard  to  religious  affiliation.  The 
division  of  the  navy  was  based  on  an  estimation  of  each  nation's 
maritime  needs.  A  combination  of  religious  affiliation  and  mil- 
itary need  was  applied  to  the  small  air  force.  As  a  result  of  parti- 
tion, India  also  received  about  two-thirds  of  the  materiel  and 
stores.  This  aspect  of  the  division  of  assets  was  complicated  by 
the  fact  that  all  sixteen  ordnance  factories  were  located  in 
India.  India  was  allowed  to  retain  them  with  the  proviso  that  it 


569 


India:  A  Country  Study 

would  make  a  lump  sum  payment  to  Pakistan  to  enable  it  to 
develop  its  own  defense  production  infrastructure. 

Independence  also  resulted  in  a  dramatic  reduction  of  the 
number  of  experienced  senior  personnel  available.  In  1947 
only  six  Indians  had  held  brigade-level  commands,  and  only 
one  had  commanded  a  division.  British  officers,  out  of  neces- 
sity, were  retained  for  varying  periods  of  time  after  indepen- 
dence. British  chiefs  stayed  on  the  longest  in  the  navy  and  the 
air  force.  The  navy  had  a  British  service  chief  until  1962  and 
the  air  force  until  1954.  The  armed  forces  also  integrated  qual- 
ified members  of  the  armies  of  the  former  princely  states  that 
acceded  to  India  (see  National  Integration,  ch.  1).  The  term 
sepoy,  made  popular  during  the  colonial  era,  was  dropped 
about  this  time,  and  the  word  jaw an  (Hindi  for  able-bodied 
man)  has  been  used  ever  since  when  referring  to  the  Indian 
soldier. 

The  Experience  of  Wars 
Pakistan 

The  first  test  for  the  Indian  armed  forces  came  shortly  after 
independence  with  the  first  In  do-Pakistani  conflict  (1947-48). 
The  military  was  called  upon  to  defend  the  borders  of  the  state 
of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  when  tribals — principally  Pathans — 
attacked  from  the  northwest  reaches  of  Kashmir  on  October 
22,  1947.  India's  161st  Infantry  Brigade  was  deployed  and 
thwarted  the  advance  of  the  tribal  forces.  In  early  November 
1947,  the  161st  counterattacked  and  successfully  broke 
through  the  enemy  defenses.  Despite  early  successes,  the 
Indian  army  suffered  a  setback  in  December  because  of  logisti- 
cal problems.  The  problems  enabled  the  forces  of  Azad  Kash- 
mir (Free  Kashmir,  as  the  part  of  Kashmir  under  Pakistani 
control  is  called)  to  take  the  initiative  and  force  the  Indian 
troops  to  retreat  from  the  border  areas.  In  the  spring  of  1948, 
the  Indian  side  mounted  another  offensive  to  retake  some  of 
the  ground  that  it  had  lost.  No  doubt  fearing  that  the  war 
might  move  into  Pakistan  proper,  regular  units  of  the  Pakistani 
army  became  more  actively  involved.  As  the  conflict  escalated, 
the  Indian  leadership  was  quick  to  recognize  that  the  war  could 
not  be  brought  to  a  close  unless  Pakistani  support  for  the  Azad 
Kashmir  forces  could  be  stopped.  Accordingly,  on  the  advice  of 
Governor  General  Earl  Louis  Mountbatten  (Britain's  last  vice- 
roy in  India  in  1947  and  governor  general  of  India,  1947-48), 


570 


National  Security 


the  Indian  government  sought  United  Nations  (UN)  media- 
tion of  the  conflict  on  December  31,  1947.  There  was  some 
opposition  to  this  move  within  the  cabinet  by  those  who  did 
not  agree  with  referring  the  Kashmir  dispute  to  the  UN.  The 
UN  mediation  process  brought  the  war  to  a  close  on  January  1, 
1949.  In  all,  1,500  soldiers  died  on  each  side  during  the  war. 

The  second  Indo-Pakistani  conflict  (1965)  was  also  fought 
over  Kashmir  and  started  without  a  formal  declaration  of  war. 
It  is  widely  accepted  that  the  war  began  with  the  infiltration  of 
Pakistani-controlled  guerrillas  into  Indian  Kashmir  on  about 
August  5,  1965.  Skirmishes  with  Indian  forces  started  as  early  as 
August  6  or  7,  and  the  first  major  engagement  between  the  reg- 
ular armed  forces  of  the  two  sides  took  place  on  August  14. 
The  next  day,  Indian  forces  scored  a  major  victory  after  a  pro- 
longed artillery  barrage  and  captured  three  important  moun- 
tain positions  in  the  northern  sector.  Later  in  the  month,  the 
Pakistanis  counterattacked,  moving  concentrations  near  Tith- 
wal,  Uri,  and  Punch.  Their  move,  in  turn,  provoked  a  powerful 
Indian  thrust  into  Azad  Kashmir.  Other  Indian  forces  captured 
a  number  of  strategic  mountain  positions  and  eventually  took 
the  key  Haji  Pir  Pass,  eight  kilometers  inside  Pakistani  territory. 

The  Indian  gains  led  to  a  major  Pakistani  counterattack  on 
September  1  in  the  southern  sector,  in  Punjab,  where  Indian 
forces  were  caught  unprepared  and  suffered  heavy  losses.  The 
sheer  strength  of  the  Pakistani  thrust,  which  was  spearheaded 
by  seventy  tanks  and  two  infantry  brigades,  led  Indian  com- 
manders to  call  in  air  support.  Pakistan  retaliated  on  Septem- 
ber 2  with  its  own  air  strikes  in  both  Kashmir  and  Punjab.  The 
war  was  at  the  point  of  stalemate  when  the  UN  Security  Council 
unanimously  passed  a  resolution  on  September  20  that  called 
for  a  cease-fire.  New  Delhi  accepted  the  cease-fire  resolution 
on  September  21  and  Islamabad  on  September  22,  and  the  war 
ended  on  September  23.  The  Indian  side  lost  3,000  while  the 
Pakistani  side  suffered  3,800  battlefield  deaths.  The  Soviet-bro- 
kered Tashkent  Declaration  was  signed  on  January  10,  1966.  It 
required  that  both  sides  withdraw  by  February  26,  1966,  to 
positions  held  prior  to  August  5,  1965,  and  observe  the  cease- 
fire line  agreed  to  on  June  30,  1965. 

The  origins  of  the  third  Indo-Pakistani  conflict  (1971)  were 
different  from  the  previous  conflicts.  The  Pakistani  failure  to 
accommodate  demands  for  autonomy  in  East  Pakistan  in  1970 
led  to  secessionist  demands  in  1971  (see  The  Rise  of  Indira 
Gandhi,  ch.  1).  In  March  1971,  Pakistan's  armed  forces 


571 


India:  A  Country  Study 

launched  a  fierce  campaign  to  suppress  the  resistance  move- 
ment that  had  emerged  but  encountered  unexpected  mass 
defections  among  East  Pakistani  soldiers  and  police.  The  Paki- 
stani forces  regrouped  and  reasserted  their  authority  over  most 
of  East  Pakistan  by  May. 

As  a  result  of  these  military  actions,  thousands  of  East  Paki- 
stanis died  at  the  hands  of  the  Pakistani  army.  Resistance  fight- 
ers and  nearly  10  million  refugees  fled  to  sanctuary  in  West 
Bengal,  the  adjacent  Indian  state.  By  midsummer,  the  Indian 
leadership,  in  the  absence  of  a  political  solution  to  the  East 
Pakistan  crisis,  had  fashioned  a  strategy  designed  to  assist  the 
establishment  of  the  independent  nation  of  Bangladesh.  As 
part  of  this  strategy,  in  August  1971,  India  signed  a  twenty-year 
Treaty  of  Peace,  Friendship,  and  Cooperation  with  the  Soviet 
Union.  One  of  the  treaty's  clauses  implied  that  each  nation  was 
expected  to  come  to  the  assistance  of  the  other  in  the  event  of 
a  threat  to  national  security  such  as  that  occurring  in  the  1965 
war  with  Pakistan.  Simultaneously,  India  organized,  trained, 
and  provided  sanctuary  to  the  Mukti  Bahini  (meaning  Libera- 
tion Force  in  Bengali),  the  East  Pakistani  armed  resistance 
fighters. 

Unable  to  deter  India's  activities  in  the  eastern  sector,  on 
December  3,  1971,  Pakistan  launched  an  air  attack  in  the  west- 
ern sector  on  a  number  of  Indian  airfields,  including  Ambala 
in  Haryana,  Amritsar  in  Punjab,  and  Udhampur  in  Jammu  and 
Kashmir.  The  attacks  did  not  succeed  in  inflicting  substantial 
damage.  The  Indian  air  force  retaliated  the  next  day  and 
quickly  achieved  air  superiority.  On  the  ground,  the  strategy  in 
the  eastern  sector  marked  a  significant  departure  from  previ- 
ous Indian  battle  plans  and  tactics,  which  had  emphasized  set- 
piece  battles  and  slow  advances.  The  strategy  adopted  was  a 
swift,  three-pronged  assault  of  nine  infantry  divisions  with 
attached  armored  units  and  close  air  support  that  rapidly  con- 
verged on  Dhaka,  the  capital  of  East  Pakistan.  Lieutenant 
General  Sagat  Singh,  who  commanded  the  eighth,  twenty- 
third,  and  fifty-seventh  divisions,  led  the  Indian  thrust  into  East 
Pakistan.  As  these  forces  attacked  Pakistani  formations,  the 
Indian  air  force  rapidly  destroyed  the  small  air  contingent  in 
East  Pakistan  and  put  the  Dhaka  airfield  out  of  commission.  In 
the  meantime,  the  Indian  navy  effectively  blockaded  East  Paki- 
stan. Dhaka  fell  to  combined  Indian  and  Mukti  Bahini  forces 
on  December  16,  bringing  a  quick  end  to  the  war.

Action  in  the  western  sector  was  divided  into  four  segments, 
from  the  cease-fire  line  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  to  the  marshes 
of  the  Rann  of  Kutch  in  northwestern  Gujarat.  On  the  evening 
of  December  3,  the  Pakistani  army  launched  ground  opera- 
tions in  Kashmir  and  Punjab.  It  also  started  an  armored  opera- 
tion  in  Rajasthan.  In  Kashmir,  the  operations  were 
concentrated  on  two  key  points,  Punch  and  Chhamb.  The 
Chhamb  area  witnessed  a  particularly  intense  battle  where  the 
Pakistanis  forced  the  Indians  to  withdraw  from  their  positions. 
In  other  parts  of  Kashmir,  the  Indians  made  some  small  gains 
along  the  cease-fire  line.  The  major  Indian  counteroffensive 
came  in  the  Sialkot-Shakargarh  area  south  and  west  of 
Chhamb.  There,  two  Pakistani  tank  regiments,  equipped  with 
United  States-made  Patton  tanks,  confronted  the  Indian  First 
Armored  Corps,  which  had  British  Centurion  tanks.  In  what 
proved  to  be  the  largest  tank  battle  of  the  war,  both  sides  suf- 
fered considerable  casualties. 

Though  the  Indian  conduct  of  the  land  war  on  the  western 
front  was  somewhat  timid,  the  role  of  the  Indian  air  force  was 
both  extensive  and  daring.  During  the  fourteen-day  war,  the  air 
force's  Western  Command  conducted  some  4,000  sorties. 
There  was  little  retaliation  by  Pakistan's  air  force,  partly 
because  of  the  paucity  of  non-Bengali  technical  personnel. 


573 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Additionally,  this  lack  of  retaliation  reflected  the  deliberate 
decision  of  the  Pakistan  Air  Force  headquarters  to  conserve  its 
forces  because  of  heavy  losses  incurred  in  the  early  days  of  the 
war. 

China 

The  Chinese  have  two  major  claims  on  what  India  deems  its 
own  territory.  One  claim,  in  the  western  sector,  is  on  Aksai 
Chin  in  the  northeastern  section  of  Ladakh  District  injammu 
and  Kashmir.  The  other  claim  is  in  the  eastern  sector  over  a 
region  included  in  the  British-designated  North-East  Frontier 
Agency,  the  disputed  part  of  which  India  renamed  Arunachal 
Pradesh  and  made  a  state.  In  the  fight  over  these  areas,  the 
well-trained  and  well-armed  troops  of  the  Chinese  People's  Lib- 
eration Army  overpowered  the  ill-equipped  Indian  troops,  who 
had  not  been  properly  acclimatized  to  fighting  at  high  alti- 
tudes. 

Unable  to  reach  political  accommodation  on  disputed  terri- 
tory along  the  3,225-kilometer-long  Himalayan  border,  the  Chi- 
nese attacked  India  on  October  20,  1962.  At  the  time,  nine 
divisions  from  the  eastern  and  western  commands  were 
deployed  along  the  Himalayan  border  with  China.  None  of 
these  divisions  was  up  to  its  full  troop  strength,  and  all  were 
short  of  artillery,  tanks,  equipment,  and  even  adequate  articles 
of  clothing. 

In  Ladakh  the  Chinese  attacked  south  of  the  Karakoram  Pass 
at  the  northwest  end  of  the  Aksai  Chin  Plateau  and  in  the 
Pangong  Lake  area  about  160  kilometers  to  the  southeast.  The 
defending  Indian  forces  were  easily  ejected  from  their  posts  in 
the  area  of  the  Karakoram  Pass  and  from  most  posts  near 
Pangong  Lake.  However,  they  put  up  spirited  resistance  at  the 
key  posts  of  Daulat  Beg  Oldi  (near  the  entrance  to  the  pass) 
and  Chushul  (located  immediately  south  of  Pangong  Lake  and 
at  the  head  of  the  vital  supply  road  to  Leh,  a  major  town  and 
location  of  an  air  force  base  in  Ladakh).  Other  Chinese  forces 
attacked  near  Demchok  (about  160  kilometers  southeast  of 
Chusul)  and  rapidly  overran  the  Demchok  and  the  Jara  La 
posts. 

In  the  eastern  sector,  in  Assam,  the  Chinese  forces  advanced 
easily  despite  Indian  efforts  at  resistance.  On  the  first  day  of  the 
fighting,  Indian  forces  stationed  at  the  Tsang  Le  post  on  the 
northern  side  of  the  Namka  Chu,  the  Khinzemane  post,  and 
near  Dhola  were  overrun.  On  the  western  side  of  the  North- 


574 


National  Security 


East  Frontier  Agency,  Tsang  Dar  fell  on  October  22,  Bum  La  on 
October  23,  and  Tawang,  the  headquarters  of  the  Seventh 
Infantry  Brigade,  on  October  24.  The  Chinese  made  an  offer 
to  negotiate  on  October  24.  The  Indian  government  promptly 
rejected  this  offer. 

With  a  lull  in  the  fighting,  the  Indian  military  desperately 
sought  to  regroup  its  forces.  Specifically,  the  army  attempted  to 
strengthen  its  defensive  positions  in  the  North-East  Frontier 
Agency  and  Ladakh  and  to  prepare  against  possible  Chinese 
attacks  through  Sikkim  and  Bhutan.  Army  units  were  moved 
from  Calcutta,  Bihar,  Nagaland,  and  Punjab  to  guard  the 
northern  frontiers  of  West  Bengal  and  Assam.  Three  brigades 
were  hastily  positioned  in  the  western  part  of  the  North-East 
Frontier  Agency,  and  two  other  brigades  were  moved  into  Sik- 
kim and  near  the  West  Bengal  border  with  Bhutan  to  face  the 
Chinese.  Light  Stuart  tanks  were  drawn  from  the  Eastern  Com- 
mand headquarters  at  Calcutta  to  bolster  these  deployments. 

In  the  western  sector,  a  divisional  organization  was  estab- 
lished in  Leh;  several  battalions  of  infantry,  a  battery  of  twenty- 
five-pounder  guns,  and  two  troops  of  AMX  light  tanks  were  air- 
lifted into  the  Chushul  area  from  Punjab.  On  November  4,  the 
Indian  military  decided  that  the  post  at  Daulat  Beg  Oldi  was 
untenable,  and  its  defenders  were  withdrawn  over  the  5,300- 
meter-high  Sasar  Brangsa  Pass  to  a  more  defensible  position. 

The  reinforcements  and  redeployments  in  Ladakh  proved 
sufficient  to  defend  the  Chushul  perimeter  despite  repeated 
Chinese  attacks.  However,  the  more  remote  posts  at  Rezang  La 
and  Gurung  Hill  and  the  four  posts  at  Spanggur  Lake  area  fell 
to  the  Chinese. 

In  the  North-East  Frontier  Agency,  the  situation  proved  to  be 
quite  different.  Indian  forces  counterattacked  on  November  13 
and  captured  a  hill  northwest  of  the  town  of  Walong.  Con- 
certed Chinese  attacks  dislodged  them  from  this  hard-won 
position,  and  the  nearby  garrison  had  to  retreat  down  the 
Lohit  Valley. 

In  another  important  section  of  the  eastern  sector,  the 
Kameng  Frontier  Division,  six  Chinese  brigades  attacked  across 
the  Tawang  Chu  near  Jang  and  advanced  some  sixteen  kilome- 
ters to  the  southeast  to  attack  Indian  positions  at  Nurang,  near 
Se  La,  on  November  17.  Despite  the  Indian  attempt  to  regroup 
their  forces  at  Se  La,  the  Chinese  continued  their  onslaught, 
wiping  out  virtually  all  Indian  resistance  in  Kameng.  By  Novem- 
ber 18,  the  Chinese  had  penetrated  close  to  the  outskirts  of 


575 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Tezpur,  Assam,  a  major  frontier  town  nearly  fifty  kilometers 
from  the  Assam-North-East  Frontier  Agency  border. 

The  Chinese  did  not  advance  farther  and  on  November  21 
declared  a  unilateral  cease-fire.  They  had  accomplished  all  of 
their  territorial  objectives,  and  any  attempt  to  press  farther  into 
the  plains  of  Assam  would  have  stretched  their  logistical  capa- 
bilities and  their  lines  of  communication  to  a  breaking  point. 
By  the  time  the  fighting  stopped,  each  side  had  lost  500  troops. 

The  fighting  war  was  over,  but  a  new  diplomatic  war  had 
begun.  After  more  than  thirty  years  of  border  tension  and  stale- 
mate, high-level  bilateral  talks  were  held  in  New  Delhi  starting 
in  February  1994  to  foster  "confidence-building  measures" 
between  the  defense  forces  of  India  and  China,  and  a  new 
period  of  better  relations  began  (see  China,  ch.  9). 

Peacekeeping  Operations 

In  addition  to  the  experience  gained  in  wars  with  Pakistan 
and  China,  the  Indian  army  has  been  involved  in  two  regional 
peacekeeping  operations.  The  first  was  in  Sri  Lanka  from  1987 
to  1990,  the  second  in  Maldives  in  1988.  In  addition,  Indian 
forces  have  participated  in  ten  UN  peacekeeping  forces. 

Sri  Lanka 

Since  the  early  1970s,  ethnic  conflict  has  pitted  Sri  Lanka's 
Tamil  minority  against  the  Sinhalese  majority  over  issues  of 
power  sharing  and  local  autonomy.  The  main  combatants  are 
the  Sri  Lankan  army  and  the  secessionist  Liberation  Tigers  of 
Tamil  Eelam.  Indian  involvement,  encouraged  by  pro-Tamil 
sentiments  in  its  state  of  Tamil  Nadu,  which  is  close  to  Sri 
Lanka,  and  the  Indian  government's  covert  aid  to  and  training 
of  Tamil  militants  between  1977  and  1987,  drew  India  into  the 
conflict.  The  Indo-Sri  Lankan  Accord,  signed  on  July  29,  1987, 
committed  New  Delhi  to  deploying  a  peacekeeping  force  on 
the  island,  making  the  Indian  government  the  principal  guar- 
antor of  a  solution  to  the  ethnic  violence  that  had  heightened 
dramatically  since  1983.  Nearly  60,000  Indian  troops  drawn 
from  two  divisions  (one  from  the  Central  Command  and  the 
other  from  the  Southern  Command)  were  in  Sri  Lanka  as  the 
Indian  Peace  Keeping  Force  (IPKF)  between  1987  and  1990. 

Originally  sent  to  Sri  Lanka  as  a  neutral  body  with  a  mission 
to  ensure  compliance  with  the  accord,  the  IPKF  increasingly 
became  a  partisan  force  fighting  against  Tamils.  The  popularity 
of  Indian  forces,  which  was  never  high,  decreased  still  further 


576 


National  Security 


amidst  charges  of  rape  and  murder  of  civilians.  Despite  the 
considerable  experience  that  Indian  troops  had  gained  in 
fighting  insurgencies  in  India's  northeast,  the  IPKF  was  at  a 
marked  disadvantage  in  Sri  Lanka.  In  fighting  Naga  and  Mizo 
guerrillas  in  northeast  India,  the  army  had  fought  on  home 
ground,  and  the  central  government  could  couple  the  army's 
efforts  with  direct  political  negotiations.  In  Sri  Lanka,  the 
Indian  forces  did  not  possess  an  adequate  local  intelligence 
network.  Despite  the  growth  of  the  IPKF  to  70,000  strong,  the 
predominantly  urban  context  of  northern  Sri  Lanka  imposed 
constraints  on  the  use  of  force.  It  also  is  widely  believed  that  Sri 
Lankan  forces  offered  only  grudging  cooperation.  Given  the 
inability  of  the  IPKF  to  prevent  either  Sinhalese  or  Tamil 
extremist  actions,  it  steadily  lost  the  support  of  both  sides  in 
the  conflict. 

As  the  Sri  Lankan  presidential  elections  approached  in 
December  1988,  both  the  contending  parties,  the  ruling 
United  National  Party  led  by  then  Prime  Minister  Ranasinghe 
Premadasa,  and  the  three-party  United  Front  led  by  former 
Prime  Minister  Sirimavo  Ratwatte  Dias  Bandaranaike, 
expressed  their  reservations  about  the  1987  accord.  Premadasa 
was  elected,  and  after  he  was  inaugurated,  he  declared  an  end 
to  the  five-and-a-half-year  state  of  emergency  and  asked  India 
to  withdraw  the  IPKF.  In  July  1989,  the  IPKF  started  a  phased 
withdrawal  of  its  remaining  45,000  troops,  a  process  that  took 
until  March  1990  to  complete. 

During  the  three-year  involvement,  some  1,500  Indian 
troops  were  killed  and  more  than  4,500  were  wounded  during 
this  operation.  Another  casualty  resulting  from  the  Sri  Lanka 
mission  was  the  assassination  of  former  Prime  Minister  Rajiv 
Gandhi  by  a  Tamil  militant  in  1991.  As  a  participant  in  what 
began  as  a  peacekeeping  mission,  the  Indian  armed  forces 
learned  some  valuable  lessons.  These  included  the  realization 
that  better  coordination  is  needed  between  military  and  politi- 
cal decision  makers  for  such  missions.  One  of  the  commanders 
of  the  IPKF  also  noted  that  training,  equipment,  and  command 
and  control  needed  improvement. 

In  1995,  at  the  request  of  the  Sri  Lankan  government, 
Indian  naval  ships  and  air  force  surveillance  aircraft  estab- 
lished a  quarantine  zone  around  the  LTTE  stronghold  in  the 
Jaffna  area.  The  supply  of  military  materiel  by  Indian  sympa- 
thizers to  the  Tamil  insurgents  in  Sri  Lanka  from  Tamil  Nadu, 


577 


India:  A  Country  Study 


just  thirty-five  kilometers  across  the  Palk  Strait,  was  an  ongoing 
problem  that  continued  to  keep  India  involved  in  the  conflict. 

Maldives 

In  1988,  the  Indian  Army  experienced  a  small  success  in 
squashing  an  attempted  coup  in  Maldives,  600  kilometers 
south  of  India  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  Maldivian  minister  of  for- 
eign affairs  Fathullah  Jameel  had  called  Rajiv  Gandhi  (India's 
prime  minister  from  1984  to  1989)  at  5:30  a.m.  on  November 
3,  1988  to  request  India's  assistance.  By  9:00  a.m.  the  same 
morning,  India's  Cabinet  Committee  on  Political  Affairs  had 
been  convened.  At  noon  the  same  day,  the  committee  gave  its 
approval  for  military  support  to  the  regime  of  President  Mau- 
moon  Abdul  Gayoom.  Later  in  the  day,  the  first  Indian  troops 
were  airlifted  from  a  military  base  at  Agra,  Uttar  Pradesh.  Some 
1,600  Indian  troops  were  dispatched  within  hours.  During  the 
next  three  days,  the  mercenaries  involved  in  the  attempted 
coup  were  rounded  up  by  Indian  troops  who  had  parachuted 
in.  The  Indian  navy  also  effectively  blocked  maritime  escape 
routes  the  coup  leaders  might  have  taken.  The  operation  was 
completed  by  November  6. 

Three  important  inferences  can  be  made  from  this  success- 
ful attempt  at  force  projection.  First,  it  demonstrated  that  suffi- 
cient interservice  cooperation  existed  to  allow  the  armed 
forces  to  respond  rapidly  to  political  directives.  Second,  it 
showed  the  capability  of  the  armed  forces  to  airlift  troops 
regionally  at  short  notice.  And  third,  it  demonstrated  the  will- 
ingness of  the  Indian  political  leadership  to  use  its  military 
strength  in  the  region  to  support  a  friendly  regime. 

United  Nations  Peacekeeping  Forces 

Indian  armed  forces  personnel  have  been  involved  in  a  vari- 
ety of  UN-sponsored  peacekeeping  missions  and  military 
observer  operations,  giving  them  invaluable  experience  in 
interacting  with  the  armed  forces  of  other  nations.  In  addition, 
although  it  was  not  a  peacekeeping  force  per  se,  an  Indian  air- 
borne field  ambulance  unit  participated  in  the  Korean  War 
(1950-53). 

Indian  infantry,  supply,  transportation,  and  signal  units 
served  between  1956  and  1967  with  the  First  United  Nations 
Emergency  Force  in  the  Suez  Canal,  Sinai  Peninsula,  and  Gaza. 
From  1960  to  1964,  Indian  infantry,  aircraft,  and  medical  per- 
sonnel, and  air  dispatch,  signal,  supply,  and  postal  units  served 


578 


National  Security 


in  the  Congo  (as  Zaire  was  then  named).  Indian  military 
observers  participated  in  UN  observation  groups  in  Lebanon 
in  1958;  Yemen  in  1963-64  (where  India  supplied  one  of  the 
chiefs  of  staff);  West  Irian  (which  later  became  Indonesia's 
Irian  Barat  Province)  in  1962-63;  the  Iran-Iraq  border  in  1988- 
91;  Angola  in  1989-91;  and  Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala, 
Honduras,  and  Nicaragua  in  1989-92.  Military  observers, 
police  monitors,  and  election  supervisors  were  sent  to  Namibia 
in  1989  and  1990  to  help  oversee  elections. 

In  the  1990s,  more  military  observers  were  sent  abroad. 
There  was  a  second  observers'  mission  to  Angola  (1991-92)  as 
well  as  missions  to  El  Salvador  (starting  in  1991),  former  Yugo- 
slavia (starting  in  1992),  and  Mozambique  (starting  in  1992). 
The  last  was  a  force  of  more  than  900  administrative,  engineer- 
ing, and  logistic  personnel.  A  sappers'  contingent  charged  with 
clearing  landmines  and  related  construction  projects  partici- 
pated in  the  United  Nations  Transitional  Authority  in  Cambo- 
dia in  1992-93.  An  infantry  brigade — including  army 
physicians,  nurses,  veterinarians,  a  tank  sqaudron,  a  mecha- 
nized battalion,  a  120-millimeter  mortar  battery,  an  engineer 
company,  and  two  flights  of  helicopters — and  an  air  force  heli- 
copter detachment,  a  force  totalling  nearly  5,000  personnel, 
were  sent  to  Somalia  in  1993-94  to  participate  in  peacekeeping 
and  humanitarian  relief  efforts. 

In  an  effort  to  achieve  some  joint  operational  understanding 
with  other  nations'  forces,  India  has  also  cooperated  in  various 
peacetime  joint  exercises  with  Indian  Ocean  nations  and  with 
the  United  States.  In  1992,  India  and  the  United  States  con- 
ducted joint  naval  exercises  in  the  Arabian  Sea  near  Kochi 
(Cochin),  and  in  1994  Indian  marine  commandos  and  United 
States  Marines  conducted  joint  exercises  with  little  fanfare. 

National  Security  Structure 

Civil-Military  Relations 

The  pattern  of  civil-military  relations  prevailing  in  India  was 
created  by  the  staff  of  Lord  Mountbatten  as  a  three-tier  system 
extending  from  the  prime  minister  to  the  three  service  chiefs. 
At  the  apex  of  this  structure  is  the  Political  Affairs  Committee 
of  the  Cabinet.  The  second  level  is  the  Defence  Minister's  Com- 
mittee of  the  Cabinet,  and  the  third  level  is  the  Chiefs  of  Staff 
Committee.  Other  committees,  such  as  the  Joint  Intelligence 
Committee,  the  Defence  Science  Advisory  Committee,  and  the 


579 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Joint  Planning  Committee,  assist  the  higher  committees.  There 
were  proposals  in  the  mid-1990s  to  establish  a  joint  defense 
staff  for  better  integration  of  interservice  resources,  programs, 
policies,  and  operations  (see  fig.  16). 

In  the  immediate  postindependence  period,  the  Defence 
Minister's  Committee  of  the  Cabinet  did  not  play  an  active  role 
in  policy  formulation.  The  higher  organization  of  defense  was 
vested  largely  with  the  minister  of  defence.  From  1957  to  1962, 
this  position  was  held  by  V.K.  Krishna  Menon,  whose  authority 
far  exceeded  that  usually  accorded  a  minister  of  defence.  A 
confidante  of  Nehru's  through  much  of  the  late  preindepen- 
dence  period,  Menon  functioned  as  Nehru's  alter  ego  for 
national  security  and  defense  planning.  Consequently,  the 
locus  of  decision  making  shifted  from  the  cabinet  to  the 
Defence  Minister's  Committee.  Menon  was  in  many  ways 
responsible  for  laying  the  foundations  of  India's  military-indus- 
trial base. 

Among  other  endeavors,  Menon  was  responsible  for  the 
development  of  ordnance  facilities  to  manufacture  the 
Ichapore  semiautomatic  rifle;  a  tank  manufacturing  complex 
at  Avadi.  Tamil  Nadu:  facilities  to  build  frigates  at  the  Mazagon 
Dock  naval  shipyard  in  Bombay;  and  the  licensed  manufacture 
of  Soviet-designed  MiG— 23  fighter  aircraft  in  Nasik.  Maharash- 
tra.  However,  his  highly  idiosyncratic  manners,  his  high- 
handed ways,  and  his  involvement  in  the  tactical  aspects  of  mil- 
itary decision  making  had  negative  consequences.  For  exam- 
ple, he  quarrelled  with  the  professional  military,  particularly 
India's  third  chief  of  armv  staff,  General  K.S.  Thimayya,  over 
Thimayya's  attempt  to  warn  Menon  and  Nehru  about  the 
emerging  Chinese  threat  as  early  as  1959.  When  Thimayya 
resigned  in  protest,  Nehru  prevailed  upon  him  to  withdraw  his 
resignation.  Unfortunately,  when  questioned  in  the  Lok  Sabha 
(House  of  the  People)  ,  the  lower  house  of  the  Parliament, 
about  Thimawa's  resignation,  Nehru  offered  a  rather  weak 
defense  of  the  general's  actions  and  sought  to  deflect  the  criti- 
cisms of  his  minister  of  defence  (see  The  Legislature,  ch.  8). 
When  Thimayya  retired  as  chief  of  army  staff  in  May  1961, 
Menon  passed  over  Thimawa's  designated  successor,  Lieuten- 
ant General  S.P.P.  Thorat,  and  instead  appointed  a  junior  offi- 
cer, Lieutenant  General  P.N.  Thapar.  The  appointment  not 
only  created  a  rift  between  the  professional  military  and  politi- 
cal leadership  but  also  alienated  a  number  of  high-ranking  offi- 
cials  in  the  Ministry  of  Defence.  Menon's  actions  also 


580 


National  Security 


demoralized  competent  personnel  in  the  Chilian  and  military 
bureaucracies,  which  led  to  important  gaps  in  defense  pre- 
paredness and  planning.  Menon's  dominance  of  the  defense 
planning  process  significantly  contributed  to  the  military  deba- 
cle of  1962. 

The  Indian  defeat  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  new  Emer- 
gency Committee  of  the  Cabinet.  This  committee  introduced  a 
system  of  "morning  meetings"  with  the  minister  of  defence  and 
the  three  service  chiefs.  The  morning  meetings,  which  are  con- 
ducted without  a  predetermined  agenda,  deal  with  current 
defense  issues  on  a  regular  basis.  The  meetings  are  also 
attended  by  the  cabinet  secretary,  the  defence  secretary,  and 
the  scientific  adviser  to  the  minister  of  defence.  These  morning 
meetings  continue  to  take  place. 

In  the  Chiefs  of  Staff  Committee,  formal  equality  prevails 
among  the  three  service  chiefs  despite  the  fact  that  the  army 
remains  the  largest  of  the  three  branches  of  the  armed  ser- 
vices. This  formal  equality  among  the  three  services  came 
about  with  independence. 

To  facilitate  defense  planning,  the  government  established 
two  organizations:  the  Defence  Coordination  and  Implementa- 
tion Committee  and  the  Defence  Planning  Staff.  The  Defense 
Coordination  and  Implementation  Committee  is  chaired  by 
the  defence  secretary  and  meets  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  Its  mem- 
bership includes  the  three  service  chiefs,  representatives  from 
civilian  and  military  intelligence  organizations,  and  the  secre- 
tary of  defence  production.  The  Defence  Planning  Staff,  a  per- 
manent body,  was  established  in  1986.  Composed  of  officers 
drawn  from  all  three  services,  it  is  responsible  for  developing 
overall  national  security  strategy.  It  is  also  charged  with  briefing 
the  Chiefs  of  Staff  Committee  on  long-term  threats  to  national 
security. 

Defense  Spending 

Until  1962  defense  spending  was  deliberately  limited.  In  the 
wake  of  the  war  with  China,  defense  spending  rose  from  2.1 
percent  of  the  gross  national  product  (GXP — see  Glossary)  in 
fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1962  to  4.5  percent  in  FY  1964.  In 
FY  1994,  defense  spending  was  slightly  less  than  5  percent  of 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary).  In  terms  of  dol- 
lars, FY  1994  total  defense  services  expenditures  were  projected 
at  USS7.2  billion  (but  are  likely  to  have  been  close  to  USS7.8 
billion).  Proportionately,  based  on  figures  provided  by  the  gov-

eminent,  48.4  percent  of  expenditures  were  for  the  army,  15.7 
percent  for  the  air  force,  5.9  percent  for  the  navy,  and  30  per- 
cent for  capital  outlays  for  defense  services  and  defense  ord- 
nance factories.  The  latter  provide  materiel  to  the  armed 
forces  through  some  thirty-nine  ordnance  factories  and  eight 
public-sector  enterprises  that  build  ships,  aircraft,  and  major 
defense  items.  The  defense  budget  for  FY  1994  was  6.5  percent 
higher  than  the  revised  estimate  for  FY  1993.  The  allocation 
increased  to  14.9  percent  of  the  total  central  government  bud- 
get, up  from  13  percent  in  the  previous  two  fiscal  years. 
Nuclear  energy  and  space  research  are  not  fully  accounted  for 
in  the  defense  budget,  but  most  paramilitary  forces  fall  within 
the  purview  of  the  Ministry  of  Defence. 

Organization  and  Equipment  of  the  Armed  Forces 
The  Army 

In  1994  the  army  had  approximately  940,000  men  and 
women  in  its  ranks  and  more  than  36,000  in  reserve  forces. 
The  army  is  headquartered  in  New  Delhi  and  is  under  the 
direction  of  the  chief  of  the  army  staff,  always  a  full  general. 
The  chief  of  the  army  staff  is  assisted  by  a  vice  chief,  two  deputy 
chiefs,  a  military  secretary,  and  the  heads  of  four  main  staff 
divisions:  the  adjutant  general,  the  quartermaster  general,  the 
master  general  of  ordnance,  and  the  engineer  in  chief. 

The  army  has  five  tactical  area  commands:  the  Northern 
Command  headquartered  at  Udhampur  in  Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir, the  Western  Command  headquartered  at  Chandimandir 
in  Chandigarh,  the  Central  Command  headquartered  at  Luck- 
now  in  Uttar  Pradesh,  the  Eastern  Command  headquartered  at 
Calcutta,  and  the  Southern  Command  headquartered  at  Pune 
in  Maharashtra  (see  fig.  17).  Each  command  is  headed  by  a 
lieutenant  general.  The  principal  combat  formations  within 
the  scope  of  these  commands  are  armored  divisions  and  inde- 
pendent armored  brigades,  infantry  divisions,  mountain  infan- 
try divisions,  independent  infantry  brigades,  airborne/ 
commando  brigades,  and  independent  artillery  brigades  (see 
table  34,  Appendix).  These  units  are  organized  in  twelve  corps- 
level  formations. 

The  army  is  equipped  with  some  3,400  main  battle  tanks.  Of 
these,  1,200  are  indigenously  manufactured  Vijayanta  tanks. 
Additionally,  the  army  has  some  T-55,  T-72,  and  PT-76  tanks. 
The  Arjun  main  battle  tank  has  been  under  development  by

the  Defence  Research  and  Development  Organisation 
(DRDO)  since  1983,  and,  in  1995,  limited  production  was 
expected  to  begin  in  1996. 

To  complement  indigenous  production,  however,  it  was 
reported  in  1994  that  Russia  had  agreed  to  help  India  modern- 
ize its  T-72  tanks  and  to  sell  and  lease  other  types  of  weapons. 
It  is  generally  understood  that  about  70  percent  of  India's  mili- 
tary equipment  is  of  Soviet  origin.  Some  army  officials  con- 
tinue to  favor  Russian-made  equipment,  such  as  the  T-72  tank, 
over  Indian  adaptations  of  the  same  items,  such  as  the  T-72  MI 
tank  developed  by  the  DRDO. 

The  army  also  has  substantial  artillery  forces.  The  best  esti- 
mate places  the  army's  towed  artillery  capabilities  at  more  than 
4,000  pieces.  In  addition  to  the  towed  artillery,  the  army  has 
self-propelled  artillery.  Finally,  it  has  substantial  numbers  of 
surface-to-air  missile  capabilities,  the  total  number  being  more 
than  1,200.  In  1986  air  observation  post  units  were  transferred 
from  the  air  force  to  the  army  to  form  the  Army  Aviation 
branch.  Using  nine  helicopter  squadrons,  Army  Aviation  has 
supported  ground  units  in  the  Siachen  Glacier  in  Jammu  and 
Kashmir  and  in  Sri  Lanka,  as  well  as  counterinsurgency  opera- 
tions in  various  parts  of  the  country.  Army  Aviation  has  also 
participated  in  disaster  relief. 

Apart  from  its  nine  squadrons  of  helicopters,  the  army  has 
eight  air  observation  squadrons  and  six  antitank/ transport 
squadrons.  It  relies  on  the  air  force  for  air  support,  lift  capabili- 
ties, and  air  supply  (see  table  35,  Appendix). 

An  extensive  body  of  schools  and  centers  supports  army 
operations.  The  officer  corps  is  largely  drawn  from  the 
National  Defence  Academy  at  Khadakvasla,  Maharashtra,  a 
joint  services  training  institution  that  provides  educational 
equivalents  to  the  bachelor  of  arts  or  bachelor  of  science 
degrees  to  cadets  for  all  three  service  arms.  Cadets  spend  their 
first  three  years  at  the  National  Defence  Academy  and  then  are 
sent  to  their  respective  service  academies  for  further  training 
before  being  commissioned  in  the  armed  forces.  A  preparatory 
school,  the  Rashtriya  Indian  Military  College,  at  Dehra  Dun, 
Uttar  Pradesh,  provides  education  to  candidates  for  the 
National  Defence  Academy.  After  completing  their  studies  at 
the  National  Defence  Academy,  army  cadets  are  sent  to  the 
Indian  Military  Academy  at  Dehra  Dun.  Other  Indian  Military 
Academy  cadets  are  graduates  of  the  Army  Cadet  College  or 
are  direct-entry  students  who  have  qualified  by  passing  the

Union  Public  Service  Commission  Examination.  They  spend 
between  twelve  and  twenty-four  months  at  the  Indian  Military 
Academy  before  being  commissioned  in  the  army  as  second 
lieutenants.  Still  other  officer  training  occurs  at  the  Officers1 
Training  Academy  in  Madras,  Tamil  Nadu,  where  a  forty-four- 
week  session  is  offered  to  university  graduates  seeking  a  short- 
service  commission. 

In  addition  to  the  Indian  Military  Academy,  the  army  runs  a 
number  of  military  education  establishments.  The  more  prom- 
inent ones  include  the  College  of  Combat  at  Mhow,  Madhya 
Pradesh;  the  High  Altitude  Warfare  School  at  Gulmarg,  Jammu 
and  Kashmir;  and  the  Counter-Insurgency  and  Jungle  Warfare 
School  at  Vairengte,  Mizoram.  The  army  also  operates  the 
Defence  Services  Staff  College  at  Wellington  in  the  Nilgiri  Hills 
in  Tamil  Nadu,  which  provides  master  of  science-level  joint-ser- 
vice training  for  mid-level  staff  appointments  and  promotes 
interservice  cooperation. 

In  1994  it  was  reported  that  there  were  200  women  in  the 
armed  forces.  In  the  army,  which  employs  women  as  physicians 
and  nurses,  the  participation  of  women  is  small  but  growing. 
The  Indian  Military  Nursing  Service  was  formed  in  1926  and 
has  eight  nursing  schools  (five  army,  two  navy,  and  one  air 
force)  and  one  nursing  college  in  Pune.  Bachelor  of  science 
graduates  are  commissioned  as  lieutenants  in  the  Medical 
Nursing  Service  and  attached  to  the  various  components  of  the 
armed  forces.  Ranks  as  high  as  colonel  can  be  attained  by 
career  officers.  In  the  mid-1990s,  a  small  but  increasing  num- 
ber of  women  officers  were  being  assigned  to  nonmedical  ser- 
vices. In  1994,  there  were  fifty  women  nonmedical  army 
officers  and  another  twenty-five  in  training.  They  are  university 
graduates  who  have  been  put  through  rigorous  training  and 
are  reported  to  be  eager  for  combat  unit  assignments. 

The  Navy 

The  origins  of  the  modern  Indian  navy  are  traced  to  a  mari- 
time force  established  by  the  East  India  Company  in  the  seven- 
teenth century.  This  force  had  a  variety  of  names — the  Bombay 
Marine,  the  Indian  Navy,  and  the  Indian  Marine.  In  1934  the 
Royal  Indian  Navy  was  established,  with  Indians  serving  prima- 
rily in  lower-level  positions.  After  independence  the  navy  was 
the  most  neglected  of  the  three  services  because  the  national 
leadership  perceived  that  the  bulk  of  the  threats  to  India  were 
land-based.

India:  A  Country  Study 


The  first  efforts  at  naval  rearmament  emerged  in  the  1964— 
69  Defence  Plan,  which  called  for  the  replacement  of  India's 
aging  fleet  and  the  development  of  a  submarine  service. 
Between  1947  and  1964,  fiscal  constraints  had  prevented  the 
implementation  of  ambitious  plans  for  naval  expansion.  Conse- 
quently, many  of  the  vessels  were  obsolete  and  of  little  opera- 
tional value.  As  part  of  this  expansion  program,  the  British 
helped  develop  the  Mazagon  Dock  shipyard  for  the  local  pro- 
duction of  British  Leander-class  frigates.  The  Soviets,  however, 
were  willing  to  support  all  phases  of  the  planned  naval  expan- 
sion. Accordingly,  they  supplied  naval  vessels,  support  systems, 
and  training  on  extremely  favorable  terms.  By  the  mid-1960s, 
they  had  replaced  Britain  as  India's  principal  naval  supplier 
(see  table  36,  Appendix). 

During  the  1980s,  Indian  naval  power  grew  significantly. 
During  this  period,  the  naval  facilities  at  Port  Blair  in  the  Anda- 
man Islands,  in  the  Nicobar  Islands,  and  in  Lakshadweep  were 
significantly  upgraded  and  modernized.  A  new  line  of  Leander- 
class  frigates  was  manufactured  at  Mazagon  Dock  in  collabora- 
tion with  Vickers  and  Yarrow  of  Britain.  These  frigates,  redesig- 
nated as  the  Godavari  class,  have  antisubmarine  warfare 
capabilities  and  can  carry  two  helicopters.  During  the  1980s, 
plans  were  also  finalized  for  the  licensed  manufacture  of  a  line 
of  West  German  Type  1500  submarines  (known  as  the  Shishu- 
mar  class  in  India).  In  addition  to  these  developments  at  Maza- 
gon Dock,  the  naval  air  arm  also  was  upgraded.  India 
purchased  nearly  two  squadrons  of  the  vertical  and  short  take- 
off and  landing  (VSTOL)  Sea  Harriers  to  replace  an  earlier 
generation  of  Sea  Hawks. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  India  was  preparing  for  a  major  modern- 
ization program  that  was  to  include  completion  of  three  5,000- 
ton  Delhi-class  destroyers,  the  building  of  three  3,700-ton  frig- 
ates based  on  Italian  Indian  Naval  Ship  (INS)-IO  design,  and 
the  acquisition  of  four  hydrographic  survey  ships.  Also  to  be 
built  were  an  Indian-designed  warship  called  Frigate  2001;  six 
British  Upholder-class  submarines;  an  Indian-designed  and 
Indian-built  missile-firing  nuclear  submarine — the  Advanced 
Technology  Vessel — based  on  the  Soviet  Charlie  II  class;  and  an 
Indian-designed  and  Indian-built  17,000-ton  air  defense  ship 
capable  of  carrying  between  twelve  and  fifteen  aircraft.  The  air- 
defense  ship  will  be,  in  effect,  a  replacement  for  India's  two 
aging  British  aircraft  carriers,  the  INS  Vikrant,  the  keel  of  which 
was  laid  in  1943  but  construction  of  which  was  not  completed

until  1961  and  which  was  slated  for  decommissioning  by  2000, 
and  the  INS  Viraat,  which  entered  service  in  1987  and  is  likely 
to  be  decommissioned  by  2005.  The  problems  encountered 
with  modernizing  these  and  other  foreign-source  ships  led 
India  to  decide  against  acquiring  an  ex-Soviet  Kiev-class  aircraft 
carrier  in  1994. 

In  the  spirit  of  international  military  cooperation,  India  has 
made  moves  in  the  early  and  mid-1990s  to  enhance  joint- 
nation  interoperability.  Indian  naval  exercises  have  taken  place 
with  ships  from  the  Russian  navy  and  those  of  Indian  Ocean  lit- 
toral states  and  other  nations,  including  the  United  States. 

Naval  headquarters  is  located  in  New  Delhi.  It  is  under  the 
command  of  the  chief  of  naval  staff — a  full  admiral.  The  chief 
of  naval  staff  has  four  principal  staff  officers:  the  vice  chief  of 
naval  staff,  the  vice  chief  of  personnel,  the  chief  of  material, 
and  the  deputy  chief  of  naval  staff.  The  total  strength  of  the 


589 


India:  A  Country  Study 


navy  in  1994  was  54,000,  including  5,000  naval  aviation  person- 
nel and  1,000  marines  (one  regiment,  with  a  second  reportedly 
forming). 

Women  were  inducted  into  the  navy  for  the  first  time  in 
1992,  when  twenty-two  were  trained  as  education,  logistics,  and 
law  cadres.  In  1993  additional  women  were  recruited  for  air 
traffic  control  duties.  By  1994  there  were  thirty-five  women 
naval  officers. 

The  navy  is  deployed  under  three  area  commands,  each 
headed  by  a  flag  officer.  The  Western  Naval  Command  is  head- 
quartered in  Bombay  on  the  Arabian  Sea;  the  Southern  Naval 
Command  in  Kochi  (Cochin),  in  Kerala,  also  on  the  Arabian 
Sea;  and  the  Eastern  Naval  Command  in  Vishakhapatnam, 
Andhra  Pradesh,  on  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  Additionally,  the  navy 
has  important  bases  in  Calcutta  and  Goa. 

The  Southern  Naval  Command  is  responsible  for  naval  offi- 
cer training,  which  occurs  at  the  Indian  Naval  Academy  in  Goa. 
Officer  candidates  are  largely  drawn  from  the  National 
Defence  Academy.  After  commissioning,  officers  are  offered 
specialized  training  in  antisubmarine  warfare,  aviation,  com- 
munications, electronic  warfare,  engineering,  hydrography, 
maritime  warfare,  missile  warfare,  navigation,  and  other  naval 
specialties  at  various  naval  training  institutions,  many  of  which 
are  collocated  with  the  Training  Command  headquarters  on 
Wiilingdon  Island,  near  Kochi. 

The  Air  Force 

The  air  force  was  established  in  1932.  In  1994  it  had  110,000 
personnel  and  779  combat  aircraft.  The  air  force,  which  is 
headquartered  in  New  Delhi,  is  headed  by  the  chief  of  air  staff, 
an  air  chief  marshal.  He  is  assisted  by  six  principal  staff  officers: 
the  vice  chief  of  air  staff,  the  deputy  chief  of  air  staff,  the  air 
officer  in  charge  of  administration,  the  air  officer  in  charge  of 
personnel,  the  air  officer  in  charge  of  maintenance,  and  the 
inspector  general  of  flight  safety.  The  air  force  is  deployed  into 
five  operational  commands:  the  Western  Air  Command,  head- 
quartered at  New  Delhi;  the  Southwestern  Air  Command, 
headquartered  at  Jodhpur,  Rajasthan;  the  Eastern  Air  Com- 
mand, headquartered  at  Shillong,  Meghalaya;  the  Central  Air 
Command,  headquartered  at  Allahabad,  Uttar  Pradesh;  and 
the  Southern  Air  Command,  headquartered  at  Thiruvanan- 
thapuram  (Trivandrum),  Kerala.  Additionally,  there  are  two 
functional  commands:  the  Training  Command  at  Bangalore, 


590 


National  Security 


Karnataka,  and  the  Maintenance  Command  at  Nagpur,  Maha- 
rashtra. 

As  of  1994,  the  air  force  was  equipped  with  twenty-two  squad- 
rons of  ground  attack  fighters.  Five  of  these  squadrons  had  a 
total  of  eighty-nine  British  Jaguar  aircraft.  Another  five  squad- 
rons had  120  Soviet-origin  MiG— 27  aircraft.  The  air  force  also 
fielded  twenty  fighter  squadrons,  two  of  which  were  equipped 
with  a  total  of  thirty-five  French-built  Mirage  2000  H/TH  air- 
craft. There  were  also  twelve  squadrons  of  transport  aircraft  in 
the  inventory  (see  table  37,  Appendix).  Because  of  the  large 
number  of  Soviet-origin  aircraft,  the  air  force  is  dependent  on 
Russia  for  spare  parts  and  equipment  and  weapons  upgrades. 
In  March  1995,  Russia  agreed  to  upgrade  India's  MiG— 21  air- 
craft. 

Aside  from  the  Training  Command  at  Bangalore,  the  center 
for  primary  flight  training  is  located  at  the  Air  Force  Academy 
at  Hyderabad,  Andhra  Pradesh,  followed  by  operational  train- 
ing at  various  air  force  schools.  Advanced  training  is  also  con- 
ducted at  the  Defence  Services  Staff  College;  specialized 
advanced  flight  training  schools  are  located  at  Bidar,  Karna- 
taka, and  Hakimpet,  Andhra  Pradesh  (also  the  location  for 
helicopter  training).  Technical  schools  are  found  at  a  number 
of  other  locations. 

In  1991  the  government  approved  the  induction  of  women 
into  nontechnical  air  force  officer  billets,  such  as  administra- 
tion, logistics,  accounting,  education,  and  meteorology.  In 
1992  opportunities  for  "pioneer  women  officers"  were  opened 
in  the  areas  of  transportation,  helicopters,  and  navigation,  and 
the  first  group  of  thirteen  women  cadets  entered  the  Air  Force 
Academy.  During  their  flight  training,  they  qualified  on  HPT- 
32  and  Kiran  aircraft  to  earn  their  air  force  commissions.  After 
completing  ten  months'  training,  five  of  the  seven  successful 
course  graduates  received  further  training  on  various  transport 
aircraft.  By  1994,  there  were  fifty-five  women  officers  in  the  air 
force. 

Recruitment  and  Training 

Under  the  Indian  constitution,  as  amended  in  1977,  each  cit- 
izen has  a  fundamental  duty  to  "defend  the  country  and  render 
national  service  when  called  upon  to  do  so"  (see  The  Constitu- 
tional Framework,  ch.  8).  However,  the  three  services  have 
always  been  all-volunteer  forces,  and  general  conscription  has 
never  proved  necessary.  Military  service  has  long  been  deemed 


591 


India:  A  Country  Study 

an  attractive  option  for  many  in  a  society  where  employment 
opportunities  are  scarce.  The  technical  branches  of  the  armed 
forces,  however,  have  experienced  problems  with  recruitment. 
Since  the  1980s,  as  a  result  of  the  growth  and  diversification  of 
India's  industrial  base,  employment  opportunities  for  individu- 
als with  technical  training  have  expanded  substantially.  Conse- 
quently, fewer  trained  individuals  have  sought  employment 
opportunities  in  the  armed  services. 

The  army  and  navy  maintain  a  combined  recruitment  orga- 
nization that  operates  sixty  offices  in  key  cities  and  towns 
nationwide.  The  air  force  has  a  separate  recruiting  organiza- 
tion with  twelve  offices.  Army  and  navy  recruitment  officers 
tour  rural  districts  adjacent  to  their  stations  and  also  draw  from 
nearby  urban  areas.  The  air  force  and  the  navy  draw  a  dispro- 
portionate number  of  their  recruits  from  the  urban  areas, 
where  educational  opportunities  are  adequate  to  generate 
applicants  capable  of  mastering  technical  skills.  The  army  also 
recruits  outside  India,  admitting  ethnic  Gurkhas  (also  seen  as 
Gorkhas)  from  Nepal  into  a  Gurkha  regiment. 

Initial  enlistments  vary  in  length,  depending  on  the  service 
and  the  branch  or  skill  category,  but  fifteen  years  is  considered 
the  minimum.  The  tour  of  duty  is  generally  followed  by  two  to 
five  years  of  service  in  a  reserve  unit.  Reenlistment  is  permitted 
for  those  who  are  qualified,  particularly  those  possessing  neces- 
sary skills.  The  minimum  age  for  enlistment  is  seventeen  years; 
the  maximum  varies  between  twenty  and  twenty-seven,  depend- 
ing on  the  service  and  skill  category.  The  compulsory  retire- 
ment age  for  officers  also  varies,  ranging  from  forty-eight  for 
army  majors,  navy  lieutenant  commanders,  and  air  force 
squadron  leaders  and  below,  to  sixty  for  army  generals,  navy 
admirals,  and  air  force  air  chief  marshals.  On  occasion  a  two- 
year  extension  is  granted  on  the  grounds  of  exceptional  orga- 
nizational needs  or  personal  ability. 

Candidates  have  to  meet  minimum  physical  standards, 
which  differ  among  the  three  services  and  accommodate  the 
various  physical  traits  of  particular  ethnic  groups.  Since  1977 
recruiting  officers  have  relaxed  physical  standards  slightly 
when  evaluating  the  only  sons  of  serving  or  former  military 
personnel — both  as  a  welfare  measure  and  as  a  means  of  main- 
taining  a  family  tradition  of  military  service. 

Educational  standards  for  enlisted  ranks  differ  according  to 
service  and  skill  category;  the  army  requirement  varies  from 
basic  literacy  to  higher  secondary  education  (see  Primary  and 


592 


Women  naval  officers 
Courtesy  Embassy  of  India,  Washington 

Secondary  Education,  ch.  2).  The  other  two  services  require 
higher  educational  levels,  reflecting  their  greater  need  for 
technical  expertise.  The  air  force  requires  at  least  a  higher  sec- 
ondary education,  and  the  navy  insists  on  graduation  from  a 
secondary  school  for  all  except  cooks  and  stewards.  Officer 
candidates  have  to  complete  a  higher  secondary  education  and 
pass  a  competitive  qualifying  exam  for  entry  into  precommis- 
sion  training.  All  services  also  accept  candidates  holding  uni- 
versity degrees  in  such  fields  as  engineering,  physics,  or 
medicine  for  direct  entry  into  the  officer  corps. 

Enlistment  was  legally  opened  to  all  Indians  following  inde- 
pendence in  1947.  In  1949  the  government  abolished  recruit- 
ment on  an  ethnic,  linguistic,  caste,  or  religious  basis. 
Exceptions  were  army  infantry  regiments  raised  before  World 
War  II,  where  cohesion  and  effectiveness  were  thought  to  be 
rooted  in  long-term  attachment  to  traditions.  Some  army  regi- 


593 


India:  A  Country  Study 

ments  have  a  homogeneous  composition;  other  regiments  seg- 
regate groups  only  at  battalion  or  company  levels.  Others  are 
completely  mixed  throughout.  In  general,  the  army  has 
steadily  evolved  into  a  more  heterogeneous  service  since  1947. 
Regiments  raised  during  and  after  World  War  II  have  recruited 
Indians  of  almost  all  categories,  and  the  doubling  of  the  army's 
size  after  the  1962  border  war  with  China  sped  up  the  process. 
The  armed  forces  have  made  a  concerted  effort  to  recruit 
among  underrepresented  segments  of  the  population  and, 
during  the  late  1970s  and  the  early  1980s,  reformed  the  recruit- 
ing process  to  eliminate  some  of  the  subjectivity  in  the  candi- 
date selection  process.  Since  1989  the  government  has  sought 
to  apportion  recruitment  from  each  state  and  union  territory 
according  to  its  share  of  the  population.  Both  the  air  force  and 
the  navy  are  now  almost  completely  "mixed"  services  and  dis- 
play considerable  heterogeneity  in  their  composition. 

Conditions  of  Service 

Pay  and  allowances  for  armed  forces  personnel  compare 
favorably  with  civilian  employment.  Monthly  salaries  vary 
according  to  the  service,  although  personnel  usually  earn  simi- 
lar pay  for  equivalent  duties.  Additionally,  there  is  an  extensive 
and  complex  system  of  special  allowances  that  depend  on  con- 
ditions and  kind  of  service.  Free  food  for  personnel  in  both 
field  and  garrison  areas  was  extended  after  1983  to  all  person- 
nel up  to  the  rank  of  colonel.  All  personnel  are  entitled  to 
annual  leaves  of  varying  lengths,  and,  other  than  for  a  few 
exceptions,  the  services  bear  transportation  costs  for  personnel 
and  their  families.  Commissioned  officers  and  other  desig- 
nated ranks  contribute  to  the  Armed  Forces  Provident  Fund,  a 
form  of  life  insurance. 

Personnel  retiring  after  twenty  years  of  service  as  an  officer 
or  fifteen  years  of  enlisted  service  receive  pensions  based  on 
the  rank  held  at  retirement.  Retirees  without  the  minimum  ser- 
vice requirement  receive  special  one-time  bonuses.  Additional 
remuneration  accrues  to  those  disabled  in  the  line  of  service 
or — in  the  event  of  the  death  of  active-duty  personnel — to  their 
surviving  dependents. 

The  Soldiers',  Sailors',  and  Airmen's  Board,  chaired  by  the 
minister  of  defence,  is  one  of  the  most  important  organizations 
dealing  with  the  welfare  of  active-duty  personnel  and  their 
dependents.  The  board  works  closely  with  the  Directorate  of 
Resettlement  in  the  Ministry  of  Defence  to  assist  former  service 


594 


National  Security 


personnel  and  their  dependents  to  find  employment  on  their 
return  to  civilian  life.  The  directorate  also  operates  cooperative 
industrial  and  agricultural  estates  and  training  programs  to 
prepare  former  service  personnel  for  employment  in  new 
fields.  Both  central  and  state-level  governments  reserve  a  per- 
centage of  vacancies  in  the  public  sector  for  former  military 
personnel. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

Indian  military  uniforms  resemble  those  in  the  correspond- 
ing British  services:  olive  drab  for  the  army,  dark  blue  for  the 
navy,  and  sky  blue  for  the  air  force.  More  uniform  variations 
exist  in  the  army  than  in  the  other  services,  with  certain  army 
regiments  preserving  traditional  accoutrements.  Sikhs  may 
wear  turbans  instead  of  standard  military  headgear,  for  exam- 
ple (see  Sikhism,  ch.  3). 

The  rank  structure  in  the  three  services,  especially  in  the 
commissioned  officer  ranks,  for  the  most  part  follows  conven- 
tional British  practice.  The  army,  however,  has  the  category  of 
junior  commissioned  officer,  for  which  there  is  no  precise 
equivalent  in  the  United  States  or  British  services.  Junior  com- 
missioned officers  are  promoted  on  a  point  system  from  within 
the  enlisted  ranks  of  their  regiments,  filling  most  of  the  junior 
command  slots,  such  as  platoon  leaders.  The  senior  junior 
commissioned  officer  usually  acts  as  the  principal  assistant  to 
the  commanding  officer. 

Rank  insignia  closely  follow  the  British  system.  Combina- 
tions of  stars,  Lion  of  Sarnath  (the  national  emblem)  badges, 
crossed  sabers,  and  crossed  batons  in  a  wreath  show  respective 
army  ranks  from  junior  commissioned  officer  up  through  field 
marshal.  The  latter  rank  has  been  granted  to  only  two  distin- 
guished Indian  officers:  K.M.  Cariappa,  a  highly  decorated  vet- 
eran of  the  1947-48  war  with  Pakistan,  and  S. H.F.J.  "Sam" 
Manekshaw,  the  strategist  of  the  1971  war  with  Pakistan.  Arm 
chevrons  worn  with  the  point  down  indicate  enlisted  ranks. 
Naval  insignia  follow  the  convention  of  sleeve  stripes  for  offi- 
cers and  fouled  anchor  badges  for  enlisted  personnel.  The  air 
force  uses  broad  and  narrow  sleeve  stripe  combinations  for 
officer  ranks  and  combinations  of  chevrons,  Lion  of  Sarnath 
badges,  and  wing  symbols  for  enlisted  ranks  (see  fig.  18;  fig. 
19).

National  Security 


India:  A  Country  Study 


Paramilitary  and  Reserve  Forces 

Paramilitary  Forces 

In  addition  to  the  regular  armed  forces,  India  also  has  para- 
military forces.  These  forces  have  grown  dramatically  since 
independence.  There  are  twelve  paramilitary  organizations, 
which  have  an  authorized  strength  of  around  1.3  million  per- 
sonnel. In  1994,  their  reported  actual  strength  was  692,500. 
These  organizations  include  the  Coast  Guard  Organisation  and 
the  Defence  Security  Force,  which  are  subordinate  to  the  Min- 
istry of  Defence.  Paramilitary  forces  subordinate  to  the  Minis- 
try of  Home  Affairs  include  the  Assam  Rifles,  the  Border 
Security  Force,  the  Central  Industrial  Security  Force,  the  Cen- 
tral Reserve  Police  Force,  the  Indo-Tibetan  Border  Police,  and 
the  Rashtriya  Rifles  (National  Rifles).  The  National  Security 
Guards,  a  joint  anti terrorist  contingency  force,  are  charged 
with  protection  of  high-level  persons  (the  so-called  very  very 
important  persons — WIPs)  and  are  subordinate  to  the  Office 
of  the  Prime  Minister  (also  sometimes  known  as  the  Prime 
Minister's  Secretariat.)  The  guards  are  composed  of  elements 
of  the  armed  forces,  the  Central  Reserve  Police  Force,  and  the 
Border  Security  Force.  The  Special  Frontier  Force  also  is  subor- 
dinate to  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Railway  Protec- 
tion Force  is  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Railways.  At  the 
local  level,  there  is  the  Provincial  Armed  Constabulary,  which  is 
controlled  by  the  governments  of  the  states  and  territories  (see 
State  and  Other  Police  Services,  this  ch.). 

During  the  1960s,  1970s,  and  1980s,  local  police  forces  could 
not  deal  with  the  mounting  array  of  sectarian,  ethnic,  and 
regional  conflicts,  and  paramilitary  forces  were  increasingly 
called  on  for  assistance.  In  addition  to  security  and  guard 
duties,  paramilitary  organizations  assist  local  and  state-level 
police  forces  in  maintaining  public  order  and  shield  the  army 
from  excessive  use  in  "aid-to-the-civil-power"  operations.  These 
operations  essentially  involve  quelling  public  disorder  when 
local  police  forces  prove  inadequate  to  the  task. 

The  Coast  Guard  Organisation  was  constituted  as  an  Armed 
Force  of  the  Union  in  1978  under  the  administrative  control  of 
the  Ministry  of  Defence  (although  it  is  funded  by  the  Ministry 
of  Home  Affairs),  following  its  1977  establishment  as  a  tempo- 
rary navy  element.  Its  principal  mission  is  to  protect  the  coun- 
try's maritime  assets,  particularly  India's  200-nautical-mile 
exclusive  economic  zone  and  the  marine  resources  contained 


598 


National  Security 


in  the  area,  which  comprises  nearly  2.8  million  square  kilome- 
ters. The  coast  guard  is  also  responsible  for  the  prevention  of 
poaching  and  smuggling,  the  control  of  marine  pollution,  and 
carrying  out  search-and-rescue  missions.  Under  the  command 
of  a  director  general,  the  coast  guard  is  organized  into  three 
national  maritime  zones:  the  Western  Maritime  Zone,  head- 
quartered at  Bombay;  the  Eastern  Maritime  Zone,  headquar- 
tered at  Madras;  and  the  Andaman  and  Nicobar  Maritime 
Zone,  headquartered  at  Port  Blair.  The  zones  are  further  subdi- 
vided into  district  headquarters,  one  each  for  the  eight  mari- 
time states  on  the  mainland  and  two  in  the  Andaman  and 
Nicobar  Islands.  In  times  of  emergency,  the  coast  guard  is 
expected  to  work  with  the  navy.  In  the  late  1980s,  coast  guard 
units  from  the  eastern  zone  supported  Indian  peacekeeping 
efforts  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  coast  guard's  equipment  includes 
about  fifty  ships,  nine  helicopters,  and  thirteen  fixed-wing  air- 
craft (see  table  38,  Appendix). 

Another  Ministry  of  Defence  paramilitary  organization  has  a 
security  mission.  The  Defence  Security  Force  guards  Ministry 
of  Defence  facilities  throughout  India. 

The  Border  Security  Force  was  established  in  the  closing 
days  of  the  1965  Indo-Pakistani  conflict.  Its  principal  mission 
involves  guarding  the  Indo-Pakistani  line  of  actual  control  in 
Jammu  and  Kashmir  as  well  as  borders  with  Bangladesh  and 
Burma.  It  works  in  internal  security  and  counterinsurgency 
operations  in  Assam,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  and  Punjab.  The 
border  force  has  also  been  used  to  deal  with  communal  rioting. 

Another  Ministry  of  Homes  Affairs  paramilitary  force 
deployed  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  is  the  Rashtriya  Rifles.  In 
1994  it  had  5,000  troops,  all  of  whom  served  in  Jammu  and 
Kashmir.  Some  observers  expected  the  force  to  grow  to  thirty 
battalions,  with  around  25,000  personnel.  In  March  1995, 
Indian  television  referred  to  the  Delta  Force  of  the  "fledgling" 
Rashtriya  Rifles.  It  was  reported  that  the  force  was  operating 
against  "terrorists"  and  "foreign  mercenaries"  in  Doda  District 
in  south-central  Jammu  and  Kashmir. 

Founded  in  1939,  the  Central  Reserve  Police  Force  is  the 
country's  oldest  paramilitary  organization.  It  maintains  inter- 
nal order  when  local  and  state-level  forces  prove  inadequate  to 
the  task.  The  Central  Reserve  Police  Force  in  Assam,  Jammu 
and  Kashmir,  and  Punjab  has  worked  in  counterinsurgency 
operations.  This  force  also  was  dispatched  to  Sri  Lanka  during 
India's  1987-90  involvement  there.  The  Ministry  of  Defence's 


599 


India:  A  Country  Study 


weekly  armed  forces  magazine,  Sainik  Samachar,  reported  that 
the  Mahila  Battalion  (Women's  Battalion)  of  the  Central 
Reserve  Police  Force  had  "proved  its  mettle  in  hot  warlike  con- 
ditions in  Sri  Lanka,"  and  had  established  women  as  "a  force  to 
reckon  with"  in  the  paramilitary. 

Another  significant  paramilitary  organization  is  the  Indo- 
Tibetan  Border  Police,  established  in  1962  in  the  aftermath  of 
the  war  with  China.  It  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  security 
of  the  border  with  China. 

The  Special  Frontier  Force,  established  in  1962  in  the  after- 
math of  the  war  with  China,  is  less  well  publicized  by  the  gov- 
ernment. Apparently  it  is  an  elite,  parachute-qualified 
commando  unit,  nominally  subordinate  to  the  army  and 
deployed  along  sensitive  areas  of  the  border  with  China,  and 
recruited  partially  from  among  border-area  hill  tribes  and 
Tibetan  refugees.  The  Special  Frontier  Force  also  appears  to 
have  a  domestic  security  role;  members  of  the  force  were 
involved  in  the  Golden  Temple  siege  in  1984.  In  1994  its 
reported  strength  was  3,000,  making  it  one  of  the  smallest  para- 
military forces. 

Reserve  Forces 

India's  "second  line  of  defense"  is  composed  of  several  citi- 
zen mass  organizations.  These  include  the  Territorial  Army,  a 
voluntary,  part-time  civilian  force  that  receives  military  training 
and  serves  as  a  reserve  force  for  the  army  "to  relieve  [it]  of 
static  duties,  to  aid  the  civil  power,  and  to  provide  units  for  the 
regular  Army,  if  and  when  required."  It  was  raised  in  1949  and 
has  been  used  in  times  of  war  and  domestic  disturbances.  Orga- 
nizationally, Territorial  Army  personnel  are  raised  from  among 
employees  of  government  agencies  and  public-sector  enter- 
prises and  are  formed  into  departmental  units.  Nondepart- 
mental  units  are  raised  from  other  citizens,  including  former 
active-duty  military  personnel.  In  the  early  1990s,  Territorial 
Army  units  saw  service  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  along  the 
northern  and  western  borders  of  India  and  in  support  of  para- 
military units  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs. 

The  National  Cadet  Corps,  which  is  open  to  young  men  and 
women,  was  established  in  1948  to  develop  discipline  and  lead- 
ership qualities  useful  in  life  and  particularly  for  potential  ser- 
vice in  the  armed  forces.  The  semiautonomous  organization 
receives  guidance  from  the  ministries  of  education  and 
defence  at  the  central  level  and  from  state-level  governments  at 


600 


National  Security 


the  local  level.  It  is  organized  into  army,  navy,  and  air  force 
wings,  and  its  ranks  correspond  to  those  in  the  respective 
armed  forces. 

Civil  Defence  Volunteers  are  under  the  leadership  of  a  small 
paid  cadre,  who  are  trained  to  provide  early  warning  communi- 
cations at  the  town  level.  They  also  participate  in  civil  works 
construction  projects  and  natural  disaster  relief  work.  Subordi- 
nation is  through  the  local  state  or  territory  government  and 
the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs. 

The  Home  Guards  are  a  voluntary  force  raised  by  state  and 
territory  governments  under  the  guidance  of  the  Ministry  of 
Home  Affairs.  Home  Guards  undergo  minimal  training  and 
receive  pay  only  when  called  for  duty.  They  assist  the  police  in 
crime  prevention  and  detection;  undertake  watch  and  patrol 
duties;  and  aid  in  disaster  relief,  crowd  control,  and  the  super- 
vision of  elections.  The  central  government  reimburses  the 
states  and  territories  at  varying  rates  for  expenses  incurred  in 
the  performance  of  Home  Guard  duties. 

Space  and  Nuclear  Programs 

India  detonated  its  first  and  only  nuclear  device  at  Pokharan 
in  the  Rajasthan  Desert  in  May  1974.  Subsequently  and  in  all 
likelihood  as  a  consequence  of  international  pressure,  India 
has  chosen  not  to  conduct  any  further  tests.  At  a  formal  level, 
Indian  officials  and  strategists  deny  that  India  possesses  nuclear 
weapons  and  refer  to  India's  position  as  an  "options  strategy," 
which  essentially  means  maintaining  the  nuclear  weapons 
option  and  exercising  it  should  regional  and  international  con- 
ditions so  warrant.  In  pursuit  of  this  end,  India  refuses  to  sign 
the  1968  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons. 
Formally,  Indian  officials  argue  that  India's  refusal  to  sign  the 
treaty  stems  from  its  fundamentally  discriminatory  character; 
the  treaty  places  restrictions  on  the  nonnuclear  weapons  states 
but  does  little  to  curb  the  modernization  and  expansion  of  the 
nuclear  arsenals  of  the  nuclear  weapons  states. 

The  Indian  ballistic  missile  program  has  some  elements  in 
common  with  the  nuclear  program.  Under  the  aegis  of  the 
Integrated  Guided  Missile  Development  Programme,  India  is 
developing  rockets  of  varying  ranges:  the  Agni,  the  Prithvi,  the 
Akash,  the  Trishul,  and  the  Nag.  The  Agni,  which  former 
Prime  Minister  Rajiv  Gandhi  referred  to  as  a  "technology  dem- 
onstrator," was  first  test  fired  in  May  1989  and  again  in  May 
1992.  In  1995  it  was  not  yet  operational,  but  it  has  interconti- 


601 


India:  A  Country  Study 


nental  ballistic  missile  potential.  The  Prithvi — which  some 
sources  reported  had  an  operational  unit  raised  in  1995  and 
deployed  along  the  Pakistani  border — is  a  tactical,  short-range 
surface-to-surface  missile  designed  by  the  DRDO  as  part  of 
India's  antimissile  defense  system.  Based  on  the  Soviet  Scud 
missile,  its  250-kilogram  payload  can  be  launched  from  a 
mobile  launcher.  The  Trishul  is  a  sea-skimming  short-range 
missile.  The  Akash  is  a  multitarget  surface-to-air  missile  that 
was  being  test  fired  in  1994  and  1995.  The  Nag  is  essentially  an 
antitank  missile. 

The  Indian  missile  program  has  been  of  concern  to  the 
United  States,  which,  under  the  terms  of  the  Missile  Technol- 
ogy Control  Regime,  imposed  sanctions  against  the  Indian 
Space  Research  Organisation  (ISRO)  in  June  1992.  In  July 
1993,  the  United  States  prevailed  upon  the  Russian  space 
agency,  Glavkosmos,  not  to  transfer  cryogenic  rocket  engines 
to  India  (see  Russia;  United  States,  ch.  9).  The  ISRO  decided  it 
would  develop  the  engine  on  its  own  by  1997  while  continuing 
to  seek  purchase  of  modified  versions  of  the  engines  from  Rus- 
sia. Seven  such  cryogenic  engines  were  scheduled  for  delivery 
by  Glavkosmos  between  1996  and  1999.  In  keeping  with  its 
agreement  with  the  United  States,  Glavkosmos  was  not  going  to 
transfer  additional  technology  for  cryogenic  engines.  However, 
cryogenic  engine  technology  transfer  had  begun  in  1991,  and 
hence  leading  ISRO  officials  were  confident  about  their  1997 
projection. 

Intelligence  Services 

The  first  post-independence  military  intelligence  service  was 
the  Intelligence  Bureau  established  in  1947  under  the  aegis  of 
the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  Until  1962  the  Intelligence 
Bureau  had  wide-ranging  responsibilities  for  the  collection, 
collation,  and  assessment  of  both  domestic  and  foreign  intelli- 
gence. The  failure  of  the  Intelligence  Bureau  to  assess  ade- 
quately the  nature  of  the  Chinese  threat,  however,  led  to  a 
reevaluation  of  its  role  and  functions  in  the  early  1960s.  Mili- 
tary Intelligence,  which  in  the  words  of  one  retired  Indian  gen- 
eral was  "little  more  than  a  post  office,"  was  reactivated  and 
given  the  task  of  reporting  to  the  revamped  Joint  Intelligence 
Committee.  The  Joint  Intelligence  Committee  is  the  key  body 
coordinating  and  assessing  intelligence  brought  to  it  by  the 
Intelligence  Bureau,  Military  Intelligence,  and  the  Research 
and  Analysis  Wing  of  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  Estab-

India:  A  Country  Study 

lished  in  1968,  the  Research  and  Analysis  Wing  is  primarily 
responsible  for  gathering  external  intelligence.  Despite  a  sub- 
stantial budget  and  extensive  foreign  postings,  the  wing's 
efforts  to  gather  intelligence  even  in  South  Asia  are  inadequate 
according  to  some  foreign  analysts  (see  Role  of  the  Prime  Min- 
ister, ch.  9). 

Each  of  the  armed  services  has  a  directorate  charged  with 
the  collection  and  dissemination  of  intelligence.  Critics  have 
charged  that  there  is  inadequate  cooperation  and  coordina- 
tion among  the  service  intelligence  directorates,  the  Intelli- 
gence Bureau,  and  the  Research  and  Analysis  Wing.  There  is, 
however,  an  interservice  Joint  Cipher  Bureau,  which  is  in 
charge  of  cryptology  and  signals  intelligence.  The  Research 
and  Analysis  Wing  includes  officers  from  the  armed  services 
and  also  has  a  chief  military  intelligence  adviser. 

Military  Justice 

The  Manual  of  Military  Law  and  Regulations  spells  out  rules 
and  procedures  for  the  investigation,  prosecution,  and  punish- 
ment of  military  offenses  and  crimes  in  the  armed  forces.  Basic 
authority  rests  in  the  constitution,  the  Army  Act  of  1954,  the 
Air  Force  Act  of  1950,  and  the  Navy  Act  of  1957. 

The  army  and  air  force  have  three  kinds  of  courts.  They  are, 
in  descending  order  of  power,  the  General  Court,  which  con- 
ducts general  courts-martial;  the  District  Court;  and  the  Sum- 
mary General  Court.  Additionally,  the  army  has  a  fourth  kind 
of  court,  the  Summary  Court.  Local  commanding  officers  con- 
duct this  court  with  powers  similar  to  nonjudicial  punishment 
in  the  United  States  armed  forces.  The  navy  uses  general 
courts-martial  in  addition  to  the  nonjudicial  powers  established 
for  commanders  in  the  Navy  Act. 

Courts-martial  can  be  convened  by  the  prime  minister,  min- 
ister of  defence,  chief  of  staff  of  the  service  concerned,  or 
other  officers  so  designated  by  the  ministry  or  the  chief  of  staff. 
There  are  channels  of  appeal  and  stages  of  judicial  review, 
although  procedures  differ  among  the  three  services. 

Members  of  the  armed  forces  remain  subject  concurrently 
to  both  civilian  and  military  law,  and  criminal  courts  with 
appropriate  jurisdictions  assume  priority  over  military  courts  in 
specific  cases.  With  the  approval  of  the  government,  a  person 
convicted  or  acquitted  by  a  court-martial  can  undergo  retrial 
by  a  criminal  court  for  the  same  offense  and  on  the  same  evi-

dence.  Once  tried  by  a  civilian  court,  however,  one  cannot  be 
tried  by  a  military  court  for  the  same  offense. 

Each  of  the  three  services  has  its  own  judge  advocate  gen- 
eral's department,  relatively  free  and  independent  of  the  other 
branches  in  the  discharge  of  its  judicial  functions.  The  various 
departments  have  officers  among  the  adjutant  general's  staff  at 
army  headquarters,  in  the  chief  of  personnel's  staff  at  navy 
headquarters,  and  in  the  administration  staff  of  the  air  force 
headquarters. 

Public  Order  and  Internal  Security 

Military  Role  Expansion 

The  army  has  four  major  roles  or  functions  in  the  mainte- 
nance of  public  order  and  internal  security.  One  is  to  defend 
India's  territorial  integrity  and  to  maintain  the  inviolability  of 
its  borders.  Another  involves  dealing  with  internal  security 
threats  stemming  from  secessionist  demands  and  externally 
supported  insurgencies.  The  army  also  is  called  upon  to  assist 
Chilian  authorities  in  maintaining  civil  order  when  local  police 
forces  and  the  paramilitary  prove  inadequate  to  the  task. 
Finally,  the  army  can  also  be  mobilized  to  deal  with  natural 
disasters  such  as  earthquakes  and  floods,  the  only  domestic 
function  that  the  army  performs  with  enthusiasm. 

Despite  the  existence  of  numerous  paramilitary  forces,  the 
army  has  had  to  quell  outbreaks  of  civil  violence,  primarily  in 
the  states  of  Assam,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  and  Punjab  (see  Para- 
military Forces  and  Reserve  Forces,  this  ch.).  By  the  early 
1990s,  army  involvement  in  Assam  and  Punjab  had  diminished 
significantly  as  insurgencies  waned.  However,  the  role  of  the 
army  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  expanded  substantially  as  both 
police  and  paramilitary  forces  failed  to  maintain  law  and  order. 

In  1993  upper-echelon  army  officers  warned  that  excessive 
use  of  the  army  to  restore  civil  order  might  have  a  number  of 
corrosive  effects.  First,  it  might  damage  the  morale  of  troops 
who  might  be  distressed  at  having  to  shoot  civilians.  Second,  it 
might  have  the  effect  of  politicizing  the  army.  The  outgoing 
chief  of  army  staff,  General  Sunith  Francis  Rodrigues,  publicly 
articulated  his  misgivings  on  this  subject.  Furthermore,  in  June 
1993,  Rodrigues  presented  a  report  entitled  "Maximizing  Effec- 
tiveness of  Central  Police  Organizations"  to  the  Committee  of 
Secretaries  (composed  of  a  "core  group",  the  secretaries  of 
defence,  finance,  and  home  affair,  chaired  by  the  cabinet  secre- 


605 


India:  A  Country  Study 

tary,  and  meeting  on  a  weekly  basis).  The  report  called  for  the 
army  to  take  over  the  training  of  paramilitary  forces. 

Civil  Liberties,  Human  Rights,  and  the  Armed  Forces 

In  response  to  a  range  of  insurgencies  since  the  early  1980s, 
the  central  government  has  enacted  an  extensive  array  of  legis- 
lation that  places  substantial  curbs  on  civil  liberties.  The 
National  Security  Act  of  1980,  the  National  Security  Amend- 
ment Act  of  1984,  the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive  Activities  (Pre- 
vention) Act  of  1985  (which  was  renewed  in  1987  and 
suspended  in  1995),  and  the  Armed  Forces  (Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir) Special  Powers  Act  of  1990  are  the  most  significant  laws  in 
force.  The  ramifications  of  these  four  laws  are  sweeping.  Under 
their  aegis,  the  central  government  has  the  right  of  preventive 
detention,  may  seek  in-camera  trials,  may  send  accused  individ- 
uals before  designated  courts,  and  may  destroy  property 
belonging  to  suspected  terrorists.  Furthermore,  under  the 
terms  of  the  Armed  Forces  (Jammu  and  Kashmir)  Special  Pow- 
ers Act,  members  of  the  armed  forces  cannot  be  prosecuted  for 
actions  committed  in  good  faith  in  pursuance  of  the  provisions 
of  this  law. 

During  the  1980s  and  1990s,  both  international  and  domes- 
tic human  rights  groups  asserted  that  human  rights  violations 
are  rampant.  The  principal  international  organizations  making 
these  allegations  are  the  International  Commission  of  Jurists, 
Amnesty  International,  and  Asia  Watch.  Two  Indian  counter- 
parts are  the  People's  Union  for  Civil  Liberties  and  the  Peo- 
ple's United  Democratic  Front.  Indian  and  foreign  press 
reports  have  alleged  that  local  police  and  paramilitary  forces 
have  engaged  in  rape,  torture,  and  beatings  of  suspects  in 
police  custody.  Numerous  "militants"  reportedly  have  simply 
disappeared  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir.  On  other  occasions,  espe- 
cially in  Punjab,  security  forces  on  various  occasions  allegedly 
captured  insurgents  and  then  shot  them  in  staged  "encounters" 
or  "escapes."  The  government  has  either  vigorously  challenged 
these  allegations  or  asserted  that  condign  punishment  had 
been  meted  out  against  offenders.  The  government  has  made 
efforts  to  blunt  the  barrage  of  domestic  and  foreign  criticism. 
One  such  effort  was  the  establishment  of  the  five-member 
National  Human  Rights  Commission  in  1993  composed  of 
senior  retired  judges.  A  report  released  by  the  commission  in 
November  1993  cited  eighty  Bombay  police  officials  for  "atroci- 
ties, ill  treatment,  collusion,  and  connivance"  and  for  "being 


606 


National  Security 


openly  on  the  side  of  the  Hindu  aggressors"  during  the  Decem- 
ber 1992  Hindu-Muslim  riots.  The  commission's  mandate  does 
not  extend  to  violations  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  northeast 
India,  and  it  must  rely  on  state  investigative  agencies  for  its 
field  work. 

Insurgent  Movements  and  External  Subversion 

Kashmir 

In  the  mid-1990s,  India  was  grappling  with  three  separate 
insurgencies  of  varying  strengths  in  the  states  of  Assam,  Jammu 
and  Kashmir,  and  Punjab.  The  insurgency  in  Jammu  and  Kash- 
mir has  the  most  serious  implications  for  India.  The  long-term 
roots  of  the  Kashmir  problem  can  be  traced  to  the  partition  of 
India  (see  National  Integration,  ch.  1).  The  crisis  centers  on  a 
militant  secessionist  demand  that  the  Indian  state  has  harshly 
suppressed.  Its  proximate  causes  are  located  in  the  central  gov- 
ernment's attempts  to  manipulate  state-level  politics  for  short- 
term  political  ends.  Since  1989,  approximately  10,000  civilians 
have  died  at  the  hands  of  security  forces  or  militants.  Although 
the  origins  of  the  crisis  are  quintessentially  indigenous,  there  is 
widespread  agreement  among  both  Indian  and  foreign  observ- 
ers that  the  Inter-Services  Intelligence  Agency  of  Pakistan  has 
actively  aided  and  abetted  some  of  the  insurgent  groups,  most 
notably,  the  radical  Islamic  Hezb-ul-Mujahideen. 

The  counterinsurgency  strategy  that  the  Indian  government 
has  adopted  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  was  developed  in  the  con- 
text of  dealing  with  guerrilla  movements  in  India's  northeast  in 
the  late  1970s.  This  strategy  involves  denying  the  guerrillas  any 
sanctuaries,  sealing  the  porous  Indo-Pakistani  border,  and 
using  both  army  and  paramilitary  forces  to  conduct  house-to- 
house  "cordon-and-search"  operations.  Whether  this  strategy 
will  lead  eventually  to  the  collapse  of  the  insurgency  in  Jammu 
and  Kashmir  remains  an  open  question;  violence  has  contin- 
ued to  accelerate  since  1993,  with  mounting  casualties  on  both 
sides  and  the  destruction  of  an  ancient  mosque  and  shrine  in 
1995  (see  Political  Issues,  ch.  8;  South  Asia,  ch.  9). 

Punjab 

The  insurgency  in  the  state  of  Punjab  originated  in  the  late 
1970s.  The  roots  of  this  insurgency  are  complex.  The  Green 
Revolution,  a  package  of  agricultural  inputs,  transformed  the 
socioeconomic  landscape  of  Punjab  (see  The  Green  Revolu- 


607 


India:  A  Country  Study 

tion,  ch.  7).  Amidst  this  new-found  prosperity,  large  numbers 
of  Sikhs  started  to  shed  some  of  the  trappings  of  their  faith. 
This  propensity  rekindled  an  age-old  fear  in  the  Sikh  commu- 
nity— that  of  being  absorbed  into  the  Hindu  fold.  In  turn, 
many  Punjabi  Sikhs,  who  were  dispossessed  of  their  land  as  a 
consequence  of  agricultural  transformation,  found  solace  in 
various  revivalistic  practices.  One  of  the  leaders  of  this  revivalis- 
tic  movement  was  Sant  Jar  nail  Singh  Bhindranwale,  a  politi- 
cally ambitious  itinerant  Sikh  preacher.  The  second  factor 
contributing  to  the  insurgency  was  the  attempt  by  Indira  Gan- 
dhi (India's  prime  minister,  1966-77  and  1980-84),  the  Con- 
gress, and  from  1978  Congress  (I)  to  use  Bhindranwale  to 
undermine  the  position  of  the  Akali  Dal  (Eternal  Party),  a 
regional  party  (see  Political  Parties,  ch.  8).  Bhindranwale  and 
his  followers  were  encouraged  to  verbally  intimidate  Akali  Dal 
politicians.  Although  this  strategy  met  with  some  success,  Bhin- 
dranwale and  his  followers  became  a  source  of  mayhem  and 
disruption  in  Punjab.  Eventually,  in  June  1984,  Gandhi  had  to 
order  units  of  the  Indian  army  to  flush  out  Bhindranwale  and 
his  followers,  who  had  taken  refuge  in  the  Golden  Temple 
complex,  Sikhism's  most  holy  shrine,  in  Amritsar,  Punjab  (see 
Sikhism,  ch.  3). 

This  exercise,  Operation  Bluestar,  was,  at  best,  a  mixed  suc- 
cess. After  all  efforts  at  negotiation  failed,  Indira  Gandhi 
ordered  the  army  to  storm  the  temple.  A  variety  of  army  units, 
along  with  substantial  numbers  of  paramilitary  forces,  sur- 
rounded the  temple  complex  on  June  3,  1984.  After  the 
demands  to  surrender  peacefully  were  met  with  volleys  of  gun- 
fire from  within  the  confines  of  the  temple,  the  army  was  given 
the  order  to  take  the  temple  by  force.  Indian  intelligence 
authorities  had  underestimated  the  firepower  possessed  by  the 
militants,  however,  and  the  army  brought  in  tanks  and  heavy 
artillery  to  suppress  the  antitank  and  machine-gun  fire.  After  a 
twenty-four-hour  firefight,  the  army  successfully  took  control  of 
the  temple.  According  to  Indian  government  sources,  eighty- 
three  army  personnel  were  killed  and  249  injured.  Insurgent 
casualties  were  493  killed  and  eighty-six  injured.  Indian  observ- 
ers assert  that  the  number  of  Sikh  casualties  was  probably 
higher. 

The  attack  on  the  Golden  Temple  had  the  effect  of  inflam- 
ing significant  segments  of  the  Sikh  community.  It  is  widely 
believed  that  the  two  Sikh  bodyguards  who  assassinated  Indira 
Gandhi  on  October  31,  1984,  were  driven  by  their  anger  over

the  Golden  Temple  episode.  In  the  wake  of  Indira  Gandhi's 
assassination,  mobs  rampaged  through  the  streets  of  New  Delhi 
and  other  parts  of  India  over  the  next  few  days,  killing  several 
thousand  Sikhs.  The  New  Delhi  police  proved  to  be  partisan 
observers  and  did  little  to  stop  or  apprehend  the  rioters.  Only 
after  the  deployment  of  the  army,  almost  three  days  after  the 
onset  of  the  riots,  was  order  fully  restored. 

The  New  Delhi  riots  had  repercussions  in  Punjab  as  militants 
stepped  up  their  activities.  Gandhi's  son  and  political  successor, 
Rajiv  Gandhi,  sought  unsuccessfully  to  bring  peace  to  Punjab 
with  an  accord  signed  with  Harchand  Singh  Longowal,  a  mod- 
erate Sikh  leader.  Rajiv  Gandhi's  successors,  belonging  to  the 
Janata  factions,  proved  to  be  no  more  adept  at  resolving  the  cri- 
sis. In  fact,  between  1987  and  1991,  Punjab  was  placed  under 
President's  Rule  and  governed  directly  from  New  Delhi  (see 
The  Executive,  ch.  8).  Eventually,  an  election  was  held  in  the 
state  in  February  1992.  Voter  turnout,  however,  was  poor;  only 
about  24  percent  of  the  population  participated  in  the  elec- 
tions. Despite  its  narrow  mandate,  the  newly  elected  Congress 
(I)  government  gave  a  free  hand  to  the  police  chief  of  the 
state,  K.P.S.  Gill.  His  ruthless  methods  significantly  weakened 
the  insurgent  movement.  Most  political  observers,  however, 
assert  that  long-term  political  stability  in  Punjab  depends  on 
addressing  the  underlying  grievances  of  segments  of  the  Sikh 
community. 

Assam  and  the  Northeast 

The  origins  of  the  insurgency  in  Assam  are  quite  different 
from  those  in  Kashmir  and  Punjab.  The  principal  grievance  of 
the  radical  student  movement,  the  United  Liberation  Front  of 
Assam,  is  nativist.  Front  members  are  violently  opposed  to  the 
presence  of  Bengalis  from  the  neighboring  state  of  West  Ben- 
gal and  waves  of  illegal  immigrants  from  Bangladesh.  Various 
rounds  of  negotiations  between  the  United  Liberation  Front  of 
Assam  and  two  successive  central  governments  resulted  in  the 
Assam  Accord  of  August  15,  1985.  Under  the  provisions  of  this 
accord,  persons  who  entered  the  state  illegally  between  January 
1966  and  March  1971  were  allowed  to  remain  but  were  disen- 
franchised for  ten  years,  while  those  who  entered  after  1971 
faced  expulsion.  A  November  1985  amendment  to  the  Indian 
citizenship  law  allows  noncitizens  who  entered  Assam  between 
1961  and  1971  to  have  all  the  rights  of  citizenship  except  the 
right  to  vote  for  a  period  of  ten  years. 


610 


National  Security 


In  1993  an  accord  was  reached  between  the  Bodo  tribe  and 
the  central  and  state  governments.  The  accord  established  the 
Bodoland  Autonomous  Council,  which  gave  the  Bodos  limited 
political  and  administrative  autonomy.  Nevertheless,  violence 
broke  out  in  1994:  members  of  the  Bodo  Security  Force,  in  the 
wake  of  demands  for  a  "liberated  Bodoland"  burned  several  vil- 
lages and  killed  around  100  immigrant  villagers.  Both  local 
counterinsurgency  forces  and  army  units  were  sent  in  to 
engage  the  Bodo  militants. 

A  number  of  other  insurgencies  in  the  northeast  have 
required  extensive  use  of  army  and  paramilitary  forces.  Four 
states  in  particular  have  witnessed  various  insurgent  and  guer- 
rilla movements.  The  first  and  perhaps  the  most  significant 
insurgency  originated  in  Nagaland  in  the  early  1950s;  it  was 
eventually  quelled  in  the  early  1980s  through  a  mixture  of 
repression  and  cooptation.  In  1993  Nagaland  experienced 
recrudescent  violence  as  two  ethnic  groups,  the  Nagas  and  the 
Kukis,  engaged  in  brutal  conflict  with  each  other.  Adding  to 
India's  internal  unrest  in  this  region  were  the  links  established 
between  the  Bodo  insurgents  in  Assam  and  the  National  Social- 
ist Council  of  Nagaland,  which,  in  turn,  had  links  to  other 
active  insurgent  groups  and,  reportedly,  operatives  in  Thai- 
land. 

In  neighboring  Manipur,  militants  organized  under  the 
aegis  of  the  People's  Liberation  Army  long  fought  to  unite  the 
Meitei  tribes  of  Burma  and  Manipur  into  an  independent  state. 
This  insurgent  movement  had  been  largely  suppressed  by  the 
mid-1990s. 

In  Mizoram  the  Mizo  National  Front  fought  a  running  battle 
with  the  Indian  security  forces  throughout  the  1960s.  As  in 
Nagaland,  this  insurgency  was  suppressed  in  the  early  1980s 
through  a  mixture  of  political  concessions  and  harsh  military 
tactics. 

In  the  state  of  Tripura,  tribal  peoples  organized  under  the 
leadership  of  the  Tripura  National  Front  were  also  responsible 
for  terrorist  activity.  This  movement  has,  for  the  most  part,  also 
been  brought  under  control  by  the  government. 

The  central  government's  success  in  quelling  these  insurgen- 
cies was  not  without  human  and  material  costs.  Although  no 
assessments  of  these  costs  exist  in  the  public  domain,  it  is 
widely  believed  that  the  paramilitary  forces  and  the  army  were 
given  a  free  hand  in  suppressing  the  uprisings.  A  prominent 
Indian  human  rights  activist  and  attorney,  Nandita  Haksar,  has 


611 


India:  A  Country  Study 

alleged  that  harsh  methods  were  routinely  used,  including  col- 
lective punishment  of  villagers  accused  of  harboring  terrorists 
in  remote  areas.  Because  of  the  continued  level  of  insurgency 
by  Assamese  and  other  groups,  which  had  bases  in  neighboring 
Burma,  India  and  Burma  started  joint  counterinsurgency  oper- 
ations against  the  rebels  in  May  1995,  the  first  such  operations 
since  the  1980s. 

Law  Enforcement 

National-Level  Agencies 

The  constitution  assigns  responsibility  for  maintaining  law 
and  order  to  the  states  and  territories,  and  almost  all  routine 
policing — including  apprehension  of  criminals — is  carried  out 
by  state-level  police  forces.  The  constitution  also  permits  the 
central  government  to  participate  in  police  operations  and 
organization  by  authorizing  the  maintenance  of  the  Indian 
Police  Service.  Police  officers  are  recruited  by  the  Union  Pub- 
lic Service  Commission  through  a  competitive  nationwide 
examination.  On  completion  of  a  nationwide  basic  public-ser- 
vice course,  police  officer  candidates  attend  the  National 
Police  Academy  at  Hyderabad,  Andhra  Pradesh.  They  are  then 
assigned  to  particular  state  or  union  territory  forces,  where 
they  usually  remain  for  the  rest  of  their  careers.  About  50  per- 
cent of  the  officers  are  regularly  assigned  to  states  or  territories 
other  than  their  own  in  an  effort  to  promote  national  integra- 
tion. 

The  constitution  also  authorizes  the  central  government  to 
maintain  whatever  forces  are  necessary  to  safeguard  national 
security.  Under  the  terms  of  the  constitution,  paramilitary 
forces  can  be  legally  detailed  to  assist  the  states  but  only  if  so 
requested  by  the  state  governments.  In  practice,  the  central 
government  has  largely  observed  these  limits.  In  isolated 
instances,  the  central  government  has  deployed  its  paramilitary 
units  to  protect  central  government  institutions  over  the  pro- 
test of  a  state  government.  During  the  Emergency  of  1975-77, 
the  constitution  was  amended  (effective  February  1,  1976)  to 
permit  the  central  government  to  dispatch  and  deploy  its  para- 
military forces  without  regard  to  the  wishes  of  the  states  (see 
The  Rise  of  Indira  Gandhi,  ch.  1).  This  action  proved  unpopu- 
lar, and  the  use  of  the  paramilitary  forces  was  controversial. 
After  the  Emergency  was  lifted,  the  constitution  was  amended 
in  December  1978  to  make  deployment  of  central  government

paramilitary  forces  once  again  dependent  on  the  consent  of 
the  state  government.  According  to  apologists  for  the  central 
government,  this  amendment  prevented  the  government  from 
sending  in  paramilitary  forces  to  protect  the  Babri  Masjid 
(Babri  Mosque)  in  Ayodhya,  Uttar  Pradesh,  in  December  1992 
(see  Public  Worship,  ch.  3). 

The  principal  national-level  organization  concerned  with 
law  enforcement  is  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  which  super- 
vises a  large  number  of  government  functions  and  agencies 
operated  and  administered  by  the  central  government.  The 
ministry  is  concerned  with  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  mainte- 
nance of  public  peace  and  order,  the  staffing  and  administra- 
tion of  the  public  services,  the  delineation  of  internal 
boundaries,  and  the  administration  of  union  territories. 

In  addition  to  managing  the  Indian  Police  Service,  the  Min- 
istry of  Home  Affairs  maintains  several  agencies  and  organiza- 
tions dealing  with  police  and  security.  Police  in  the  union 
territories  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Police  Division,  which 
also  runs  the  National  Police  Academy  and  the  Institute  of 
Criminology  and  Forensic  Science.  The  Central  Bureau  of 
Investigation  investigates  crimes  that  might  involve  public  offi- 
cials or  have  ramifications  for  several  states.  The  ministry  also  is 
the  parent  organization  of  the  Border  Security  Force. 

State  and  Other  Police  Services 

The  Police  Act  of  1861  established  the  fundamental  princi- 
ples of  organization  for  police  forces  in  India,  and,  with  minor 
modifications,  continues  in  effect.  Consequently,  although 
state-level  police  forces  are  separate  and  may  differ  in  terms  of 
the  quality  of  equipment  and  resources,  their  patterns  of  orga- 
nization and  operation  are  markedly  similar. 

An  inspector  general,  answerable  to  the  home  secretary  of 
the  state,  heads  each  state,  union  territory,  or  national  capital 
territory  police  force.  Under  the  inspector  general  are  a  num- 
ber of  police  "ranges"  composed  of  three  to  six  districts, 
headed  by  deputy  inspectors  general.  District  police  headquar- 
ters are  commanded  by  superintendents.  District  superinten- 
dents have  wide  discretionary  powers  and  are  responsible  for 
overseeing  subordinate  police  stations  as  well  as  specialty  ele- 
ments, such  as  criminal  investigation  detachments,  equipment 
storehouses  and  armories,  and  traffic  police.  Many  large  dis- 
tricts also  have  several  assistant  district  superintendents.

tions there,  a  district  may  be  subdivided  and.,  in  some  states, 
further  divided  into  police  "circles"  to  facilitate  the  supervision 
from  district  headquarters.  Most  of  the  major  metropolitan 
areas  such  as  New  Delhi.  Bombay  Calcutta,  and  Madras  have 
separate  municipal  forces  headed  bv  commissioners.  Police  in 
the  states  and  union  territories  are  assisted  bv  units  of  volun- 
teer Home  Guards,  maintained  under  guidelines  formulated 
bv  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs. 

In  most  states  and  territories,  police  forces  are  functionally 
divided  into  civil  (unarmed)  police  and  armed  contingents. 
The  former  staff  police  stations,  conduct  investigations,  answer 
routine  complaints,  perform  traffic  duties,  and  patrol  the 
streets.  Thev  usually  carry  lathis — bamboo  staffs  weighted  or 
tipped  with  iron. 

Contingents  of  armed  police  are  divided  into  two  groups, 
the  district  armed  police  and  the  Provincial  .Armed  Constabu- 
lary The  district  armed  police  are  organized  along  the  lines  of 
an  army  infantry  battalion.  Thev  are  assigned  to  police  stations 
and  perform  guard  and  escort  duties.  Those  states  that  main- 
tain distinct  armed  contingents  employ  them  as  a  reserve  strike 
force  for  emergencies.  Such  units  are  organized  either  as  a 
mobile  armed  force  under  direct  state  control  or  in  the  case  of 
district  armed  police  (who  are  not  as  well  equipped)  as  a  force 
directed  bv  district  superintendents  and  generally  used  for  riot- 
control  duty 

The  Provincial  Armed  Constabulary  (Pradeshik)  is  an 
armed  reserve  maintained  at  kev  locations  in  some  states  and 
active  onlv  on  orders  from  the  deputy  inspector  general  and 
higher-level  authorities.  Armed  constabulary  are  not  usually  in 
contact  with  the  public  until  thev  are  assigned  to  VIP  duty  or 
assigned  to  maintain  order  during  fairs,  festivals,  athletic 
events,  elections,  and  natural  disasters.  Thev  mav  also  be  sent 
to  quell  outbreaks  of  student  or  labor  unrest.,  organized  crime, 
and  communal  riots:  to  maintain  kev  guard  posts;  and  to  par- 
ticipate in  antiterrorist  operations.  Depending  on  the  type  of 
assignment,  the  Provincial  .Armed  Constabulary  mav  carry  only 
lathis. 

At  all  levels,  the  senior  police  officers  answer  to  the  police 
chain  of  command  and  respond  to  the  general  direction  and 
control  of  designated  civilian  officials.  In  the  municipal  force..

the  chain  of  command  runs  directly  to  the  state  home  secretary 
rather  than  to  the  district  superintendent  or  district  officials. 

Working  conditions  and  pay  are  poor,  especially  in  the  lower 
echelons  of  the  police  forces.  Recruits  receive  only  around 
Rsl,900  per  month  (about  US$64).  Opportunities  for  promo- 
tion are  limited  because  of  the  system  of  horizontal  entry  into 
higher  grades.  Allegations  of  bribery,  attributable  to  the  low 
pay  and  poor  working  conditions,  have  been  widespread. 

Since  the  late  1980s,  women  have  entered  in  larger  numbers 
into  the  higher  echelons  of  the  Indian  police,  mostly  through 
the  Indian  Police  Service  system.  Women  police  officers  were 
first  used  in  1972,  and  a  number  of  women  hold  key  positions 
in  various  state  police  organizations.  However,  their  absolute 
numbers,  regardless  of  rank,  are  small.  Uniformed  and  under- 
cover women  police  officers  have  been  deployed  in  New  Delhi 
as  the  Anti-Eve  Teasing  Squad,  which  combats  sexual  harass- 
ment against  women  ("Eves").  Several  women-only  police  sta- 
tions have  also  been  established  in  Tamil  Nadu  to  handle  sex 
crimes  against  women. 

Police  uniforms  vary  widely  according  to  grade,  region,  and 
kind  of  duty  performed.  Among  the  armed  police,  uniforms 
tend  to  resemble  army  dress  rather  than  conventional  police 
uniforms.  The  khaki  uniforms  of  the  Indian  Police  Service  offi-

cers  are  similar  in  all  states,  but  headgear  varies  widely,  espe- 
cially among  metropolitan  areas. 

The  Criminal  Justice  System 

The  criminal  justice  system  descends  from  the  British  model. 
The  judiciary  and  the  bar  are  independent  although  efforts 
have  been  made  by  some  politicians  to  undermine  the  auton- 
omy of  the  judiciary.  From  about  the  time  of  Indira  Gandhi's 
tenure  as  prime  minister,  the  executive  has  treated  judicial 
authorities  in  an  arbitrary  fashion.  Judges  who  handed  down 
decisions  that  challenged  the  regime  in  office  have  on  occasion 
been  passed  over  for  promotion,  for  example.  Furthermore, 
unpopular  judges  have  been  given  less-than-desirable  assign- 
ments. Because  the  pay  and  perquisites  of  the  judiciary  have 
not  kept  up  with  salaries  and  benefits  in  the  private  sector, 
fewer  able  members  of  the  legal  profession  have  entered  the 
ranks  of  the  senior  judiciary. 

Despite  the  decline  in  the  caliber  and  probity  of  the  judi- 
ciary, established  procedures  for  the  protection  of  defendants, 
except  in  the  case  of  strife-torn  areas,  are  routinely  observed. 
The  penal  philosophy  embraces  the  ideals  of  preventing  crime 
and  rehabilitating  criminals. 

Criminal  Law  and  Procedure 

Under  the  constitution,  criminal  jurisdiction  belongs  con- 
currently to  the  central  government  and  the  states.  The  prevail- 
ing law  on  crime  prevention  and  punishment  is  embodied  in 
two  principal  statutes:  the  Indian  Penal  Code  and  the  Code  of 
Criminal  Procedure  of  1973.  These  laws  take  precedence  over 
any  state  legislation,  and  the  states  cannot  alter  or  amend 
them.  Separate  legislation  enacted  by  both  the  states  and  the 
central  government  also  has  established  criminal  liability  for 
acts  such  as  smuggling,  illegal  use  of  arms  and  ammunition, 
and  corruption.  All  legislation,  however,  remains  subordinate 
to  the  constitution. 

The  Indian  Penal  Code  came  into  force  in  1862;  as 
amended,  it  continued  in  force  in  1993.  Based  on  British  crimi- 
nal law,  the  code  defines  basic  crimes  and  punishments,  applies 
to  resident  foreigners  and  citizens  alike,  and  recognizes 
offenses  committed  abroad  by  Indian  nationals. 

The  penal  code  classifies  crimes  under  various  categories: 
crimes  against  the  state,  the  armed  forces,  public  order,  the 


616 


National  Security 


human  body,  and  property;  and  crimes  relating  to  elections, 
religion,  marriage,  and  health,  safety,  decency,  and  morals. 
Crimes  are  cognizable  or  noncognizable,  comparable  to  the 
distinction  between  felonies  and  misdemeanors  in  legal  use  in 
the  United  States.  Six  categories  of  punishment  include  fines, 
forfeiture  of  property,  simple  imprisonment,  rigorous  impris- 
onment with  hard  labor,  life  imprisonment,  and  death.  An 
individual  can  be  imprisoned  for  failure  to  pay  fines,  and  up  to 
three  months'  solitary  confinement  can  occur  during  rare  rig- 
orous imprisonment  sentences.  Commutation  is  possible  for 
death  and  life  sentences.  Executions  are  by  hanging  and  are 
rare — there  were  only  three  in  1993  and  two  in  1994 — and  are 
usually  reserved  for  crimes  such  as  political  assassination  and 
multiple  murders. 

Courts  of  law  try  cases  under  procedures  that  resemble  the 
Anglo-American  pattern.  The  machinery  for  prevention  and 
punishment  through  the  criminal  court  system  rests  on  the 
Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  of  1973,  which  came  into  force  on 
April  1,  1974,  replacing  a  code  dating  from  1898.  The  code 
includes  provisions  to  expedite  the  judicial  process,  increase 
efficiency,  prevent  abuses,  and  provide  legal  relief  to  the  poor. 
The  basic  framework  of  the  criminal  justice  system,  however, 
was  left  unchanged. 

Constitutional  guarantees  protect  the  accused,  as  do  various 
provisions  embodied  in  the  1973  code.  Treatment  of  those 
arrested  under  special  security  legislation  can  depart  from 
these  norms,  however.  In  addition,  for  all  practical  purposes, 
the  implementation  of  these  norms  varies  widely  based  on  the 
class  and  social  background  of  the  accused.  In  most  cases, 
police  officers  have  to  secure  a  warrant  from  a  magistrate 
before  instituting  searches  and  seizing  evidence.  Individuals 
taken  into  custody  have  to  be  advised  of  the  charges  brought 
against  them,  have  the  right  to  seek  counsel,  and  have  to 
appear  before  a  magistrate  within  twenty-four  hours  of  arrest. 
The  magistrate  has  the  option  to  release  the  accused  on  bail. 
During  trial  a  defendant  is  protected  against  self-incrimination, 
and  only  confessions  given  before  a  magistrate  are  legally  valid. 
Criminal  cases  usually  take  place  in  open  trial,  although  in  lim- 
ited circumstances  closed  trials  occur.  Procedures  exist  for 
appeal  to  higher  courts. 

India  has  an  integrated  and  relatively  independent  court  sys- 
tem. At  the  apex  is  the  Supreme  Court,  which  has  original, 
appellate,  and  advisory  jurisdiction  (see  The  Judiciary,  ch.  8). 


617 


India:  A  Country  Study 

Below  it  are  eighteen  high  courts  that  preside  over  the  states 
and  union  territories.  The  high  courts  have  supervisory 
authority  over  all  subordinate  courts  within  their  jurisdictions. 
In  general,  these  include  several  district  courts  headed  by  dis- 
trict magistrates,  who  in  turn  have  several  subordinate  magis- 
trates under  their  supervision.  The  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure  established  three  sets  of  magistrates  for  the  subordi- 
nate criminal  courts.  The  first  consists  of  executive  magistrates, 
whose  duties  include  issuing  warrants,  advising  the  police,  and 
determining  proper  procedures  to  deal  with  public  violence. 
The  second  consists  of  judicial  magistrates,  who  are  essentially 
trial  judges.  Petty  criminal  cases  are  sometimes  settled  in  pan- 
chayat  (see  Glossary)  courts. 

The  Penal  System 

The  constitution  assigns  the  custody  and  correction  of  crimi- 
nals to  the  states  and  territories.  Day-to-day  administration  of 
prisoners  rests  on  principles  incorporated  in  the  Prisons  Act  of 
1894,  the  Prisoners  Act  of  1900,  and  the  Transfer  of  Prisoners 
Act  of  1950.  An  inspector  general  of  prisons  administers  prison 
affairs  in  each  state  and  territory. 

By  the  prevailing  standards  of  society,  prison  conditions  are 
often  adequate.  Some  prison  administrators  concede  that  the 
prevailing  conditions  of  poverty  in  Indian  society  contribute  to 
recidivism  because  a  prison  sentence  guarantees  minimal  levels 
of  food,  clothing,  and  shelter.  Despite  this  overall  view,  India's 
prisons  are  seriously  overcrowded,  prisoners  are  given  better  or 
worse  treatment  according  to  the  nature  of  their  crime  and 
class  status,  sanitary  conditions  are  poor,  and  punishments  for 
misbehavior  while  incarcerated  have  been  known  to  be  particu- 
larly onerous. 

Prison  conditions  vary  from  state  to  state.  The  more  prosper- 
ous states  have  better  facilities  and  attempt  rehabilitation  pro- 
grams; the  poorer  ones  can  afford  only  the  most  bare  and 
primitive  accommodations.  Women  prisoners  are  mostly  incar- 
cerated in  segregated  areas  of  men's  prisons.  Conditions  for 
holding  prisoners  also  vary  according  to  classification.  India 
retains  a  system  set  up  during  the  colonial  period  that  man- 
dates different  treatment  for  different  categories  of  prisoners. 
Under  this  system,  foreigners,  individuals  held  for  political  rea- 
sons, and  prisoners  of  high  caste  and  class  are  segregated  from 
lower-class  prisoners  and  given  better  treatment.  This  treat- 
ment includes  larger  or  less-crowded  cells,  access  to  books  and 


618

newspapers,  and  more  and  better  food.  Despite  laws  that  man- 
date egalitarian  treatment  of  Dalits  (see  Glossary),  members  of 
Scheduled  Tribes  (see  Glossary),  and  members  of  the  so-called 
Backward  Glasses  (see  Glossary),  a  rigid  class  system  that  cir- 
cumvents the  spirit  of  these  laws  exists  within  the  prison  system 
(see  Varna,  Caste  and  Other  Divisions,  ch.  5). 

The  press  and  human  rights  groups  periodically  raise  the 
subject  of  prison  conditions,  including  problems  of  overcrowd- 
ing, the  plight  of  prisoners  detained  for  long  periods  while 
awaiting  trial,  and  the  proper  treatment  of  women  and  juvenile 
prisoners  (children  are  often  incarcerated  with  their  parents) . 
Reports  have  also  surfaced  alleging  that  torture,  beatings,  rape, 
sexual  abuse,  and  unexplained  suicides  occur  on  many  occa- 
sions in  police  stations  and  prisons.  Because  of  a  shortage  of 
mental  institutions,  numerous  "non-criminal  lunatics"  are 
imprisoned,  often  under  conditions  worse  than  those  afforded 
criminals.  The  government  concedes  that  problems  exist,  but 
insists  that  its  attempts  at  prison  reform  have  suffered  from  a 
paucity  of  resources. 

National  Security  Challenges 

As  the  twenty-first  century  approaches,  India  faces  a  number 


619 


India:  A  Country  Study 

of  key  challenges  to  its  national  security.  The  vast  majority  of 
emergent  threats  are  essentially  from  within. 

Because  of  increased  educational  opportunities,  greater 
political  awareness,  and  media  exposure,  hitherto  quiescent 
ethnic  minorities  are  steadily  claiming  their  rights  in  the  politi- 
cal arena.  This  form  of  political  assertiveness  has  generated  a 
backlash  from  the  well-entrenched  segments  of  India's  majority 
population.  Much  violence  has  accompanied  this  process  of 
social  change.  Increased  use  of  coercion  alone,  however,  is 
unlikely  to  contain  ethnoreligious  violence.  Further  develop- 
ment of  India's  political  institutions  and  social  policies  is  also 
needed. 

A  related  national  security  problem  in  the  region  is  linked  to 
the  porous  borders  and  cross-national  ethnic  ties  that  charac- 
terize South  Asia.  Consequently,  Pakistan  has  found  it  expedi- 
ent to  support  Muslim  militants  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  and,  to 
a  lesser  degree,  Sikh  insurgents  in  Punjab.  India,  on  occasion, 
has  retaliated  in  Pakistan's  Sindh  Province,  supporting  various 
movements  for  Sindhi  autonomy.  Furthermore,  India  has  also 
been  involved  in  supporting  the  Tamil  extremists  in  Sri  Lanka. 
As  long  as  governments  in  the  region  yield  to  these  tempta- 
tions for  short-term  gains,  continued  fratricidal  violence  is 
inevitable. 

The  other  major  source  of  instability  in  the  region  stems 
from  the  proliferation  of  nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  capabili- 
ties in  both  India  and  Pakistan.  The  long-standing  border  dis- 
pute with  China  and  the  memories  of  the  1962  military  debacle 
have  encouraged  India's  efforts  to  acquire  these  capabilities. 
India's  acquisition  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  may  well 
precipitate  a  three-way  arms  race  in  the  region  involving  India, 
Pakistan,  and  China.  Such  an  arms  race  not  only  would  be  stra- 
tegically destabilizing  but  also  would  impose  enormous  costs 
on  resource-poor  societies.

ing its  paramilitary  forces,  periodically  appear  in  the  journal

The  various  wars  that  have  taken  place  in  the  region  are  well 
documented.  The  best  analyses  are  Lionel  Protip  Sen's  Slender

South  Asian  Crisis  and  Richard  Sisson  and  Leo  E.  Rose's  War  and 
Secession  on  the  1971  Indo-Pakistani  conflict.  Sumit  Ganguly's 
The  Origins  of  War  in  South  Asia  is  the  only  comparative  and 
comprehensive  account  of  the  three  Indo-Pakistani  conflicts. 
Civil-military  relations  and  defense  decision-making  issues  have 
been  discussed  in  articles  written  jointly  byjerrold  F.  Elkin  and 
W.  Andrew  Ritezel  and  by  Sumit  Ganguly. 

An  excellent  discussion  of  nuclear  proliferation  issues  is 
found  in  Stephen  Philip  Cohen's  Nuclear  Proliferation  in  South 
Asia.  Indian  nuclear  and  ballistic  missile  programs  are  dis- 
cussed in  some  detail  in  Brahma  Chellaney's  Nuclear  Prolifera-

Table  14.  ( Continued)  National  Calendar  and  Government  Holidays 

NOTE:  In  1957  the  Indian  government  adopted  a  uniform,  national  calendar  based 
on  the  Gregorian  calendar  and  the  Shaka  Era  (starting  in  A.D.  78)  for  civil 
government  purposes.  Using  this  calendar,  the  year  A.D.  1995  is  1917  of  the 
revised  Shaka  Era.  The  Shaka  calendar  has  been  used  at  least  since  the  first 
century  A.D.  Because  the  Shaka  calendar  is  based  on  solar  and  lunar  obser- 
vations, some  of  the  dates  of  holidays  listed  below  are  subject  to  change  in  a 
given  year  and  from  one  part  of  India  to  another.  The  dates  shown  below 
are  from  1993  (Shaka  1915).  An  unofficial  but  widely  used  calendar  in 
North  India  dates  from  the  ninth  century  A.D.,  is  based  on  the  Vikrama  Era 
(beginning  in  57  B.C.) ,  and  starts  in  Chaitra.  The  Muslim  calendar  (starting 
with  A.D.  622)  is  widely  used  among  the  Muslim  population.  The  Buddhist 
calendar — based  on  the  death  of  Buddha  (483  B.C.) — and  the  Zcroastrian 
calendar  (starting  with  632  B.C.)  are  also  used.

are  assumed  to  be  included  in  the  final  prices.  GDP  is 
sometimes  aggregated  and  shown  at  market  prices,  mean- 
ing that  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  are  included;  when 
these  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  have  been  eliminated, 
the  result  is  GDP  at  factor  cost.  The  word  gross  indicates 
that  deductions  for  depreciation  of  physical  assets  have 
not  been  made.  See  also  gross  national  product. 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — Gross  domestic  product  (q.v.) 
plus  net  income  or  loss  stemming  from  transactions  with

culated  at  market  prices,  which  include  indirect  taxes  and 
subsidies.  Because  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  are  only 
transfer  payments,  GNP  is  often  calculated  at  factor  cost  by 
removing  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies. 
Group  of  Fifteen  (G-15) — Group  of  Third  World  countries

tation and  Cooperation"  and  charged  with  opening  a  dia- 
logue with  the  industrialized  nations,  specifically  the 
members  of  the  Group  of  Seven  (Canada,  France,  Ger- 
many, Italy,  Japan,  Britain,  and  the  United  States).  G-15 
summits  were  held  in  Kuala  Lumpur  (June  1990),  Caracas 
(November  1991),  Dakar  (November  1992),  and  New 
Delhi  (March  1994).  The  group  includes  Algeria,  Argen-

guru — In  the  Sikh  faith,  one  of  ten  spiritual  leaders  and  teach- 
ers, the  first  of  whom  was  Nanak  Dev,  the  last  being 
Gobind  Singh.  In  Hinduism,  a  religious  teacher  or  guide. 

Harijans — Term  introduced  by  Mahatma  Gandhi  for  Untouch- 
ables. Literal  meaning  is  children  of  God.  Militant  mem- 
bers of  this  group  prefer  to  be  called  Dalit  (q.v.)  in  self- 
recognition  of  their  historical  oppression. 

imam(s) — In  general  use  and  lower-cased,  imam  means  the 
leader  of  congregational  prayers;  as  such  it  implies  no 
ordination  or  special  spiritual  powers  beyond  sufficient 
education  to  carry  out  this  function.  Imam  is  also  used  fig- 
uratively by  many  Sunni  (q.v.)  Muslims  to  mean  the  leader 
of  the  Islamic  community.  Among  Shia  (q.v.)  Muslims,  the 
word  is  usually  upper-cased  and  takes  on  many  complex 
and  controversial  meanings;  in  general,  however,  it  indi- 
cates that  particular  descendant  of  the  House  of  Ali  who  is 
believed  to  have  been  God's  designated  repository  of  the 
spiritual  authority  inherent  in  that  line.  The  identity  of 
this  individual  and  the  means  of  ascertaining  his  identity 
have  been  the  major  issues  causing  divisions  among  Shias. 

Indian  National  Congress — Founded  in  1885;  before  and  after 
1947,  popularly  called  Congress  or  the  Congress.  A  major

been  dominant  in  Parliament  and  formed  governments 
from  1947  to  1977,  1980  to  1985,  and  1991  to  1996.  In 
1969  the  Congress  split,  and  the  ruling  party  under  Indira 
Gandhi  became  known  as  Congress  (R) — R  for  Requisi- 
tion— while  the  faction  opposed  to  her  was  called  Con- 
gress (O) — O  for  Organisation.  In  1978  she  renamed  her 
party  Congress  (I) — I  for  Indira.  There  also  have  been 
Congress  (S) — S  for  Socialist  or  Secular — and  Congress 
(U) — for  Urs,  named  after  its  founder  Devanaj  Urs — splin- 
ter groups. 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  along  with 
the  World  Bank  (q.v.)  in  1945,  the  IMF  is  a  specialized 
agency  affiliated  with  the  United  Nations  and  is  responsi- 
ble for  stabilizing  international  exchange  rates  and  pay- 
ments. The  main  business  of  the  IMF  is  the  provision  of 
loans  to  its  members  (including  industrialized  and  devel- 
oping countries)  when  they  experience  balance  of  pay- 
ments difficulties.  These  loans  frequently  carry  conditions 
that  require  substantial  internal  economic  adjustments  by 
the  recipients,  most  of  which  are  developing  countries. 

jati — Literally,  birth  group.  Basic  endogamous  unit  of  the  caste 
system.  There  are  approximately  3,000  jatis  in  contempo- 
rary society.  The  word  jati  is  also  sometimes  used  for  eth- 
nic, religious,  or  linguistic  groups. 

karma — Literally,  action.  Spiritual  merit  or  demerit  that  a 
being  acquired  in  a  previous  incarnation  and  is  acquiring 
in  present  existence. 

lakh — A  unit  of  measure  equal  to  100,000.  Also  see  crore  (q.v.). 

Mandal  Commission — A  government-appointed  commission, 
officially  the  Second  Backwards  Classes  Commission, 
chaired  by  former  member  of  Parliament  Bindhyeshwari 
Prasad  Mandal  from  December  1978  to  December  1980. 
Of  the  five  members,  four  were  from  Backward  Classes 
(q.v.)  and  one  was  from  a  Scheduled  Caste  (q.v.).  The  com- 
mission's controversial  December  1980  report  (the  Mandal 
Commission  Report  of  the  Backward  Classes  Commission)  called 
for  reserving  27  percent  of  all  services  and  public-sector 
undertakings  under  the  central  government  and  27  per- 
cent of  all  admissions  to  institutions  of  higher  education 
(except  in  states  that  have  reserved  higher  percentages) 
for  Backward  Class  members  and  Dalits  (q.v.).  In  August 
1990,  Prime  Minister  Vishwanath  Pratap  Singh  announced

fied benefits  under  the  constitution.  Untouchables,  also 
known  as  Harijans  (q.v.)  or  Dalits  (q.v.),  constitute  the  bulk 
of  Scheduled  Castes.  See  also  Scheduled  Tribes  (q.v.).  The

smaller  of  the  two  great  divisions  of  Islam.  The  Shia  sup- 
ported the  claims  of  Ali  and  his  line  to  presumptive  right 
to  the  caliphate  and  leadership  of  the  Muslim  community, 
and  on  this  issue  they  divided  from  the  Sunnis  (q.v.)  in  the 
major  schism  of  Islam.  Later  schisms  have  produced  fur- 
ther divisions  among  the  Shia  over  the  identity  and  num- 
ber of  imams  (q.v.).  Most  Shia  revere  twelve  Imams,  the 
last  of  whom  is  believed  to  be  hidden  from  view.

goal  is  to  effect  economic,  technical,  and  cultural  coopera- 
tion and  to  provide  a  forum  for  discussions  of  South  Asian 
political  problems. 

Sufi(s) — Comes  from  suf,  the  Arabic  word  for  "wool."  The  term 
derives  from  the  practice  of  wearing  a  woolen  robe,  a  sign 
of  dedicating  oneself  to  the  mystical  life,  known  in  Islam  as 
becoming  a  Sufi.  Sufis  seek  mystical  union  with  God  and 
have  been  condemned  by  some  Sunni  (q.v.)  legal  schools. 

Sunni — Comes  from  sunna,  meaning  "custom,"  with  connota- 
tions of  orthodoxy.  One  of  the  two  great  divisions  of  Islam, 
the  Sunnis  supported  the  traditional  method  of  election  to 
the  caliphate  and  accepted  the  Umayyad  line.  On  this 
issue,  they  divided  from  the  Shia  (q.v.)  belief  in  the  first 
great  schism  within  Islam. 

swadeshi — Literally,  of  one's  own  country.  A  preindependence 
movement  to  further  the  use  of  Indian-made  items,  partic- 
ularly cottage-industry  products,  such  as  hand-loomed 
cloth,  and  to  oppose  British-made  goods. 

tribal — In  addition  to  its  use  as  an  adjective — tribal  land  or 
tribal  customs — the  word  is  also  used  as  a  noun  to  describe 
a  tribesperson,  tribesman,  or  tribeswoman. 

twice-born — Referring  to  jatis  (q.v.)  claiming  membership  in 
one  of  the  three  upper  varnas  (q.v.),  that  is,  Brahman 
(q.v),  Kshatriya,  and  Vaishya.  Male  member's  natural  birth 
is  followed  by  a  sprititual  rebirth  in  a  rite  involving  investi- 
ture with  a  sacred  thread. 

varna — Literally,  color.  One  of  the  four  large  caste  groups 
(Brahman  (q.v.)  Kshatriya,  Vaishya,  and  Sudra)  from 
which  most  jatis  (q.v.)  are  believed  to  derive. 

World  Bank — Informal  name  used  to  designate  a  group  of  four 
affiliated  international  institutions:  the  International  Bank 
for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),  the  Interna- 
tional Development  Association  (IDA),  the  International 
Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  the  Multilateral  Invest- 
ment Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA).  The  IBRD,  established 
in  1945,  has  the  primary  purpose  of  providing  loans  at 
market-related  rates  of  interest  to  developing  countries  at 
more  advanced  stages  of  development.  The  IDA,  a  legally 
separate  loan  fund  but  administered  by  the  staff  of  the 
IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960  to  furnish  credits  to  the  poorest 
developing  countries  on  much  easier  terms  than  those  of 
conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC,  founded  in  1956,  sup- 
plements the  activities  of  the  IBRD  through  loans  and 


794 


Glossary 


assistance  designed  specifically  to  encourage  the  growth  of 
productive  private  enterprises  in  the  less-developed  coun- 
tries. The  MIGA,  founded  in  1988,  insures  private  foreign 
investment  in  developing  countries  against  various  non- 
commercial risks.  The  president  and  certain  officers  of  the 
IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the  IFC.  The  four  institu- 
tions are  owned  by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that 
subscribe  their  capital.  To  participate  in  the  World  Bank 
group,  member  states  must  first  belong  to  the  Interna- 
tional Monetary  Fund  (q.v.). 
zamindar(s) — Landlord,  but  particularly  the  group  of  land- 
lords and  the  zamindar  system  that  emerged  after  the  Brit- 
ish Permanent  Settlement  (Landlease)  Act  of  1793.  In 
essence,  the  former  revenue  collectors  of  the  Mughal 
period  (1526-1858)  became  landlords  under  the  British.
