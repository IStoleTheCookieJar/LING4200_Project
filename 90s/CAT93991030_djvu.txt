Grand  Forks  Human  Nutrition  Research  Center 


Brief  History 

In  1963,  Senator  Milton  Young  of  North  Dakota  submitted  to  Congress  a  report  prepared  by  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Agriculture's  Agricultural  Research  Service  (ARS)  about  the  need  for  an  expanded 
national  research  program  in  human  nutrition.  To  accompHsh  an  expanded  program,  it  was  proposed 
that  three  regional  research  laboratories  be  estabhshed  near  medical  schools,  one  each  in  the  North 
Central,  Southeast  and  Southwest  United  States.  The  Grand  Forks  Human  Nutrition  Research  Center 
was  the  only  laboratory  estabhshed  under  the  original  concept  of  the  report.  Planning  for  the  facility 
began  in  1966;  construction  began  in  1969.  The  building  was  completed  in  September  1970  and  dedicated 
with  a  symposium  "Newer  Trace  Elements  in  Nutrition."  At  this  time,  the  facility  was  a  1-1/2  story 
building  of  20,000  square  feet  with  only  two  finished  laboratories  and  no  animal  quarters  and  was 
officially  a  field  station  of  the  Vitamins  and  Minerals  Laboratory  of  the  ARS  Nutrition  Division  in 
Beltsville,  MD.  In  1972,  the  facihty  became  the  Human  Nutrition  Research  Laboratory  of  the  ARS 
North  Central  Region.  In  1976,  the  laboratory  began  operating  a  chnical  nutrition  research  program  in 
addition  to  the  basic  animal  research  program.  In  1977,  the  laboratory  was  designated  the  Grand  Forks 
Human  Nutrition  Research  Center  (GFHNRC).  The  GFHNRC  is  one  of  the  five  human  nutrition 
research  centers  operated  by  ARS;  the  others  are  located  in  Beltsville,  MD;  Houston,  TX;  Boston,  MA; 
and  San  Francisco,  CA. 

Between  the  years  of  1972  and  1984,  the  facility  was  expanded  from  20,000  to  80,000  square  feet.  It  now 
contains  a  vivarium  with  22  separate  rooms  for  small  animals,  a  laboratory  for  each  senior  scientist,  a  14- 
bed  metabolic  ward  for  long-term,  live-in  human  volunteer  studies,  and  a  separate  area  for  community- 
based  human  studies.

Clinical  Nutrition 


Mission 

The  Clinical  Nutrition  Research  Unit  plans,  implements,  and  interprets  research  designed  to  produce  new 
knowledge  about  human  nutrient  requirements,  with  emphasis  on  mineral  elements.  The  research  will 
identify  human  needs  necessary  for  achievement  of  genetic  potentials  and  optimal  function  throughout 
the  life  cycle.  It  will  also  provide  information  for  decisions  concerning  the  provision  of  a  healthful  food 
supply  to  the  U.S.  population. 

Human  volunteers  are  studied  under  controlled  conditions  of  a  metabolic  research  ward  or  as  free-hving 
individuals  to  determine  mineral  element  requirements  and  factors  that  influence  requirements  including 
interactions  among  nutrients,  and  between  nutrients  and  non-nutrients  that  influence  nutrient 
bioavailabihty  and  utilization.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Folic  acid  supplements  of  400  fig  every  other  day  reduced  urinary  zinc  excretion  by  50  percent  and 
increased  fecal  zinc  losses  in  young  men  fed  a  diet  marginal  in  zinc.  This  suggests  that  high  dietary  folic 
acid  in  relation  to  zinc  impairs  zinc  absorption.  Additional  collaborative  studies  with  pregnant  women 
indicated  that  high  blood  folate  and  low  plasma  zinc  were  related  to  an  increased  risk  of  complications  at 
delivery. 

Made  advances  in  sweat  collection  methods.  With  the  advances,  showed  that  whole  body  sweat  losses  of 
zinc  are  a  significant  percentage  of  total  zinc  loss.  Additionally,  zinc  loss  in  sweat  declines  with  time 
during  zinc  depletion.  This  suggests  a  homeostatic  role  for  sweat  in  regulating  zinc  metabolism.  These 
observations  indicate  that  zinc  lost  in  sweat  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  human  zinc 
requirements.  Also  showed  that  surface  losses  of  copper  of  1-6  percent  of  dietary  intake  may  not  be 
important  for  copper  homeostasis. 

Developed  a  method  for  the  separation  of  platelets,  mononucleated  white  cells,  polynucleated  white  cells, 
and  red  blood  cells  on  a  discontinuous  Percoll  gradient.  Apparent  zinc  content  of  the  white  cell  fractions 
was  dependent  upon  degree  of  separation  from  platelets.  Subsequent  studies  with  rats  fed  a  severely 
zinc-deficient  diet,  and  women  fed  a  diet  marginal  in  zinc,  indicated  no  changes  in  the  zinc  content  of 
blood  cellular  components.  The  findings  suggest  that  zinc  in  blood  cellular  components  is  not  a  good 
indicator  of  zinc  status.  A  procedure  for  measuring  the  manganese  and  copper  content  of  blood  cells, 
using  graphite  furnace  atomic  absorption  spectrophotometry  with  Zeeman  background  correction,  was 
developed.  Erythrocytes  accounted  for  about  66  percent  of  the  total  manganese  in  whole  blood,  whereas 
the  "buffy  coat"  (platelets  and  leukocytes)  accounted  for  about  30  percent.  Because  the  "buffy  coat" 
components  turn  over  more  rapidly  than  do  erythrocytes,  their  manganese  content  may  be  a  better 
indicator  of  manganese  status.

Developed  an  isocratic  HPLC  procedure  for  the  separation  and  measurement  of  retinol  (vitamin  A),  a- 
tocopherol  (vitamin  E),  lycopene,  a-carotene,  and  /3-carotene,  extracted  from  plasma.  The  small  sample 
size,  sunphcity  of  extraction,  short  run  time,  accuracy,  and  reproducibihty  of  the  method  make  it  ideal  for 
use  in  either  a  clinical  or  research  setting. 

Found  that  ethanol  metaboHsm  was  significantly  impaired  in  postmenopausal  women  fed  a  diet  containing 
2.6  mg  Zn/day  for  4  months.  The  impairment  seemed  to  be  corrected  within  1  month  upon  feeding 
adequate  zinc.  Plasma  zinc  and  key  zinc-containing  enzymes  were  maintained  throughout  the  low  zinc 
intake  period,  either  by  strong  homeostatic  mechanisms  or  by  shifting  body  pools  of  zinc.  This  suggests 
that  functional  aspects  of  zinc  biochemistry,  such  as  ethanol  metabohsm,  may  be  more  sensitive  indicators 
of  zinc  nutriture  and  stores  than  circulating  amounts  of  zinc. 

A  metabohc  study  with  women  fed  a  diet  containing  0.67  mg  copper/day  and  1.5  g  ascorbic  acid/day 
indicated  that  cytochrome  c  oxidase  in  platelets  and  white  cells,  and  the  specific  enzymatic  activity  of 
ceruloplasmin,  may  be  more  sensitive  indicators  of  copper  status  than  plasma  copper  or  erythrocyte 
superoxide  dismutase.  Qjntrary  to  studies  with  laboratory  animals,  ascorbic  acid  supplements  for  6  weeks 
did  not  markedly  affect  commonly  measured  mdices  of  copper  metabohsm  except  for  the  specific 
enzymatic  activity  of  ceruloplasmin. 

Indices  of  iron  status  were  evaluated  in  young  women  as  they  were  being  depleted  of  iron  through  low 
iron  intake  and  phlebotomy.  The  relative  sensitivities  of  different  indices  for  detecting  iron  depletion 
were  as  follows:  ferritin  >  percent  transferrin  saturation  >  plasma  iron  >  hemoglobin  >  zinc 
protoporphyrin  and  erythrocyte  protoporphryn.  Changes  in  heme  synthesis  evidently  do  not  occur  until 
iron  stores  are  depleted  and  conversely,  during  iron  repletion  hematopoiesis  must  be  satisfied  before  iron 
stores,  as  reflected  by  serum  ferritin,  increase.  These  findings  indicate  that  one  index  of  iron  status  is  of 
limited  value  for  detecting  iron  depletion.  The  use  of  two  or  more  abnormal  indices  would  better  predict 
iron  depletion.

Dietary  Interactions  and  Required  Nutrient  Intakes  Laboratory 
Mission 

To  investigate  human  dietary  requirements  for  trace  elements,  especially  iron  and  zinc.  This  includes 
assessing  the  effects  of  marginal  dietary  intakes  and  the  influence  of  dietary  interactions  on  nutrient 
bioavailabihty.  The  nutrient  content  of  diets  is  assessed  by  using  computer-based  nutrient  data.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Demonstrated  that  rats  fed  marginal  dietary  iron  had  normal  blood  hemoglobin,  low  hver  iron  stores,  and 
reduced  spontaneous  24-hour  activity. 

Demonstrated  that  zinc  requirements  increase  with  increased  dietary  protein  intake  and  that  higher 
protein  intakes  result  in  greater  bone  zinc  concentration  in  growing  rats. 

Determined  that  approximately  one-fourth  of  the  zinc  in  a  representative  U.S.  diet  is  absorbed. 

Demonstrated  that  ascorbic  acid  supplements  improve  ongomg  iron  absorption  and  retention  in  iron- 
depleted  women  consuming  a  diet  with  poorly  available  iron.  This  was  the  first  demonstration  that 
ascorbic  acid  can  improve  iron  retention  from  a  whole  diet  rather  than  just  single  meals. 

Demonstrated  that  iron  from  soybean  hulls  is  absorbed  by  humans  as  well  as  iron  from  bakery  grade 
ferrous  sulfate.  Soybean  hulls  could  be  an  economical  and  nutritious  iron  source  for  partial  enrichment 
of  bakery  products. 

Using  the  rat  model,  found  that  zinc  availabihty  from  a  variety  of  foods  correlated  with  the  amount  of 
protein  and  several  amino  acids,  but  not  the  amount  of  phytic  acid  in  the  foods. 

Developed  a  model  demonstrating  that  zinc  absorption  by  rats  from  a  test  meal  is  proportional  to  the 
natural  log  of  the  meal  zinc  content  and  the  reciprocal  of  the  usual  dietary  zinc  concentration;  the 
greatest  effects  of  zinc  status  on  absorption  are  seen  when  low  doses  of  zinc  are  used.

Trace  Elements  and  Cardiovascular  Health  Laboratory 
Mission 

To  define  the  effects  of  copper  deprivation  on  the  cardiovascular  system.  The  effects  of  copper 
deprivation  on  organs,  hormones,  and  other  metaboUtes  that  regulate  cardiovascular  physiology  will  also 
be  studied.  These  studies  will  provide  information  useful  in  the  definition  of  copper  requirements.  The 
effects  of  commonly  consumed  chemicals,  both  nutritive  and  non-nutritive,  on  copper  requirements  will 
be  determined.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

AccompHshments  iuclude  the  following  findings: 

Copper  deficiency  lowers  the  activity  of  enzymes  that  affect  cholesterol  metabolism.  Plasma 
lecithin  xholesterol  acyltransf erase  and  lipoprotein  lipase  activities  were  decreased  in  plasma  of  copper- 
deficient  rats.  As  low  activities  of  these  enzymes  lead  to  higher  concentrations  of  plasma  cholesterol, 
these  findmgs,  which  have  been  confirmed  by  others,  may  explain  partially  the  hypercholesterolemia  of 
copper  deficiency. 

Copper  deficiency  impairs  glucose  metabohsm.  Copper-deficient  rats  had  increased  glycosylated 
hemoglobin,  an  indicator  of  elevated  plasma  glucose. 

Clofibrate,  a  lipid-lowering  drug,  improves  copper  nutriture.  Clofibrate  will  lessen  the 
hypercholesterolemia  of  copper  deficiency.  The  effect  is  mediated  by  an  iucrease  in  liver  copper.  This 
observation  led  to  the  concept  of  cholesterotropic  and  cuprotropic  chemicals.  Some  of  these— for 
example,  aspirin,  clofibrate,  and  sodium  phytate— lower  plasma  cholesterol  and  enhance  copper 
metabolism.  Others— for  example,  ascorbic  acid,  cholesterol  plus  cholic  acid,  and  zinc— raise  plasma 
cholesterol  and  inhibit  copper  metabolism.  Extra  dietary  copper  can  abolish  the  hypercholesterolemia 
caused  by  feeding  cholesterol  plus  cholic  acid.  Since  1924,  cholesterol  plus  cholic  acid  have  been  fed  to 
animals  to  induce  atherosclerosis.  This  procedure  induces  copper  deficiency  in  rats.    Cholesterol  fed  to 
rabbits  without  cholic  acid  lowers  liver  copper  and  may  induce  copper  deficiency.  This  method  has  been 
used  since  1913  in  the  induction  of  atherosclerosis. 

Hypercholesterolemia  and  impaired  glucose  tolerance  have  been  induced  in  men  by  feeding  a  low  copper 
diet.  Prolonged  ingestion  of  a  diet  containing  0.8  mg  of  copper  per  day  produced  reversible  increases  in 


14 


plasma  cholesterol  and  the  height  of  the  glucose  tolerance  curve.  Hypercholesterolemia,  glucose 
intolerance,  and  diets  this  low  in  copper  are  common  in  the  U.S.  population. 

Copper  deficiency  induces  atrial  thrombosis.  For  approximately  20  years,  the  adverse  effects  of  certain 
diets  on  mice  were  attributed  to  the  diets  being  high  in  fat.  In  reality,  copper  had  been  left  out  of  the 
diets.  Adequate  copper  prevented  abnormal  blood  clottmg  and  abnormal  cardiograms  and  promoted  far 
greater  longevity.  This  finding  is  similar  to  an  earher  experiment  in  which  a  diet  high  in  cholesterol  had 
little  effect  on  mice  if  dietary  copper  was  adequate. 

Abnormal  electrocardiograms  and  hypercholesterolemia  may  be  more  sensitive  indices  of  copper 
deficiency  than  anemia.  Among  nonanemic  rats  deficient  in  copper,  abnormahties  were  found  in  the 
following  (in  order,  beginning  with  greatest  change):  liver  iron,  heart  dopamine,  liver  copper,  plasma 
cholesterol,  heart  weight,  and  heart  norepinephrine. 

Copper  deficiency  produces  abnormal  cardiac  anatomy.  Mitochondrial  membranes  deteriorated  in  hearts 
of  rats  deficient  in  copper;  debris  and  vacuoles  were  seen.  The  collagen  fibers  that  hold  the  cardiac 
muscle  cells  together  were  poorly  developed.    The  activity  of  choline  phosphotransferase  was  decreased 
in  copper  deficiency;  this  change  may  partially  explain  some  of  the  anatomical  changes  noted. 

The  original  observation  (1973)  Unking  copper  metabolism  and  cholesterol  metaboHsm  has  been 
confirmed  in  at  least  15  independent  laboratories.  This  paper  is  among  the  more  frequently  quoted  from 
the  American  Journal  of  CHnical  Nutrition  and  was  the  subject  of  a  Citation  Classic  essay  in  Current 
Contents. 

Adult  rats  deficient  in  copper  are  hypertensive;  this  new  observation  has  already  been  confirmed.  The 
decreased  blood  pressure  of  weanling  rats  made  deficient  in  copper  may  be  caused  partly  by  decreased 
activity  of  angiotensin  converting  enzyme  in  plasma  in  addition  to  structural  defects  of  heart  and  arteries. 

A  new  way  of  explaining  the  clinical  variability  of  specific  human  illnesses  has  been  developed.  Four 
classes  of  etiologic  agents-toxicity,  heredity,  infection,  and  deficiency— are  known.  Illnesses  that  are 
caused  by  cooperating  members  of  two  classes  have  been  identified—for  example,  nutritional  deficiency 
induced  by  a  toxic  agent.  Three-  and  four-way  cooperations  also  exist;  15  cooperative  mechanisms  have 
been  identified. 

Kidneys  of  rats  fed  salt  and  deficient  in  copper  fail  with  poor  perfusion  of  blood  and  very  large  (greater 
than  90  percent)  decrease  in  aldosterone  and  plasma  renin.  Kidney  failure  was  produced  with  half  the 
salt  in  half  the  time  in  comparison  to  classical  experiments. 

Electroencephalograms  were  studied  in  experiments  similar  to  those  that  demonstrated  adverse  effects  of 
copper  deficiency  on  electrocardiograms.  Copper  deficiency  produced  a  shift  to  higher  frequency 
response  and  a  shift  to  more  dominance  of  the  right  half  of  the  brain. 

Rats  fed  a  diet  deficient  in  copper  were  given  either  beer  or  water  to  drink  because  of  extensive  data 
demonstrating  that  modest  consumption  of  beer  is  associated  with  less  death  from  heart  disease  than  is 
abstinence  from  alcoholic  beverages.  Beer  drinking  rats  hve  nearly  six  times  as  long  with  less  heart 
damage  and  higher  liver  copper.  Results  were  not  from  either  the  alcohol  or  the  copper  in  beer;  rather, 
animals  absorbed  and  retained  copper  better. 

Slight  copper  deficiency  was  induced  in  young  pigs  by  feeding  their  mothers  high  doses  of  zinc  during 
pregnancy;  the  normal  conversion  of  cartilage  into  bone  during  development  was  retarded. 


15 


Both  copper  deficiency  and  the  psychological  stress  of  intermittent,  close  confinement  increased  the  blood 
pressure  of  adult  rats.  Rats  low  in  copper  with  stress  had  the  highest  blood  pressures.  Copper  deficiency 
increased  the  sodium  in  hearts. 

Diets  in  the  United  States  seem  to  be  low  in  copper  in  comparison  to  putative  requirements;  35  percent 
of  daily  diets  probably  contain  less  than  1.0  mg  copper.  Diets  containing  amounts  of  copper  proved 
insufficient  for  volunteers  in  controlled  experiments  are  readily  available  to  the  U.S.  population.  A 
unified  theory  is  proposed  that  explains  the  high  prevalence  of  ischemic  heart  disease  in  terms  of  dietary 
copper  deficiency.  Copper  deficiency  may  induce  this  illness  by  weakening  the  connective  tissue  of 
arteries  which  are  bathed  in  abnormal  hpids  and  are  under  greater  tension  from  high  blood  pressure. 
Arterial  injury  may  be  increased  by  decreased  defense  against  oxidizing  metabohtes  and  by  glycosylation 
of  proteins.  These  changes  result  in  abnormal  cardiac  physiology. 

More  than  60  similarities  between  animals  deficient  in  copper  and  people  with  ischemic  heart  disease 
have  been  identified.  The  most  important  of  these  are  glucose  intolerance,  hypercholesterolemia, 
abnormal  electrocardiograms,  hyperuricemia,  hypertension,  and  the  differential  susceptibiUty  of  males  and 
females.

Nutrition,  Biochemistry,  and  Metabolism 


Mission 

The  Nutrition,  Biochemistry,  and  Metabolism  Research  Unit  plans,  implements,  and  interprets 
biochemical  and  metabolic  studies  with  humans  and  animals  that  provide  insights  into  the  reasons  for  the 
essentiahty  of  various  trace  elements  and  that  show  conditions  under  which  regulation  of  metabolism  is 
perturbed.  This  provides  information  about  situations  in  which  the  trace  element  content  of  the  diet  may 
be  of  concern.  Research  in  this  unit  seeks  to  elucidate  the  metabohsm  of  the  mineral  elements,  including 
the  effects  of  mineral  element  deficiencies  and  excesses  on  other  metabolites  and  the  utilization  of  other 
nutrients;  to  define  the  effects  of  commonly  ingested  nutritive  and  non-nutritive  materials  on  the 
metabolism  of  mineral  elements;  and  to  identify  functional  changes  and/or  adaptive  mechanisms  affecting 
responses  to  mineral  elements.  Research  in  this  unit  includes  the  role  of  copper  in  cell  membrane 
function,  the  role  of  zinc  in  regulation  of  blood  pressure  and  male  reproductive  function,  homeostatic 
adjustments  to  changes  in  dietary  zinc  and  in  manganese,  and  the  possible  essentiahty  of  certain  elements 
such  as  boron  and  arsenic.

Absorption  and  Homeostasis  of  Trace  Elements  Laboratory 
Mission 

To  study  factors  affecting  the  absorption,  retention  and  utilization  of  trace  elements  from  food  and  diets 
and  the  homeostatic  regulation  of  trace  element  metabolism,  and  to  determine  how  these  factors  affect 
human  nutrient  requirements.  This  work  includes  development  of  methodology  for  using  stable  isotopes 
in  human  studies  and  studies  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  trace  element  absorption  and  excretion  occur. 
Studies  in  experimental  animals  (mainly  rats)  are  used  as  preliminaries  to  studies  in  humans  or  to  study 
factors  that  are  inaccessible  in  humans.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Found  that  Zn-65  incorporated  intrinsically  into  beef  is  absorbed  the  same  as  Zn-65  added  extrinsically  to 
beef  when  the  beef  was  fed  as  a  hamburger  with  potatoes  and  a  milkshake. 

Found  that  manganese  absorption  in  rats  decreases  as  dietary  manganese  increases.  The  rate  of 
manganese  turnover  differs  depending  on  whether  Mn-55  is  administered  orally  or  by  injection. 

Found  that  previous  diet,  which  affected  body  zinc  stores  in  rats,  could  affect  zinc  absorption  and 
excretion;  this  effect  occurred  in  addition  to  any  effect  of  the  current  diet. 


20 


Developed  an  isotope  dilution  method  for  measurement  of  Cu  absorption  and  endogenous  excretion  by 
rats.  Used  this  method  to  measure  Cu  absorption  and  excretion  in  rats  fed  starch,  glucose,  fructose,  and 
sucrose.  Rats  fed  starch  absorbed  significantly  more  Cu  than  those  fed  the  sugars. 

Determined  that  injection  of  stable  isotope  Cu-65  into  stems  of  wheat  produces  intrinsically  labeled  wheat 
which  is  physiologically  the  same  as  wheat  with  Cu  incorporated  through  normal  growth  processes. 
Produced  wheat,  peanuts,  and  geese  labeled  intrinsically  with  Cu-65  for  use  in  human  studies. 

Found  that  Cu-65  added  intrinsically  or  extrinsically  to  wheat,  goose  meat,  goose  liver,  or  peanut  butter  is 
absorbed  equally  from  a  typical  American  meal. 

Found  that  women  fed  low  Mn  diets  ( ~  1  mg/day)  had  greater  menstrual  losses  of  Mn,  Fe,  and  total 
hemoglobin  than  women  fed  5.5  mg  Mn/day.  Dietary  supplementation  with  Ca  (1,200  mg  Ca/day)  did  not 
affect  Mn  absorption  or  turnover. 

Found  that  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  ^''Mn  tracers  are  absorbed  the  same  from  plant  foods  when  eaten  by 
humans. 

Found  that  dietary  protein  source  does  not  significantly  affect  Mn  bioavailability  in  rats. 

Validated  methodology  for  measuring  Zn  absorption  and  endogenous  excretion  in  humans  using  stable 
isotopes,  and  developed  method  for  measuring  exchangeable  Zn  pools. 

Found  that  12-week-old  infants  absorb  Zn  and  Cu  more  efficiently  from  breast  milk  than  from  infant 
formula,  but  net  absorption  of  both  Zn  and  Cu  is  greater  from  formula  because  of  its  higher  mineral 
content. 

Found  variable  boron  isotope  ratios  in  commercial  produce. 

Found  that  foliar  or  hydroponically  grown  broccoH  or  cabbage  can  be  intrinsically  enriched  with  boron-10 
to  levels  needed  for  absorption  studies  in  rats  and  humans. 

An  extrinsic/intrinsic  boron  study  showed  that  fecal  and  urine  boron  isotope  ratios  show  large  changes,  as 
measured  by  ICP-MS,  and  represents  the  first  reported  animal  tracer  study. 

Found  that  meat  and  meat-products  increase  nonheme  iron  absorption  and  the  factor  involved  appears  to 
be  saturated  fats. 

Found  that  most  zinc  in  bihary/pancreatic  secretions  is  associated  with  carboxypeptidase  zymogens,  active 
enzymes  or  proteolytic  fragments  and  a  small  amount  of  zinc  is  associated  with  small  peptides  not 
associated  with  carboxypeptidase. 

A  ^''Mn  kinetics  model  has  been  developed  from  rat  data,  and  a  reduced  version  of  that  model  is  now 
being  used  to  examine  the  kinetics  of  ^''Mn  in  humans. 

Found  that  copper  absorption  and  rate  of  turnover  differ  between  men  and  women  and  that  these  effects 
differ  in  young  and  older  adults. 

Found  that  the  minimum  dietary  Zn  requirement  for  young  men,  estimated  factorially,  is  about  2  mg/day.

Cell  Membrane  Biochemistry  Laboratory 


Mission 

To  determine  the  trace  element  requirements  for  maintaining  normal  biochemical  functions  of  cell 
membranes.  Emphasis  on  understanding  the  biochemical  roles  of  copper  and  iron  in  maintaining  cellular 
functions  that  are  related  to  cell  membranes.  These  functions  include  transmembrane  signaUng,  cell 
proliferation,  and  cell  differentiation.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Demonstrated  that  copper  deficiency  increases  the  amount  of  a  170,000  dalton  protein  in  erythrocyte 
membranes.  This  protein  is  associated  with  the  cytoskeleton  and  indicates  that  copper  may  be  essential 
for  maintaining  normal  cytoskeletal  structure  and  function  in  blood  cells. 

Demonstrated  that  interactions  between  cytoskeletal  proteins  in  platelets  following  thrombin  activation 
are  affected  by  copper  status.  When  compared  to  rats  fed  adequate  copper,  myosin  association  with  the 
cytoskeleton  and  actin  polymerization  following  thrombin  activation  are  enhanced  in  platelets  from  rats 
fed  a  copper-deficient  diet. 

Found  that  dense  granule  secretion  from  thrombin-activated  platelets  is  increased  twofold  by  copper 
deficiency  in  rats.  This  hypersecretory  response  is  apparently  related  to  changes  in  the  manner  by  which 
signals  are  processed  by  the  protein  kinase  c-dependent  signaling  pathway.  The  specific  defect  may 
involve  either  depressed  protein  kinase  c  activity  or  impaired  activation  of  this  enzyme  following  platelet 
stimulation  with  thrombin.  Also  found  that  the  mobilization  of  intracellular  calcium  following  thrombin 
activation  and  a  thrombin-independent  calcium  transport  mechanism  are  both  impaired  in  platelets  by 
copper  deficiency.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Co-produced  the  first  evidence  that  boron  has  an  essential  physiological  role  in  the  chick.  In  the  chick, 
dietary  boron  affects  several  physiological  indices  including  growth,  tibial  epiphysial  growth  plate 
calcification,  and  serum  glucose.  Previously,  boron  was  considered  essential  only  for  plants. 

Demonstrated  that  the  effects  of  dietary  boron  on  various  morphological  and  biochemical  indices  are 
modified  by  the  dietary  concentrations  of  magnesium,  calcium,  and  cholecalciferol.  In  the  cholecalciferol- 
deficient  chick,  supplemental  dietary  boron  enhances  growth  at  the  expense  of  cartilage  calcification  when 
dietary  magnesium  is  inadequate  and  slows  growth  to  the  benefit  of  calcification  when  dietary  magnesium 
is  adequate. 

Identified  a  fivefold  range  of  boron  intake  that  is  beneficial  to  the  cholecalciferol-deficient  chick.  A  study 
with  chicks  indicated  that  optimum  intake  is  about  1  fig  B/g  of  dry  diet.  Further  increases  in 
supplemental  dietary  boron  apparently  overwhelm  homeostatic  controls. 

Provided  the  first  evidence  that  boron  helps  regulate  energy  metabolism  in  the  rat.  In  the  cholecalciferol- 
deficient  rat,  supplemental  dietary  boron  markedly  influenced  key  indicators  of  energy  metabohsm  by 
decreasing  plasma  concentrations  of  creatine  kinase,  insulin,  and  pyruvate,  and  by  increasing  plasma 
concentrations  of  thyroxine.

Provided  the  first  evidence  that  boron  protects  the  integrity  of  kidney  function/structure  from  acute  phase 
nephrotoxin-induced  damage.  Rats  injected  24  hours  previously  with  streptozotocin  exhibited  an 
abnormal  elevation  of  total  24-hour  urinary  albumin,  potassium,  and  sodium;  supplemental  dietary  boron 
alleviated  the  abnormal  elevations.  However,  the  protective  influence  of  supplemental  dietary  boron  was 
apparently  overwhelmed  with  time;  48  hours  after  injection,  compared  to  boron-deprived  controls,  the 
rats  supplemented  with  dietary  boron  exhibited  increased  urinary  excretion  of  those  substances. 

Developed  a  new  low-temperature,  wet-ashing  method  for  use  in  boron  analysis  of  biological  tissues  and 
fluids  and  foodstuffs.  This  method  minimizes  the  loss  of  boron  from  the  sample  through  volatilization. 
Volatilization  is  a  significant  problem  in  boron  analysis  methodology. 

Determined  that  the  daily  intake  of  boron  usually  differs  considerably  between  any  two  individuals  by 
analyzing  a  variety  of  typical  Western  foods  and  personal  care  products.  The  concentration  of  boron  in 
water  varies  considerably  according  to  geographical  source;  at  some  locations  the  boron  in  drinking  water 
and  water-based  beverages  may  account  for  most  of  the  total  dietary  boron  intake.  Individual  food 
preference  greatly  influences  daily  intake  of  boron;  fruits,  vegetables,  tubers,  and  legumes  have  relatively 
much  higher  concentrations  of  boron  than  cereal  grains  or  animal  tissues  and  fluids.  Also,  boron  is  a 
significant  contaminant  of,  or  major  ingredient  of,  many  different  personal  care  products. 

Demonstrated  that  inadequate  zinc  nutriture  during  infancy,  despite  postlactational  zinc  repletion, 
induced  imbalances  in  adult  bone  mineral  metabolism  when  compared  to  zinc-adequate,  pair-fed  rat  pups. 
At  150  days  of  age,  zinc-deficient  rat  pups  exhibited  increased  concentrations  of  bone  phosphorus  and 
magnesium  and  decreased  concentrations  of  bone  potassium. 

Demonstrated  that  short-term  zinc  depletion  (35  days)  in  humans  affects  several  aspects  of  andrology, 
especially  seminal  volume.  Compared  to  when  they  were  consuming  10.4  mg  Zn/day,  volunteers 
consuming  1.4  mg  Zn/day  exhibited  decreased  semen  volumes  and  serum  testosterone  concentrations,  but 
no  change  in  seminal  zinc  concentrations.  Treatments  of  1.4,  2.5,  and  3.4  mg  Zn/day  decreased  the  total 
semen  zinc  loss  per  ejaculate.  Seminal  loss  accounted  for  9  percent  of  total  body  zinc  loss  when  1.4  mg 
zinc  was  consumed  per  day.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Our  laboratory  is  studying  the  involvement  of  zinc  (Zn)  in  the  metabolism  of  certain  peptide  hormones. 
Zinc  is  a  cofactor  for  many  of  the  enzymes  that  either  synthesize  or  degrade  many  of  the  active  peptides. 
Angiotensin  converting  enzyme  (ACE),  which  converts  a  nonactive  peptide,  angiotensin  I,  into  a  very 
potent  vasoactive  peptide,  angiotensin  II,  is  affected  by  Zn  nutriture.  This  enzyme  is  important  in  the 
regulation  of  blood  pressure  in  all  animals,  including  humans.  It  is  also  important  in  reproduction  in  the 
male  because  it  is  found  in  very  high  concentration  in  the  testes  and  sperm.  We  find  that  in  the  Zn- 
deficient  rat,  blood  pressure  is  lowered  and,  if  the  deficiency  is  begun  before  puberty,  the  testes  do  not 
mature. 

Our  latest  research  has  focused  on  the  effect  of  Zn  deficiency  on  ACE  synthesis  in  the  testes.  We  have 
isolated  pure  ACE  from  normal,  mature  rat  testes  by  affinity  chromatography  and  used  it  to  produce  high 
titer  antibodies  in  rabbits.  We  have  developed  an  enzyme  linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  to  detect 
minute  quantities  of  this  protein.  Using  this  assay,  we  recently  found  that  Zn  deficiency  also  decreases 
the  ACE  protein  concentration  in  testes.  Tlaere  was  a  direct  correlation  between  enzyme  activity  and 
enzyme  protein  concentration.  The  next  step  is  to  determine  if  Zn  deficiency  affects  the  tissue 
concentration  of  ACE  mRNA. 

Endothelial  cells  Une  the  vascular  system.  They  have  abundant  ACE,  and  those  of  the  lung  and  kidney 
are  thought  to  be  involved  with  the  renin-angiotensin-system  that  regulates  blood  pressure.  We  have 
successfully  grown  endothelial  cells  in  culture  and  have  attempted  to  show  an  effect  of  media  Zn 
deficiency  on  ACE  activity.  Because  it  appears  that  endothehal  cells  require  very  httle  Zn  in  the  media 
to  grow,  we  turned  our  attention  to  how  this  cell  type  might  handle  Zn.  Recently,  D.J.  Bobilya,  a 


31 


research  associate  in  our  lab,  published  some  elegant  work  describing  the  kinetics  of  Zn  transport  and 
some  characteristics  of  the  transporter.  This  work  will  further  our  understanding  of  Zn  metabolism  ia 
this  as  well  as  other  cell  types.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Produced  the  first  evidence  suggesting  that  nickel  has  an  essential  role  in  animals.  Showed  that  nickel 
influences  iron  metabohsm  through  physiologic,  pharmacologic,  and  toxicologic  mechanisms.  Also 
showed  that  vitamin  B12  and  biotin  status,  and  luxuriant  amounts  of  an  odd-chain  fatty  acid  (margaric 
acid),  in  the  diet  affects  the  response  of  rats  to  nickel  deprivation.  These  findings  suggest  that  vitamin  B^ 
may  be  necessary  for  the  optimal  expression  of  the  biologic  role  of  nickel,  and  this  role  affects  metabolic 
pathways  involving  vitamin  B12  and  biotin.  Because  of  this,  nickel  nutriture  affects  fat  and  methionine  or 
sulfur  amino  acid  metabohsm.  Thus,  nickel  might  be  of  nutritional  significance. 


34 


Co-produced  the  first  evidence  that  boron  is  an  essential  nutrient  for  animals.  Signs  of  boron  deficiency 
were  found  to  vary  in  nature  and  severity  as  diets  varied  in  content  of  substances  that  affect  macro 
mineral  metabolism~for  example,  calcium,  potassium,  and  magnesium.  Findings  to  date  indicate  that 
boron  deprivation  alters  the  function  or  composition  of  the  skeleton,  kidney,  and  brain.  Prior  to  these 
findings,  boron  was  considered  essential  only  for  plants.  The  findings  established  boron  as  an  element  to 
be  considered  in  human  nutrition. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  showing  that  boron  may  be  nutritionally  important  for  humans.  Findings 
were  obtained  which  indicated  that  the  supplementation  of  a  boron-low  diet  with  an  amount  of  boron 
commonly  found  in  diets  high  in  fruits  and  vegetables  induces  in  postmenopausal  women  changes 
consistent  with  the  prevention  of  calcium  loss  and  bone  demineralization.  Also,  boron  was  found  to 
enhance  and  to  mimic  some  of  the  effects  of  estrogen  therapy  in  postmenopausal  women.  Boron 
nutriture  may  be  an  important  factor  in  the  occurrence  of  some  of  the  problems  associated  with  the 
postmenopausal  phase  of  life. 

Found  that,  in  humans,  boron  deprivation  reduces  blood  hemoglobin  concentration,  mean  corpuscular 
hemoglobin  concentration  and  mean  corpuscular  hemoglobin,  and  increases  hematocrit,  red  blood  cell 
count,  and  platelet  count.  The  findings  are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  boron  affects  membrane 
function,  and  thus  indirectly  affects  many  variables,  including  those  associated  with  erythropoiesis  and 
hematopoiesis. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  suggesting  that  arsenic  is  an  essential  trace  element.  Demonstrated  that 
dietary  methionine  and  arginine  markedly  affect  the  response  of  chicks  to  arsenic  deprivation.  Also 
showed  that  arsenic  deprivation  in  rats  and  chicks  is  affected  by  dietary  manipulations  affecting  labile 
methyl  metabolism.  Produced  the  first  evidence  that  arsenic  deprivation  decreases  the  concentration  of 
liver  polyamines  in  rats.  The  findings  indicate  that  arsenic  is  important  physiologically  as  a  methylated 
compound  or  is  involved  in  labile  methyl  metabolism.  The  findings  should  help  in  defining  the  essential 
role  of  arsenic  and  in  determining  whether  arsenic  is  a  practical  human  nutrition  concern. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  that  dietary  vanadium  deprivation  affects  thyroid  function  of  the  rats. 
Vanadium  deprivation  elevates  thyroid  weight  and  depresses  the  activity  of  thyroid  peroxidase.  The 
findings  suggest  that  vanadium  might  be  essential  for  optimal  thyroid  function  or  thyroid  hormone 
metabolism.  However,  findings  were  obtained  which  indicate  that  vanadium  does  not  directly  affect 
deiodinase  (extrathyroidal)  enzymes.  These  findings  also  should  help  determine  whether  vanadium  is  a 
practical  nutritional  concern  for  animals  including  humans. 

Found  that  both  bone  turnover  and  bone  formation  as  indicated  by  acid  and  alkaline  phosphatase  in 
femurs  are  depressed  in  animals  fed  inadequate  silicon.  Also,  calcium-45  uptake  by  ectopic  bone  in  rats 
is  decreased  by  silicon  deprivation.  Silicon  apparently  is  necessary  for  normal  bone  metabolism. 

Demonstrated  that  genetic  factors,  sex,  and  dietary  sulfur  amino  acids  markedly  affect  the  nature  and 
severity  of  the  signs  of  copper  deficiency  in  rats  and  humans.  The  findings  indicate  that  the  signs  of 
copper  deficiency  in  humans  are  not  likely  to  be  consistent  and  have  implications  for  the  hypothesis  that 
copper  nutriture  affects  cardiovascular  health. 

Showed  for  the  first  time  that  experimentally  significant  effects  other  than  on  urinary  magnesium  can  be 
obtained  by  the  dietary  restriction  of  magnesium  in  otherwise  healthy  adults.  Magnesium  deprivation 
apparently  adversely  affects  the  erythrocyte  membrane,  changes  indices  associated  with  bone  metabolism 
and  causes  heart  rhythm  abnormalities.  Magnesium  may  be  of  more  nutritional  concern  than  currently 
acknowledged.

Nutrition,  Physiology,  and  Behavior 


Mission 

The  Nutrition,  Physiology,  and  Behavior  Management  Unit  plans,  implements,  and  interprets  research 
that  is  designed  to  produce  new  knowledge  about  human  nutrient  requirements  with  an  emphasis  on  trace 
elements.  The  research  will  identify  human  needs  necessary  for  achievement  of  optimal  physiologic  and 
psychological  function  and  performance  based  on  genetic  potentials  throughout  the  life  cycle,  and  provide 
information  for  decisions  concerning  the  provision  of  a  healthful  food  supply  to  the  population  of  the 
United  States. 

Animal  models  are  used  to  provide  information  useful  in  planning  studies  with  human  volunteers, 
including  safety,  new  analytical  methods,  and  demonstration  of  the  usefulness  of  measuring  previously 
ignored  characteristics  and  responses.  Information  provided  by  the  animal  models  will  be  used  to 
elucidate  the  metabohsm  of  the  mineral  elements,  including  the  effects  of  mineral  element  deficiencies 
and  excesses  on  other  nutrients  and  to  identify  functional  changes  and/or  adaptive  mechanisms  affecting 
responses  to  mineral  nutrients.  Research  on  animals  provides  the  background  for  human  studies  by 
investigating  hypotheses  in  ways  that  would  be  inappropriate  for  humans. 

Human  volunteers  are  studied  under  controlled  conditions  of  a  metabolic  research  ward  or  as  free-hving 
individuals  to  determine  the  effects  of  graded  trace  element  intakes  on  physiologic  and  psychological 
function  and  performance  in  response  to  static  and  dynamic  stressors  and  challenges.  The  responses  are 
evaluated  and  compared  with  standard  and  new  biochemical  indices  of  trace  element  status  to  identify 
impairments  in  function  and  performance.  This  information  is  necessary  to  determine  previously 
unrecognized  metabolic  roles  of  essential  and  other  trace  elements.

Recent  Researcli  Accomplishments 

Developed  and  vaHdated  the  tetrapolar  bioelectrical  impedance  method  for  assessing  human  body 
composition.  Models  for  predicting  densitometrically  determined  fat-free  mass  based  upon  conductance 
measurements  of  the  body  were  developed  and  cross-vahdated  in  adults.  The  error  of  estimating  fat-free 
mass  was  within  the  hmits  of  the  reference  method  of  assessing  body  composition.  The  predictive 
accuracy  was  less  than  that  found  by  standard  anthropometric  procedures.  Other  studies  resulted  in  the 
development  and  validation  of  models  using  impedance  measurements  to  estimate  total  body  water  and 
extracellular  water  in  healthy  adults.  These  relationships  were  subsequently  used  to  assess  fluid  changes 
in  surgical  patients. 

Provided  first  evidence  that  copper  status  affects  human  blood  pressure.  Significant  increases  in  systolic 
and  diastolic  blood  pressure  responses  during  five  minutes  of  isometric  hand-grip  exercise  were  exhibited 
by  eight  women  consuming  diets  low  in  copper  (0.65  mg/d)  and  supplemented  with  ascorbic  acid  (1.5  g/d). 
Resting  blood  pressures  were  not  affected  by  low  copper  intake.  These  findings  indicate  a  functional 
alteration  in  human  blood  pressure  regulation  during  mild  copper  depletion. 

Identified  a  unique  biochemical  adaptation  associated  with  aerobic  physical  training.  Significant  increases 
in  a  copper-  and  zinc-containing  enzyme,  superoxide  dismutase,  responsible  for  destruction  of  oxygen 
free-radicals  were  observed  in  male  and  female  collegiate  swimmers  after  a  competitive  season.  No 
changes  were  found  in  age-matched,  non-training  control  subjects.  The  observed  changes  in  the 


43 


swimmers  indicate  a  homeostatic  response  in  copper  metabolism  to  protect  skeletal  muscle  from  oxidative 
damage. 

Developed  and  implemented  a  program  for  the  prescription  of  aerobic  exercise  to  maintain  body 
composition  and  physical  fitness  of  human  volunteers  residing  on  a  metabolic  unit.  Use  of  this  program 
faciUtates  control  of  energy  expenditure  so  that  biochemical  and  physiological  changes  can  be  attributed 
with  confidence  to  altered  micronutrient  intake. 

Demonstrated  that  iron  deficiency  without  overt  anemia  in  humans  is  associated  with  impairments  in 
energy  metaboUsm.  A  reduced  thermogenic  response  during  acute  cold  exposure  and  a  blunted  rate  of 
oxygen  utilization  during  progressive  exercise  to  exhaustion  were  observed  ia  12  women  who  were  made 
iron-deficient  by  a  combination  of  reduced  iron  intake,  phlebotomy,  and  menstruation.  It  is  noteworthy 
that  the  apparent  inability  to  produce  heat  in  the  cold  and  reduced  rate  of  oxygen  uptake  during  work 
were  associated  with  an  increase  in  anaerobic  metabolism.  These  data  indicate  that  iron-dependent 
factors  other  than  oxygen-carrying  capacity  can  influence  body  metabolism. 

Identified  that  zinc  deficiency  impairs  thyroid  hormone  status  in  animals.  Significant  decreases  in 
circulating  thyroid  hormones  are  characteristic  of  severely  zinc-deficient  rats,  particularly  when  the 
animals  are  acutely  exposed  to  cold.  In  moderately  zinc-deficient  rats,  there  is  a  reduction  in  processing 
of  thyrotropin-releasing  hormone  precursor  peptides  in  the  brain  that  may  be  explained  by  reduced 
activity  of  two  zinc-dependent  enzymes.  These  findings  indicate  a  new  biological  role  of  zinc  in  thyroid 
hormone  metabolism.

Recent  Research  Accomplishments 

Demonstrated  that  the  administration  of  antioxidants  to  laboratory  animals,  either  by  feeding  or  injection, 
can  inhibit  the  development  of  cardiac  enlargement,  cardiac  edema,  and  anemia  caused  by  dietary  copper 
deficiency. 

Collaborated  in  a  study  which  showed  that  ethane  production,  an  indicator  of  lipid  peroxidation,  is 
enhanced  when  laboratory  rats  are  fed  a  diet  deficient  in  copper. 

Demonstrated,  in  a  collaborative  study,  that  copper  deficiency  in  rats  enhances  lung  damage  caused  by 
breathing  oxygen  under  high  pressure.  This  further  suggests  that  copper-deficient  animals  are  vulnerable 
to  oxidative  stress. 

Q)llaborated  in  research  showing  that  microvascular  function  in  rats  is  altered  in  copper  deficiency. 
Specifically,  copper  deficiency  enhanced  the  increase  in  microvascular  permeability  caused  by  release  of 
histamine  and  inhibited  adhesion  of  platelets  to  microvessel  walls.  This  suggests  that  inflammation  is 
enhanced  and  hemostatic  (clotting)  function  is  reduced  in  copper  deficiency.  Further  studies  of 
microvascular  function  showed  that,  though  high  blood  cholesterol  depressed  copper  status,  the  effects  on 
inflammation  and  clotting  were  the  opposite  from  those  of  copper  deficiency. 

Found  that  the  aortas  of  copper-deficient  rats  are  less  capable  of  relaxing  in  response  to  agents  which 
require  an  intact  blood  vessel  endothelium  for  their  action.  Demonstrated,  in  a  collaborative  study,  that 
endotheUum-dependent  relaxation  is  also  disrupted  in  the  microcirculation  of  copper-deficient  rats.  This 
suggests  a  mechanism  for  the  development  of  high  blood  pressure  in  copper  deficiency.

Co-produced  a  series  of  studies  illustrating  that  copper  deficiency  causes  alteration  of  renal  composition, 
enzyme  activity,  clearance  function,  and  body  water  retention.  Further,  renal  damage  by  cis-platinum,  an 
anti-tumor  agent  and  nephrotoxin,  is  exaggerated  in  copper  deficiency.  Obtained  evidence  that  cis- 
platinum  acts  by  producing  Oj-derived  free  radicals,  which  suggests  that  copper  deficiency  potentiates  cis- 
platinum  damage  by  reducing  antioxidant  defenses. 

Co-produced  a  study  which  demonstrated  that  mitochondrial  respiration  is  impaired  in  hearts  of  copper- 
deficient  rats.

Recent  Research  Accomplishinents 

Produced  the  first  evidence  that  dietary  boron  may  be  important  for  brain  function  in  animals. 
Electrocorticographic  (EOdG)  data  were  collected  from  100-day-old  male  and  female  rats  fed  either  0.12 
or  2.71  /xg/g  boron  for  approximately  10  weeks.  Low  dietary  boron  decreased  ECoG  activity  in  both  left 
and  right  hemispheres,  particularly  in  the  higher  frequencies,  and  increased  the  proportion  of  lower 
frequency  activity  while  decreasing  the  proportion  of  higher  frequency  activity. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  that  dietary  boron  may  be  important  for  brain  function  in  healthy,  older 
adults.  In  one  study,  electroencephalographic  (EEG)  data  were  collected  from  13  healthy 
postmenopausal  women  fed  either  0.23  or  3.23  mg/d  boron  as  part  of  a  6-month  metabolic  unit  study. 
Low  dietary  boron  increased  low-frequency  EEG  activity  in  parietal  and  left  occipital  regions  of  the  head 
and  increased  the  proportion  of  lower  to  higher  frequency  activity,  primarily  in  the  frontal  regions.  In  a 
second  study,  EEG  data  were  collected  from  10  healthy  women  (9  postmenopausal)  and  5  healthy  men 
older  than  45  years  fed  either  0.23  or  3.23  mg/d  boron  as  part  of  a  4-month  free-living  community  study. 
Low  dietary  boron  decreased  EEG  activity  in  the  higher  frequencies  in  the  anterior  regions  of  the  head 
and  in  the  lower  frequencies  in  the  posterior  regions  and  increased  the  proportion  of  lower  frequency 


52 


activity  while  decreasing  the  proportion  of  higher  frequency  activity.  In  addition,  low  boron  resuhed  in  a 
greater  left-minus-right  hemisphere  asymmetry  in  EEG  activity. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  that  dietary  boron  may  be  important  for  sensory-motor  function  and  cognitive 
performance.  Data  collected  during  the  second  study  described  above  showed  that  the  lower  boron 
intake  resulted  in  impaired  performance  on  tapping,  pursuit,  search,  counting,  and  encoding  tasks. 

Found  that  dietary  calcium  and  manganese  intakes  were  related  to  menstrual  symptomatology  in  10 
healthy  women  with  normal  menstrual  cycles  as  part  of  a  six-month,  hve-in  metaboUc  study.  Diets  were 
fed  in  a  Latin-square,  double-blind  manner  for  39  days  each.  In  contrast  to  when  they  were  fed  1,336  mg 
calcium/2,000  kcal/day,  women  fed  587  mg  calcium  reported  increased  negative  mood,  more  behavioral 
problems,  and  poorer  concentration  throughout  the  menstrual  cycle.  Low  calcium  also  resulted  in  reports 
of  greater  pain  during  the  menstrual  phase  and  increased  water  retention  during  the  premenstrual  phase. 
An  interaction  between  dietary  manganese  (1.0  versus  5.6  mg/2,000  kcal/day)  and  calcium  showed  that, 
despite  the  presence  of  high  dietary  calcium,  low  manganese  intake  resulted  in  increased  negative  mood 
during  the  premenstrual  phase. 

Determined  dietary  zinc  effects  on  cognitive  processes  and  sensory-motor  skills  in  14  healthy  men  as  part 
of  a  7-month,  hve-in  metaboUc  study.  Subjects  were  fed  1,  2,  3,  or  4  mg  zinc/2,500  kcal/day  during  each 
of  four  35 -day  dietary  periods  fed  in  a  random,  double-blind  manner.  When  contrasted  with  performance 
during  a  35-day  control  period  providing  10  mg  zinc,  response  time  and  errors  on  tasks  measuring 
attention,  perception,  memory,  and  spatial  and  sensory-motor  skills  showed  poorer  performance  with 
lower  Zn  intakes.  However,  there  were  few  differences  among  the  low  zinc  periods  to  support  a  "dose" 
effect. 

Found  that  responses  to  a  standardized  self-report  measure  of  mood  states  were  related  to  dietary  intakes 
and  blood  concentrations  of  aluminum,  calcium,  copper,  iron,  magnesium,  manganese,  and  zinc  in  healthy 
adult  women  participating  in  six  independent,  live-in  studies  of  trace  element  nutrition.  Dietary  effects 
on  mood  states  were  evident  in  all  six  studies,  with  higher  intakes  of  aluminum,  copper,  and  iron,  and 
lower  intakes  of  magnesium  and  zinc  associated  with  more  positive  mood  states.  Correlations  between 
mood  states  and  concentrations  of  copper,  iron,  magnesium,  and  zinc  in  the  blood  were  numerous,  but 
were  often  inconsistent  when  data  from  different  studies  were  compared.  Results  were  interpreted  as 
providing  only  weak  support  for  a  trace  element-mood  relationship. 

Determined  sleep  patterns  in  healthy,  young-adult  women  participating  in  several  independent,  Hve-in 
studies  of  trace  element  nutrition  and  related  to  dietary  intakes.  Osmpared  to  when  they  consumed  >2 
mg/day  copper,  11  women  consuming  <1  mg/day  copper  reported  earlier  bedtimes,  longer  latency  to 
sleep,  longer  total  sleep  time,  and  feeling  less  rested  upon  awakening.  In  contrast  to  when  they  were  fed 
>15  mg/day  iron,  13  women  fed  <5  mg/day  iron  reported  earlier  bedtimes,  more  nighttime  awakenings, 
and  longer  total  sleep  time.  Results  were  interpreted  as  providing  moderate  support  for  a  trace  element- 
sleep  behavior  relationship. 

Produced  the  first  evidence  of  a  relationship  between  dietary  copper  and  brain  function  in  animals. 
ECoG  data  were  collected  from  male  rats  fed  0.7,  1.4,  or  2.7  \ig/g  copper  for  100  days  following  weaning. 
Rats  with  the  lowest  copper  intake  showed  decreased  low-frequency  amplitudes,  increased  middle-  and 
higher-frequency  amplitudes,  and  increased  right-minus-left  hemisphere  asymmetries.  Results  suggest  that 
copper  deficiency  may  shift  brain  arousal  and  increase  laterality  of  activity. 

Developed  a  computer  software  package  to  automate  the  administration  of  standardized  psychological 
tasks  designed  to  assess  a  variety  of  cognitive  processes  (for  example,  sensation,  perception,  attention, 
learning,  memory,  decision  making),  and  spatial  and  sensory-motor  skills  in  healthy  adults.  This  system 
has  been  used  in  several  studies  of  nutrition  and  cognition  at  both  the  Grand  Forks  and  Western  Human 
Nutrition  Research  Centers.  Also  developed  and  standardized  several  paper-and-pencil  measures

designed  to  assess  mood  states,  stress,  psychosocial  behavior,  daily  activity  levels,  and  sleep  behavior  of 
adults  participating  in  metabohc  unit  and  free-living  studies  of  nutrition. 

Found  a  relationship  between  several  measures  of  iron  status,  cognitive  performance,  and  EEG 
parameters  of  healthy,  older  (>55  years)  adults.  Short-term  memory  for  numerical  sequences  was  poorer 
in  individuals  with  low  iron  status.  Iron  status  was  related  to  higher  amplitudes  in  the  lower  EEG 
frequencies  in  the  posterior  regions  of  the  brain,  but  to  lower  amplitudes  in  the  higher  frequencies 
recorded  from  anterior  regions.
