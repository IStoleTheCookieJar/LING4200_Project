SrALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  7 

Resume  of  the  Tennis  Season  of  1914 

By  P.  B.  Alexander. 

In  many  ways  the  lawn  tennis  season  of  1914  was  the  most  remarkable 
in  the  history  of  the  game  in  the  United  States.  Undoubtedly  it  produced 
the  highest  grade  of  tennis  among  the  experts,  both  native  and  foreign,  that 
the  game  has  ever  seen. 

The  early  spring  season  started  off  in  the  East  by  an  invasion  of  two 
young  Pacific  Coast  players — R.  Lindley  Murray  and  Herbert  Hahn — two 
heretofore  unknown  men  East  of  the  Rockies,  and  both  college  boys.  In  the 
dual  meets  with  the  two  representative  best  players  in  the  differnt  Eastern 
universities,  they  swept  all  before  them,  capping  the  climax  when  they  de- 
feated the  strong  Harvard  team,  composed  of  Watson  F.  Washburn  and 
Edward  II.  Whitney.  In  singles,  Murray  quickly  rounded  into  form  and 
showed  one  of  the  strongest  games  that  any  Western  man  has  ever  played  on 
Eastern  courts  in  his  first  season. 

In  his  first  tournament,  the  Sleepy  Hollow  Invitation,  Murray  defeated 
consecutively,  in  one  day,  Frederick  B.  Alexander,  Karl  Behr  and  William  M. 
Hall,  a  feat  which  the  experts  and  authorities  of  the  game  would  have  de- 
clared even  impossible  for  the  great  McLoughlin  himself  to  do. 

Later  he  won  the  Metropolitan  Championship  at  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club 
in  New  York  City,  defeating  Washburn  and  Church  in  the  earlier  rounds, 
and  then  Alexander  in  a  hard  five-set  match  in  the  finals.  These  two  tourna- 
ments naturally  placed  him  in  a  position  to  be  considered  seriously  for  the 
next  International  team. 

Interest  centered  after  this  in  the  trials  for  the  International  team.  The 
committee,  composed  of  Messrs.  R.  D.  Wrenn,  George  T.  Adee  and  Harry 
Slocum.  watched  carefully  every  movement  of  the  twelve  or  fourteen  men 
who  had  a  "look  in."  They  had  no  easy  task  in  choosing  them,  there  being 
wealth  of  material. 

The  Westchester  invitation  tournament  witnessed  the  arrival  of  more  of 
the  Western  contingent.  W.  M.  Johnston  in  his  first  tournament  in  the  East 
showed  excellent  possibilities  by  winning  all  of  his  matches  and  defeating  Karl 
Behr  in  the  semi-finals,  though  later  he  fell  off  considerably  in  his  game. 

The  Seabright  tournament  showed  the  Western  contingent  complete,  Mc- 
Loughlin, the  national  champion,  and  Bundy.  his  partner,  arriving  on  the 
scene  and  winning  the  doubles  after  a  hard  five-set  match  against  Pell  and 
Behr.  Williams,  having  defeated  Behr  in  one  of  the  earlier  rounds,  won  the 
singles  after  a  five-set  match  in  the  challenge  round  against  Theodore  Pell. 

The  scene  then  shifted  to  Longwood,  and  the  committee  announced  its 
choice  for  the  International  team,  namely,  M.  E.  McLoughlin,  R.  N.  WMlliams, 
2d,  K.  H.  Behr  and  T.  C.  Bundy.  McLoughlin  played  his  first  singles  for  the 
Longwood  Cup  and  romped  through  the  tournament  without  the  loss  of  a 
set,  disposing  of  such  men  as  R.  N.  Williams,  2d,  W.  M.  Johnston,  R.  L.  Mur- 
ray,   N.    W.    Niles    and    T.    C.    Bundy    with    almost    ridiculous    ease — a    truly 


8  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

wonderful  performance.  The  doubles  for  the  Eastern  Sectional  Championship 
provided  more  excellent  tennis.  Pell  and  Behr  eventually  winning.  In  the 
finals  they  defeated  the  old  team  of  Hackett  and  Alexander  in  straight  sets. 

From  then  on  all  eyes  were  turned  towards  New  York  City,  where  the 
challenge  round  for  the  International  championship  and  Davis  Cup  was  sched- 
uled for  the  courts  of  the  West  Side  Club,  at  Forest  Hills.  The  Australasian 
team — N.  E.  Brookes,  A.  F.  Wilding.  A.  W.  Dunlop  and  S.  N.  Doust — upheld 
prediction.  They  defeated  the  Canadian  team,  composed  of  R.  B.  Powell  and 
B.  P.  Schwengers,  with  ease,  on  the  courts  of  the  Onwentsia  club.  Lake 
Forest,  111.  They  then  traveled  to  Pittsburgh  and  defeated  O.  Froitzheim  and 
O.  Kreuzer,  the  German  team,  without  the  loss  of  a  match. 

Just  previous  to  the  Davis  Cup  matches  some  good  tennis  was  shown  in 
the  New  York  State  Championship.  McLoughlin  winning  it  also  with  ease. 
Hackett  and  Alexander  won  the  doubles,  after  being  nearly  defeated  at  the 
hands  of  Wayne  and  Browne  of  the  Pacific  Coast. 

The  "piece  de  resistance"  of  the  season  occurred  when  the  United  States 
and  Australasia  clashed  for  the  "blue  ribbon"  event  of  the  tennis  world.  The 
scene  at  the  West  Side  Lawn  Tennis  Club  grounds  at  Forest  Hills,  has  un- 
doubtedly never  been  surpassed  in  the  annals  of  the  game.  A  crowd  of 
14,000  people  each  day,  from  all  over  the  world,  gathered  to  witness  the  four 
greatest  experts  of  the  game  show  their  prowess ;  nor  were  the  lovers  of 
tennis  disappointed. 

The  first  match,  staged  on  the  first  day  of  play,  between  Williams  and 
Wilding,  was  a  bitter  disappointment  and  shock  to  America.  After  a  brilliant 
start,  Williams  was  never  in  the  running,  and  though  he  made  a  plucky  fight 
in  the  last  few  games,  he  was  undoubtedly  defeated  by  a  better  man.  Wilding, 
in  this  match,  showed  the  tremendous  value  of  percentage  in  lawn  tennis. 
After  the  first  few  games  his  percentage  of  errors  was  almost  too  small  to  be 
believable.  True,  he  was  not  as  brilliant  or  aggressive  as  he  might  have 
been,  but  he  played  an  ideal  game  against  Williams,  and  an  absolutely  safe 
game. 

The  second  match,  between  Brookes  and  McLoughlin,  was  a  revelation  to 
lawn  tennis  players,  and  their  skill,  headwork,  change  of  pace — in  fact,  all 
round  tennis — has  never  been  equalled.  The  first  set  was  not  only  a  record 
breaker  in  the  history  of  international  matches,  but  also  was  probably  the 
hardest  played  set,  on  both  sides,  that  has  ever  been  witnessed,  both  men 
exerting  themselves  to  their  utmost.  The  young  American  won  not  so  much 
through  playing  better  tennis  than  his  older  opponent  but  through  stamina 
and  wronderful  headwork. 

The  doubles  match,  on  the  second  day,  considered  by  many  a  lost  cause 
even  before  it  was  played,  proved  undoubtedly  the  superiority  of  the  Aus- 
tralasian team,  although  Bundy  and  McLoughlin  put  up  a  game  fight.  Bundy 
especially  played  at  the  top  of  his  form.  Brookes  and  Wilding  did  not  appear 
to  be  as  good  as  they  had  been  in  practice  the  week  before,  probably  because 
they  held  the  match  safe  all  the  way  through. 

The  third  day  again  was  a  treat  for  lovers  of  the  game.  Brookes  defeated 
Williams  in  the  first  match,  after  Williams  had  made  one  of  the  pluckiest 
fights  ever  seen  on  the  tennis  court.     With  two  sets  against  him,   he  pulled 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  9 

the  third  set  out  of  the  fire  when  it  looked  hopeless.  This  match  gave 
Australasia   the  Davis  Cup. 

Though  the  Cup  was  lost  to  the  United  States,  the  Wilding-MeLoughlin 
match  was  played,  however,  and  in  that  match  McLoughlin  at  times  un- 
doubtedly played  the  greatest  tennis  that  has  ever  been  seen.  Wilding  took 
one  set,  the  third. 

One  game  in  the  fourth  set,  of  which  particular  mention  should  be  made, 
was  on  Wilding's  service.  The  ball  was  hit  exactly  eight  times  in  the  game, 
four  times  by  each  player,  each  of  Wilding's  four  first  services  being  good  and, 
in  return,  each  one  being  driven  with  great  speed  for  a  clean  earned  point 
by  McLoughlin. 

Following  the  Davis  Cup  matches,  the  Southampton  invitation  tournament 
was  held.  Particular  mention  might  be  made  that  Norman  E.  Brookes  teamed 
up  with  W.  A.  Larned  and  won  the  doubles. 

The  National  Championships  at  Newport  were  robbed  of  an  international 
flavor  by  th<>  fact  that  none  of  the  foreign  visitors  took  part,  mainly  on 
account  of  the  fact  of  the  European  war.  Upsets  occurred  throughout  the 
tournament.  Williams  disposed  of  W.  M.  Johnston  in  the  first  round  in  a 
well  played  match,  and  showed  excellent  form  throughout  the  tournament  : 
in  fact,  so  much  better  than  his  form  in  the  Davis  Cup  matches  that  all  the 
tennis  contingent  marvelled  at  it.  McLoughlin,  towards  the  end  of  the 
tourney,  showed  signs  of  going  stale,  and  dropped  a  set  to  Clarence  Griffin. 
The  final  match,  between  McLoughlin  and  Williams,  was  won  by  the  latter 
in  three  straight  sets,  all  of  them  well  played.  Williams  was  undoubtedly  at 
the  very  tip-top  of  his  brilliant  game  and.  in  the  opinion  of  many.  Williams  at 
his  top  is  unbeatable.  McLoughlin  showed  up  poorly  in  comparison  to  his 
form  in  the  internationals.  Whether  McLoughlin  suffered  from  the  effects 
of  his  hard  contests  during  the  summer,  or  whether  Williams'  wonderful  game 
did  not  permit  him  to  pull  off  his  customary  shots,  is  an  argument  which 
may  be  waged  pro  and  con  to  the  end  of  time.  Nevertheless,  Williams  un- 
doubtedly earned  his  victory  and  title  on  that  day. 

The  Challenge  match  in  the  doubles  championship  between  George  M. 
Church  and  Dean  Mathcy,  challengers,  and  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  T.  C. 
Bundy,  holders,  resolved  itself  into  a  procession  for  the  Pacific  Coast  team. 
After  a  good  stand  in  the  first  set.  Church  and  Mathey  weakened  and  lost 
three  straight.  This  practically  ended  the  important  competitions  of  the  sea- 
son, with  the  exception  of  the  Intercollegiate  Championships,  held  at  the 
Merion  Cricket  Club,  Philadelphia,  where,  much  to  the  surprise  of  everyone, 
George  M.  Church  of  Princeton  defeated  the  national  champion  in  four  hard 
sets. 

From  the  standpoint  of  the  United  States,  it  was  a  wonderful  season,  with 
the  one  drawback  of  once  more  seeing  the  Davis  Cup  start  on  its  way  round, 
the  world,  but  the  fact  that  in  McLoughlin  America  undoubtedly  has  the- 
greatest  tennis  player  of  all  time,  will  do  much  to  heal  that  wound. 


N.  E.  BROOKES  AND  M.  E.  McLOUGHLIN. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  11 

Davis  Cup  Preliminaries  of  1914 

By  "Austral/"'  of  the  Sydney  Referee. 

[Previous  to  the  departure  of  the  Australasian  players  from  home,  the  publishers 
of  the  Annual  arranged  with  Mr.  R.  M.  Kidston  ("Austral")  of  the  Sydney  Referee 
to  furnish  the  account  of  the  Davis  Cup  matches  of  1914,  including  the  preliminaries 
in  Europe  and  America.  Mr.  Kidston  is  the  author  of  a  book  on  "Davis  Cup 
Matches  in  Australasia"  and  his  acquaintanceship  with  the  leading  players  of  the 
Antipodes  and  familiarity  with  their  individual  styles  of  play,  render  him  in  a  position 
to  write  authoritatively  on  the  subject.  Mr.  Kidston  is  considered  throughout  the 
world  as  an  expert  authority  on  the  game.] 

The  first  contest  in  the  eliminating  matches  for  the  Davis  Cup  was  played 
at  Folkestone.  England.  The  British  team,  composed  of  James  Cecil  Parke 
(oaptaini,  Herbert  Roper  Barrett.  Theodore  Michel  Mavrogordato  and  A.  R.  F. 
Kingscote.  had  for  opponents  Belgium's  representatives,  Chevalier  Paul  de 
Borman  (captain),  A.  G.  Watson,  L.  Trasenster  and  W.  H.  Duvivier.  The 
result  was  anticipated,  of  course,  although  the  Belgians  put  up  a  sturdy  fight 
and  Watson,  in  particular,  fairly  extended  Parke  and  showed  the  right  way 
to  meet  his  terrific  drives. 

The  British  team  next  met  the  team  from  France  and  had  it  not  been  for 
the  mercurial  temperament  of  the  French  players,  it  is  quite  possible  that 
victory  would  have  gone  to  her  players,  Max  Decugis  and  M.  Germot.  These 
two  fairly  beat  the  British  pair,  Barrett  and  Mavrogordato.  by  play  of  the 
greatest  brilliancy,  and  each  in  turn  went  very  close  to  winning  his  first 
match.  Germot  was  only  beaten  by  Mavrogordato.  after  playing  the  better 
tennis  all  through,  by  lack  of  physique;  and  it  was  the  same  lack  that 
spoiled  the  chance  of  Decugis  against  Parke  in  a  contest  that  might  have  tried 
the  staying  power  of  any  athlete.  These  two  wins  entitled  the  team  of  the 
British  Isles  to  contest  the  final  round  at  Boston  against  the  team  that 
should  win  its  matches  in  the  other  half  of  the  draw. 

By  the  luck  of  the  draw  the  first  match  in  the  other  half  was  between 
Australasia  and  Canada,  and  the  conditions  of  the  Davis  Cup  are  such  that 
as  these  two  nations  could  not  agree  on  a  place  in  the  country  of  either  for 
the  contest  it  must  be  played  in  the  country  of  the  champion'  nation.  That 
necessitated  the  Australasian  team  coming  to  America  to  play  its  first  match, 
and  the  further  natural  consequence  of  this  was  that  each  of  the  other  nations 
would  have  to  come  to  America  to  play  the  subsequent  rounds  against  the 
winners  of  Canada  and  Australasia.  Thus,  for  the  first  time.  America  was 
assured  of  a  fine  series  of  contests  for  the  cup  that  has  done  most  to  make 
the  game  famous.  Previously  it  had  only  had  one  match,  at  the  most,  played 
in  its  country  in  any  year. 

The  winner  of  the  Australasia-Canada  tie  was  to  meet  Germany  in  the 
second  round,  and  almost  up  to  the  last  moment  it  was  thought  that  the 
German  Association  would  not  persist  in  its  challenge.  Accordingly  after, 
in  fact,  it  had  withdrawn  from  the  contest — it  was  arranged  that  the  first 
tie  should  be  played  at  Chicago  and  the  final  at  Boston.  But  at  the  last 
moment — or  after  it — the  German  Association  asked  to  be  allowed  to  renew 
its  challenge  and,  with  the  consent  of  the  Australasian  Association,  this 
request  was  granted.  The  arrangements  already  made  for  the  first  tie, 
however,  could  not  lie  altered,  and  to  avoid  as  much  traveling  as  was  possible 
under  these  circumstances  for  the  Australasian  team  Pittsburgh  was  chosen 
for  the  second  round.  Had  it  been  known  that  Germany  intended  to  play, 
all  the  matches  would  have  been  played  nearer  to  the  common  center,  New 
York,  where  the  challenge  round  was  of  course  to  be  played. 

As  was  expected,  the  Australasian  team  very  easily  disposed  of  the  Canadian 
representatives  at  the  Onwentsia  Club,  near  Chicago,  for  the  two  champions 
of  the  world  of  1913  and  1914,  N.  E.  Brookes  and  A.  F.  Wilding,  were  in  the 
former's  team  and  Canada's  best  men  were  R.  B.  Powell  and  B.  P.

of  the  world-beatprs  from  the  Antipodes.  But  the  Canadians  fought  a  plucky 
fight. 

By  this  time  the  German  team  had  arrived  at  Pittsburgh  and  had  settled 
down  to  the  short  practice  that  was  possible.  Their  men  were  the  famous; 
Otto  Froitzheim,  who  a  few  weeks  before  had  almost  beaten  the  mighty- 
Brookes  himself  in  the  final  of  the  English  and  world's  championship  at 
Wimbledon,  and  Otto  Kreuzer,  a  left-handed  colt  of  great  promise,  who 
a  year  before  had  reached  the  semi-final  of  the  same  event,  and  had  then  been, 
unexpectedly  beaten  by  Stanley  N.  Doust,  who  with  Alfred  W.  Dunlop  formed 
the  reserves  of  the  Australasian  team  for  the  1014  struggle.  Great  expecta- 
tions for  a  fine  contest  were  centered  on  the  meetings  of  Froitzheim  with 
Brookes  and  Wilding,  but  it  was  not  anticipated  that  the  German  team 
would  be  able  to  seriously  imperil  the  chances  of  the  Australasian  team  of 
reaching  the  final  round.  But  apart  from  that  first  rubber  between  Brookes 
and  Froitzheim.  in  which  the  Gorman  captain  came  very  close  to  taking  the 
-first  set  and  which  Brookes  won  by  the  fine  grit  he  showed  after  being  several 
times  within  a  point  of  losing,  the  Germans  never  approached  victory  in  any 
rubber,  although  Kreuzer  joined  the  few  who  have  succeeded  in  taking  a  set 
from  the  great  Victorian. 

Then  the  conquering  Australasian  team  journeyed  on  to  Boston,  where  on 
the  famous  Longwood  courts  they  met  the  team  of  the  British  Isles,  and 
again  emerged  victorious.  But  this  time  the  two  champions  each  had  a 
narrow  escape  from  defeat.  Parke  showed  once  more  that  his  strokes  are 
The  ones  that  touch  Brookes  at  his  most  vital  spot,  or  rather,  perhaps,  that 
against  the  tactics  of  Brookes,  Parke  is  at  his  best.  Brookes  led  all  through 
to  the  middle  of  the  fifth  set.  Then  the  famous  Irishman  came  with  a 
determined  run  that  took  him  to  within  a  stroke  of  victory  at  5/3,  and 
again  at  5/4.  But  each  time  the  grit  and  skill  of  the  Victorian  enabled  him 
to  keep  the  Irishman  on  the  defensive  until  he  had  won  the  point,  and  then 
Brookes  ran  out,  while  the  Irishman  seemed  to  be  regretting  his  miss  of  a 
great  chance.  Wilding  was  outstayed  by  that  fine  driver,  Arthur  II.  Lowe, 
but  by  the  greatest  good  luck  in  the  world  managed  to  hold  the  Englishman 
off  from  taking  the  third  set  when  it  appeared  fairly  clear  that  if  the  latter 
succeeded  in  taking  that  set  he  would  win  the  remainder.  After  that  the 
Australasian  team  had  no  difficulty  in  winning  the  remaining  rubber  neces- 
sary to  ensure  success,  and  defaulted  then  in  the  remaining  two,  so  as  to  get 
as  much  rest  as  possible.  Brookes  and  Wilding  entirely  overwhelmed  Parke 
and  Mavrogordato  in  the  doubles,  and  the  play  of  the  Australasian  pair  in 
this   contest  was   of  a   far  higher   standard   than   they   had   previously   shown. 

In  the  doubles  Decugis  and  Germot  were  in  brilliant  form  and  defeated  the 
British  team.  Barrett  was  not  in  a  brilliant  vein,  but  the  French  pair  were 
too  good  and  are  a  superior  combination.  Germot  was  quite  the  best  of  the 
four  and  in  several  rallies  successfully  fought  the  two  opponents  at  close 
range  in  volleying  interchanges.  And  the  teaming  of  the  French  pair  was 
a  very  strong  factor  in  their  success.  When  Germot  would  run  across  to 
recover  a  toss  that  had  surprised  Decugis.  and  cleared  his  racket.  Decugis 
would  run  across  like  a  flash  to  cover  the  side  left  so  unguarded  by  Germot 
and  instantly  the  unbroken  front  of  the  correct  parallel  formation  was  again 
presented  to  the  foe.  And  if  a  chance  came  to  smash  Germot  was  always 
ready  to  drop  aside,  or  stoop  for  his  partner  to  step  in  and  kill  with  his 
more  deadly  skill  overhead.  And  in  his  best  form  overhead  Decugis  has  no 
superior — not  even  McLoughlin  in  the  challenge  round.  When  he  got  the 
match  point  which  came  on  his  own  service  Decugis  took  a  huge  deep  breath. 
Then  he  delivered  a  mighty  service  to  Barrett.  The  latter  skied  it  from 
the  very  canvas  and  the  ball  would  have  landed  almost  on  the  base  line.  But 
it  never  landed.  The  Frenchman  flung  hjmself  up  again  and  smote  the  ball 
even  harder  than  he  had  done  before.  The  ball  flew  like  a  bullet  from  a  rifle 
straight  down  the  center  and  the  last  sight  was  the  Englishmen  scurrying 
like  rabbits  to  reach  it.  But  in  vain,  and  it  hit  the  canvas  with  a  resound- 
ing smack  that  announced  the  French  victory  in  the  rubber. 

Britain  led  by  two  rubbers  to  one  and  France  still  had  a  chance.  But  a 
bare  fighting  one,  for  Germot  had  to  beat  Parke.  One  expected  Decugis  to 
defeat  Mavrogordato  after  the  way  he  had  played  against  Parke.  But  that 
expectation  was  never  realized.

In  the  Germot-Parke  match  the  former  for  the  whole  of  the  first  set  held 
the  upper  hand  by  his  all-round  skill.  He  avoided  any  attempt  to  outdrive 
Parke  by  pace,  but  he  placed  with  the  greatest  nicety,  and  stayed  back  till 
lie  got  a  chance  to  get  in  to  the  net,  which  he  was  always  aiming  for.  When 
he  got  to  the  net  he  did  what  every  volleyer  must  do  to  succeed — attacked 
•on  every  shot  that  was  possible.  He  is  like  Brookes,  an  artist  in  every  stroke 
and  in  all  his  methods. 

Parke  was  in  fine  form  and  gradually  wore  the  Frenchman  down,  but  the 
latter's  skill  and  dash  kept  the  spectators  in  thrills  of  admiration.  Drive 
after  drive  of  great  severity  he  sent  at  his  opponent,  first  on  one  side  and 
then  on  the  other,  and  though  Germot's  activity  and  dash  enabled  him  to 
take  them  at  first,  he  gradually  lost  his  activity  and  failed  both  to  reach 
as  close  to  the  net  as  was  necessary  and  to  take  the  ball  early  enough  in 
its  flight,  and  also  to  play  with  his  initial  severity  and  accuracy. 
He  was  simply  worn  down  after  the  first  set,  and  once  he  had  to  stay  hack 
it  was  all  over.  He  often  beat  Parke  by  his  sudden  placing  of  the 
hall  on  the  forehand  line,  the  stroke  scoring  by  its  audacity  as  well  as  by 
its  speed  and  skill. 

THE  CHALLENGE  TO  AMERICA. 

And  now  all  the  preliminaries  had  been  disposed  of.  The  gladiators  of 
the  two  great  nations  were  arrayed  for  battle.  The  veterans  of  Australasia 
had  thrown  down  the  gage  and  the  colts  of  America  were  certainly  ready  to 
lift  it  up.  Immense  had  been  the  travels  of  the  visitors  from  the  Antipodes. 
Their  captain,  when  he  started  from  Australia's  shores  to  prepare  for  the 
mighty  struggle,  was  in  the  opinion  of  many  right  past  his  best.  He  was  a 
dead  star  in  the  reckoning  of  those  who  put  him  at  the  worst.  In  the 
opinion  of  those  who  thought  best  of  him,  save  one  or  two  whose  confidence 
Tvas  never  one  whit  shaken  in  his  abilities,  he  was  at  the  most  a  second 
string  who  might  perhaps  with  luck  achieve  success.  But  the  present  writer 
was  one  of  those  who  could  not  see  why  he  should  not  with  good  practice 
regain  his  superb  form  of  1907,  which  had  caused  the  world's  critics  to  call 
him  the  "Mighty"  Brookes.  Personally  I  had  put  his  defeat  by  Parke  in 
1012  to  lack  of  consistent  practice,  though  quite  realizing  the  fine  play  of 
Parke,  and  Brookes'  undue  disregard  of  the  possibilities  of  the  backline  game. 

The  practice  he  needed  he  obtained  in  Europe  on  the  hard  courts  of  the 
Biviera,  where  he  pluckily  exposed  himself  to  almost  certain  defeat  by 
Wilding  for  the  sake  of  obtaining  the  best  practice  possible.  But  no  one 
■else  was  able  to  stop  his  triumphal  progress.  In  each  tournament  he  was. 
apparently  practising  for  his  heavy  programme,  which  included  not  only 
the  winning  of  the  Davis  Cup — its  chief  purpose — but  also  the  repetition 
of  all  his  successes  of  1907  ;  that  is,  the  singles  championship  of  All-England, 
carrying  with  it  now  the  title  of  Champion  of  the  World  ;  the  doubles  cham- 
pionship of  All-England  again,  with  Wilding,  and  all  the  lesser  titles.  He 
went  through  them  all  unbeaten,  and  though  he  had  slight  variations  of 
form  he  was  never  defeated  or  in  serious  danger  of  defeat  save,  as  stated, 
oy  Wilding,  until  he  entered  on  the  contest  for  the  Championship  of  the 
World  at  Wimbledon.  There  he  met  and  defeated  in  turn  all  the  best  players 
in  Europe  who  survived  their  contests  until  they  met  him.  having  beaten 
other  fine  players.  Notably  Parke  was  defeated  by  Froitzheim  in  decisive 
fashion,  the  German  so  placing  himself  definitely  in  the  world's  best  five 
players.  Then  Brookes  met  Froitzheim  in  the  final  and  a  heroic  contest 
•ensued. 

For  two  sets  and  well  into  the  third  the  Victorian's  skill  was  simply 
dazzling,  and  Froitzheim  appeared  utterly  rattled  by  the  strokes  with  which 
Brookes  met  his  best  efforts.  Many  times  have  I  seen  Brookes  play,  but 
never  once  did  I  see  him  use  some  of  the  devices  by  which  he  turned  almost 
sure  defeat  into  success.  He  half-volleyed  drives  after  the  ball  had  passed 
him,  and  in  doing  so  brought  the  ball  back  to  the  right  direction  by  having 
his  wrist  arched  back  at  the  momeut  of  impact.  One  of  these  he  cut  so 
severely  that  the  ball  almost  bounced  backwards  after  it  struck  the  ground 
within' about  three  yards  of  the  net,  having  been  half-volleyed  from  about 
the  service  line  and  near  the  side  line.

He  scored  with  many  hook  volleys,  and  one  ho  varied  by  chopping  heavily 
as  he  struck  the  ball.  Had  this  burst  of  skill  continued  the  match  would 
have  been  soon  over.  But  I  had  anticipated  a  "bad  time"  for  Brookes  owing 
to  the  intense  and  muggy  heat.  Every  one  of  his  reverses  for  the  last  five 
years  has  been  in  such  weather.  He  faltered  in  the  third  set.  For  a  moment 
the  German  did  not  realize  that  he  still  had  a  chance,  but  as  he  did,  he  rose 
pluckily  to  the  occasion.  Once  more  he  was  against  a  mere  human  being, 
and  not  a  wizard.  He  took  the  next  two  sets  and  led  at  3/2  in  the  fifth 
set  by  taking  Brookes'  service,  and  he  had  won  all  his  own  for  some  time. 

But  just  here  the  grit  of  the  Victorian,  and  a  "second  wind,'"  enabled  him 
to  resume  the  offensive.  He  took  the  German's  service,  and  by  winning  all 
his  own  led  by  a  game  to  7/6.  Then  the  German  had  the  service.  But 
Brookes  had  waited  for  this  game  so  as  to  have  the  sun  behind  him.  He  is 
always  a  great  general.  Getting  to  30-all  Brookes  went  for  a  finish.  Three 
times  he  drove  the  returns  with  all  the  immense  speed  of  his  early  career, 
when  he  was  a  player  who  went  for  pace  alone,  and  hit  as  hard  as  any  of 
the  mere  speed   merchants  of  the  present   day. 

But  though  not  exhausted,  he  was  like  Froitzheim  tired,  and  he  put  his 
hackhand  returns  rather  feebly  over  the  base  line  till  on  his  third  'vantage 
he  gained  the  net.  and  then  by  a  marvellous  anticipation  he  intercepted  an 
attempt  at  an  alley  backhand  pass  and  scored  with  a  splendid  backhand 
volley  deep  to  the  center  and  clean.  But  it  was  a  narrow  shave  and  Froitz- 
heim more  greatly  deserved  success  than  did  Parke  at  Longwood,  though  he 
was  not  so  close  to  achieving  it.     Brookes  won,   6/2,  6/1,  5/7.  4/6,  8/6.

Davis  Cup  Matches 

By  "Austral/'  of  the  Sydney  Referee. 

This  splendid  contest,  which  will  rank  with  that 
of  1007  and  1908  as  the  three  most  closely  fought 
of  the  whole  series,  was  favored  by  fine  but  very 
hot  weather,  far  too  oppressive  for  tournament 
play.  It  was  hot  and  muggy  to  a  most  unpleasant 
degree.  The  crowd  exceeded  all  records  and  totaled 
Mi  the  third  day  well  over  fourteen  thousand  per- 
sons, all  comfortably  seated  on  the  huge  stands  on 
three  sides.  The  west  side  was  taken  up  by  a 
smaller  stand  for  the  officials  and  members.  Prac- 
tically every  seat  was  paid  for  and  the  total  re- 
ceipts were  in  excess  of  £10,000.  Even  after  pay- 
5  for  the  huge  stands,  there  was  a  good  surplus 
tn  return  to  the  associations  that  sent  their  teams, 
which  sum  will  be  devoted  to  the  improvement  of 
the  game  in  both  countries. 

Three  courts  had  been  marked  out  within  the 
arena.  The  side  ones  were  for  the  singles  matches 
and  the  center  one  for  the  doubles,  and  by  this 
arrangement  it  was  possible  to  avoid  using  the  same 
nirt  twice  on  the  same  day,  and  as  the  space  was 
necessary  to  enable  so  vast  a  crowd  to  see  the 
;ames,  it  was  an  excellent  idea,  though  it  did 
entail  thf  crowd  being  rather  far  away. 
At  the  back  and  all  round  the  sides  was  a  green  baize  fence,  ten  feet  high, 
which  gave  the  players  a  most  perfect  sight  of  the  ball.  The  ball  boys  were 
a  special  class  of  young  fellows,  who  all  play  the  game  themselves  and  knew 
that  they  should  move  quickly  and  unobtrusively  in  removing  the  balls  from 
the  courts.  They  did  their  work  splendidly.  The  line  umpires  were  all  fore- 
most players  in  the  game  and  amongst  them  I  noticed  R.  L.  Murray,  W.  M. 
Johnston,  F.  B.  Alexander.  L.  W.  Glazebrook,  Dean  Mathev,  George  M.  Church, 
T.  R.  Pell,  Clarence  Griffin,  G.  F.  Touchard,  Bernon  Prentice.  W.  A. 
Larned  was  footfault  judge.  He  had  the  unpleasant  task  of  "calling"  on 
several  occasions,  and  did  his  work  impartially.  The  following  took  turns  in 
the  umpire's  chair :  A.  L.  Iloskins,  E.  F.  Torrey,  George  T.  Adee,  W.  J. 
Clothier  and  E.  C.  Conlin,  and  called  the  score  loudly  and  promptly,  yet  wait- 
ing for  the  applause  to  cease,  so  that  the  call  could  lie  heard.  These  are  little 
things,  but  they  count  greatly  in  lessening  the  tension  on  the  player. 

The  result  of  the  draw  was  to  throw  the  strain  of  the  most  important 
crises  on  the  colt  Williams,  and  it  speaks  well  for  his  fineness  of  grit  that 
he  stood  that  strain  well,  yet  not  without  showing  it.  He  is  a  wonderful  boy, 
but  he  is  still  only  a  boy.  and  any  man  would  feel  the  strain.  But  he  showed 
none  at  all  in  his  wonderful  outburst  of  brilliancy  at  the  opening  against 
Wilding,  though  he  was  opposed  by  the  player  who  three  months  before  was 
considered  unbeatable. 

Williams  won  the  service  and  Wilding  sent  him  to  the  southern  end  to  com- 
mence. Wilding  had  his  usual  wide-brimmed,  green-lined  white  hat.  Williams, 
unwisely  I  think,  wore  no  hat  to  shield  his  head  from  the  fierce  sun.  Play 
commenced  at  2.20  and  the  stands  were  quite  full. 

Wilding  made  a  weak  return  of  the  first  service  and  Williams  killed  with 
a  severe  drive.  A  service  scored  clean,  another  was  just  tipped  as  it  flew 
past,  and  a  second  service  of  great  pace  was  left  alone  by  Wilding,  who 
looked  up  for  a  decision  that  it  was  a  fault.  The  services  were  of  great 
speed  and  almost  unplayable. 

Wilding  served   and   netted   a  half  volley  of   the   return,   the  depth   of  the

next  return  beat  him,  but  Williams  outed  a  wild  drive  of  the  return  and 
mulled  a  backhand  return.  Then  a  fierce  return  scored  bv  depth  and  speed 
and  a  severe  drive  of  a  short  length  ball  from  Wilding  gave  Williams  the 
second  game.  Then  Williams  faulted,  but  scored  with  his  next  service.  Wi!* 
ding  held  the  lead  for  four  points  in  this  third  game  by  gauging  the  length 
of  his  drives,  so  as  to  take  advantage  of  the  bad  position  of  Wiliams,  who 
stood  a  little  behind  the  service  line  to  hold  Wilding  at  the  back  court.  That 
is  the  position  he  always  volleys  from.  ( I  shall  ask  my  readers  to  remember 
that  all  through,  for  it  is  the  novelty  and  the  weakness  of  his  tactics,  and 
yet,  if  he  could  justify  it,  a  formidable  proposition  to  answer.  I  also  want 
them  to  realize  that  this  account  is  from  shorthand  notes  made  at  the 
instant,  and  so  speaks  mostly  of  what  was  to  happen  then  as  still  in  the 
future.     It  does  not  treat  it  all  as  part  of  an  account  written  after  months. ) 

Then,  after  a  'vantage  against  him  Williams  got  ahead,  but  threw  away 
two  'vantages  by  double  faults.  He  scored  as  often  by  the  severity  of  his 
second  services  and  the  keeping  of  Wilding  on  the  defensive.  You  cannot 
make  omelettes  without  breaking  eggs,  nor  serve  severe  second  services  with- 
out double  faults.  Williams  won  the  last  point  by  two  fine  volleys  to  Wilding's 
backhand,  which  was  weak.  He  led.  3/0.  The  crowds  were  justly  delighted 
at  his  fine  lead.     I  was  not  perturbed  for  I  know  Wilding  to  be  a  slow  starter. 

But  here  he  did  start  and  took  his  own  service  to  15.  His  services  were 
well  placed  and  caused  Williams  to  hit  out  three  times  with  w?ak  back- 
hand strokes.  He  netted  one  weak  backhand  drive  of  a  return.  He  won  the 
game  by  attacking  Williams'  backhand  which  is  stylish  but  not  strong.  Wil- 
liams held  his  lead  by  taking  his  own  service  to  15.  Two  fine  services,  aw  out 
by  himself,  a  clean  second  volley,  and  a.  successful  attack  on  Wilding's  back- 
hand scored  the  game  to  15 — 4/1 ;  Williams  leads.  Williams  led  against  the 
service  to  40/30  by  drives  of  great  power,  two  scoring,  and  Wilding  netting 
a  third  with  a  forehand  volley.  Then,  as  Wilding  raa  in,  Yfilliams  Mimed 
to  drop  short  and  netted  deuce.  Then  he  mulled  a  return  and  a  cruel  service 
made  him  net,  4/2. 

Wilding  ran  the  score  to  15/40  by  a  deep  return,  a  slow  drop  to  Williams' 
feet  of  return,  and  an  error  by  Williams,  after  Williams  had  won  the  first 
by  a  fine  sendee  and  drive  of  return.  A  good  smash  after  a  rally,  and  a 
good  service  deuced,  and  then  Williams  mulled  a  drive  and  netted  a  good 
drive  by  Wilding.  At  last  Wilding  had  a  chance  to  pull  level  on  his  service. 
Wilding's  whole  play  was  now  marked  by  the  most  extreme  care.  He  was 
playing  patiently  for  Williams'  weak  spot's  and  taking  no  risks. 

Williams'  best  shots  were  coming  back  safely,  and  his  weak  ones 
were  punished  with  exact  justice  for  their  element  of  error.  This  was  throw- 
ing a  strain  on  the  boy  under  which  he  was  to  later  break. 

But  not  yet.  Williams  took  Wilding's  service  at  15  bv  a  fault,  a  fine 
volley  and  an  error  0/40.     Then  he  jrst  outed  a  fine  volley,  but  scored  with

a  deep  return  that  Wilding  netted.  Wilding  was  too  safe  in  this  game  and 
lacked  attack;  score,  5/3;  Williams  leads  and  to  serve.  It  looked  serious,  but 
Wilding  was  playing  well  within  himself.  He  netted  his  first  return  weakly. 
Then  Williams  faulted  and  Wilding  outed  his  next  return.  The  crowd  was 
tense  with  excitement.  They  almost  groaned  as  he  served  another  double 
fault.  30-all.  Wilding  got  in  to  the  not  and  scored  a  fine  smash  and  then 
the  colt  netted  a  smash  of  a  weak  toss  of  the  return.  4/5. 

Wilding  served  and  Williams  scored  twice  with  fine  volleying  as  Wilding 
stayed  back.     But  the  colt  netted  one  and  outed  three  returns.  5-all. 

Williams  was  evidently  aware  of  the  loss  of  a  chance  and  hurried  bis 
strokes  in  the  next  game.  Wilding  led  at  0/30  on  Williams'  errors,  but  two 
services  scored.  Then  Williams  faulted  twice,  with  two  good  rallies  in  be- 
tween, one  to  each.  A  fine  save  of  a  net  ball  gave  Wilding  a  'vantage,  and 
a  double  gave  him  the  game.  Even  an  Australian  could  feel  for  the  boy's 
and  the  crowd's  disappointment.  He  was  feeling  the  pressure  of  Wilding's 
skill,  and  was  trying  to  force  his  play.  Wilding  now  led,  6/5,  and  to 
serve,  and  he  carved  the  game  out  with  deadly  accuracy.  A  fine  serve  was 
outed,  he  took  the  net,  and  compelled  Williams  into  a  net  after  a  good 
rally.  Then  Williams  out-volleyed  him.  Again  Wilding  got  in  and  forced 
an  error,  40/15,  and  a  fine  service  was  put  out.  First  set  to  Australasia. 
Wilding*s  precision  was  too  much  for  the  colt. 

And  he  got  more  precise  as  the  game  went  on  and  gradually  introduced 
a  lot  of  volleying  into  his  game,  always  splendidly  timed  and  rarely  on  any 
risky  position.  It  was  the  play  of  a  man  who  knew  the  value  of  every  stroke 
as  against  the  opponent  before  him. 

Williams  scored  the  first  game  by  fine  services  and  volleying,  but  here  he 
was  halted  by  the  play  of  a  master  who  scarcely  ever  played  a  loose  ball. 
Do  what  Williams  might,  the  ball  came  back,  and  he  tried  harder  and  harder 
and  played  too  hurriedly.  Wilding  met  him  by  finely  judged  returns  that 
just  gave  Williams  too  much  to  do,  and  he  netted  and  outed  in  a  run  of 
seven  points.  His  faulty  position  was  responsible  for  most  of  his  errors. 
He  lost  four  games  in  succession,  in  which  he  only  scored  five  points,  and 
only  one  of  these  five  was  the  result  of  his  own  good  play.  He  made  two 
doubles  in  the  fifth  game.  At  this  stage  he  was  trying  clearly  to  eliminate 
his  errors  by  elaborately  carrect  strokes — 4/1  ;  Wilding  leads. 

A  long  game  followed,  on  Wilding's  service,  and  Williams  pulled  up  from 
15/40  to  'vantage.  Williams  was  better,  but  not  good  enough  to  take  the 
game,  nor  to  answer  Wilding's  solid  services  and  all-round  excellence  ;  score, 
5/1. 

Another  long  game  followed.  Wilding  got  in  once  to  volley,  but  Williams 
held  the  net  all  through,  and  scored  some  fine  volleys,  one  splendid  back- 
hand to  toss  off.  He  finished,  after  a  double,  with  a  fine  service  ace,  and  then 
a  stiff-wristed  low  drive  volley  across  court  of  the  return.     It  is  the  ability

to  continually  make  those  strokes  from  the  service  line  that  could  alone 
justify   Williams'  position  ;  score,  5/2. 

Wilding  made  short  work  of  the  next  game.  He  passed  Williams  as  the 
latter  closed  in  on  his  return.  Then  he  banged  a  weak  return  to  Williams* 
backhand  and  closed  in,  compelling  Williams  to  net  a  weak  return.  Two  sets 
to  none ;  Australasia  leads. 

A  Ions  game  opened  the  third  set,  and  it  came  to  Wilding  mainly  through 
the  continued  errors  of  Williams.  Two  double  faults,  the  second  after  being 
foot-faulted,  and  three  losses  through  faulty  position  and  other  weak  strokes, 
spoiled  the  result  of  two  fine  services  and  two  outs  by  Wilding.  The  next 
game  went  to  Wilding  by  catching  Williams  out  of  position  almost  wholly. 
The  strokes  Wilding  had  to  make  were  easy  ;  score.  2/0. 

Again  Wilding  won  Williams'  service  in  spite  of  three  services  that  he 
could  only  tip.  and  all  but  one  of  his  five  points  he  won  on  the  same  error 
by  Williams.  The  last  point  was  a  bad  smash  of  an  easy  ball  by  Williams 
after  he  had  worked  up  a  good  positon  by  fine  volleying;  score,  3/0.  Again 
Wilding  took  his  own  service  easily.  Williams'  play  was  at  its  worst  and 
Wilding  was  just  paddling  home.  Pushy  backhand's,  bad  positions  and  a 
feeble  attempt  to  pass  and  a  weak  toss  were  the  errors;  score,  4/0. 

Then  Williams  suddenly  started  a  new  attempt.  He  gave  up  the  idea  of 
steadiness,  and  tried  desperately  to  find  his  game  by  hard  hitting.  He  took 
a  game  to  love  on  his  own  service,  and  led  at  15/4Q  on  Wilding's.  One 
volley  of  a  ball  was  scored  clean,  in  which  he  hit  the  ball  after  it  had  almost 
got  past  him,  bringing  it  back  by  the  angle  of  his  wrist.  Wilding  then  took 
the  net  and  deuced,  but  Williams  took  the  game.  4/2. 

Three  bad  shots  from  a  bad  position  and  a  double  fault  finished  this  effort, 
and  when  Wilding,  on  his  own  service,  ran  to  40/0,  from  two  errors,  and 
his  own  fine  drives  to  pass  Williams,  it  looked  all  over.  Then  Williams 
made  a  splendid  effort  and  by  fine  volleying  evened  up  that  game,  and  after 
1  several  splendid  rallies,  in  which  the  colt  played  the  most  brilliant  series 
of  strokes  from  all  over  the  court,  he  took  the  game  to  wild  cheering.  But 
Wilding  must  here  be  debited  with  an  error  in  tactics,  for  at  40/0  he  had 
given  up  the  steady  back-line  game  that  had  succeeded  for  a  series  of  rushes 
to  the  net  in  the  hurry  to  finish  and  was  beaten  in  the  volleying  rallies  that 
ensued.     It  is  always  best  to  keep  to  a  winning  game. 

Australasia   had  scored  first  blood. 

"Lay  on  MacDuff,  and  damned  be  he,  who  first  cries :  Hold !  Enough  !" 
Then  came  the  battle  on  which  the  hopes  of  America  were  centered.  Clearly 
on  the  prior  results,  and  by  the  play  in  the  first  match  Williams  could  not 
be  expected  to  beat  Brookes,  and  America,  therefore,  had  to  rely  on 
McLoughlin  winning  all  his  three  rubbers.  And  the  majority  of  your  en- 
thusiasts expected  him  to  beat  both  Brookes  and  Wilding.  They  could  not 
imagine   how   either   of   them   could   hope   to   answer   their   champion's    speed.

Brookes  and   Wilding  vs.   McLoughlin   and   Bundy— McLoughlin   running   in. 


Americans  are  too  fond  of  speed.  But  they  admit  now  that  it  is  not  the 
speed  of  the  California!!  Comet  that  won  for  him.  except  in  service  smash- 
ing. It  was  the  subtlety  of  his  volleying  and  his  ability  to  hold  the  net  by 
these  features.  He  won — that  is,  by  adopting  Brookes'  methods — a  tribute 
to  the  Victorian  of  the  highest. 

Brookes  served  first  and  won  the  first  game  by  finely  placed  services  to 
Mac's  backhand.  McLoughlin  followed  and  evened  by  the  combined  excel- 
lence of  his  services,  and  the  volleys  of  the  returns.  But  right  away  Brookes 
showed  an  ability  to  handle  the  services  that  was  a  surprise  to  the  "fans." 
Brookes  took  his  next  service  to  15,  the  last  two  beating  Mac  utterly.  But 
the  Comet  responded  to  love  by  fine  volleying  to  30/0,  and  then  two  service 
aces.  Brookes  took  the  next  to  15  by  a  fine  series  of  strokes  from  close-in 
volleying,   stepping  back   a-chopping,   blocking  tosses,   and  a   fine   service. 

Brookes  got  the  services  into  play  next  game,  but  was  beaten  by  the 
American's  network,  and  a  service  that  battered  his  racket  aside ;  score, 
3-all.  Each  was  winning  his  own  service  with  such  certainty  that  a  long 
duel  was  clearly  to  be  expected.  A  finely  concealed  toss  scored  the  first 
point  for  Mac,  but  he  netted  two,  and  Brookes  held  a  lead  to  douce,  and 
then  got  in  two  stinging  services.  By  this  time  it  was  evident  that  both 
were  at  the  top  of  their  game  and  the  play  was  superb.  "Who  will  break 
through  first?"  is  my  note  of  the  instant.  Brookes  took  the  next  game  by 
volleys  of  the  returns,  and  Mac  was  clearly  learning  to  get  the  ball  back, 
but  he  could  not  gain  command.  He  led,  40/15,  and  then  double-faulted. 
Then  Brookes,  in  a  long  rally,  showed  his  wonderful  capacities  at  the  back  of 
the  court,  passing  Mac  close  in  on  his  fifth  stroke.  Deuce  and  two  service 
aces  finished  the  game. 

At  this  stage  it  looked  as  if  Brookes  would  be  the  one  to  break  through. 
He  was  returning  better  than.  Mac  was,  but  Mac  carried  the  next  game  to 
deuce,  and  one  of  Brookes'  points  was  a  very  doubtful  decision.  Mac 
evened  with  a  superb  drive,  but  then  Brookes  took  the  next  two  points  with 
the  most  superb  volleying  even  he  is  capable  of.  The  last  was  a  low  fore- 
hand volley  of  one  of  Mac's  absolutely  fiercest  drives  taken  at  full  stretch 
within  a  foot  of  the  ground.      It  scored  clean  down   Mac's  forehand   line. 

Mac  evened  by  six  hits,  i.  e..  two  volleys  of  returns,  and  two  services  of 
great  power.  He  tried  lobs  in  the  next  game,  but  Brookes  was  equal  to  any 
scheme,  and  scored  a  wonderful  rally  ;  two  service  aces,  and  then  each  outed 
once.  So  the  superb  duel  went  on.  Tremendous  services  were  returned  to 
start  splendid  rallies,  but  the  advantage  of  the  service  was  too  closely 
pressed  to  allow  the  striker-out  to  get  a  chance  to  win.  At  7/8,  15/30, 
Mac  double-faulted,  but  rang  in  two  severe  services  that  scored,  though  one 
looked  like  a  fault.  A  fine  effort  was  a  splendid  recovery  of  a  landed  toss 
by  Brookes,  and  a  terrific  smash  of  a  deep  toss  by  Mac.  He  never  lets  any 
toss  land.

Brookes  and  Wilding  vs.  McLoughlin  and  Bundy — McLoughlin  ready  to  smash. 

At  7-all  Mac  started  to  toss  with  fine  judgment  and  concealment,  and  fairly 
bothered  Brookes  by  the  mixture.  He  got  within  a  point  of  taking  Brookes' 
service  after  a  fine  rally  in  which  he  gained  command  by  a  toss,  and  then 
finished  with  a  deep  smash.  But  Brookes  scored  with  a  volley  of  return 
and  Mac  netted  three  returns,  and  scored  with  one  slow  drop  as  Brookes  ran 
in.  But  he  went  close  to  taking  this  game  and  was  only  held  off  by  the 
two   fine   finishing   services. 

And  then  Brookes  responded  in  the  most  critical  game  of  the  rubber.  A 
good  return  was  followed  by  two  fine  low,  slow  drives,  and  the  third  a 
backhand  cross  scored  clean.  Mac  missed  an  easy  volley  of  the  next  return, 
and  the  next  return  was  so  low  that  Mac  outed  it  in  the  attempt  to  volley  ; 
score.  0  /40 — three  set  points  ! 

Bang !  came  a  service  like  a  shot  out  of  a  gun.  Another  was  just  tipped. 
The  Comet  was  a  blaze  of  furious  energy.  A  third  was  rammed  in.  but 
Brookes  took  it  with  surpassing  skill  and  slipped  the  ball  slowly  back  to  Mac's 
feet  as  he  ran  in.  Mac  spooned  it  up  weakly  and  rushed  closer  in  a  eat- 
like  attitude.  Cooly,  and  yet  with  equal  activity,  Brookes  stepped  quickly 
round  and  got  the  easy  kill  off  the  ground  on  his  forehand.  He  could  put  it 
where  he  liked.  He  chose  to  drive  like  a  bullet  to  the  off.  And  with  a 
marvelous  anticipation,  or  perchance  a  bit  of  luck.  Mac  had  jumped  that 
way,  volleyed  the  ball  with  a  superb  effort  and  sent  it  back  to  Brookes'  feet, 
and  he  in  surprise  half  volleyed  out.  There  was  a  deep  sigh  of  relief  from 
all  the  vast  crowd,  and  a  burst  of  applause  when  the  Comet  volleyed  the 
next  return  and  scored  the  game  with  a  service.  But  it  was  a  close  shave, 
and  a   superb  save. 

In  quick  succession,  11-all  and  12-all  followed,  though  Brookes  pushed 
against  each  service.  He  served  his  first  double  fault  at  1 1  -all.  and  evened 
after  40/0  at  12/11.  He  scored  the  twenty-fifth  game  to  love,  and  then 
gave  the  crowd  a  thrill  as  he  ran  to  15/40  against  the  service  by  a  fine 
pass  and  a  brilliant  smash.  But  again  the  Comet  flashed  brilliantly,  and 
at  the  end  Brookes  played  several  weak  backhands  and  was  clearly  tiring. 
Small  wonder.  But  equally  Mac's  service  was  weaker  and  he  was  not  getting 
the  tremendous  pace  and  he  only  saved  those  set  points  by  careful  volleying, 
not  as  before  by  ferocious  services.  Brookes  again  led  at  14/13  and  15/14, 
the  play  being  still  of  almost  perfect  skill  by  both,  save  for  the  signs  of 
fatigue.  The  twenty-ninth  game  was  an  awful  struggle,  and  ran  to  five 
'va ni ages  before  Brookes  could  score  it.  Mac's  youth  was  allowing  him  to 
stand  the  strain,  and  he  scored  three  points  by  fine  drives  sent  suddenly  to 
Brookes'  forehand.  And  Brookes  was  moving  in  more  slowly,  and  only  held 
the  game  by  sheer  grit.  Then  Mac  ("as  fresh  as  ever"  is  my  note  made  at 
tin  opening  stroke  of  this  game)  scored  his  next  service  to  love,  Brookes 
only  getting  one  hall   into   play  and  that  was  promptly   smashed. 

Brookes   led,   40/15.    in   the  next  game,   but,   moving   in  slowly,  was  passed

by  two  severe  drives  of  the  returns.  Ho  handled  four  short  lobs  in  the  next 
rally,  but  he  netted  the  next  low  return,  was  beaten  by  a  hard  drive  of 
return,  and  then  running  in  well  on  his  next  service,  netted  a  low  backhand 
volley  of  a  good  return,  but  he  had  volleyed  all  like  it  before.  Weariness  I 
think. 

Now  Mac  led  for  the  first  time  and  had  the  service,  but  Brookes  responded 
pluckily,  and  by  skilful,  slow  drop  returns  caused  Mac  to  net  two,  and  at 
40/30  closed  in  on  his  return  and  beat  Mac  with  a  fine  volley,  but  he  tried 
that  again  and  failed  and  with  a  fast  deep  service  to  Brookes'  backhand 
the  Comet  had  won  the  finest  set  ever  played  in  the  history  of  the  game. 
And  it  was  clearly  the  match  also,  for  youth  had  already  told,  and  would 
tell  to  the  end. 

The  first  game  in  the  second  set  was  all  brilliant  strokes.  Mac  scored  two 
fine  drives,  but  the  game  went  to  Brookes.  Then  Mac  scored  his  own  service 
by  fine  serving  to  30,  and  leading  all  through  the  next  by  severe  drives, 
which  either  scored  or  made  Brookes  net  or  out,  and  one  toss.  Brookes  was 
tiring  more  visibly.  His  backhand  strokes  are  not  followed  through  and  he 
is  slow  in,  so  giving  room  for  the  fast  drives  that  Mac  is  now  using.  Mac 
took  his  service  to  15  by  close  net  work  that  drove  Brookes  into  errors. 
Each  then  won  his  service  to  love,  practically  by  their  fine  deliveries,  and 
Mac  led,  4/2.  In  the  next  game  Mac  pulled  up  from  0/40  to  30/40.  but 
missed  in  trying  for  a  hard  drive  past  Brookes;  score,  4/.".. 

Brookes  now  made  a  gallant  attempt  to  save  the  set,  and  a  series  of  fine 
low  drives  save  him  the  first  two  points.  But  Mac  then  got  in  and  scored 
■with  a  delicate  short  drop  volley  with  an  out  and  a  volley  of  the  return, 
and  after  a  long  rally  scored  with  a  toss  volley  that  Brookes  let  fall,  and  it 
appeared  to  him  to  be  out.  So  it  did  to  me,  looking  along  the  line,  but  the 
line  umpire  did  not  think  so,  and  Williams  and  many  alongside  me  agreed 
with  him.  Brookes  played  badly  in  the  next,  and,  coming  in  slowly,  Mac 
drove  for  aces  and  scored  the  second  set. 

It  was  all  over  now.  and  I  expressed  to  Williams  a  hope  that  Brookes 
would  not  try  for  the  third  set,  so  as  to  leave  himself  fit  for  the  double  next 
day  !  Mac  took  his  first  service  to  love  by  pure  speed,  only  having  to  volley 
one  return.  Brookes  led  at  40/15  in  the  next  game,  but  again  came  in 
slowly,  and  Mac  scored  by  the  pace  and  droop  of  his  returns,  catching  him 
far  back.  So  MeLoughlin  gained  a  'vantage  and  then  Brookes  made  a  weak, 
high  volley  with  every  sign  of  weariness.  It  was  as  much  mental  as  physical 
fatigue,  and  the  long  strain  of  tournaments  possibly  had  their  share  in 
causing  it ;  score,  2/0.     Mac  leads. 

The  lead  against  him  waked  Brookes  up,  and  at  last  he  scored  against 
Mac's  service,  and  to  15  !  But  two  of  the  points  were  bad  smashes  by  Mac, 
and  one  came  from  a  net  ball.  It  was  in  the  early  part  of  the  rallies  that 
Brookes  showed  his  effort.

Revived  by  the  success.  Brookes  served  hard  and  rushed  in.  "Nice  volley." 
said  Mac,  pleasantly,  to  one  humming  volley  of  his  return  as  he  watched 
it  score  clean.  Now  2-all,  and  the  crowd  cheered  heartily  at  Brookes' 
pull-up.  Each  won  his  service  easily,  but  the  rallies  on  Brookes'  service 
were  longer  fought.  Brookes  took  the  last  by  solid  overhead  play  of  tosses. 
And  he  held  Mac  to  deuce  in  the  next  service.  4   ■'!. 

Brookes  led  to  40/30  in  spite  of  a  double  fault.  "Good  service."  said 
Mac,  when  Brookes  took  the  fifth  point  clean.  And  then  Mac  rushed  the 
game,  and  having  a  'vantage  by  a  fine  save  scored  by  a  mis-hit.  5/3,  and 
the  crowd  got  up  to  leave,  amid  cries  of  "Sit  down"  from  all  the  officials,  but  it 
took  quite  throe  minutes  for  them  to  allow  the  game  to  proceed.  And  then 
Mac  ran  out  to  love. 'Brookes  offering  but  a  half-hearted  opposition.  Only 
the  last  rally  of  all  was  contested,  and  that  was  finished  by  a  fine  smash 
Vv  McLoughlin  which  scored  decisively. 

Every  player  and  ex-champion  1  spoke  to  had  the  same  answer  to  my 
question  "What  did  you  think  of  that?"  "It  is,"  said  W.  A.  Larned.  -the 
finest  set  I  ever  saw  played.  I  never  saw  two  players  at  the  same  time  pre- 
serve such  a  high  standard  of  play."  So  said  R.  D.  Wrenn,  P.  B.  Alexander 
and  II.  H.  Hackett,  and  so  said  every  single  man  I  spoke  to.  The  answer 
was  almost  stereotyped.  T.  C.  Bundy  in  answer  to  my  question  spun  an 
imaginary  comment:  "The  first  set,"  I  mean,  he  added,  "whoever  won  that 
took  the  match." 

THE   DOUBLES. 

Up  to  the  very  last  moment  the  American  Selection  Committee  were  in 
doubt  as  to  who  they  would  pick  of  Bundy  and  Behr  to  partner  McLoughlin. 
Actually,  I  am  told  on  fairly  reliable  authority  that  McLoughlin  was  trying 
up  to  ten  o'clock  the  night  before  to  find  out  who  would  be  chosen.  He  made 
do  bones  about  his  own  preference  for  Bundy,  but  at  the  same  time  said  it 
►vas  for  the  Committee  to  do  the  choosing.  "It  is  up  to  you  fellows," 
is  what  I  am  told  he  said.  Before  and  after  the  match  I  agreed  with  him. 
He  and  Bundy  are  a  pair.  He  and  Behr  are  two  clashing  mentalities  on  the 
court.     I  saw  that  clearly  in  practice. 

But  whose  was  the  mind  that  ran  the  tactics  with  which  they  opened  I 
do  not  know.  Directly  the  game  opened  they  commenced  tossing,  and  that 
was  clearly  a  mistake.  It  put  them  on  the  defensive,  and  that  is  not  Mac's 
game.  He  had  shown  he  could  return  Brookes'  service  low  and  clean  and 
hard  and  he  should  have  stuck  to  that. 

And  I  am  in  entire  disagreement  with  all  the  opinions  I  have  heard  as  to 
the  relative  merits  of  the  play  of  Mac  and  Bundy.  I  do  not  think  Bundy 
was  class  enough  for  the  match,  although  I  think  he  was  a  better  partner 
for  Mac  than  Behr  and  that  Mac  and  Behr  would  not  have  done  so  well. 
His  network   is  not  good  enough,   and  Mac  knew   this  and   so,   when   he  saw

their  defeat  certain  in  the  middle  of  the  match,  he  valiantly  tried  to  rise  to 
such  a  height  as  to  carry  the  game  off  by  his  own  play,  and  went  to  pieces, 
largely  no  doubt  through  the  feeling  that  he  was  to  blame  for  Bundy's  in- 
clusion. 

Bundy,  it  is  said,  only  lost  one  service ;  McLoughlin  lost  three.  That  is 
surely  hasty  criticism.  Very  often  it  is  the  man  at  the  net  who  wins  the 
service  games  and,  in  my  opinion,  this  was  so  in  this  match.  Mac  was  always 
threatening  to  jump  in  to  nip  off  the  return  of  Bundy's  service,  while  the 
latter  hardly  ever  did  so.  Mac  was  certainly  wild,  even  at  the  first,  but  if 
he  had  had  a  stronger  partner  he  would  not  have  gone  cold  for  a  share  in 
the  play.     I  am  not  overlooking  Bundy's  fine  tossing  of  deep  smashes,  nor  his 

:  pluck  and  grit.  But  his  low  volleying  was  the  weak  point  that  drove  them 
to  the  back  court.     America  is  actually  without  a  strong  pair. 

Wilding  was  the  best  of  the  four.     His  smashes  were  splendid.     His  nerve 

,  was  equal  to  any  crisis,  and  his  low  volleying  sound  and  forcible.  In  short, 
he  played  a  splendid  game  right  through.  Brookes  at  stages  rose  above  him, 
and  at  one  time  played  absolutely  wonderful  tennis,  even  for  him.  But  he 
was  patchy  at  times  and  did  not  handle  the  tosses  as  well  as  Wilding.  He 
served  better  than  Wilding  did,  but  lost  one  service,  while  Wilding  lost  none. 
But  he  was  more  assistance  to  Wilding  in  threatening  a  poach  than  Wilding 
was   to   him. 

THE  PLAY. 

Brookes  had  the  first  service  and  started  from  the  northern  end.  He  was 
met  with  a  weak  toss  by  McLoughlin  and  netted.  He  did  the  same  to 
Bundy's  toss  of  the  return.  Mac  then  went  for  a  wild  biff — "out,"  and  the 
crowd  applauded  wildly,  thinking  it  was  in.  Bundy  outed  his  return,  and 
then  Mac  got  a  fine  return  hard  to  Brookes'  feet,  30/40.  Wilding  killed  the 
next  return  with  a  fine  backhand  smash,  and  finished  the  next  rally  with  a 
fine  volley.  Bundy  then  outed  his  next  return.  The  first  game  was  to 
Australasia,   but  its   supremacy   did  not  look   too  assured. 

The  players  must  have  been  a  bit  nervous  at  the  greatness  of  the  issue. 
for  there  was  a  similar  hesitation  about  the  attack  of  McLoughlin  and  Bundy 
on  MeLoughlin's  service,  for  mostly  the  servers  win  at  first  till  the  players 
warm  up.  McLoughlin  served  severely  and  led,  40/15,  but  the  next  two  re- 
turns; beat  him.  and  Australasia  gained  a  'vantage  before  he  took  the  game 
by  good  volleying.  But  it  was  a  good  sign,  from  the  Australian  point  of 
view,  that  both  Australians  were  taking  his  services  well,  and  he  got  the 
last  point  by  a  lucky  volley  when  beaten  by  a  severe  drive  by  Brookes. 
Bundy  played  well  in  the  next  game,  scoring  a  fine  drive  and  nearly  scor- 
ing with  a  clever  interception.  Wilding  served  well  and  led,  40/15.  Then 
Brookes  netted  an  interception  of  the  return,  but  Bundy  mulled  an  easy 
volley,    2/1.      Australasia    leads.

R.   N.   Williams,   2nd  U.   E.   McLoughlin. 

Bundy  started  off  with  a  "double."  and  then  Wilding  made  a  fine  drive  to 
finish  the  next  point,  and  after  Brookes  had  outed,  Wilding  got  another  return 
to  Bundy's  feet,  and  the  latter  netted.  After  a  long  rally  America  scored 
and  then  McLoughlin  intercepted  Brookes'  return,  and  deuced,  and  gaining 
the  next  point  had  a  'vantage.  But  Brookes  scored  by  a  fine  lift-drive- 
volley  from  deep,  and  then  went  very  close  with  a  fine  smash.  Bundy  was 
Then  sent  back  with  a  landed  toss,  and  from  the  stop  netting  lobbed  several 
times,  but  Australasia  scored  and  finally,  after  another  deuce,  took  the  game. 
Bundy's   play   in   this   game  was   below   class;   score,    3/1;   Australasia   leads. 

Brookes  then  won  his  service  to  love  by  good  service,  the  returns  being 
promptly  killed.  McLoughlin  served  and  also  won  to  love,  and  in  the  first 
rally  the  crowd  showed  the  strain  by  "applauding  a  mere  error"  (my  note 
at  the  instant)  by  Australasia.  3/2.  Wilding  served  and  an  exceedingly 
in-and-out  tussle  ensued.  Wilding  actually  won  after  serving  three  double 
faults,  and  on  the  first  of  them,  which  gave  America  a  'vantage,  the  crowd, 
applauded  loudly  when  he  was  footfaulted  on  his  second  service.  Granted, 
it  may  have  been  at  the  score,  but  at  least  it  was  ill-timed  and  regrettable. 
Three  times  the  Americans  had  the  'vantage,  but  each  time  Wilding  got  in 
a  splendid  service  and  saved  cooly.  He  double  faulted  again.  Next  stroke 
Wilding  let  a  ball  fall  in,  giving  another  'vantage.  But  after  sixteen  points 
•the  Australasian  pair  won,  5/3.  In  Bundy's  next  service  Mac  was  very 
threatening  at  the  net  and,  Bundy  serving  well,  Australasia  only  scored  one 
point  by  the  fine  play  of  Brookes.  Brookes  then  served  and  led,  40/15,  having 
his  services  tossed,  and  he  and  Wilding  smashing  well.  But  Mac  scored 
with  a  fine  driving  return,  and  Bundy's'  tosses  took  the  next  point.  Then 
Brookes  got  in  two  stinging  services,  one  being  netted,  the  other  outed.      1/0. 

McLoughlin  served  next,  and  smashed  for  the  first  point,  winning  three 
more  by  his  tine  services  being  outed.  But  he  missed  an  easy  backhand  smash. 
Brookes  followed  and  was  beaten  by  a  slow  drop  return  by  Mac.  Then 
Brookes  went  for  a  fine  backhand  smash,  and  was  evidently  astonished  by 
the  decision  that  the  ball  went  out,  and  also  not  a  little  upset.  He  had  no 
right  to  be  so  upset.  A  long  tossing  series  by  Bundy  was  at  last  ended  by 
Wilding  bouncing  the  ball  into  the  grand  stand,  and  he  did  the  same  in  the 
next  rally.  But  Mac's  severe  return  beat  Brookes  clean,  and  Bundy's  toss 
landed,  and  Brookes  netted  in  trying-  to  cut  his  recovery.  At  this  stage  Mac 
was  driving  with  great  pace  and  Bundy  tossing.  It  scored  by  the  variety, 
but  it  showed  the  different  methods  of  the  two  Americans.  2/0 ;  America 
leads. 

And  when  Bundy  scored  his  service  to  30  the  crowd  were  very  delighted. 
Mac  was  threatening  to  poach  and  our  men  scored  two  points  by  tosses  of 
the  returns,  but  Bundy's  services  were  good.  The  crowd  roared  w'ith  delight 
at  the  finish.  Wilding  then  won  his  service  to  15,  smashing  finely.  The 
Tallies  were  long,  mostly  smashes  of  Bundy's  tosses.  Then  McLoughlin 
•served  and   Wilding  scored  the  first  point   by   a   hard  drive.     Mac  jumped  in

Brookes  and  Wilding  vs.   McLoughlin  and  Bundy — Brookes  ready  to  snia 


to  intercept  in  the  next  rally  and  outed,  but  won  the  next  stroke.  Then 
Wilding  returned  low  and,  the  volley  coming  up,  killed  with  a  smash.  A 
service  beat  Wilding  clean.  But  sending  another  as  good  to  Brookes,  the 
latter  sent  it  back  low  and  Mac  netted.  3/2  ;  America  leads.  Brookes  scored 
his  next  service  to  15,  two  points  with  smashes,  and  two  returns  were  outed. 
But  Mac  scored  with  one  hard  return. 

Bundy  served  and  led,  40/15,  by  his  own  fine  play.  In  one  rally  he  vol- 
leyed three  difficult  balls  and  scored  at  last  and  he  placed  his  services 
splendidly.  Brookes  beat  him  with  one  return,  but  he  scored  the  last  point 
after  a  close  rally.  The  crowd  cheered  heartily,  4/3.  Wilding  served  and 
both  Americans  centered  a  series  of  tosses  to  Brookes  facing  the  sun  and 
at  last  he  outed.  At  30-all  Mac  scored  a  splendid  forehand  alley  drive, 
when  seemingly  beaten,  and  a  long  rally  ensued,  which  Australasia  saved  and 
so  probably  saved  the  set.  Then  Wilding  double-faulted,  but  evened  with 
a  mighty  service,  and  finally  scored  the  game  4-all.  It  was  a  very  close 
shave,  indeed,   for  Australasia. 

Mac  won  his  next  service  in  spite  of  both  he  and  Bundy  missing  easy 
smashes.  His  services  scored  on  their  own  merits.  Brookes  served  and  was 
again  met  with  tosses,  one  easy  one  being  missed  by  him.  But  at  30-all  he 
sent  down  two  fine  services  which  won.  Bundy  served  and  Brookes  won 
the  first  two  points  with  fine,  speedy  drives,  but  Mac  then  intercepted  well 
and  killed  two  returns.  Brookes'  next  return  was  outed.  but  again  Mac 
scored  three  strokes  by  his  interceptions,  and  the  threat  of  them.  This  is 
where  Mac  was  doing  fine  work  by  winning  Bundy's  service  game  at  a  critical 
stage.  Once  more  Wilding  cut  things  fine  in  the  next  game.  At  15/30  he 
served  a  double.  15/40  (two  set  points).  Mac  netted  his  return  and  then 
there  was  a  splendid  rally  from  which  the  Americans  emerged  with  an  easy 
chance  to  Mac.  He  mulled  it  in  the  silliest  way  and  we  breathed  again.  The 
next  service  was  netted  and  also  Bundy's  return,  6-all.  Here  was  seen  the 
effect  of  the  heavy  pressure  on  Mac.  The  previous  game  shows  how  he  was 
forcing  himself.  Here  he  broke  badly  it  is  true,  but  one  must  recognize  the 
strain  on  him  through  Bundy's  weakness. 

Mac  served  again  and  led,  40/15 ;  tosses  by  Brookes  and  Wilding,  after 
rallies,  going  out,  and  Wilding  netting  a  return,  and  our  point  coming  from 
a  smash  by  Brookes.  Then  Brookes  beat  Bundy  with  a  diving  forehand 
return  straight  at  him  by  its  sheer  audacity.  Again  Brookes  rose  to  the 
occasion  and  commanded  the  rally,  which  he  finished  with  a  smash,  and  the 
Americans  left  to  each  other  in  the  next  point.  Brookes  tried  to  finish  the 
game  with  a  lift  drive,  but  netted.  But  he  secured  the  net  with  a  fine  toss 
volley  in  the  next  rally,  and  the  Americans  outed.  But  Mac  smashed  the 
next  ball  hard  at  Wilding's  feet  and  there  was  a  roar  as  Wilding,  by  a  most 
lucky  fluke  half-volley  scooped  the  ball  high  in  the  air,  and  Mac  netted  an 
easy    smash    in    his   surprise   and    in    trying   for    a   kill    of    a   very   deep    ball. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  41 

"Good  luck,  Australasia,"  called  some  one  in  the  crowd.  It  was  good  luck, 
as  well  as  good  play.  Mac  broke  down  in  trying  too  much,  but  I  admire  him 
for  that,  as  he  saw  he  had  to  do  something.  Brookes'  play  at  this  crisis 
rose  to  the  highest  of  the  four  during  the  match. 

Brookes  made  short  work  of  his  next  service,  three  points  coming  from 
smashes.  Brookes'  last  smash  hit  the  net  and  rolled  over  too  short  for 
Mac's  desperate  attempt  to  reach  it.  Australasia  certainly  had  a  lot  of  luck 
at  the  end  of  that  set.  Wilding's  toss  and  Mac's  misses  and  his  net  ball. 
Two  sets  to  none  :   Australasia  leads. 

Mac  was  gradually  going  wild  in  his  endeavor  to  save  the  match  and  was 
•worrying  over  his  misses.  After  leading,  40/0,  Mac  just  missed  a  lovely 
volley,  but  Brookes  had  the  same  bad  luck  in  just  outing  an  attempt  to  toss 
a  half-volley  of  a  ball  banked  to  his  feet. 

Wilding  followed  and  led,  40/15.  by  two  smashes  and  a  net  by  Mac.  Then 
Mac  returned  hard  and  drove  Wilding's  weak  answer  for  an*  ace.  Bundy 
got  his  return  over  Brookes'  head.  "Can't  reach  it."  said  Brookes.  At  the 
third  deuce  Wilding  got  in  two  fine  services,  and  killed  a  toss  with  another 
fine  smash.  Mac  had  some  trouble  in  winning  his  next  service,  and  served 
a  double  fault.  Brookes  was  again  assailed  with  a  run  of  tosses  in  the 
opening  rally,  but  America  outed,  and  Bundy  was  beaten  by  a  curly  second 
service  which  he  outed.  He  was  finding  great  trouble  in  handling  the  slower 
but  more  twisted  second  services  of  both  Australasians.  Wilding  won  the 
last  point  by  a  fine  smash.  2-all.  Bundy  served  and  Mac  again  scored  by 
good  interception,  missing  one  easy  one,  but  the  last  two  services  were  good 
and  scored  themselves.  ?>/-•  Bundy  scored  the  only  point  for  America 
against  Wilding's  next  service  with  a  fine  drive  down  the  center  from  outside- 
the  lines.  Mac  missed  the  last  point  with  a  wild  drive,  and  his  wildness  at 
this  stage  in  the  attempt  to  save  the  match  was  very  noticeable.  He  won  his 
next  service  after  30/0  and  30/40.  There  was  one  superb  volleying  rally 
between  Brookes  and  Mac.  which  Brookes  won.  It  must  be  realized*  also  that 
Mac  had  to  force  his  way  into  the  rallies.  Leading  at  30/40,  Brookes  played 
a  most  perfect  rally,  in  which  he  showed  all  his  wonderful  skill  in  every 
stroke.  The  ball  crossed  the  net  about  sixteen  times,  and  at  last  Mac  scored 
with  a  rather  lucky  half  volley.  Then  Mac  scored  with  a  smash  and  a 
service  ace.  4/3:  America  leads.  Brookes  served,  and  a  Ions  game  followed. 
The  Americans  scored  with  a  toss  and  then  Wilding  killed  two  alter  patient 
tosses  from  the  stop-netting  by  Bundy.  That  sort  of  tossing  was  the  main 
part  of  the  closing  games,  but  Wilding  was  always  too  severe  and  Brookes  too- 
steady.  Mac  beat  Brookes  with  a  forehand  return  to  make  the  score  '.0-all. 
and  a  rally  followed.  "Outside,"  roared  a  youthful  line  umpire,  with  delight 
too  evident  in  his  voice.  'Vantage  to  America  !  But  Brookes  heat  Bundy 
with  the  service  and  after  a  couple  more  'vantages  to  Australasia  Wilding 
scored  with  a  severe  smash,  and  once  again  Brookes  beat  Bundy  with  his 
service.  4-all.  Bundy  served  and  led,  40/0,  but  Wilding  scored  three  fine 
drives  for  deuce.  Then  Bundy  scored  a  fine  volley,  and  Brookes  netted  a  half 
volley.  4/5;  America  leads.  Wilding  took  his  service  to  love,  hardly  a  ball 
being  returned  effectively.  5-all.  Again  Mac  went  close  to  losing  his  service, 
the  Australasians  having  a  'vantage  after  40/15.  Wilding's  line  play  was 
mainly  responsible  in  tossing  and  volleying.  At  the  'vantage  Brookes  and 
Bundy  had  a  fine  tussle  and  Brookes  just  failed  to  win.  Then  Mac  got  in 
two  fine  services  and  won,  6/5. 

Brookes  served  and  led.  40/15,  by  three  fine  deliveries.  Then  he  missed  a 
smash  weakly,  but  a  curly  service  was  utterly  too  much  for  Bundy.  6-all. 
Bundy  served  and  a  featureless  though  good  game  went  to  the  Americans, 
who  played  well,  and  Mac  scored  one  fine  interception. 

Wilding  served  and  won  a  point.  Then  he  let  a  ball  fall  in.  and  a  net  ball 
beat  Brookes  by  hopping  over  his  racket  close  in.  Wilding,  Brookes,  and 
Wilding  again  scored  by  smashes  after  long  duels  between  them  and  Bundy. 
In  one  rally  Bundy  sent  up  five  tosses.     6-all. 

Then  came  the  startling  end.  Mac  served.  Both  Americans  let  a  lob 
after  a  long  rally  fall  untouched.  Mac  netted  Wilding's  return.  He  volleyed 
Brookes'  return  to  Wilding.  Again  the  latter  beat  him  with  a  hard  drive 
and  Brookes  caused  him  to  net  in  the  next  rally.  7/6;  Australasia  leads* 
and  Brookes  to  serve  Mac. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  43 

It  looked  all  over.  But  Mar's  eyes  glared  and  at  the  end  of  a  rally  he 
killed  a  fine  toss  volley  by  Brookes  with  a  deep  smash.  Brookes  netted 
Bundy's  return.  Wilding  outed  an  easy  smash.  0/40.  The  fans  dared  to 
hope?  But.  in  turn.  Brookes  rose  to  the  occasion.  His  service  was  outed 
by  Bundy.  Mac  got  a  chance  to  kill  and  made  a  rotten  smash  of  an  easy 
ball,  rushing-  at  it  overeagerly  as  he  saw  the  chance  to  even  the  score  and 
save  the  set  and  match. 

Again  Bundy  was  beaten  by  Brookes'  service,  screwing  it  weakly  out 
through  the  great  break.  Deuce.  Brookes  got  in  a  fine  service  and  a  good 
smash  of  the  lob  of  it.  Match  point.  Then  he  sent  down  a  most  horribly 
curly  service  to  Bundy  and  the  latter,  doing  his  utmost,  could  only  get  it  back 
to  the  net.  Australasia  had  won.  and  no  one  doubted  that  this  was  the  end. 
No  one,  least  of  all  the  American  papers,  gave  Williams  a  sporting  chance 
of  beating  Brookes.  In  fact,  if  he  had  read  the  papers  he  would  have  been 
entirely  daunted  by  the  way  they  wrote  down  his  chances  of  success — and 
his  fine  recovery  afterwards  showed  how  wrong  they  were. 

BROOKES   VS.   WILLIAMS— AUSTRALASIA  IN   SIGHT  OF  VICTORY. 

Brookes  won  the  toss  and  served  first  from  the  northern  end.  Right  away 
the  boy  was  beaten  by  the  strangeness  of  Brookes'  service.  He  has  met 
left-handed  servers  before,  notably  Fottrell,  whose  service  appears  to  be 
swifter  than  that  of  Brookes,  but  it  is  the  command  of  various  breaks  and 
the  change  of  pace  that  makes  Brookes'  service  so  difficult.  From  what  I 
had  seen  of  the  method  of  Wilding's  game  against  Williams  I  had  anticipated 
that  Brookes  would  do  as  he  did — attack  Williams'  backhand,  and  go  to  the 
net.  But  Brookes  won  the  first  game,  to  love,  and  only  one  ball  came  back, 
once.  Against  the  first  service  Brookes  returned  to  the  backhand,  and  fol- 
lowed the  return  to  the  net  and  Williams  netted.  But  the  colt  passed  finely 
in  the  second  rally.  Then  he  double-faulted,  outed  a  backhand  attempt  to 
pass,  and  faulted  again.  2/0.  Brookes  scored  the  third  game  with  greater 
ease.  Two  absolute  service  aces,  and  two  outs  of  returns  in  attempts  to  pass, 
in  reply  to  services  he  did  not  understand  betti  r  than  a  mere  beginner, 
were  the  items.  3/0.  In  that  game  the  colt  was  scarcely  able  to  put  his 
racket  on  the  ball.  In  the  next  game  a  good  service  gave  him  a  point,  then 
erred  twice  in  attempting  to  pass  Brookes,  and  again  scored  a  service.  He 
was  caught  out  of  position  as  against  Wilding  in  the  next  point  ;  but  after 
alternately  being  beaten  by  the  return  or  winning  with  the  service  he  at 
last  took  a  game,  3/1. 

He  actually,  in  the  fifth  game,  got  the  first  two  points  against  Brookes' 
service,  but  then  the  veteran  overwhelmed  him  with  anothter  series  of 
services,  not  one  of  which  he  got  into  play.  He  led  30/0  in  his  next  service, 
but  threw  the  game  away  by  two  double  faults,  an  out  of  a  backhand  toss, 
and  Brookes'  drive  to  his  feet  in  bad  position.     5/1  ;  Brookes  leads. 

He  took  another  service,  without  a  ball  being  returned  to  play.  Actually 
in  this  set  Williams  only  returned  three  of  Brookes'  four  services  into  play. 
It  was  sheer  slaughter.  And  it  continued  in  the  next  set.  Williams  led, 
30/0,  in  the  first  game,  but  netted  the  next  return,  and  position  spoiled  him 
in  the  next.  Then  he  netted  a  chance  to  score,  and  double-faulted.  Again 
Brookes  scored  his  service  to  love,  but  Williams  got  two  returns  weakly  into 
play.  One  of  Brookes'  services  was  an  uncalled  let.  The  crowd  at  this 
stage  were  very  fair  with  their  applause,  in  spite  of  the  annihilation  of  all 
their  hopes. 

Again  Brookes  got  in  on  the  returns  and  Williams  was  unable  to  handle 
the  balls  to  his  backhand,  and  lost  one  chance  by  a  weak  volley.  I  had  said 
to  a  prominent  American  that  on  the  game  Williams  played  against  Wilding 
I  did  not  expect  him  to  get  six  games  in  the  three  sets  against  Brookes. 
It  looked  as  if  I  had  overestimated  him.  3/0  ;  Brookes  leads.  Again  Brookes 
served,  and  was  foot-faulted  on  the  American  interpretation  on  his  first 
service. 

Brookes  won  the  game  to  love,  and  only  had  to  finish  two  returns.  After 
leading  30/0  in  first  game  the  colt  had  only  won  one  point  in  four  games. 

Then  he  pulled  himself  together  and  by  desperate  play  took  the  game  to  15,

President  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills,  Long  Island,  N.  Y. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  45 

three  points  by  fine  services.  Again,  however.  Brookes  won  his  service  to 
love,  but  had  to  do  a  lot  of  close  volleying  for  the  first  point.  The  second 
last  service  had  the  off-break,  and  entirely  beat  Williams  by  breaking  into 
his  body.     5/1. 

Again  Williams  made  a  fine  effort,  and  won  the  service  to  love  after  good 
rallies.  But  he  could  not  stop  Brookes  from  winning  another  service  to  love, 
and  the  colt  only  got  one  ball  into  play. 

In  the  third  set  he  again  won  his  service  to  15,  Brookes  only  succeeding 
in  returning  one,  when  a  net  ball  spoiled  his  volley.  Again  Brookes  won  his 
service  easily  :  but  the  colt  was  now  clearly  handling  it  better,  and  got  several 
into  play,  and  he  won  his  own  service  just  as  easily,  giving  Brookes  quite  a 
tussle  for  the  latter's  next  service,  although  he  only  won  one  point.  He  did  not 
seem  so  utterly  helpless  against  the  service,  and' he  had  played  really  finely 
in  the  previous  game.  I  commenced  to  realize  his  possibilities.  2-all.  He 
led.  40/15,  in  the  next  game,  and  scored  to  30,  passing  Brookes  for  almost 
the  first  time  as  he  went  in  on  a  return  to  the  backhand.  He  got  two 
services  back  in  the  next  game,  but  could  not  win  a  point,  and  Brookes  was 
sending  down  a  greater  variety  of  twists.  But  he  won  his  own  service  again 
and  then,  with  a  series  of  fine  strokes,  took  a  'vantage  against  Brookes' 
service,  making  a  passing  stroke  of  a  low  volley  and  scoring  with  a  neat  toss 
after  a  rally.  His  next  return  was  let  go  by  Brookes,  and  it  dropped  only 
two  inches  out.  Then  he  outed  an  attempt  to  pass,  and  was  beaten  by 
Brookes'  close  volleying.  Again  he  won  his  own  service  to  15,  and  held 
Brookes  for  a  long  time  on  his.  Brookes  was  not  now  following  his  returns 
to  the  net. 

Brookes  took  the  first  point  in  this  game  by  the  best  stroke  I  saw  him 
play  in  America.  He  was  seemingly  passed,  but  stretched  out  his  racket, 
and.  with  a  perfect  hook  volley,  tossed  the  ball  right  into  the  last  square 
foot  of  Williams'  backhand  corner,  and  latter  netted  his  recovery.  The 
crowd  applauded  generously.  Brookes  won  the  game  after  three  deuces. 
5-all.  Brookes  made  an  effort  to  finish  here,  and  led  at  O/30  and  15/40, 
and  looked  hard  at  the  line  umpire  for  a  fault  on  the  third  point.  But  that 
line  umpire  was  Alexander,  and  he  could  not  have  been  wrong.  Then 
Williams  won  four  points  ;  three  returns  going  into  the  net.  Was  it  "'mental 
storm"  on  Brookes'  part  or  the  fine  services?  The  last  rally  ended  in 
Brookes  tossing  out.     Again  Brookes  had  difficulty  in  winning  his  service. 

Each  then  won  his  own  service  to  15  without  incident,  but  with  fine  play 
by  both.     7-all. 

Then  Williams  served  a  double  fault  and  netted  an  easy  volley.  He  drew 
level  in  spite  of  two  good  saves  by  Brookes;  but  then  he  netted  an  attempt 
to  pass,  and  Brookes  seized  the  chance  and  returned  deep  to  his  backhand 
and  closed  in,  and  Williams  netted.  The  crowd  very  fairly  applauded  Brookes 
as  he  went  to  serve,  or  else  it  was  to  encourage  Williams. 

Brookes  led,  30/15,  and  sent  down  a  severe  service.  The  colt  fought  him 
back,  and  made  him  net  and  then,  with  two  fine  series  of  low  slow  drives, 
finally  caused  him  to  net  twice  more.  Brookes'  play  lacked  sting  at  this 
stage.  The  crowd  was  uproarious  in  their  delight,  and  stopped  play  for 
quite  a  while.  The  colt  seemed  to  suddenly  find  new  abilities  at  this  escape, 
and  with  a  most  magnificent  series  of  passing  strokes  made  from  every  part 
of  the  court  off  the  ground,  and  with  his  peculiar  skill  oft  volleys  had 
Brookes  jumping  from  side  to  side  like  an  acrobat  till  he  finally  passed  him, 
or  caused  him  to  net.  Brookes'  anticipations  were  seldom  at  fault,  but  he 
could  not  handle  the  passes  effectively,  perhaps  because  he  was  a  shade  too 
far  back. 

Williams  won  his  own  service  to  30,  and  that  of  Brookes'  to  15,  and  in  the 
last  game  every  one  of  his  points  was  scored  after  Brookes  had  gained  the 
net.  Williams'  command  of  slow  drop  passes  at  this  stage  excels  anything 
I  have  ever  seen,  and  twice  he  passed  Brookes  clean  by  the  skill  with  which 
he  concealed  his  direction. 

The  cheers  of  the  crowd  rose  and  fell  and  rose  again.  There  was  a  lull 
and  then  they  broke  out  in  echo  after  echo.  To  a  certain  stage  they  were 
thoroughly  justified,  but  they  went  beyond  that  stage,  and  Brookes  fell  into 
the   regrettable   error   of   shutting   up   his   ears    to   shut   out   the   clamor.      To 


46  Sl'ALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

suggest,  as  many  did,  that  he  did  this  because  he  did  not  like  to  hear 
Williams  applauded  is  only  to  add  another  error.  That  would  be  too  unthink- 
able. 

Then  the  players  went  in  for  the  seven  minutes'  intermission  allowed  in 
America,  which  at  the  moment  came  as  a  surprise  to  Brookes.  He  and 
Parke  had  not  taken  it  at  Longwood  as  far  as  I  remember.  It  is  never  taken 
outside  America. 

That  intermission  possibly  gave  Australasia  the  cup.  When  the  players 
returned,  Williams  had  in  some  unaccountable  way  entirely  forgotten  the 
way  tn  play  Brookes'  service,  and  never  had  a  chance.  He  foozled  his 
backhand  in  just  the  same  way  as  Brookes  returned  the  services  there,  and 
closed  in  to  the  net.  But  just  as  probably  Brookes  was  rested  by  the  interval, 
and  helped  by  the  kindly  advice  from  Alf  Dunlop  to  "go  in  and  win"  as  he 
re-entered  the  arena.  He  gained  confidence  from  the  evident  conviction  he 
saw  in  Dunlop  that  he  had  only   to  attack  to  win. 

He  won  Williams'  first  .service  to  15  by  two  returns  to  the  backhand,  and 
taking  the  net  on  them,  so  causing  Williams  to  hit  out.  He  scored  by  a 
hard  drive  after  a  rally,  and  then  with  a  fine  volley  of  a  weak  backhand. 
He  won  his  own  service  to  15.  A  double  fault,  and  Williams  looked  as  feeble 
as  in  the  first  set.  But  the  colt  held  his  own  then  for  two  of  his  own 
services  by  the  fineness  of  his  deliveries,  and  the  following  volleys.  But 
he  was  finding  the  services  breaking  all  ways  and  could  not  handle  them,  and 
at  3/2  Brookes  took  his  service  to  love,  only  two  balls  coming  back  to  be 
finished. 

In  the  next  game  Brookes  showed  fine  back  court  play,  winning  a  long  rally, 
and  led,  0/30,  by  his  next  return.  But  the  colt  came  back  with  a  rush n and 
took  four  points,  one  a  perfect  clean  half-volley  of  a  fine  return.  But 
Brookes  was  too  severe  in  the  next  game,  in  spite  of  fine  attempts  to  pass  by 
Williams.  He  was  closing  in  better.  The  last  service,  at  40/30,  was  a  curly 
one  and  was  netted.      5/3:  Brookes  leads. 

Williams  netted  a  high  volley  of  a  ball  going  out  and  then  netted  an  easy 
high  backhand  volley  of  the  return.  Brookes  netted  in  the  next  rally  and 
sent  a  high  return  which  Williams  might  have  scored.  But  he  let  it  go — to 
fall  just  in.     15/40. 

TWO  DAVIS  CUP  POINTS. 

A  fine  service  was  returned,  but  Williams  witht  rare  courage  again  let  it 
pass — to  go  just  out.  Then  he  served,  and  hesitated  whether  to  go  in  or  not. 
He  was  lost,  for  Brookes  seized  the  chance  with  remarkable  quickness  of 
thought  and  execution.  He  returned,  deep  to  the  backhand,  and  rushed  right 
into  the  net.  There  he  stood  with  the  keenness  of  an  eagle  ready  to  pounce 
on  any  return.  Too  iate  Williams  had  started  to  go  in  to  the  net  himself. 
He  was  caught  half  way  in.  made  a  gallant  attempt  at  a  backhand  half- 
volley  and  failed  to  get  the  ball  near  the  top  of  the  net. 

The  Davis  Cup  was  again  in  the  custody  of  Australasia.  America's  long 
quest  was  again   commenced. 

But  there  was  still  another  match  to  play.  One  might  with  a  feeling  of 
purest  sportsmanship  have  wished  that  the  match  between  Wilding  and 
McLoughlin  might  have  been  left  to  determine  the  issue  so  that  their  merits 
in   an   actual   fight   on   which    the   cup   depended   could    have   been   determined. 

McLoughlin  served  first  and  with  such  pace  on  every  stroke  that  Wilding 
had  no  chance  to  get  going,  or  to  score  a  point.  He  rushed  Wilding's 
services  with  equal  impetuosity  in  the  next  game  and  there  was  no  attempt 
now  to  use  his  backhand.  Right  through  M*uc  ran  round  to  get  the  ball  on 
his  forehand,  and  then  hit  with  all  his  might.  Wilding  only  got  two  points. 
And  he  got  none  in  the  next  game,  for  again  he  had  a  whirlwind  of  energy 
against   him. 

But  Wilding  is  notably  a  slow  starter  and  never  worried  an  atom.  He 
got  going  himself  in  the  next  game,  taking  his  own  service  to  love.  In  the 
next  game  he  stood  in  close  to  the  base  line,  and  took  Mac's  services  on  the 
rise,  as  he  had  in  the  doubles,  steadily  and  well.  His  backhand  strokes 
were  splendily  placed.     3/i*  ;  McLoughlin  leads. 

But  the  latter  rose  at  the  resistance  to  a  still  more  furious  burst  of  energy. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  47 

He  served  and  drove  and  volleyed  with  the  fury  of  a  tiger.  It  is  almost  im- 
possible to  understand  how  any  human  being  can  hurl  himself  at  every  ball  so 
furiously  and  for  so  long  without  collapsing.  So  he  took  two  ganies,  and 
led.  5/2,  Wilding  only  scoring  three  points  in  these  two  games.  But  Wilding 
made  a  fine  effort  in  the  last  game  of  the  set.  in  which  there  were  six 
deuces,  and  in  which  he  answered  the  impetuosity  of  the  colt  with  play  of  the 
utmost  steadiness. 

McLoughlin  kept  up  his  rush  in  the  second  set.  and  the  contrast  between 
the  game  he  was  now  playing  and  that  he  had  played  against  Brookes  was 
most  noticeable.  One  was  all  fury-  The  other  all  delicacy  and  finesse  till 
the  moment  came  for  energy.  And  the  earlier  method,  used  against  Brookes, 
is  the  higher  class,  though  not  so  attractive,  nor  so  easily  understood. 

But  Wilding  held  his  own  services  to  2-aIl.  He  was  compelled  to  do  an 
immense  amount  of  chasing  to  recover  Mac's  volleys,  which  wire  sharply 
angled,  but  Wilding  recovered  finely  and  several  times  scored  clean  from  hard 
drives  right  past  Mac  close  in.  Mac  took  his  third  service  to  15,  but 
Wilding  took  his  to  love. 

But  the  "Comet"  was  only  three  ganies  off  the  set  and  that  was  close 
enough  for  him  to  go  for  a  finish.  He  actually  scored  those  three  games  to 
three  points,  one  in  each  game,  and  they  were  over  so  quickly  that  Wilding 
was  left  no  time  to  work  out  a  scheme.  A  terrific  service  and  a  fierce  volley 
was  all  there  was  to  Mac's  service  games.  On  Wilding's  service  it  was  a 
catlike  jump,  a  rush  at  the  ball,  and  if  it  came  back  it  was  killed  by  another 
drive  or  a  furious  volley,  made  as  he  rushed  across  the  court  at  full  speed. 
I  rather  wondered,  though,  why  Wilding  did  not  notice  that  Mac  was 
starting  to  run  to  take  the  ball  on  his  backhand  before  the  ball  was  struck, 
and  why  he  did  not  therefore  serve  wide  on  Mac's  forehand.  Mac  won  three 
service  aces  running  in  one  game. 

In  the  third  set  even  Mac  had  to  call  a  halt,  and  he  looked  quite  tired 
and  drawn.  It  seemed  to  us  who  looked  on — Brookes,  Williams,  myself 
and  others  clustered  together — that  he  was  all  out  through  the  long  strain 
of  the  whole  contest  and  his  disappointment  over  the  doubles.  Wilding 
also  was  playing  more  seriously,  that  is,  with  more  tactics,  and  was  working 
for  openings.  He  took  the  first  game  with  a  fine  toss  for  the  last  point  and, 
leading  all  through,  won  Mac's  service.  He  scored  one  fine  smash,  after 
having  driven  Mac  back,  and  then  drove  hard  to  Mac's  feet,  as  he  followed 
in  on  his  service,  just  a  shade  more  slowly  through  fatigue.  Again  Wilding 
won  his  service  by  the  most  steady  play  at  all  points.  lie  was  now  playing 
like  a  machine  and  led,  3/0.  He  took  the  next  game  with  finely  judged 
drives.  He  always  was  able  at  this  stage  to  just  give  Mac  too  much  to  do 
to  handle  the  ball.  He  finished  the  next  game  after  deuce  by  two  curly 
services  that  Mac  spooned  out.  Earlier  he  had  not  used  these,  and  went 
only  for  pace,  5/0. 

Mac  tried  hard  to  save  the  love  set,  and  led  at  30/1 5.  But  Wilding 
scored  with  a  fine  backhand  pass,  and  in  the  next  rally  his  low  drive  was 
netted  by  Mac  in  attempting  to  volley.  Wilding  was  within  a  point  of  a  love 
set!  But  Mac  could  not  suffer  that  indignity  and,  after  a  desperate  spurt 
of  his  seemingly  spent  energies,  took  the  game  with  fine  services  that 
Wilding  netted.  He  won  Wilding's  service  by  a  display  even  more  brilliant 
than  ever,  scoring  with  a  superb  variety  of  skill  the  first  point,  with  a  drive, 
a  chop,  and  a  volley — all  splendid  strokes.  Then  he  smote  the  services  four 
times — once  out ;  three  times  for  aces.  But  Wilding  gave  him  no  rest,  and 
answered  by  scoring  against  the  service  by  a  superb  toss  and  at  last,  by  a 
slow  pass,  and  had  the  third  set. 

The  seven  minutes'  spell  then  came,  and  as  the  men  came  out  it  was  clear 
that  Mac  had  benefited  greatly,  but  he  still  looked  tired.  He  took  Wilding's 
service  by  fine  volleying,  and  then  dropped  his  own,  serving  two  doubles.  But 
again  he  took  Wilding's,  winning  the  last  point  by  fine  defensive  volleying. 
Then  a  seeming  miracle  happened.  The  tired  man  suddenly  struck  a  "gusher'' 
of  hidden  energy.  He  won  the  next  twelve  strokes  by  actually  the  most 
unparalleled  burst  of  pace  that  I  have  ever  seen.  Not  only  with  his  services, 
but  even  more  surely  with  his  ferocious  returns,  he  simply  battered  Wilding 
off  the  court.     In  the  fifth  game  he  won  all  four  points  by  forehand  returns.

Wilding  netted  the  first.  In  the  next  it  took  the  return  and  a  drive  to  beat 
Wilding  aside,  and  then 

TELE  HUMAN  CATAPULT 

fired  two  shots  that  Wilding  had  not  even  time  to  move  before  they  had 
struck  the  forehand  corner  and  had  won.  Then  Mac  served  again,  and  only 
one  ball  came  back  into  play.  But  Wilding  even  then  did  not  falter.  He 
gained  a  'vantage.  A  match  point.  But  two  returns  beat  him.  He 
won  his  next  service  to  love,  not  one  ball  coming  back  into  play,  and  led  at 
0/30  in  the  next  game.  Mac  was  again  faltering.  Would  he  break?  He 
assembled  his  scattered  forces,  and  gained  three  more  'vantages,  losing  one 
through  Wilding's  fine  driving,  and  one  by  a  double  fault.  But  he  gained 
the  third  with  a  splendid  smash,  and  then  sent  down  a  tremendous  serve  and 
Wilding  could  only  net  it,  and  the  boy  of  1909  had  avenged  as  Champion  of 
America,  on  both  Brookes  and  Wilding,  the  two  most  famous  players  of  the 
decade,   each   defeat  then   inflicted  at   Sydney   in   Australia. 

Clearly  he  is  the  finest  player  of  the  Davis  Cup  Competition  of  1914  and 
he  is  the  player  of  the  future.  His  sway  cannot  be  long  disputed  by  Brookes 
or  Wilding.     But  there  may   be  others  to  come?     Who  can   say? 

And  R.  N.  Williams,  2nd,  answered  in  the  championship.  But  that  is  out- 
side my  arena.

AN  APPRECIATION   OF  AMERICAN   HOSPITALITY. 

It  is  perhaps  outside  the  scope  of  this  account  for  me  to  express  the  deep' 
appreciation  I  feel  of  the  many  kindnesses  extended  to  me  in  America, 
which  is  I  am  sure  due  to  no  merit  on  my  part  but  to  the  innate  hospitality 
of  Americans.  And  it  was  not  so  much  what  was  done  by  your  team  and 
officials  and  Mr.  Dwight  Davis.  I  am  sure  that  if  the  great  amount  of  work 
that  the  preparations  for  the  cup  entailed  in  all  and  the  distractions  and 
worries  that  arose  out  of  the  war  had  not  inevitably  demanded  all  the  time 
of  your  votaries  I  should  have  been  overwhelmed  with  kindnesses.  I  saw 
that  in  San  Francisco,  where  Mr.  Carl  R.  Gardner  and  Dr.  Sumner  Hardy 
nearly  made  me  miss  my  boat  with  their  hospitality.  What  I  appreciated 
was  the  kindly  spirit.  Let  me  close  therefore  by  saying  that  all  I  ask  is 
that  any  American  enthusiast  who  comes  to  Sydney  will  look  me  up  and 
allow  me  to  return  to  him  some  of  the  courtesies  extended  to  me,  which  I 
shall  always  remember  as  the  most  hearty  of  my  trip  in  any  part  of  the 
world. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  51 


National    Championship 

Bx  F.  B.  Alexander. 

The  thirty-fourth  tournament  for  the  national  championship  of  the  United 
States,  in  singles,  for  1914,  witnessed  an  entry  list  of  138  experts.  Almost 
all  of  the  experts  of  the  United  States  took  part,  but  much  to  the  disap- 
pointment of  the  lovers  of  the  game  the  expected  international  atmosphere 
was  lacking,  N.  E.  Brookes,  the  great  Victorian,  and  A.  F.  Wilding,  the 
equally  well  known  New  Zealander,  defaulting  in  the  first  round.  This,  in 
a  manner,  seemed  to  take  away  some  of  the  interest  at  the  start,  but  the 
general  high  standard  of  play  by  the  home  talent  throughout  and  the  number 
of  close  matches  soon  revived  the  enthusiasm. 

The  first  round  witnessed  the  defeat  of  the  old  expert  and  member  of  the 
famous  Wrenn  Brothers'  team,  G.  L.  Wrenn.  by  Basil  WTagner.  by  a  score  of 
7/5,  7/5,  6/1,  the  old  internationalist  tiring  badly  in  the  last  set.  In  the 
second   round   "the  class"   came   through  without  an   upset. 

The  match  between  W.  M.  Hall  and  I.  C.  Wright  was  particularly  well 
played.  Hall  showed  a  lack  of  practice  and  in  consequence  was  not  as 
steady  as  usual.  This  and  the  fact  that  Wright's  cut  strokes  bothered  him 
considerably  proved  his  undoing.  Hall,  after  being  two  sets  down,  pulled  the 
third  set  out  of  the  fire,  8/6,  only  to  lose  the  fourth  and  match,  at  6/4. 
W.  M.  W^ashburn  had  much  trouble  with  B.  C.  Law\  only  defeating  him  after 
four  sets  of  fast  play.  William  M.  Johnston,  the  Californian,  took  C.  M. 
Bull,  Jr.,  into  camp  in  straight  sets. 

The  third  round  saw  the  beginning  of  the  really  exciting  work,  the  best 
match  being  that  between  R.  N.  Williams.  2nd,  and  W.  M.  Johnston,  and 
though  Williams  won,  with  something  to  spare.  Johnston  forced  him  hard  all 
the  way.  The  first  set  was  particularly  hard  fought.  Williams  winning  at 
9/7.  The  second  set  had  no  sooner  started  than  Williams  showed  his  old 
wildness.  His  drives,  taken  from,  or  even  before  the  top  of  the  bound,  were 
either  catching  the  tape  of  the  net  or  missing  the  side  lines  by  inches,  and 
Jbhnston  took  the  set  at  6/3.  The  last  two  sets  were  fairly  easy  for 
Williams,  he  never  being  in  danger. 

A.  S.  Dabney  and  S.  H.  Voshell  of  Boston  and  New  York,  respectively, 
performed  a  Marathon  for  the  benefit  of  the  spectators.  Voshell,  after  being 
two  sets  down,  the  second  one,  by  the  way.  going  to  a  score  of  16/14,  one 
of  the  longest  on  record,  pulled  out  the  next  two  sets,  and  was  several  times 
within  an  ace  of  victory  before  Dabney  finally  won  the  fifth  at  8/6. 

R.  L.  Murray  breezed  through  Wagner  in  straight  sets,  the  latter  seemingly 
being  unable  to  handle  the  terrific  service  of  the  Californian  "southpaw." 
W.  J.  Clothier  ran  away  with  R.  D.  Little,  who  had  entered  the  tourna- 
ment with  no  preparation.  Harold  Throckmorton,  the  schoolboy,  astonished 
the  natives  by  defeating  the  veteran  Chauncey  Seaver  in  a  hard  five-set 
match.  The  youngster  showed  hard  hitting  ability  and  stamina.  E.  C.  Mc- 
Cormack.  the  California  interscholastic  champion,  took  a  well  earned  set 
from  G.  P.  Gardner.  Jr. 

The  fourth  round  ably  upheld  the  traditions  of  the  national  championships, 
with  three  hard  five-set  matches.  F.  C.  Inman  of  New  York  defeated  Harry 
Johnson  of  Boston  in  five  hard  sets,  the  match  being  a  toss-up  until  the  last 
stroke  was  played.  G.  F.  Touchard  then  got  into  a  long  winded  court  argu- 
ment with  E.  H.  Whitney,  the  Harvard  University  captain,  which  was  only 
settled  by  a  score  of  lli/lO  in  favor  of  the  former  in  the  fifth  set.  N.  W. 
Niles  defeated  D.  Mathey  in  straight  sets  with  unexpected  ease.  C.  A. 
Major  downed  Sidney  Thayer,  Jr..  in  five  sets.  Williams  easily  settled  Dab- 
noy's  aspirations,  allowing  him  only  eight  games  in  three  sets.  LeRoy  put 
up  a  good  exhibition  against  Behr  and  managed  to  earn  a  set  from  "The 
Orator."  Irving  Wright  was  unable  to  make  any  impression  on  the  great 
McLoughlin,    getting   only   three  games   in   the   same   number   of   sets.      G.    P. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  53 

Gardner,  Jr.,  also  put  out  the  veteran  base  line  expert  Richard  Stevens  in 
straight  sets. 

Again,  in  the  fifth  round,  G.  F.  Touchard  ran  into  an  endurance  contest, 
five  sets  being  required  before  he  had  settled  with  Tnman.  The  Fottrell- 
Niles  match  was  a  hummer,  both  men  excelling  in  their  services  and  net 
play,  Fottrell  finally  winning  in  four  sets,  two  of  which  went  to  deuce. 
The  Behr-Murray  match  was  the  star  event  of  the  day.  Behr  started  off 
poorly,  dropping  the  first  set  and  seemingly  being  unable  to  get  control  of  his 
ground  strokes.  A  reversal  of  form  took  place  in  the  second,  which  Behr 
won  at  6/2.  The  third  set  found  both  men  playing  at  the  top  of  their 
game,  with  Behr  breaking  through  Murray's  service  at  the  critical  time. 
and  winning  the  set  7/5.  In  the  fourth  set  Behr  again  grew  wild  and 
Murray  won  the  set  at  1/3,  leading  all  the  way.  The  fifth  set  was  a  dogged 
ding  dong  affair,  both  men  being  undoubtedly  weary,  but  playing  excellent 
tennis,  at  that.     Behr  finally  won  at  8/6. 

Clothier  defeated  Washburn  with  unexpected  ease,  and  much  to  the  sur- 
prise of  the  knowing  ones.  Wallace  Johnson  ran  through  T.  R.  Pell,  after 
losing  the  first  set.  McLoughlin  and  Williams  won  their  matches  with  ease, 
and  Griffin,  the  Californian.  received  a  walkover  from  G.   F.   Gardner,  Jr. 

In  the  sixth  round  the  best  match  was  the  one  between  McLoughlin  and 
Griffin.  This  was  practically  McLoughlin's  first  hard  match,  as  he  had  the 
easy  side  of  the  draw.  Griffin  ended  up  by  taking  the  third  set,  after  the 
champion  had  breezed  through  the  first  two  to  the  tune  of  6/1.  6/4.  Much 
to  the  surprise  of  all  he  then  forced  him  to  8/6  in  the  fourth  and  deciding 
set.  There  is  no  question  that  McLoughlin.  notwithstanding  Griffin's  fine 
play,  did  not  show  the  keenness  of  the  "wonder  of  the  internationals."  There 
was  a  marked  listlessness  about  his  play,  which  did  not  coincide  with  his 
usual  brilliant  and  peppery  work.  Clothier  defeated  his  brother  Philadelphian 
Johnson   in  straight  sets. 

Williams  showed  what  a  wonderful  game  his  is  when  at  its  top  by  de- 
feating Behr  in  straight  sets,  Behr  remarking  afterward  that  he  had  never 
felt  so  utterly  helpless  on  a  court  before.  Touchard's  two  previous  five-set 
matches  made  him  an  easy  mark  for  Fottrell,  the  tall  Californian  allowing 
him   but  five  games. 

The  semi-finals  witnessed  two  straight  set  victories,  in  each  half  the  East 
being  opposed  to  the  West.  Williams,  in  the  upper  half,  disposed  of  Fottrell 
with  unexpected  ease.  The  terrific  service  of  the  Californian  seemed  to  have 
no  terrors  for  the  European  taught  Easterner.  Fottrell's  service,  which  had 
so  far  held  his  opponents  at  bay,  had  no  terrors  for  the  Williams  of  that 
day.  The  fast,  high  bound  seemed  to  suit  him  to  perfection  and  he  was 
never  in  difficulties. 

Williams'  game  throughout  the  tournament  had  been  showing  constant 
improvement  and  this  match  was  a  worthy  predecessor  to  the  greatest  match 
of  his  career,  which  was  to  come  the  following  day. 

The  other  semi-final  in  the  lower  half  was  better  fought,  though  Mc- 
Loughlin always  held  the  mastery.  Clothier,  as  he  always  does,  fought 
hard  for  every  point,  but  was  compelled  to  lower  his  colors  in  the  end. 

The  match  to  decide  the  championship  was  played  under  perfect  condi- 
tions, and  before  a  record  Newport  crowd,  on  the  new  championship  court. 
Both  Williams  and  McLoughlin  were  confident  of  winning.  The  prevalence 
of  opinion  being  that  McLoughlin  would  win,  but  not  till  after  a  hard  fight. 
Williams  surprised  his  own  admirers  from  the  start  by  jumping  into  the 
lead  and  after  breaking  through  the  "California  Comet's"  bullet-like  service, 
winning  the  first  set  at  6/3.  McLoughlin  braced  in  the  second  set,  which 
was  replete  with  excellent  play,  but  Williams  did  not  falter.  His  strokes 
were  well  nigh  perfect  in  their  accuracy  and  his  bad  habit  of  double  faulting 
on  his  service  had  disappeared  entirely.  In  fact,  he  was  winning  his  services 
with  ease,  while  McLoughlin  was  fighting  desperately  to  hold  his  own.  The 
end  came  when  Williams  broke  through  the  "Comet's"  service  and  took  the 
second  set  at  8/6. 

To  the  experts  about  the  court  it  seemed  impossible  to  believe  that  anyone 
could  keep  up  the  terrific  pace  which  Williams  had  set  in  the  first  two 
periods  of  play,  and  a  let  down  was  freely  predicted.     Indeed,  several   times

in  the  third  set  the  coming  champion  was  perilously  close  to  defeat,  but  each 
time  an  added  burst  of  speed,  or  a  beautifully  executed  stroke  would  save 
him.  McLoughlin  fought  against  defeat  with  his  usual  undaunted  courage, 
but  it  is  safe  to  say  that  Williams  simply  could  not  be  defeated  on  that 
day.  This  set  went  to  twenty  games  before  a  new  king  of  the  tennis  world 
was  crowned  and  the  title  returned  to  the  East  after  an  absence  of  two 
years.  - 

Many  discussions  have  arisen  as  to  whether  McLoughlin's  strenuous  cam- 
paign had  not  left  him  stale,  but  it  must  be  recalled  that  Williams  had  had 
an  equally  hard,  if  not  harder,  season,  and  not  only  that,  but  a  harder  path 
through  the  tournament.  Therefore,  acknowledgment  must  be  made  that 
on   that   day   Williams  was   undoubtedly   superior.

The    Challenge    Match   for   the   Doubles 
Championship  of  the  United  States 

By  F.  B.  Alexander. 

A  perfect  day  ushered  in  the  blue  ribbon  event  of  the  United  States  in 
doubles.  Conditions  when  the  four  men  took  the  championship  court  were 
well  nigh  perfect,  though  the  Newport  tennis  enthusiasts  were  somewhat 
slow  in  arriving  and  getting  seated.  A  round  of  applause  greeted  the  four 
players.  MeLoughlin  and  Bundy,  the  defenders,  and  Church  and  Mathey, 
the  challengers,  who  lost  no  time  in  getting  warmed  up.  On  account  of  the 
excellent  showing  of  the  young  team,  Church  and  Mathey,  in  an  exhibition 
match  against  the  second  Australasian  team,  Messrs.  Doust  and  Dunlop,  the 
week  preceding,  at  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills,  L.  I.,  the  "wise 
ones"  expected  a  hard  contest  with  the  balance  in  favor  of  the  holders,  due 
to  their  greater  experience.  The  match  started  slowly,  all  four  men  feeling 
their  way  and  each  team  playing  carefully.  Church  and  Mathey  warmed  up 
to  their  work  more  quickly  than  the  veterans  and,  showing  the  same  burst  of 

s] d   which   had   been    noticeable   in    their   matches   all    season,    jumped   into 

tin'  lead  at  4/2.  This  turned  out,  however,  to  be  a  mere  flash  in  the  pan, 
as  for  some  unknown  reason  the  game  of  the  challengers  became  erratic,  the 
easiest  kind  of  shots  being  missed.  Mathey's  usually  steady  but  powerful 
ground  strokes  went  sadly  astray  and  he  repeatedly  double  faulted.  Church 
was  almost  as  great  an  offender  in  his  overhead  work,  usually  so  consistent, 
and  showed  none  of  the  fine  volleying  of  which  he  is  capable.  McLoughlin's 
game  was  but  mediocre  and  all  Bundy  did  was  to  play  excellent,  steady  tennis. 
The  second  set  was  a  repetition  of  the  latter  part  of  the  first,  only  even 
more  demoralized,  MeLoughlin  showing  improvement  but  getting  little  of  the 
play. 

The  third  set,  up  to  the  last  few  games,  could  be  put  in  the  same  class  as 
the  second.  Towards  the  end.  however,  with  the  champions  leading  by  a 
safe  margin.  Church  showed  a  bit  of  his  fighting  spirit  and  with  a  correspond- 
ing brace  on  the  part  of  Mathey  they  crawled  up  to  within  striking  distance. 
An  excellently  served  game  by  MeLoughlin  put  a  stop  to  the  eleventh  hour 
rally  and  gave  the  championship  for  the  third  time  in  succession  to  the 
Pacific  Coast  team.  To  summarize  the  match  in  a  few  words  it  may  be  said 
that  Church  and  Mathey  undoubtedly  played  far  below  form  and  that 
MeLoughlin  and  Bundy  were  compelled  at  no  time  to  extend  themselves. 

The  scores  were  6/4,  6/2,  6/4.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  57 


National  Preliminary  Doubles 

The  National  Preliminary  Doubles,  an  event  to  select  the  challengers  of 
M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  T.  C.  Bundy  for  the  national  championship,  was  decided 
on  the  courts  of  the  Onwentsia  Club  of  Lake  Forest,  111.,  August  4  and  5.  The 
winners  of  the  final  round  being  George  M.  Church  and  Dean  Mathey. 

The  drawings  brought  the  Western  champions,  Church  and  Mathey,  against 
the  Southern  champions,  Irving  C.  Wright  and  J.  B.  Adoue,  Jr.,  and  the  Pa- 
cific Coast  champions,  William  M.  Johnston  and  Clarence  J.  Griffin,  against 
the  Eastern  winners,  Karl  H.  Behr  and  T.  R.  Pell. 

The  first  of  the  matches  was  unproductive  of  highclass  tennis.  Wright  and 
Adoue  battled  valiantly  throughout  to  turn  the  tide  in  their  favor,  but  Church 
and  Mathey  were  at  the  top  of  their  game  and  never  gave  the  Southerners  a 
look-in.  Only  once  in  the  entire  match  did  the  Southern  players  lead  and  that 
spurt  came  in  the  first  game  of  the  first  set. 

Great  interest  was  centered  in  the  contest  between  the  East  and  Pacific 
Coast,  owing  to  the  fact  that  it  marked  the  first  appearance  of  Behr  and 
Johnson  on  Chicago  courts.  The  interest  was  more  than  justified,  for  the 
most  spectacular  tennis  seen  at  Onwentsia  since  Touchard  and  Little  defeated 
McLoughlin   and  Bundy   was   exhibited. 

All  four  men  played  wonderful  tennis  at  times.  Behr,  except  for  his  errors 
overhead,  was  perhaps  the  most  brilliant.  Johnston,  however,  was  very  ef- 
fective with  his  forehand  drive  and  had  Griffin  played  the  tennis  of  which  he 
is  capable  the  result  might  easily  have  been  different.  The  Eastern  team 
finally  won  after  losing  the  first  and  third  sets. 

The  final  match  brought  the  Eastern  and  Western  teams  together,  the  latter 
winning  in  spectacular  style.  The  victory  of  Church  and  Mathey  was  due 
almost  entirely  to  their  brilliant  team  work.  On  the  other  hand,  the  rather 
poor  showing  of  Behr  and  Pell  was  principally  attributed  to  the  nervousness 
of  Behr,  who  fell  down  badly  at  critical  times  and  his  lack  of  condition  seemed 
to  spoil  his  whole  game.     The  summary  : 

G.  M.  Church  and  D.  Mathey,  Western  champions,  d.  Irving  C.  Wright  and  J.  B. 
Adoue,  Jr.,  Southern  champions,  6/4,  6/1,  6/2:  K.  H.  Behr  and  T.  K.  Pell,  Eastern 
champions,  d.  W.  M.  Johnston  and  ('.  J.  Griffin,  Pacific  ('east  champions,  4/6.  6/2,  1/6, 
7/5,  6/3.     FINAL  ROUND— Church  and  Mathey  d.  Behr  and  Pell,  6/3,  6/4,  4/6,  7/5. 


MISS    MART    BROWNE, 


WILLIAMS, 


Miss  Browne  was  the  winner  in  singles  and  paired  with  Mrs.  Williams  was  victorious 
in  doubles  at  the  National  championships.  She  also  succeeded  in  annexing  the 
mixed  doubles  title  with  W.  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  as  partner. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  59 


National   Championships  for  Women 

Miss  Mary  Browne  of  Los  Angeles,  Calif.,  for  the  third  successive  year,  won 
three  national  titles — singles,  doubles  and  mixed  doubles — at  the  national 
women's  championishp  held  at  the  Philadelphia  Cricket  Club,  St.  Martin's, 
near  Philadelphia,  from  June  8  to  12.  This  performance  equals  that  of  Miss 
Hazel  Hotchkiss,  champion  in  1909,  1910  and  1911,  and  gives  her  permanent 
possession  of  the  challenge  cup.  which  was  placed  in  competition  in  1912. 
Miss  Browne  now  needs  but  one  more  win  to  equal  the  record  of  Miss  Elizabeth 
H.  Moore  as  a  four-time  winner  of  the  championship. 

Miss  Browne's  challenger  was  Miss  Marie  Wagner  of  New  York,  who  had 
come  through  the  tournament  without  great  difficulty.  The  match  which  en- 
sued was  altogether  one-sided.  Miss  Wagner  making  no  effective  resistance  in 
the  first  and  third  sets,  while  Miss  Browne  was  just  as  helpless  in  the  second. 
The  title  holder  had  plenty  of  speed  and  played  a  well  judged  game  through- 
out, but  she  did  not  follow  in  on  her  service  nor  did  she  go  to  the  net  with 
any  consistency. 

In  the  first  round  of  the  doubles  Mrs.  Sullivan's  net  play  and  Miss  C.  B. 
Neely's  steadiness  in  the  back  court  brought  the  pair  victory  in  the  first  set 
against  Miss  Wagner  and  Miss  Cassel,  but  they  could  get  no  farther.  Miss 
Browne  and  Mrs.  Williams  then  removed  Miss  Wagner  and  Miss  Cassel  with 
surprising  ease.  Both  the  semi-final  matches  were  disappointing.  Miss  Eliza- 
beth H.  Moore  and  Mrs.  C.  N.  Beard  were  inexplicably  weak  against  the 
champions,  winning  only  one  game  in  the  match. 

It  was  thought  that  Mrs.  Raymond  and  Miss  Edna  Wildey  might  stay  the 
march  of  Miss  Browne  and  Mrs.  Williams,  but  their  lack  of  aggressiveness  and 
inability  to  kill  all  loose  balls  nullified  their  efforts.  They  were  defeated 
in  straight  but  close  sets. 

The  mixed  event  was  full  of  surprises  and  upsets.  Two  strong  teams  fell 
by  the  wayside  in  the  first  round — Miss  Isabel  Pendleton  and  Wallace  F. 
Johnson  and  Miss  Edna  Wildey  and  II.  M.  Tilden.  their  conquerors  being  Miss 
Eleanor  Carey  and  J.  T.  Thayer  and  Mrs.  Willard  Sullivan  and  F.  E.  Xewbold, 
respectively  :  both  matches  required  three  sets.  In  the  second  round  Miss 
Dorothy  Disston  and  Aleck  Thayer  took  the  measure  of  Miss  Moore  and  E.  B. 
Dewhurst,  as  did  Miss  Carey  and  Thayer  that  of  Mrs.  Sullivan  and  Xewbold; 
while  Miss  Sheafe  and  C.  S.  Rogers  beat  Miss  White  and  J.  R.  Carpenter.  Jr. 
There  was  another  upset  in  the  third  round  when  Mrs.  Smith  and  A.  E.  Ken- 
nedy won  from  Miss  Sheafe  and  Rogers:  and  in  the  next  round  the  victors 
lost  to  Miss  Myers  and  J.  R.  Rowland.  In  the  final  round  the  latter  pair  could 
make  no  headway  against  Miss  Browne  and  W.  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  losing  in  straight 
sets. 

In  the  men's  event  the  finalists  were  W.  T.  Tilden,  Jr.,  and  J.  R.  Carpenter, 
Jr.,  as  in  191.'!;  and  the  former  won  in  four  sets  after  an  interesting  match.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL  61 

Fifth  Clay  Court  Championships 

By  Gordon   E.  Small. 

The  fifth  annual  tournament  for  the  national  clay  court  championship  was 
held  by  the  Ohio  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  on  the'  courts  of  the  Cincinnati 
Tennis  Club,  July  11   to  18,   1914. 

It  is  safe  to  say  that  this  tournament  was  the  greatest  ever  held  in  Cincin- 
nati. The  play  was  spectacular  throughout,  and  as  a  result  big  galleries  were 
attracted  throughout  the  week.  The  entry  list  was  large,  and  included  four 
of  the  renowned  California  players,  as  well  as  many  prominent  throughout 
the  Middle  West.  The  California  contingent,  Elia  Fottrell,  Clarence  J.  Griffin, 
Claude  Wayne  and  Nat  Browne,  made  Cincinnati  their  first  stop  on  what 
proved  to  be  a  successful  "Eastern  Invasion,*'  and  carried  off  all  the  honors  in 
sight.  In  the  women's  events.  Miss  Mary  Browne,  the  national  champion,  and 
Mrs.  Robert  Williams  of  Chicago,  divided  the  honors  between  them.  Miss 
Browne  winning  in  the  finals  from  Mrs.  Williams,  and  the  pair  winning  the 
doubles. 

In  the  men's  singles  there  were  no  matches  of  prominence  until  the  second 
round  was  reached.  The  feature  of  this  round  was  the  match  between  R.  A. 
Holden,  Jr.,  and  W.  A.  Horrell  of  Arizona.  Horrell  proved  to  be  a  "dark 
horse"  and  gave  Holden,  the  tussle  of  his  life.  Holden  finally  won.  9/7,  !>/7, 
but  the  match  was  very  close,  and  hard  fought,  requiring  nearly  three  hours 
to  complete  it.  Another  interesting  match  was  the  defeat  of  C.  Drummond 
Jones  of  St.  Louis,  by  J.  C.  Mackrell,  Jr.,  of  Pittsburgh. 

In  the  third  round,  Clifford  Lockhorn  of  Cincinnati,  defeated  A.  M.  Kidder, 
the  Princeton  star,  in  a  well  played  match,  while  J.  J.  Armstrong,  of  Harvard, 
eliminated  Mackrell. 

In  the  fourth  round,  Lockhorn  continued  his  good  work  by  putting  out 
Poland  Hoerr  of  St.  Louis.  Fottrell  and  Griffin  eliminated  two  Cincinnati 
"Hopes."  Hunt  and  Hopple,  while  Armstrong  and  Wayne  came  through  in  the 
lower  half  of  the  di-aw  without  trouble. 

The  fifth  round  saw  some  good  tennis  and  brought  the  entire  California 
contingent  through  to  the  semi-finals.  In  the  upper  half,  Nat  Browne,  brother 
of  Mary  Browne,  the  women's  champion,  defeated  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  of  Cin- 
cinnati. Browne  does  not  play  with  the  dash  and  fire  that  is  considered 
typical  of  all  California  players,  but  his  chops  and  placing  shots  are  deadly  in 
their  accuracy.  It  took  two  sets  for  Holden  to  solve  his  game.  Holden  won 
the  third  set  at  G/2.  and  was  going  strong,  when  luckily  for  Browne,  rain 
stopped  the  match.  When  play  was  resumed  the  next  day,  Fottrell  defeated 
Lockhorn  in  a  well  played  match,  in  which  Fottrell's  terrific  serve  proved  the 
undoing  of  his  opponent.  With  the  defeat  of  II.  Truxton  Emerson  by  Griffin, 
the  last  of  the  Cincinnati  players  was  eliminated.  The  best  played  and  most  in- 
teresting match  of  the  round  was  that  between  Joe  Armstrong  of  Harvard,  and 
Claude  Wayne  of  Los  Angeles.  Armstrong,  though  a  much  improved  player, 
met  his  match  in  the  wiry  Californian.  Wayne's  play  was  replete  with  spec- 
:  tacular  dashes  to  the  net,  where  he  made  many  seemingly  impossible  kills. 
He  proved  unusually  steady,  despite  his  vigorous  tactics,  and  won  the  admi- 
ration of  the  large  gallery  by  his  brilliant  work. 

The  semi-finals  brought  Browne  against  Fottrell,  and  Wayne  against  Griffin. 
Fottrell  won  rather  easily,  as  he  was  too  fast  for  Browne,  The  Wayne-Griffin 
match  showed  Griffin  at  his  very  best.  His  placing  shots  down  the  side  lines 
were  perfect.  His  generalship  was  of  a  high  order,  and  he  repeatedly  out- 
guessed  Wayne  for  clean  aces.  Wayne  was  stopped  to  nothing  at  the  net, 
which  played  havoc  with  his  game.  Griffin's  showing  in  this  match  made  him 
an  even  favorite  with  Fottrell  for  the  title,  who,  up  to  this  time,  was  con- 
sidered as  the  sure  winner  of  the  tournament. 

The  final  round,  which  was  played  before  a  record  crowd,  furnished  one 
of  the  most  spectacular  and  dramatic  contests  ever  seen  on  a  tennis  court. 
Fottrell  started  out  like  a  whirlwind.  His  service  was  under  perfect  control, 
and  with  terrific  speed,  combined  with  a  great  top  spin,  baffled  Griffin's  efforts

to  return  it.  The  latter  seemed  nettled  at  his  inability  to  hardle  Fottrell's 
serve,  and  fell  off  in  his  general  play.  He  netted  many  comparatively  easy 
chances  and  failed  to  place  his  shots,  as  in.  his  match  with  Wayne.  The  first 
two  sets  went  to  Pottrell,  6/3,  8/6. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  third  set,  it  was  apparent  that  Fottrell,  who  was 
not  in  the  best  of  condition  physically,  had  staked  all  on  winning  in  straight 
sets.  As  Griffin  began  to  improve,  Fottrell  played  desperately  in  an  effort  to 
bring  the  match  to  a  close.  Griffin  was  not  to  be  denied,  however,  and  hung 
on  like  grim  death.  With  the  score  at  5/4,  and  40/30,  in  Fottrell's  favor, 
came  the  turning  point  of  the  match.  Playing  carefully,  he  worked  Griffin 
from  side  to  side  and  finally  tried  for  the  point  with  a  terrific  drive  down  the 
side  line.  The  ball  struck  the  tape  of  the  net,  bounded  high  in  the  air — and 
fell  back.  The  loss  of  this  point  seemed  to  take  the  heart  out  of  Fottrell,  and 
although  he  won  the  next  game,  Griffin  quickly  ran  out  the  set  amid  great 
applause. 

When  the  players  reappeared  on  the  court  after  the  rest,  the  condition  of 
Fottrell  was  pitiable.  He  was  evidently  completely  exhausted  from  his  terrific 
efforts  in  the  first  three  sets,  but  with  grim  determination  went  in  for  the 
finish.  After  the  first  few  points  had  been  played,  he  determined  to  try  and 
save  his  strength  for  the  last  set,  as  he  made  no  effort  to  "get"  balls  he  could 
not  reach  without  effort.  Griffin  made  short  work  of  this  set,  winning  6/0, 
Fottrell  getting  only  eleven  points. 

At  the  start  of  the  fifth  set  Fottrell  made  a  game  effort  to  "come  back," 
but  after  getting  to  2/3,  he  was  done,  and  Griffin  ran  the  set  out,  6/2. 

Aside  from  Fottrell's  play  in  the  first  set,  the  brand  of  tennis  played  was 
not  remarkable.  As  one  of  the  Cincinnati  papers  said  :  "It  was  magnificent, 
but  it  was  not  tennis."  As  an  exhibition  of  grit,  however,  and  as  a  heart 
breaking  match,  it  will  live  long  in  the  annals  of  the  game.

*  As  John  Strachan  of  San  Francisco,  the  1913  winner,  was  unable  to  make 
the  trip  East  because  of  pressure  of  business,  Griffin  won  the  title  of  national 
clay  court  champion  by  default. 

In  the  final  of  the  men's  doubles,  Wayne  and  Browne  won  rather  easily  over 
Fottrell  and  Griffin,  who  were  in  no  condition,  after  their  gruelling  match,  to 
play  championship  tennis.  The  feature  of  the  contest  was  the  playing  of 
Griffin,  who,  wishing  to  spare  Fottrell.  who  could  hardly  walk,  played  every 
ball  be  could  possibly  reach.  His  smashing  of  lobs  was  the  best  ever  seen  in 
Cincinnati.  Wayne  and  Browne  played  well  together,  however,  and  deserved 
to  win.     The  scores  were,  6/3,  6/4,  6/3. 

In  the  women's  singles,  Miss  Mary  Browne,  the  national  champion  ;  Mrs. 
Robert  Williams  of  Chicago,  Miss  Mary  Shreve  Lyons  of  Louisville,  and  Miss 
Ruth  Sanders  of  Cincinnati  came  through  to  the  semi-finals.  Miss  Lyons 
caused  a  sensation  by  taking  the  first  set  of  her  match  with  Miss  Browne,"  but 
the  latter  came  back  strong  and  won  the  next  two  sets  without  much  trouble. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  65 

Mrs.  Williams  defeated  Miss  Sanders  in  straight  sets,  much  to  the  disappoint- 
ment of  the  gallery,  who  had  visions  of  Cincinnati  being  represented  in  the 
finals.  Mrs.  Williams  was  at  the  top  of  her  game,  however,  and  in  the  final 
forced  Miss  Browne  to  extend  herself  to  the  utmost  to  win.  Mrs.  Williams 
took  the  second  set,  6/3,  and  reached  2-all  in  the  last  set,  from  which  point 
Miss  Browne  ran  out  the  match. 

In  the  women's  doubles.  Miss  Browne  and  Mrs.  Williams  won  over  all 
comers,  without  the  loss  of  a  set,  defeating  Miss  Lyons  of  Louisville,  and  Miss 
Dodd  of  Cincinnati,  in  the  final  round,  6/2,  6/1.     The  summaries  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL.  67 


National   Indoor  Championships 

Gustavo  F.  Touchard,  for  the  third  successive  time,  won  the  annual  National 
Indoor  Lawn  Tennis  Championship,  held  on  the  courts  at  the  Seventh  Regi- 
ment Armory,  New  York,  February  12  to  22.  By  his  victory  Touchard 
obtains  possession  of  the  Seventh  Regiment  Cup,  placed  in  competition  in 
1912.  The  honors  in  the  doubles  were  taken  by  Touchard  and  Watson  M. 
Washburn. 

The  meeting  produced  an  entry  list  of  seventy-three  men  in  the  singles  and 
thirty-two  pail's  in  the  doubles,  as  against  eighty-four  and  forty-two  in  1914. 
On  the  closing  day,  Washington's  Birthday,  the  attendance  was  probabls  the 
largest  ever  present  at  any  of  these  events.  The  weather  during  the  tourna- 
ment was  unusually  good.  There  were  a  few  stormy  days  in  the  early  part 
of  the  meeting,  but  after  that  clear  skies  and  bright  sun  made  the  light  as 
perfect  as  it  can  be  indoors.  On  one  stormy  day  the  lights  were  turned  on  in. 
the  middle  of  the  afternoon  and  this  improved  playing  conditions. 

The  final  round  of  the  singles  brought  together  Touchard  and  Arthur  M. 
Lovibond.  The  latter  was,  if  not  outclassed,  at  least  outplayed.  Touchard 
would  work  him  out  of  position  and  then  hit  for  the  point  :  or  shoot  the 
ball  to  the  line  with  unerring  precision,  or  come  to  the  net  and  volley 
sharply  for  the  point.  Occasionally  Lovibond  would  earn  a  shot,  but  most 
of  the  time  it  would  come  to  him  through  Touchard's  errors  as  the  latter 
tried  for  the  most  difficult  of  shots.  Coolness,  steadiness,  and  a  thoroughly 
sound  game  carried  Lovibond  to  the  final  round,  but  in  Touchard  he  more 
than  met  his  match. 

The  strongest  pairs  in  the  tournament,  Touchard  and  Washburn  and  Karl 
H.  Behr  and  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell,  met  in  the  final  round  of  the  doubles. 
A  magnificent  five-set  match  ensued,  in  which  the  thousand  odd  spectators 
were  thrilled  by  the  sight  of  the  most  brilliant  play,  some  of  the  rallies 
being  scintillating  and  evoking  prolonged  applause.  Touchard  and  Behr  were 
the  stars,  and  the  former  excelled  the  latter  chiefly  because  he  equalled  him 
in  brilliance  and  surpassed  him  in  steadiness,  especially  in  the  pinches.  The 
two  men  were  plainly  out  to  outplay  each  other,  and  the  way  each  singled 
out  the  other  and  gave  him  his  most  scintillating  shots  was  thrilling  in  the 
extreme.  Washburn  and  Pell  gave  their  partners  excellent  support,  and 
occasionally  almost  equalled  them  in  brilliance. 

In  the  fifth  and  deciding  set,  Washburn  served  out  the  first  game,  and 
then  Behr  was  broken  through  in  a  game  brimful  of  brilliant  play.  Defeat 
was  stayed  for  a  few  minutes  by  the  win  of  Touchard's  service,  followed  by 
Pell's.  But  the  end  was  almost  in  sight.  Behr  was  again  broken  through 
and  Touchard  and  Washburn  led  at  5/3.  With  only  their  service  game  to 
win.  Touchard  and  Washburn  got  to  40/15,  and  then  Behr  and  Pell  made 
their  last  stand.  They  brought  the  score  to  deuce  and  then  to  advantage, 
only  In  have  Behr  net.  Washburn  then  drove  straight  to  Behr  for  the  point; 
and  then,  after  a  prolonged  rally,  Behr  netted,  giving  game,  set  and  match 
to  the  opposing  side.     The  summaries  :

Indoor  Championships  for  Women 

Miss  Marie  Wagner  of  Now  York  won  in  singles  for  the  fifth  time,  nt  the 
seventh  annual  Indoor  Championship  tor  Women.  The  tournament  was  held 
as  usual  a1  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory.  New  York,  from  March  14  to  19. 
In  the  doubles.  Miss  Wagner  and  Mrs.  Theodore  Cassebeer,  formerly  Miss 
Clara  Kuttroff,  the  1913  champions,  were  defeated  in  the  third  round,  and 
Mrs.  S.  Pullerton  Weaver  and  Miss  Clare  Casse'.,  both  of  New  York,  became 
champions  of  1014. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  69 

The  entry  list,  as  in  recent  years,  was  more  local  in  character  than  a  na- 
tional events  should  be.  Miss  Wagner's  opponent  in  the  final  round  of  the 
singles  was.  as  in  the  previous  year.  Mrs.  C.  N.  Beard,  but  a  much  closer  and 
better  match  resulted.  Mrs.  Frederick  Schmitz.  a  former  holder  of  the  title, 
and  Miss  Clare  Cassel  were  the  most  formidable  of  the  other  contenders. 

In  the  doubles  the  entry  was  better  and  the  contests  were  more  closely 
fought  and  more  exciting.  Mrs.  Weaver  and  Miss  Cassel  won  in  excellent 
style,  defeating  Mrs.  Schmitz  and  Mrs.  Marshall  McLean,  the  latter  making 
her  first  appearance  in  these  championships. 

In  the  final  of  the  singles.  Miss  Wagner  had  all  the  better  of  it  in  the  first 
set  and  most  of  the  third.  Both  played  cautiously.  The  pair  placed  well,  but 
at  times  were  very  erratic,  Miss  Wagner's  good  streaks,  however,  came  at  the 
right  time  and  enabled  her  to  win. 

The  final  of  the  doubles  was  an  exciting  match.  Mrs.  Weaver  was  a  stone- 
wall at  the  net,  while  Miss  Cassel  was  tireless  in  the  back  court  and  drove 
sharply  and  effectively.  Both  Mrs.  Schmitz  and  Mrs.  McLean  were  unsteady 
at  critical  times,  the  former  chiefly  in  her  net  shots  and  the  latter  in  the 
back  of  the  eourt.  The  slightest  thing,  however,  would  have  changed  the 
result.     The  summaries  :

BROOKES   VS.    WILPIXG— FOR    ENGLISH   CHAMPIONSHIP. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  71 


All-England  Championships 

Norman  E.  Brookes  succeeded  Anthony  F.  Wilding  as  All-England  cham- 
pion in  the  tournament  played  at  Wimbledon,  in  June.  1914.  He  defeated 
O.  Froitzheim  of  Germany  in  the  fln:il  round,  and  then  won  from  Wilding 
in  the  challenge  round.  The  doubles  honors  were  captured  by  Brookes 
and  Wilding,  who  easily  defeated  A.  II.  Lowe  and  F.  G.  Lowe  in  the  final 
round. 

In  the  final  round  of  the  women's  singles  the  issue  rested  between  Mrs. 
Larcombe  and  Miss  Elizabeth  Ryan  of  California,  U.  S.  A.  The  latter  found 
the  net  with  too  many  of  Mrs.  Larcombe's  servere  cuts  and  was  defeated, 
6/4.  6/3.  In  the  doubles,  Mrs.  Larcombe  and  Mrs.  Hannam  met  the  Misses 
Morton  and  Ryan  in  the  final  round,  and  won  without  the  loss  of  a  set. 
The  mixed  doubles  was  taken  by  Mrs.  Larcombe  and  Parke. 

There  were  102  entries  in  the  championship,  but  only  Brookes,  Froitzheim 
and  Parke  were  considered.  Against  Brookes'  chance  to  defeat  Wilding  for 
the  title  the  chief  item  was  the  necessity  for  him  to  play  through  while 
Wilding  stood  out. 

The  progress  of  Brookes  to  the  final  round  could  not  be  stayed.  Darin, 
a  likely  voting  Scotchman,  was  unable  to  win  a  single  game.  Ritchie,  a  famous 
English  player,  was  defeated,  6/1,  6/0,  6/1.  Against  A.  W.  Gore,  the  veteran, 
he  had  a  little  difficulty  in  the  first  set.  but  after  that  won  as  he  pleased. 
Then  he  met  Beamish,  another  internationalist,  and  although  the  latter  had 
the  advantage  of  practising  with  Wilding,   he  was  defeated  quite  handily. 

In  the  upper  division  Parke  disposed  of  Dixon.  11/9.  6/1,  6/3.  Then  Parke 
outclassed  F.  G.  Lowe.  6/1,  6/3,  6/4.  Meanwhile  Froitzheim  had  defeated 
Hope  Crisp.  0/2.  3/0.  6/2.  6/2.  Then  Froitzheim  won  from  A.  H.  Lowe, 
6/3.  6/4.  5/7,  10/S.  Parke  and  Froitzheim  now  met,  and  the  German  fairly 
and  squarely  defeated  his  opponent  by  greater  steadiness  and  better  play 
all  around.  "The  scores  were  5/7.  6/2.  9/7,  6/2.  Froitzheim's  next  victim  was 
Mavrogordato,  the  latter  being  simply  worn  down  by  the  German's  rallies. 

Brookes,  in  the  final  round,  at  first  won  with  great  ease,  but  not  in  the 
nature  of  a  runaway.  Froitzheim  was  driving  finely,  but  seemed  staggered  by 
the  strokes  Brookes  played.  The  latter  won  the  first  two  sets,  and  led.  3/1, 
in  the  third.  His  ground  strokes  were  quite  as  good  as  Froitzheim's  and  his 
tosses  also.  But  here  he  slacked,  and  Froitzheim  at  once  took  courage.  He 
rushed  in.  volleyed  and  smashed  and  drove  with  fierce  vigor.  He  captured 
the  third  set.  and  led,  5/1,  in  the  fourth.  Brookes  here  made  an  effort  and 
reached  4/5  by  tennis  as  good  as  at  first.  At  5/4.  however,  the  German 
had  the  service  with  the  sun  behind  him  and  in  Brookes'  eyes,  and  won 
the  game  clearly,  making  two  sets  all. 

Again  a  struggle  ensued,  but  now  each  man  seemed  at  his  best.  Brookes 
led  at  7/6,  Froitzheim  serving,  but  the  former  now  had  the  sun  behind  him. 
and  evidently  realized  it  was  his  best  chance.  By  three  forehand  lift  drives 
of  the  greatest  pace,  that  landed  within  a  yard  of  the  base  line,  he  won 
■  or  compelled  Froitzheim  to  answer  weakly.  But  he  put  his  backhands  over 
the  line  in  trying  too  much  for  depth.  He  at  last  gained  a  match  point,  and, 
intercepting  a  backhand  alley  drive,  scored  clean  by  a  fine  backhand  volley 
almost  on  the  base  line. 

When  Brookes  and  Wilding  met  in  the  challenge  round  it  was  still  hot. 
Wilding  served  and  at  the  iump  Brookes  took  the  net  on  his  returns  which 
were  finelv  played  and  well  judged.  As  predicted.  Wilding  lobbed,  but  Brookes 
potted  away  steadily  and  won  these  rallies.  Wilding  drove  and  Brookes 
volleyed  strongly.  At  C-/4  WMlding  served  and  started  by  good  length  driving 
to  swing  Brookes  from  side  to  side.  Brookes'  court  covering  and  recoveries 
of  drives  was  superb,  and  his  pace  great.  But  Wilding  outdrove  him  and 
took  the  game.  In  the  next  game  the  overspin  and  immense  pace  of  Wilding  s 
drives  was  too  much  for  even  Brookes.      Score  2/4. 

At  this  stage  the  plav  of  each  was  superb,  but  Brookes  placed  the  first 
two  sets  to  his  credit,  and  finally  the  third  and   match.     The  summaries  :

World's  Hard  Court  Championships 

Anthony  F.  Wilding,  confining  himself  to  one  event — the  singles,  in  which 
he  was  the  playing  through  title  holder,  repeated  his  triumph  of  1913  in  the 
world's  championships  on  hard  courts,  which  was  held  at  the  Stade  Francais. 
in  the  park  of  St.  Cloud,  near  Paris,  beginning  May  29. 

Wilding's  victory  was  rather  a  hollow  one.  as  hi'  lost  only  one  set  in  the 
tournament  and  that  in  the  early  round.  His  opponent  in  the  final  was 
Count  Salm  of  Austria,  who  played  the  best  game  of  his  career,  and  per- 
formed the  feat  of  defeating  F.  G.  Lowe  and  A.  IT.  Gobert,  the  former  in  five 
and  the  latter  in  three  sets.  Against  Wilding,  however,  he  had  but  little 
chance  in  the  first  two  sets,  but  in  the  third  he  led.  4/3.  He  threw  away 
his  opportunity  by  stopping  to  change  his  shoe.  The  scores  were  6/0.  0/2. 
0/1.  In  the  doubles,  France  against  England,  Decugis  and  Germot  defeated 
Gore  and  Kingscote  after  four  sets.   6/1.   11/9,  6/8,   6/2. 

In  the  women's  singles.  Mile.  Suzanne  Lenglen  won  a  notable  victory, 
6/2,  6/0.  She  lost  only  one  set  in  the  tournament.  The  mixed  doubles  was 
won  by  Miss  Elizabeth  Ryan  and  Max  Decugis.  an  American-French  combina- 


Mile.  Suzanne  Lenglen  and  Count  Salm:  the  former  at  age  of  14    is  the  singles  and 
with  Miss  E.   Ryan  doubles  champion  of  the  world  on  hard  courts.

tion,  0/3,  6/1.  In  the  women's  doubles  Mile.  Lenglen,  fourteen  years  old, 
and  Miss  Ryan,  the  California  girl,  won  two  love  sets  from  the  Amblard 
sisters. 

Lawn  Tennis  in  Australasia 

Dr.  Arthur  O'Hara  Wood,  twenty  years  old,  a  pupil  of  Norman  E.  Brookes, 
won  the  Australasian  championship  of  1014.  much  to  the  surprise  of  the 
knowing  ones,  who  expected  Rod  W.  Heath,  the  conqueror  of  W.  A.  Larned 
in  New  Zealand  in  1912,  to  defeat  all  comers.  He  had  trained  hard  to  win 
the  title,  for  in  the  event  of  his  winning  this  time  he  would  become  perma- 
nent possessor  of  the  cup.  He  was  put  out,  however,  in  the  semi-final  round 
by  Tatterson  in  straight  sets.  This  brought  the  latter  against  Wood  in  the 
final  round,  and  Wood  won  with  the  loss  of  but  one  set.  He  dragged  Pat- 
terson in  close  to  the  net  with  short  cuts  and  there  found  out  the  lad's  weak- 
ness in  close  range  volleying  and  deep  overhead  work.  Then  when  Wood  had 
victory  well  in  sight  he  faltered  for  one  set.  Then  again  he  found  his  game 
and  ran  out  rather  easily. 

The  doubles  championship  was  from  the  first  clearly  a  contest  between 
Campbell  and  Patterson  and  Heath  and  Wood.  These  two  pairs  met  in  the 
final,  and  the  former  combination  won  with  some  ease.  They  knew  of  the 
weakness  of  Heath  overhead  and  fed  him'  with  tosses,  which  he  netted  with 
consistency.  Wood  also  failed,  often  through  his  liking  for  half-volleys  from 
the  service  line.  Campbell  was  very  clever  with  short  drop  ground  strokes 
which  frequently  got  to  the  feet  of  their  opponents,  and  Patterson  served  and 
smashed  with  great  ferocity. 

In  the  women's  events.  Miss  Stewart  won  a  triple  crown  by  annexing  all 
three  championships  open  to  women.  She  won  the  singles,  doubles,  and  with 
Campbell  the  mixed  doubles.  It  was  the  second  time  she  scored  a  triple 
win,  and  on  the  previous  occasion  in  Sydney,  Campbell  was  also  her  partner.

SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  77 


Longwood  Singles  and  Eastern  Doubles 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  became  Longwood  champion,  and  Karl  FT.  Behr 
and  Theodore  Roosevelt  IV11  Eastern  doubles  champions,  at  the  twenty- 
fourth  annual  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club, 
Boston.   Mass.,   from  July  20  to  28. 

A  large  and  high  class  entry  list  was  received  for  both  events,  the  weather 
excellent  on  all  but  two  days,  the  playing  for  the  premier  honors  was  keen, 
and  the  management  was,  as  usual,  competent  and  deserving  of  much  praise. 

It  was  McLoughlin's  success  that,  more  than  any  other  cause,  deprived  the 
singles  event  of  much  of  the  interest  that  marked  previous  meetings.  Ilis 
going  through  the  tournament,  and  his  successful  challenging  of  the  title- 
holder.  William  M.  Johnston  of  San  Francisco,  was  regarded  as  a  foregone 
conclusion.     He  did  not  lose  a  set  during  the  tournament. 

The  draw  in  the  singles  was  top  heavy,  most  of  the  best  men  being  in  the 
upper  half.  It  was  the  fate  of  N.  W.  Niles  and  W.  .1.  Clothier  to  meet 
M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  R.  X.  Williams,  2nd.  respectively,  in  the  second  round, 
when  each  made  his  exit.  In  this  half  also  were  E.  P,.  Alexander.  T.  C.  Bundy, 
A.  S.  Dabney,  Irving  C.  Wright.  G.  V.  Gardner.  Jr..  W.  M.  Washburn  and 
S.  H.  Voshell.  There  was  good  class  in  the  lower  half,  however.  In  getting 
to  the  final  round  R.  L.  Murray  was  obliged  to  dispose  of  W.  F.  Johnson.  Elia 
Fottrell  and  F.  C.  Inman.  while  other  players  of  note  in  this  section  were 
E.  II.  Whitney,  Robert  LeRoy,  R.  C.  Seaver  and  J.  D.  E.  Jones. 

In  the  semi-final  round  of  the  singles  McLoughlin  appeared  againsl  Wil- 
liams with  determination  written  all  over  him.  and  seldom  has  he  played  a 
fiercer  match.  lie  kept  the  usually  aggressive  Williams  on  the  defensive  after 
the  first  three  games,  and  the  latter  was  driven  to  frequent  errors  by  the 
American  champion's  meat  speed.  It  was  the  fourth  tournament  encounter  of 
the  two  leaders  of  tennis  in  this  country,  the  first  taking  place  at  Bay  Ridge 
in  1912,  when  Williams,  after  dropping  the  first  two  sets,  came  back  with 
a  flash  and  lost  only  in  five  sets.  The  second,  also  a  five  set  match,  was 
fought  at  Newport  that  same  month:  the  third  was  the  final  in  I'.ii:',  at  New- 
port, in  which  McLoushlin  needed  four  sets  to  dispose  of  his  brilliant  antag- 
onist. In  view  of  these  matches  McLoughlin's'  straight  set  triumph  in  the 
1914  tourney  at  Longwood  was  not  expected. 

The  final  round  brought  McLoughlin  and  Murray  together.  It  was  the 
latter's  ambition  to  lie  the  first  player  in  the  tournament  to  win  a  set  from 
the  champion.  Strive  as  he  might,  Murray  could  get  no  more  than  three 
games  in  the  first  two  sets.  In  the  third  he  redoubled  his  efforts,  and  by  the 
fastest  kind  of  work  cot  a  lead  of  5/2.  The  set  seemed  to  be  within  his 
grasp.  Me  strove  with  might  and  main  to  capture  the  necessary  game,  but 
MeLoushlin  was  awake.  By  speeding  up  he  managed  to  draw  level,  and 
seemed  to  be  out  of  danger.  But  Murray  was  not  done  yet.  With  the  energy 
of  despair  he  fought  on.  determined  to  win  the  coveted  set.  but  failed. 

There  was  a  pretty  general  opinion  that  Johnston  would  not  win  a  set 
from  McLoughlin  in  the  challenge  round.  The  titleholder  was  confident, 
however,  that  he  would  be  able  to  make  a  good  showing.  For  two  sets 
Johnston  almost  held  his  own.  McLoughlin's  same  was  an  open  book  to  him, 
and  all  that  was  needed  was  to  brine  against  it  the  strokes  that  would  win. 
Johnston  almost  proved  equal  to  the  emergency.  He  did  what  no  <>ne  else 
had  been  able  to  do  in  the  tournament,  that  is.  sot  to  the  net  and  held 
his  own  asainst  the  fierce  drives  of  his  opponent.  McLouahlin  made  a  Gar- 
rison finish  in  the  third  set.  He  called  on  the  reserves  which  had  not  been 
needed,  and  cut  loose  with  a  venwance.  His  speedy  shots  caused  Johnston 
to  err.  at  first  narrowly  but  afterward  by  wide  margins.  One  game  was  all 
that   Johnston   could  win. 

Fast  tennis  was  the  order  in  the  doubles.  The  match  between  Hackett 
and  Alexander  and  Clothier  and  Gardner  was  one  of  very  fast  tennis,  espe- 
cially after  the  first  set.  Alexander  was  the  hero  of  the  match,  and  his 
close-quarter  work  was  astounding.     He  and  Hackett  won  after  five  sets.     The 


78  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

host    contest    of    the    doubles,    however,    was    in    the    semi-final    round,    when 
Hackett  and  Alexander  defeated   Fottrell   and  Murray  in  a  four-set  affair. 

In  the  final  round.  Hackett  and  Alexander  showed  a  reversal  of  form 
against  Behr  and  Pell,  and  lost  the  match  in  straight  sets.  Hackett  was 
very  slow,  and  Alexander  drove  the  ball  in  flic  net  on  the  slightest  provoca- 
tion. His  short  center  shots  did  not  clear  the  barrier  as  they  did  in  earlier 
matches.  His  service,  usually  powerful,  was  ineffective.  He  won  only  three 
games  out  of  seven  on  his  service :  Hackett  won  four  and  lost  four ;  Pell 
won  four  and  lost  four  ;  while  Behr  alone  served  effectively  for  a  win  of  seven 
out   of   eight   service   games.      The   summaries  :

SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL 


Western  Championships 

In  a  tournament  that  broke  all  former  records  for  entries  in  the  singles 
events  and  for  attendances  in  Western  tennis,  Alex  Squair  of  Chicago,  a 
student  at  the  University  of  Chicago,  became  the  new  Western  champion,  in 
the  twenty-seventh  annual  competition  for  the  title,  held  on  the  courts  of 
the  Onwentsia  Club  of  Chicago  from  July  25  to  August  4.  In  the  doubles. 
George  M.  Church  and  Dean  Mathey  of'  Princeton  University  defeated  the 
title  holders.  Walter  T.  Hayes  and  3.  II.  Winston.  Squair's  victory  was  the 
big  feature  of  the  tournament,  including  as  it  did  successive  wins  over  James 
TI.  Winston.  R.  B.  Powell,  Paul  E.  Gardner.  Joseph  J.  Armstrong  and  Clar- 
ence J.  Griffin.  As  in  the  tournament  in  1013.  Armstrong  was  the  runner-up 
in  the  final  round.  The  first  set  was  very  close.  Both  men  were  playing 
beautiful  tennis  and  were  doing  their  utmost  to  win.  Every  point  was  hard 
fought  and  many  of  the  games  ran  to  deuce.  Squair,  however,  held  the 
edge  throughout  and  ultimately  ran  out  at  8/6.  In  the  next  set  Arm- 
strong started  nut  with  a  burst  of  speed  and  took  the  first  three  games. 
Squair,  however,  answered  this  attack  by  taking  the  net  on  every  occasion 
and  literally  ran  the  Harvard  man  off  his  feet.  The  exhibtion  shown  by 
Squair  was  one  of  the  best  of  the  year  seen  in  Chicago  up  to  that  time, 
and  he  took  five  straight  games  and  the  set  at  6/3.  In  the  third  set 
both  men  fought  stubbornly  for  every  point  and  the  games  were  all  clpse. 
Squair.  however,  always  had  the  edge  and  ran  out  at  6/4,  taking  the  match. 
This  victory  brought  Squair  to  face  Griffin  in  the  challenge  round.  In  the 
first  set  Squair  held  a  comfortable  lead  and  never  was  in  danger  of  losing. 
In  the  second  set  Squair  led  at  3/2,  but  in  the  sixth  game  Griffin  played 
the  best  tennis  he  showed  in  the  match  and  by  breaking  through  Squair's 
service  tied  the  score  at  r.-all.  This  was  the  critical  game  of  the  set,  for 
had  Squair  won  his  own  service  the  set  would  undoubtedly  have  been  his. 
Thereafter  (iriffin  led  and.  by  breaking  through  Squair's  service  on  the 
twelfth  game,  scored  the  set  at  7/5.  The  winning  of  this  set.  however, 
proved  costly  to  Griffin  for  the  reason  that  Squair  had  literally  run  the 
Californian  off  his  feet  and  Griffin  was  visibly  tired  while  Squair,  as  usual, 
was  as  fresh  as  when  he  began.  The  third  set  was  Squair's  all  the  way. 
The  fourth  and  last  set  of  the  match  was  merely  a  romp  for  Squair.  Criffin 
was  badly  off  his  own  game  while  Squair  was  invincible.  The  men's 
doubles,  with  fifty-three  teams,  was  the  biggest  event  of  its  kind  ever  held 
in  the  West.  Of  these  teams  six  stood  out  as  the  "class"  of  the  field  and 
the  draw  was  fortunate  in  separating  the  best  of  these.  The  first  set  of 
the  final  round  was  Church  and  Mathey's  all  the  way.  In  the  second  set 
things  were  pretty  much  reversed  and  Byford  and  Burdick  led  all  of  the 
way.  running  out  at  6  •"..  The  third  set  was  close  and  a  point  or  two  might 
have  changed  the  whole  complexion  of  the  match.  All  four  men  were  play- 
ing splendid  tennis,  but  Church  and  Mathey  seemed  to  have  the  most  in 
reserve  and  took  the  set  at  6/4.  The  fourth  set  was  a  veritable  battle- 
royal.  Nearly  every  game  went  to  deuce  and  each  point  was  fought  <>ut  to 
the  limit.  First  one  side  and  then  the  other  had  the  advantage  and  both 
tennis  teams  had  several  splendid  chances  to  win.  but  Church  and  Mathey 
were  again  the  steadiest  when  the  points  counted  most  and  took  the  set 
at  14/12  and  with  it  the  match.  The  women's  singles  also  brought  out 
a  large  entry.  The  final  round  brought  together  Miss  Mary  Browne,  the 
national  champion,  and  Mrs.  Robert  II.  Williams.  Fine  tennis  was  shown, 
but  Miss  Browne  had  a  shade  the  better  of  it  all  the  way  and  won  in 
straight  sets.  As  Miss  Gwendolyn  Rees  the  holder  of  the  title  failed  t<> 
appear.  Miss  Browne  became  champion  by  default.  In  the  women's  doubles. 
Miss  Browne  and  Mrs.  Williams  had  move  or  less  of  a  walkaway,  while 
in  the  mixed  doubles.  Miss  Browne  and  Ilorrell  won  in  straight  sets.  The

University  Heights  Tennis  Club  Tournament.— The  fourth  annual  open  tournament 
of  the  University  Heights  Tennis  Club  of  New  York  City,  was  the  most  successful 
the  club  ever  held.  Play  began  on  July  4.  but  the  doubles  was  not  completed  until 
August  9,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  finalists  were  prevented  from  the  earlier  playing 
of  "the  match.  The  singles  was  won  by  Arthur  Lovibond  of  the  Hamilton  Grange 
Club,  in  a  four-set  final  match  with  his  clubmate,  James  O'Neale,  the  Columbia  Base 
Ball  pitcher.  O'Neale,  who,  by  his  free,  hard  hitting  style,  had  defeated  such  men  as 
W.  M.  Fischer,  the  former  title  holder,  and  A.  D.  Hammett,  and  had  been  picked 
by  many  to  defeat  Lovibond,  was  outgeneraled  by  his  older  and  more  experienced 
opponent.  Lovibond  played  his  best  tennis  of  the  tournament.  The  score  was  6/3.  6  4, 
7/9,  S/6.  Last  year's  winner,  Charles  Chambers  of  the  Kings  County  Club  of  Brooklyn, 
lost  a  hard  three-set  match  to  Harry  Steinkamp  of  the  Bedford  Park  Club.  Cham- 
bers won  the  first  set  at  love,  and  after  losing  the  second  was  three  times  within  a 
point  of  the  third  set,  which  was  finally  won  by  Steinkamp  at  12/10.  The  doubles  was 
Avon  bv  Lovibond  and  Steinacher,  both  of  the  Hamilton  Grange  Club.  They  won  from 
Steinkamp  and  Drake  in  the  finals  in  three  straight  sets,  6/3,  6/2,  6/3.  Probably  the 
best  match  was  in  the  round  before  the  semi-finals  between  Steinkamp  and  Drake  and 
Chambers  and  J.  Mersereau,  last  year's  winners.  This  match,  started  on  Friday, 
July  10,  was  set-all,  four-all.  when  darkness  overtook  the  contestants.  It  was  then 
agreed  that  the  match  would  continue  with  the  understanding  that  if  it  went  to 
five-all  the  entire  match  would  be  played  over  the  next  day.  Chambers  and  Mersereau 
ran  the  score  to  5/4  40-15  and  looked  all  over  winners,  but  finally  lost.  The  match

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  87 


Pacific  Coast  Championships 

By    Carl   R.    Gardner. 

William  M.  Johnston  of  San  Francisco,  successfully  defended  his  title  in 
men's  singles,  in  the  twenty-seventh  annual  tournament  for  the  championship 
of  the  Pacific  Coast,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Naglie  Park  Tennis  Club,  San 
Jose,  Calif.,  June  22  to  29.  The  tournament  was  well  conducted  and  a  com- 
plete success.  The  Chamber  of  Commerce  of  San  Jose  and  the  local  Mer- 
chants' Association  offered  liberal  prizes  to  the  contestants.  On  his  way  to 
the  championship.  Johnston  encountered  his  first  serious  oppositon  from  Carl 
R.  Gardner,  with  whom  he  clashed  in  the  second  round.  It  was  not  until  the 
middle  of  the  third  set  that  Johnston  appeared  to  find  himself,  and  his  fierce 
driving-  improved  very  noticeably,  with  the  result  that  he  scored  three  straight 
games  in  short  order  and  won  the  match.  In  the  semi-final  round  Johnston 
met  Clarence  Griffin,  who  had  played  exceptionally  well  in  the  previous  rounds 
and  was  expected  to  call  out  the  champion's  best,  which  he  did.  After 
dropping  the  first  set  Johnston  showed  the  most  brilliant  stretch  of  volleying 
ever  seen  on  the  coast.  He  killed  one  clever  return  after  another,  and  as  his 
network  became  sure,  he  seemed  to  double  his  control  of  all  his  strokes  and  his 
driving  and  smashing  were  almost  faultless.  By  these  methods,  he  thoroughly 
demoralized  his  opponent,  winning  eleven  straight  games  after  dropping  one, 
and  pressed  into  the  final  round  by  taking  the  match.  In  the  final  match 
Johnston  opposed  Elia  Fottrell  and  met  the  stiffest  competition  of  the 
tourney.  Hot  as  the  pace  was  in  the  first  set,  Johnston  seemed  still  able  to 
lift  it  in  the  second  just  as  he  had  done  with  Griffin  in  the  semi-finals.  His 
all-round  play  became  more  severe  than  ever,  and  though  he  did  not  specialize 
in  volleying  in  this  match,  he  made  no  errors  in  that  department,  and  his  fast 
driving  from  the  back  court  was  so  perfect  that  he  scored,  mainly  by  it, 
thirteen  straight  games  from  his  weakening  opponent  and  won  the  title. 
The  women's  singles  championship  was  won  by  Mrs.  H.  A.  Nieineyer,  a  steady 
and  even  baseline  player,  who  has  improved  steadily  during  the  past  four 
years.  The  women's  doubles  championship  was  won  by  Miss  Carmen  Tarilton 
and  Miss  Eleanor  Tennant.  These  young  women  played  remarkable  tennis, 
taking  the  net  together  and  defending  the  position  well.  The  mixed  doubles 
championship  was  won  by  Miss  Carmen  Tarilton  and  A.  C.  Van  Vliet,  from  a 
field  which  included  Miss' Anita  Myers  and  Elia  Fottrell.  Miss  E.  Tennant  and 
J.    C.    Rohlfs,    and   Miss   I.    Norman   and    William    M.    Johnston. 

With  Griffin,  Johnston  took  the  special  doubles  event,  encountering  their 
only  dangerous  opponents  in  Fottrell  and  Gardner  in  their  first  match.  The 
superior  team  work  of  Johnston  and  Griffin,  however,  pulled  them  through  to 
a  well  earned  victory.  They  decisively  defeated  Johns  and  Roberts  in  the 
final.  6/2,  0/2.   7/.".. 

II.  V.  I).  Johns  won  the  junior  title,  defeating  his  old.  or  rather  young, 
rival,  Roland  Roberts,  in  the  semi-final,  and  Leon  Strauss  in  the  final.  The 
latter  match  was  the  longest  of  the  tournament,  and  both  boys  were  com- 
pletely fagged  at  the  finish.  With  Roberts,  Johns  also  won  the  doubles.  The

Pacific  Coast  Doubles 

W.  M.  Johnston  and  Clarence  Griffin  dropped  jauntily  in  at  the  Hotel 
Virginia,  Long  Beach,  Cal.,  on  July  1.  and  four  days  later  emerged  twice  as 
jauntily,  with  the  title  and  privilege  of  representing  the  Pacific  Coast  at 
Lake  Forest.  111.  The  Los  Angeles  tennis  contingent  had  laid  several  mines 
for  the  San  Francisco  invaders  in  the  teams  of  Claude  Wayne  and  Nat. 
Browne.  W.  Mace  and  Simpson  Sinsabaugh,  Clifton  Herd  and  Ward  Dawson, 
Hal  Braley  and  John  Duncan.  F.  Adams  and  Robert  Variel.  (ierald  Young  and 
Charles  Rogers,  L.  Freeman  and  Kenneth  Newell,  McCormick  and  Barber,  and 
others  of  less  danger.  But  some  of  these  blew  up  their  brethren  and  the 
others  were  very  skilfully  rendered  harmless  by  the  Northern  combination. 
In  the  semi-final  round  McCormick  and  Barber' bit  the  dust  to  the  score  of 
6/1,  0/0,  6/1,  hardly  giving  Johnston  and  his  stubby  partner  a  try-out.  In 
the  same  round  Mace  and  Sinsabaugh  were  treated  roughly  by  their  neigh- 
bors. Browne  and  Wayne.  The  brilliance  shown  by  the  former  pair  when 
they  eliminated  Herd  and  Dawson  was  lacking  anil  the  path  for  their  oppo- 
nents was  one  of  roses,  as  the  score.  0/1.  6/3,  6/3,  indicates.  The  final  round 
brought  forth  some  excellent  tennis,  but  in  this  case  the  aggressive  game, 
which  was  at  the  same  time  a  steady  one.  showed  to  distinct  advantage  over 
the  defensive  game.  Browne  and  Wayne  played  Griffin  two-thirds  of  the  time, 
but  that  gentleman  was  right  at  the  top  and  simply  ate  up  all  that  came 
his  way.  Johnston,  too,  was  deadly  and  the  outcome  was  never  in  doubt 
from   start  to  finish  of  the  match.      The   summaries  :

Volleys   from   California 

"Maury"  McLoughlin  returned  from  the  East  a  bit  "fed  up"  with  tennis. 
This  we  "know,  because  he  turned  to  golf  immediately,  much  as  Alexander 
the  Great  might  have  taken  a  hand  at  pinochle  to  clear  his  head  after  a 
battle.  Incidentally  "Mac"  is  no  mean  hand  at  the  "gentler"  game.  He 
often  gets  'round  under  85,  but  expects  to  do  much  better  when  he  grows 
too  aged  and  rheumatic  for  tennis.  His  tennis  season  will  begin  earlier  than 
usual  this  year,  as  he  will  compete  in  the  exposition  tournament  before  going 
East,  and  will   need   to  lie  in  practice. 

In  spite  of  the  long  siege  of  tournaments  "Lin"  Murray  battled  in  last 
summer  he  returned  full  of  ginger  and  hooting  all  ideas  of  staleness.  Busi- 
ness of  being  an  "agricultural  chemist"  (whatever  that  is  i  has  given  him 
little  time  for  tennis,  however.  He  is  now  assistant  head  chemist  for  the 
Pacific  Coast  Borax  Co.,   at  Oakland.   Calif. 


90  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Murray  has  competed  in  one  tournament  since  returning — the  Bay  Counties 
championship,  at  San  Francisco.  lie  reached  the  finals  and  met  John 
Strachan.  when,  after  losing  the  first  set,  5/7,  and  two  games  in  the  second, 
he  sustained  a  severe  twist  of  his  instep,  which  necessitated  his  defaulting. 

The  season  of  Eastern  tennis  has  improved  Murray's  game,  beyond  doubt, 
toning  down  the  rough  parts  and  adding  to  his  headwork.  He  has  learned 
the  value  of  conserving  his  energy,  and,  better  still,  he  gives  his  opponent 
a  few  chances  to  miss. 

About  a  month  after  their  return,  McLoughlin  and  Murray  were  dragged 
out  to  make  a  Roman  holiday  for  the  public,  in  an  exhibition  doubles  match 
with  Johnston  and  Strachan.  The  latter  team,  being  in  good  practice,  did 
give  a  fair  impersonation  of  the  lions,  while  the  other  pair,  being  sadly  out 
of  trim,  fell  readily  into  the  role  of  the  Christian  martyrs  and  were  eaten 
alive.  The  lions  gagged  a  bit  in  the  third  set,  when  the  martyrs  proved 
somewhat  tough,  and  lost  at  0/6.  However,  they  finished  the  feast  with  a 
final  gulp  andtook  the  match,   7/5,  6/3,  3/6,  6/2. 

Johnston  and  Strachan  look  very  formidable — on  paper — and  their  chances 
for  challenging  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  for  the  title  next  August  seem  good. 
However,  there  are  several  "it's,  huts  and  ands"  to  be  considered,  so  we  can't 
make  rosy  prophecy  at  this  early  date. 

John  Strachan  came  on  steadily  during  the  past  year,  in  spite  of  the  fact 
that  he  had  not  the  advantage  of  the  Eastern  season's  play.  He  competed 
in  only  the  State  and  Bay  Counties  championships,  but  won  in  both  singles 
and  doubles.  With  a  straight  set  win  over  Johnston,  an  easy  defeat  of 
Griffin  and  a  lead  on  Murray  when  the  latter  injured  his  foot,  his  record  is 
very  impressing.  "Doubles"  is  his  long  suit,  and  it  isn't  too  flattering  to 
predict  that  he  will  one  day  figure  on  the  champion  team. 

"Billy"  Johnston,  disappointed  and  somewhat  nonplussed  by  his  compara- 
tively poor  showing  in  the  East  last  summer,  has  had  his  rackets  on  the 
shelf  for  the  past  few  months.  It  didn't  take  him  long  to  decide  that  a 
complete  rest  would  add  to  his  keenness  in  the  1915  season.  Johnston  has 
played  tennis  almost  continuously  for  nearly  ten.  years,  and,  possibly,  a 
vacation  was  needed. 

"Eely"  Fottrell  is  learning  to  coax  crops  out  of  the  soil  up  on  his 
father's  extensive  ranch.  If  "Eely"'  turns  out  as  good  a  farmer  as  he  has  a 
tennis  player,  ranching  should  prove  profitable.  Farm  work  hasn't  taken 
every  minute  of  his  time,  however,  for  recently  he  rode  forty  miles  to 
Stockton,  Calif.,  on  his  motorcycle  (returning  the  same  day)  just  for  a  few 
sets  of  tennis. 

"Peck"  Griffin,  of  clay  court  fame,  is  now  associated  with  II.  Taylor 
Curtis,  who  markets  fine  paintings.  Rumor  has  it  that  after  they  have  made 
an  exceptionally  profitable  sale  they  hie  them  to  the  courts  and  there  cele- 
brate with  a  couple  of  sets  of  peppery  tennis.  Curtis  is  hardly  in  Griffin's 
class  as  a  tennis  player,  but  then  Griffin  is  hardly  in  Curtis'  class  as  a 
picture  seller. 

"Mell"  Long,  the  former  Internationalist,  is  now  in  a  fair  way  to  become 
an  eminent  "sawbones."  Jefferson  Medical  College,  Philadelphia,  gave  him 
his  degree  last  June,  since  when  he  has  secured  his  license  to  practice  in 
the  State  of  California.  "Mell"  is  now  an  interne  in  the  Buena  Vista 
Sanitarium,  which  is  owned  by  his  father,  Dr.  S.  F.  Long.  Local  tennisdom 
has  tried  in  vain  to  coax  Long  back  to  the  game  in  the  past  six  months.  He 
is  too  wrapped  up  in  his  profession  for  the  present,  however,  but  we  live 
in  hopes. 

San   Francisco   Championship 

W.  M.  Johnston  again  won  the  San  Francisco  championship  on  the  courts 
of  the  California  Lawn  Tennis  Club  last  May  when  he  defeated  Roland 
Roberts  in  four  well  played  sets  in  the  final  round.  Johnston  reached  the 
final  with  ease  and  everyone  expected  to  see  him  tread  all  over  the  sixteen- 
year-old  Golden  Gate  Park  Junior  Club  member.  Roberts,  however,  seemed 
to  find  the  older  player's  game  to  his  liking,  for  he  handily  took  a  set  and 
very  nearly  annexed  two,  forcing  Johnston  to  the  utmost  to  stave  off  defeat. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  91 

It   was    a    pretty    match,    both    hitting   hard   and   clean,    with   the   drive   pre- 
dominating. 

Roberts,  it  will  be  remembered,  came  within  a  point  of  snuffing  Johnston's 
lambitions  at  Del  Monte  the  year  before  in  the  Pacific  States  championship. 
It  was  the  closest  call  the  latter  had  during  the  event. 

California   Intercollegiate   Championships 

The  California  intercollegiate  championship  is  in  reality  nothing  more  than 
a  meet  between  the  two  main  universities  of  the  State,  California  and  Leland 
Stanford,  Jr.  But  as  these  two  have  always  had  a  monopoly  of  the  best 
players,  the  question  of  propriety  in  giving  the  title  of  intercollegiate  cham- 
pion to  the  winner  has  never  been  raised. 

As  usual,  the  meet  was  held  last  Spring,  and,  as  usual,  California  triumphed, 
taking  all  the  matches.  Had  Lindley  Murray,  Stanford's  best  man,  been 
able  to  compete,  his  university  might  have  taken  two  of  the  five  matches 
played.  As  it  was.  Stanford's  case  was  hopeless  and  the  best  it  could  do 
was  to  win  one  set  in  eleven.     The  summaries  :

Southern   Championships 

The  Southern  championship,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  New  Orleans  Lawn 
Tennis  Club,  beginning  May  25,  was  one  of  the  most  successful  tournaments 
ever  held  in  that  section  of  the  country.  A  field  of  fifty-two  in  the  men's 
singles  and  half  that  number  in  men's  doubles  competed  for  championship 
honors,  while  the  women  were  represented  by  twenty  contestants  in  the 
singles,  and  eight  teams.  The  final  round  of  the  singles  brought  together 
Irving  C.  Wright  of  Boston  and  Esmond  Phelps  of  New  Orleans.  They  fur- 
nished beautiful  tennis  for  the  first  set.  Phelps  volleyed  sharply,  taking  the 
net  on  every  possible  opening,  and  forcing  Wright  to  cover  an  immense  amount 
of  territory  in  the  back  court.  These  tactics  soon  brought  the  score  to  5/2, 
Thelps  leading,  but  Wright  again  rose  to  the  occasion,  began  placing  more 
accurately,  assuming  the  net  himself  when  he  had  made  a  good  opening,  and  I 
won  five  straight  games  for  the  set.  The  next  two  sets  were  easy  for  the  vis- 
itor, the  scores  being  6/1,  6/3.  In  the  final  match  of  the  doubles  the  best; 
tennis  of  the  tournament  was  seen,  and  Wright  and  Adoue  had  to  exert  them- 
selves to  the  utmost  to  defeat  the  younger  pair,  Bruns  and  Watters,  both  of 
whom  are  still  in  their  teens.     Summaries  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  95 


Middle  States  Championships 

Karl  II.  Behr  was  the  hero  in  the  tournament  for  the  Middle  States  chain 
pionship,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Orange  Lawn  Tennis  Omit.  South  Orange, 
N.  .1..  beginning  on  June  22.  He  defeated  T.  R.  Pell  in  the  final  round,  the 
match  going  rive  sets,  and  in  the  challenge  round  overpowered  Gustave  F. 
Touchard  for  the  title.  In  the  doubles,  Behr  and  Pell  defeated  George  1. 
Wrenn  and  C.  F.  Watson.  Jr..  in  the  final  round,  the  latter  having  a  sprained 
ankle,  and  in  the  challenge  round  were  successful  against  Touchard  and  W.  M. 
Washburn. 

Mrs.  Louise  H.  Raymond  won  the  women's  singles  and  successfully  dial 
lenged  Miss  Edith  E.  Rotch  of  Boston,  for  the  title.  Paired  with  Mrs.  C.  X. 
Beard  she  also  won  the  doubles. 

The  final  round  between  Behr  and  Pell  was  by  far  the  best  of  the  tourna- 
ment.    The   first   three  sets  were  very  close,    neither   man    being  more   than    a 

ame  ahead  of  the  other  at  any  time  except  at  the  end  of  the  set.  Behr 
started  off  by  rushing  the  net  at  every  opportunity  and  volleying  back  Pell's 
fast  backhand  shots  very  sharply.  He  did  not  especially  try  to  force  the 
latter's  forehand,  but  time  after  time  made  him  err  off  his' backhand  l>v  hard, 
stinging  volleys.  By  these  tactics  he  took  the  first  set  at  10/8.  The' second 
set  was  as  close  as  at  first,  but  Tell  proved  the  steadier  in  the  pinches,  winning 
at  8/6.     The  third  set  Pell  got  his  hard  first  service  working  to  perfection. 

forcing  Behr.  and  making  him  pop  up  easy  ones  which  Pell  promptly  pro ded 

to  kill  off.  The  latter  played  confidently,  passing  bis  opponent  right  and  left, 
winning  the  set  at  6/3.  Play  was  resumed  without  resting  and  it  looked  like 
an  easy  victory  for  Pell.  He  made  a  great  mistake,  however,  in  letting  up  a 
little   and   Behr   came  with  a   rush,   winning  twelve  out  of  the   next   thirteen 

ames  and  the  match. 
The  challenge  round  was  very  disappointing,     Touchard  simply  could  not  act 

oing  and  his  poor  play  had  such  an  effect  on  Behr  that  the  latter  took  a  bad 

lump   in   the   third   set,   losing  it   at  6  '4.      Touchard   plainly   showed    lack   of 
practice,  and  Behr  did  all  the  forcing.     The  former,  however!  ended  the  match 
great  style  with  a  perfect  service  ace  down  the  middle. 

The  challenge  round  of  the  doubles,  as  was  generally  expected,  resulted  in  a 
victory  for  the  challengers.  Touchard  was  short  of  practice,  having  played 
for  the  first  time  in  months  only  the  day  before.  Yet  he  and  Washburn 
pressed  their  opponents  to  four  sets.  The  first  was  hard  fought  and  finally 
went  to  the  challengers  at  11/9,  Touchard  and  Washburn  won  the  next  easily 
pit  dropped  the  third.  A  struggle  ensued  for  the  fourth,  but  at  7/6  against 
them  Behr  and  Pell  came  with  a  rush  and  won  the  next  three  games.  The 
summaries  :

Rockaway  Hunting  Club  Invitation  Tournament.— The  annual  invitation  tournament 
of  the  Rockaway  Hunting  Club  at  Cedarhurst,  Long  Island,  N.  Y.,  May  30  and  31, 
marked  the  opening  of  the  grass  court  season  in  the  New  York  district.  William 
A.  Earned  made  his  reappearance  in  the  singles,  the  first  time  since  1911,  and  by 
defeating  W.  M.  Hall,  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  and  Robert  Le  Roy,  advanced  to  the  final 
round.  His  opponent  was  Dean  Mathey.  This  match,  however,  was  postponed  for 
nearly  a  month,  by  reason  of  an  injury  to  Larned's  knee.  Earned  won  the  first  two 
sets,  but  Mathey  took  the  next  three  and  the  match.  The  doubles  honors  were  cap- 
tured by  T.  R.  Pell  and  Karl  IL  Behr.  In  the  final  match  Little  and  Inman  played 
below  their  usual  standard,  while  Pell  and  Behr  played  brilliantly.  The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  97 


Metropolitan    Championships 

Robert  Lindley  Murray  of  Palo  Alto,  Calif.,  in  a  sensational  match  with 
Fred  B.  Alexander,  three  times  winner  of  the  title,  won  the  Metropolitan 
championship  in  singles,  and  <;.  M.  Church  and  I  lean  Mathey  annexed  the 
doubles  against  G.  C.  Shafer  and  King  Smith,  in  the  first  tournament  held  on 
the  new  grounds  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  at  Forest  Hills,  Long  Island, 
N.  Y..  June  18  to  20. 

The  entry  list  was  large,  but  hardly  as  classy  as  some  of  the  previous 
tournaments,  while  the  weather  conditions  were  good  in  the  main.  The  day 
of  the  final  match  was  beautiful,  clear  and  cool,  and  the  gallery  was  so  large 
that  it  occupied  all  the  valuable  space  about  the  championship  court  and  on 
the  club  house  porch  and  steps. 

One  of  the  surprises  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  Pell  by  Hugh 
Tallant  on  the  opening  day.  The  latter  played  good  tennis,  but  his  victory 
was  due  chiefly  to  the  lapses  of  Pell,  who  was  unable  to  play  anything  near 
his   usual  game. 

In  the  final  Alexander  brought  into  use  all  of  his  wonderful  craftiness  and 
all  of  his  old  speed  and  daring.  At  times,  and  they  were  frequent,  he  made 
phenomenal  shots,  and  his  court  covering  and  brilliance  were  remarkable. 
Murray  was  up  against  the  struggle  of  his  life,  and  he  won  because  he  refused 
to  give  up  and  because  he  tried  for  everything.  He  covered  miles  of  court, 
and  served  like  a  whirlwind.  At  times  he  drove  like  Alexander,  who  sent  the 
ball  over  the  net  so  fast  it  could  scarcely  be  seen. 

The  doubles  final  lacked  the  vim  and  snap  of  the  singles  final,  but  showed 
worlds  of  steadiness  in  all  those  concerned,  and  an  ability  to  "get"  and  lob, 
which  was  remarkable.  Church  and  Mathey  won  because  of  better  team  work. 
The  doubles  part  of  the  tournament  was  remarkable  for  the  large  number  of 
close  and  well  played  three-set  matches  and  for  the  number  of  upsets. 

Church  and  Mathey  had  a  narrow  escape  when  they  pulled  out  from  a  5/1 
hole  in  the  deciding  set  against  Pell  and  P»ehr.  The  Princeton  pair  stuck  to 
it  with  great  perseverance  and  courage,  and  deserved  much  credit  for  their 
remarkable  victory.     The  summaries  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  101 

Tri-State  Tournament 

By  W.  Gage  Hoag. 

The  sixteenth  annual  open  Tri-State  tournament  was  held  on  the  courts  of 
the  Indianapolis  (Ind.)  Tennis  Association,  during  the  week  of  July  6.  It 
was  the  first  year  the  tournament  had  not  been  played  on  Cincinnati  courts. 
Owing  to  the  efforts  of  the  committee,  of  which  Dr.  Charles  D.  Humes  was 
chairman,  the  largest  entry  list  of  any  tournament  ever  held  in  Indiana  was 
secured.  The  number  of  out  of  State  players  was  not  large,  which  was  due  to 
(the  fact  that  several  other  tournaments  were  held  during  the  same  week,  both 
in  the  East  and  West. 

.1.  C.  Mackrell,  Jr.,  of  Pittsburgh,  was  picked  to  win.  He  met  Charles  P. 
frask  of  Indianapolis  in  an  early  round  and  was  eliminated  in  straight  sets. 
Trask  won  his  way  into  the  finalsin  the  lower  half.  In  the  upper  half  of  the 
racket.  William  G.  Hoag,  State  champion,  also  won  his  way  into  the  finals. 
His  matches  with  William  Fleet  of  Culver,  Ind.;  Captain  McNagney  of  Co- 
lumbia City,  and  John  Darnall  of  Lebanon,  were  all  hard  fought  and  inter- 
esting. 

In  the  final  round,  Trask  started  out  in  whirlwind  style  and  took  the  first 
two  sets.  He  had  the  third  set,  4  to  1 ,  before  Hoag  could  stop  him.  The  next 
three  games  went  to  Hoag.  and  finally  the  set.  He  also  won  the  fourth  set 
with  a  loss  of  but  two  points.  The  fifth  and  deciding  set,  and  with  it  the 
premier  honors  in  the  tournament,  was  also  won   by   Hoag. 

William  McEllroy,  winner  in  1013,  was  on  hand  to  defend  his  title  in  the 
challenge  round.  In  this  match  some  of  the  best  tennis  ever  played  on  local 
courts  was  witnessed.  The  first  two  sets  went  to  McEllroy.  both  being  hard 
fought,  throughout.  Hoag  braced  in  the  third  set  and  won  four  straight 
jamis.  and  finally  the  set.  In  the  fourth  set.  McEllroy  came  back  strong, 
■sinning  his  net  game,  which,  together  with  his  brilliant  service,  completely 
iffled  Hoag,  and  the  set,  match  and  tournament  went  to  McEllroy  for  the 
second  time. 

J.  C.  Mackrell,  Jr.,  and  Cullen  Thomas  had  little  trouble  in  winning  the 
Hen's  doubles,  not  losing  a  set  during  the  tournament. 

Miss  Katharine  Brown  defeated  Mrs.  I.  Watt  Pugh  in  the  final  round  of 
;he  women's  singles,  only  to  lose  to  Miss  Ruth  Sanders  of  Cincinnati  in  the 
halIen_go  round.     The  summaries  :

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Intercollegiate  Championships 

The  thirty-fourth  annual  intercollegiate  championships,  which  were  held  on 
the  grass  courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club,  at  Haverford,  Pa.,  from  Septem- 
ber 15  to  19,  produced  one  of  the  most  astonishing  results.  This  was  the  de- 
feat of  Richard  Norris  Williams,  2nd.  representing  Harvard  University,  by 
George  Myers  Church  of  Princeton  University,  in  the  final,  and  this  in  spite 
of  the  fact  that  on  September  1,  Williams  defeated  the  famous  McLoughlin  for 
the  national  championship  of  1914.  Conspicuously  inferior  to  Williams  in 
strokes,  except  overhead,  Church  excelled  in  control  of  the  ball,  in  court  gen- 
eralship   and    strategy. 

Eight  institutions  were  represented  in  the  tournament,  namely  :  Harvard. 
Princeton,  Yale.  University  of  Pennsylvania.  University  of  Pittsburgh.  Am- 
herst. Dartmouth  and  Haverford.  Cornell  also  entered  a  team,  composed  of 
Charles  O.  Benton  and  Clifton  B.  Herd,  but  did  not  come  on  and  was  de- 
faulted. The  only  colleges  to  win  points  mi  the  new  cup  placed  in  competition 
1913  were  Princeton  and  Harvard,  each  being  credited  with  1  point  for  their 
victories  in  the  singles  and  doubles  events,  respectively.  As  Harvard  won 
both  events  in  1913  the  tally  is  as  follows:  Harvard  3  points;  Princeton  1 
ipoint. 

The  weather  was  nearly  perfect,  the  courts  in  splendid  condition,  consider- 
ing the  long  spell  of  dry  weather,  and  affairs  wen'  capably  managed. 

The  doubles  final  for  two  sets  was  one-sided.  Williams  and  Harte  hit  hard 
and  freely  and  worked  togeths  r  smoothly.  Church  and  Kidder  tried  every- 
thing they  knew  without  avail.  In  tin'  third  set  the  latter  made  their  last 
stand,  but  Williams  and  Harte  were  not  to  be  denied  and  they  won  the  set 
and  match.     The  summaries  :

the  Casino  courts,  Newport,  R.  I.,  in  conjunction  with  the  national  champion-

McCormick  of  the  University  of  Southern  California.  The  former  played  a 
medium  paced,  steady,  consistent  game,  letting  his  husky  opponent  make  the 
errors,  and  kept  the  ball  coming.  McCormick  tried  too  hard  and  cramped 
most  of  his  shots,  really  not  doing  himself  justice,  and  lost.     The  summaries  :

106  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS     ANNUAL. 


Seabri&ht  (N.  J.)  Invitation  Tournament 

By  winning  the  singles  honors  in  the  annual  invitation  tournament  of  the 
Seabright  Lawn  Tennis  and  Cricket  Club,  on  the  courts  of  the  famous  seaside 
resort,  during  the  week  of  July  13,  R.  Norris  Williams,  2nd.,  earned  the  right 
to  have  his  name  engraved  on  the  Achelis  Cup,  a  trophy  highly  prized  by  all 
tennis  players.  There  was  a  splendid  entry  list,  thirty-two  players  being 
drawn   in  the  singles  event  and  twelve  pairs  in  the  doubli  s  event. 

Williams'  victory  was  clean-cut  and  well  deserved.  William  M.  Johnston 
was  removed  from  his  path  by  the  unexpected  victory  of  Robert  Le  ltoj  m  the 
first  round,  overplay  and  a  heavy  court  being  chiefly  responsible  for  the  upset. 

W.  J.  Clothier  put  Nat  W.  Niles  out  of  the  running,  and  then  in  turn  suc- 
cumbed to  Williams,  in  a  match  which  revealed  the  young  Philadelphia!)  at  the 
top  of  his  game.  In  the  challenge  round  T.  R.  Pell  made  an  unexpectedly  good 
fight,  carrying  the  match  to  full  five  sets  and  even  leading  at  two  sets  to  one. 

The  doubles  combinations  brought  out  two  of  the  strongest  teams  in  the 
country  in  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  T.  C.  Bundy  and  T.  R.  Pell  and  K.  II.  Behr. 
Both  of  these  teams  drew  byes  in  opposite  halves  of  the  tourney.  Ilackett  and 
Inman  took  the  first  set  from  Tell  and  Behr  in  the  second  round,  largely  bo- 
cause  of  the  latter's  errors  and  Ilackett's  cleverness  in  making  the  openings. 
Clothier  and  Gardner,  who  had  won  their  first  round  match  in  two  close  sets 
against  Prentice  and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  defaulted  to  Church  and  Mathey. 

Johnston  and  Tallant  sprung  somewhat  of  a  surprise  when  they  won  from 
Niles  and  Dabney  in  a  three-set  match  in  the  second  round,  the  winners  pair- 
ing finely  together.  Pell  and  Behr  then  took  Johnston  and  Tallant  into  camp 
in  two  sets.  In  the  semi-finals  Pell  was  sweeping  his  backhand  short  across 
the  court  on  the  forehand  side,  this  shot  giving  the  losers  no  end  of  trouble, 
and  Behr  was  rushing  the  net  at  every  opportunity. 

The  final  match,  between  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  and  Pell  and  Behr,  was 
won  by  the  former  pair,  but  only  after  the  hardest  kind  of  a  five-set  struggle.

R.  Lindley  Murray  met  Washburn  in  the  final  round  of  the  singles  and  de- 
feated him  in  straight  sets.  The  doubles  honors  resulted  in  a  victory  for 
McLoughlin  and  Bmidy,  their  opponents  in  the  final  round  being  Norman  E. 
Brookes,  the  Australasian,  and  W.  A.  Larned.  The  first  set  of  this  match  was 
fairly  close,  each  side  winning  on  service  up  to  5-all,  when  Larned  was  broken 
through.  The  latter  tired  in  the  second  set,  which  was  easy  for  the  champions,

Tennis  in  Kirk  Park,  Syracuse,  N.  Y. — According  to  Hazen  Charles  Kelley,  supervisor 
of  tennis,  the  game  in  1!H4  had  its  best  season  since  the  municipal  courts  were  opened 
four  years  ago.  In  Kirk  Park  there  are  six  clay  courts  and  these  are  not  enough  to 
supply  the  demands  of  the  tennis  lovers  in  this  section  of  the  city.  The  tournament 
of  1914  brought  out  a  large  entry  list  in  each  of  the  events.  The  men's  singles  was 
W"on  by  G.  R.  Granbow,  who  promises  to  give  city  champion  Raleigh  a  tight  for  honors 
next  season.  The  men's  doubles  went  to  Granbow  and  Norton,  who  play  a  very  steady 
game.  Miss  Pratt  and  Mr.  Wisner  won  the  mixed  doubles.  Three  teams  from  Kirk 
Park,  consisting  of  McClure  and  Hogan,  Listman  and  Barth,  and  Kelley  and  Kelley 
entered  the  city  championships,  held  at  the  Sedgwick  Farm  Club,  and  made  an  ex- 
cellent showing.  A  large  amount  of  credit  for  the  fine  season  enjoyed  on  the  munici- 
pal tennis   courts  is  due  Thomas  F.   Keanc,   superintendent   of  playgrounds.

110  SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL. 


Country  Club    of  Westchester    Tournament 

The  week  of  July  6  was  a  memorable  one  at  the  tennis  courts  of  the  Country 
Club  of  Westchester,  just  outside  of  New  York  City.  It  was  the  club's  invi- 
tation tournament  and  was  altogether  successful.  The  courts  were  in  splendid 
condition,  and  the  fame  of  the  contestants  brought  out  large  and  enthusiastic 
galleries.  A  doubles  tournament  on  the  first  three  days  of  the  week  was 
played  on  the  miss  and  out  plan,  instead  of  a  round  robin,  as  is  customary  at 
Westchester.  On  Thursday,  Friday.  Saturday  and  Sunday  a  singles  event  on 
the  same  lines  was  held.  The  changes  in  the  tournament  were  made  chiefly  to 
give  the  Davis  Cup  committee  a  line  on  the  possibilities  for  the  team.  There 
was  little  of  an  encouraging  nature  in  the  doubles,  for  Theodore  Roosevelt 
Pell  and  Karl  II.  Behr,  who  defeated  G.  M.  Church  and  Dean  Mathey  in  the 
final  round,  continued  the  good  work  they  had  been  doing  all  spring,  while 
Richard  Norris  Williams,  2nd,  and  R.  L.  Murray,  who  played  together  for 
the  first  time,  showed  little  to  warrant  their  selection  as  the  much-needed 
team  to  defend  the  cup.  In  the  singles,  however,  there  was  much  to  gratify 
the  committee,  Williams,  Johnston  and  Behr.  who  were  looked  upon  at  the 
time  as  having  the  best  chance  to  be  bracketed  with  McLaughlin,  revealing 
tennis  of  international  quality.  In  the  final  round,  which  was  changed  to  the 
best  two  out  of  three  sets  on  account  of  the  heat,  Williams  defeated  Johnston 
after  dropping  the  first  set.     The  summaries:

Seventh  Regment  Defeats  Yale. — The  annual  winter  match,  Seventh  Regiment  T.  C. 
versus  Yale  University,  was  played  at  the  Seventh  Regiment  Armory,  New  York, 
on  the  afternoon  of  Washington's  Birthday.  The  collegians  were  very  rusty:  few  of 
the  members  of  the  team  had  handled  a  racket  since  October,  and  as  Seventh  Regi- 
ment had  out  a  strong  aggregation  of  players,  headed  by  W.  M.  Hall,  the  contest  was 
altogether  one-sided.  The  visitors  not  only  failed  to  win  a  match  but  their  total 
of  sets  was  only  two.  The  summaries:  Singles— Walter  Merrill  Hall  (7th  R.)  d.  W.

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


New  England  Championships 

Tho  thirteenth  New  England  championship  tournament,  which  was  held  on 
the  courts  of  the  Hartford  Golf  Club,  Hartford,  Conn.,  during  the  week  of 
June  S.  was  featured  by  excellent  tennis  weather,  a  large  entry  list,  a  willing- 
ness on  the  part  of  the  contestants  to  play  their  matches  on  schedule  time, 
and  an  efficient  committee. 

R.  L.  Murray,  the  clever  young  left-handed  player  of  Leland  Stanford  Uni- 
versity at  Stanford  University,  Calif.,  had  no  difficulty  in  winning  the  singles. 
He  came  through  the  tournament,  defeating  P.  W,  Cole  in  the  final  round,  and 
A.  H.  Man.  Jr.,   former  Yale  player,  in  the  challenge  round. 

The  doubles  event  brought  out  some  good  playing,  although  the  favorite, 
C.  C.  Burgwin  and  J.  L.  Richards,  and  R.  L.  Murray  and  II.  L.  Ilahn  had  no 
difficulty  in  coming  through  their  respective  halves.  In  the  final  Murray  and 
Ilahn   won  in  straight  sets.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  H3 


Missouri  Valley    Championships 

By  John  Tex  Broeck. 

The  Central  Western  classic,  which  is  held  yearly  under  the  name  of  the 
Missouri  Valley  Championship  for  men,  began  on  the  courts  of  the  Kansas 
City  (Mo.)  Athletic  Club,  August  4.  An  innovation  in  the  way  of  charging 
admission  was  tried,  and  the  financial  success  achieved  has  induced  the  Kan- 
sas City  tennis  contingent  to  make  a  strong  bid  for  the  clay  court  champion- 
ships as  soon  as  suitable  quarters  can  be  secured.  The  class  of  the  tourney 
consisted  of  Armstrong  of  St.  Paul,  Iloerr  of  St.  Louis,  and  Cannon,  the  local 
pride.  The  dope  ran  true  to  form,  although  Wester  nearly  brought  about  an 
upset  by  playing  Iloerr  a  three-set  match  and  leading  on  the  final  set,  5/3. 
Cannon  also  sent  the  hopes  of  his  admirers  soaring  by  going  after  the  vet- 
eran Armstrong  in  aggressive  style  and  outplaying  the  Harvard  crack  in  the 
first  two  sets.  Only  an  attack  of  unsteadiness  changed  the  tide  and  enabled 
the  Minnesota  champion  to  win.  The  team  of  Armstrong  and  Iloerr  was  too 
strong  for  the  balance  of  the  field,  that  team  winning  the  doubles  in  impres- 
sive style.     The  summaries :

Missouri  Valley  Women's  Championships 

One  month  after  the  Missouri  Valley  men's  tournament  came  the  cham- 
pionships in  women's  singles  and  mixed  doubles.  While  the  field  was  not  so 
large  as  in  the  Central  WTest,  the  play  was  much  faster.  Miss  Marion  Sowle 
of  Kansas  City,  upset  all  the  dope,  going  to  the  finals  in  impressive  style, 
defeating  the  only  foreign  entry,  Miss  Prendergast  of  St.  Louis,  but  losing  to 
Mrs.  Yager,  also  of  Kansas  City,  in  the  finals  in  a  heartbreaking  contest, 
after  having  match  point  in  the  third  set.  Miss  Marjorie  Hires  and  Jack 
Cannon  were  the  victors  in  the  mixed  doubles  over  Miss  Marion  Sowle  and

A   QUARTETTE    OF   WELL   KNOWN   INTERNATIONALISTS 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


State  Championships 


New  York  State  Championships 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  won  the  singles  title,  and  Harold  II.  Hackett  and 
Fred  P5.  Alexander  the  doubles  honors  in  the  tournament  for  the  New  York 
State  championship,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club  at  Bay 
Ridge,  Brooklyn,  N.  Y.,  from  July  29  to  August  8.  It  was  one  of  the  most 
interesting  and  successful  tournaments  ever  held  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Crescent   A.    C. 

Upsets  and  reversals  were  frequent  during  the  competition,  and  an  Ameri- 
can marathon  record  was  set  up  by  Hoffman  Nickerson  and  E.  B.  McCormick 
in  the  fourth  round  of  the  singles,  the  former  running  the  score  up  to  19/17 
in  their  second  set,  thus  eclipsing  all  previous  long  distance  tournament 
records. 

Touchard  and  J.  S.  Cushman  played  a  long  three-set  match  in  the  first 
round,  the  former  winning  the  third  set  at  6/3.  Bundy  started  play  against 
II.  K.  Sturdy,  Jr..  in  the  second  round  and  he  was  in  such  excellent  form 
that  his  opponent  got  but  two  games.  Inman  had  an  unexpectedly  easy  time 
winning  from  A.  H.  Man.  Jr. 

The  Alexander-Washburn  match  of  the  third  round  attracted  a  large 
gallery  and  was  replete  with  sensational  shots,  but  after  losing  the  first  set 
Alexander  came  back  strong  and  won  the  second  and  third  sets  quite  easily. 

Fottrell  faced  McLoughlin  in  the  third  round  and  made  the  famous  Cali- 
fornian  extend  himself  to  his  utmost  to  win.  Bundy  sprung  a  surprise  by 
defeating  Touchard  with  ease,  and  when  Merrill  Hall  succumbed  to  the  Davis 
Cup  player,  many  thought  that  Bundy  would  reach  the  semi-final,  but  in  this 
they  were  mistaken  as  he  was  defeated  very  handily  by   Inman. 

McLoughlin,  showing  very  brilliant  form,  disposed  of  Inman  in  three  sets 
in  the  semi-final  match,  but  the  other  semi-final  proved  to  lie  the  best  contest 
•of  the  tournament.  It  was  a  meeting  between  Murray  and  Alexander,  who 
had  met  twice  before  during  the  season  and  in  both  instances  Murray  was 
declared  the  victor.  This  last  match  at  once  resolved  itself  into  a  contest 
of  furious  speed  and  brilliancy.  Murray  had  the  speed,  the  dash  and  the 
stamina,  while  Alexander  had  the  head  and  tennis  strokes. 

Murray  won  the  first  set  by  breaking  through  the  veteran's  service,  and 
pulled  out  the  second  after  being  behind  at  5/3.  He  lost  the  third  after 
Alexander  had  point  set  on  him  eight  times.  The  Californian  played  well  in 
the  fourth  set  aud  ran  into  a  lead  of  5/2.  only  to  be  caught  again  by 
Alexander  in  a  wonderful  spurt  at  5-all.  An  extra  kick  to  his  serve  enabled 
Murray  to  run  out  the  set  at  8/6  and  with  it  the  match. 

The  final  match  between  McLoughlin  and  Murray,  played  on  August  20, 
resulted  in  a  victory  of  straight  sets  for  the  former.  McLoughlin  started 
with  wonderful  speed,  while  Murray  was  a  bit  nervous  and  off  his  game. 
McLoughlin  ran  off  the  first  four  games  of  the  first  set.  and  then  Murray 
1  took  the  fifth,  his  only  one  of  the  set,  on  errors  by  McLoughlin.  The  latter 
then  ran  out  the  next  two  games  for  the  set.  The  second  and  third  sets 
found  a  great  improvement  in  Murray's  play,  especially  in  serving.  McLough- 
lin found  the  twisting  ball  very  difficult  to  handle,  but  took  the  serve  just 
often  enough  to  keep   comfortably  in  the  lead  at  all   times. 

The  surprise  of  the  doubles  tournament  was  the  unexpectedly  brilliant 
showing  of  Claude  Wayne  and  Nat  Browne,  national  clay  court  champions, 
who  forced  Hackett  and  Alexander  to  five  hard  sets  before  they  bowed  to 
superior  speed  and  generalship. 

The  final  round  found  Hackett  and  Alexander  facing  Palmer  and  Throck- 
morton, who  had  won  the  lower  half  from  an  inferior  field.  As  was  expected, 
the  former  national  champions  won  in  straight  sets.  Alexander  with  his 
unbeatable  serve  and  Hackett  with  his  persistent  steadiness  and  accuracy 
proving  too  strong  a  combination.     The  summaries  :

Florida  State  Championships 

Theodore  Roosevelt  Tell  of  New  York,  retained  his  title  as  champion  of 
Florida  in  the  fifth  annual  tournament  held  by  the  Palm  Beach  Tennis  Club, 
on  the  Royal  Poinciana  courts,  from  February  28  to  March  7.  New  York  was 
further  honored  by  the  victory  of  Artemas  Holmes  and  F.  C.  Inman  in  the 
doubles.  In  the  women's  singles  Mrs.  Ramson  Wood,  who  defaulted  to  Mrs. 
paight  in  the  first  round  in  the  1913  tournament,  was  returned  the  winner, 
while  Miss  L.  G.  Witherbee  and  Miss  C.  Roberson  won  the  doubles  in  straight 
sets. 

The  list  of  entries  was  a  remarkable  one,  and  the  tournament  itself  recorded 
an  advance  over  the  high  standard  already  created.  The  attendance  daily  was 
large,  and  the  playing  generally  was  of  a  high  order  of  excellence. 

The  result  of  the  final  round  of  the  singles  between  Inman  and  Dabney  was 
quite  a  surprise.  As  the  latter  had  played  wonderful  tennis  up  to  this  time  it 
was  fully  expected  that  the  match  would  be  close  and  exciting,  with  the 
chances  about  even.  Inman.  however,  accomplished  what  really  was  a  runa- 
way, winning  in  straight  sets.  6/1,  6/3,  6/4. 

In  the  challenge  round  Inman  and  Pell  were  brought  together.  A  better 
match  has  rarely  been  seen  anywhere.  The  conditions  were  perfect.  To  the 
great  surprise  of  everyone,  Inman  won  the  first  two  sets  with  the  loss  of  but 
two  games  in  each  set.  The  pace,  however,  began  to  tell  on  Inman  and  he  lost 
the  third  set  as  easily  as  he  had  won  the  first  two.  He  showed  great  recupera- 
tive powers  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  sets,  but  lost  both  by  a  small  margin. 

Holmes  and  Inman  and  Dabney  and  Pell  met  in  the  final  round  of  the 
doubles.  This  was  looked  upon  as  sure  to  be  a  close  match,  with  the  odds 
slightly  in  favor  of  Dabney  and  Pell.  The  wise  ones,  however,  proved  poor 
guessers.  as  Holmes  and  Inman  won  in  straight  sets. 

In  the  women's  singles  there  was  also  a  large  entry  and  some  excellent 
tennis.  The  finals  brought  out  an  exhibition  of  hard  hitting  and  brilliancy  on 
the  part  of  Miss  Holmes  against  the  more  steady  Mrs.  Rawson  Wood.  The 
first  and  second  sets  were  equally  divided,  each  winning  one.  In  the  final  set 
each  contestant  came  within  a  point  of  winning  several  times  and  each  was

Maryland  State  Championships 

Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  displaced  Wallace  F.  Johnson  as  Maryland  cham- 
pion in  the  annual  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Baltimore  Country 
Club  during  the  week  of  May  14.  Pell  was  also  successful  in  the  doubles, 
paired  with  Charles  M.  Bull,  Jr.  The  mixed  doubles  was  won  by  a  Baltimore 
pair,  Miss  Susanne  White  and  Clarence  Fisher. 

In  the  final  round  of  the  singles,  the  best  J.  A.  C.  Colston  could  do  against 
Pell  was  to  force  the  score  of  the  third  set  to  7/5.  The  New  Yorker  was  in 
good  form  and  his  shots  had  plenty  of  sting.  In  the  challenge  round  against 
Johnson  he  got  revenge  for  his  defeat  at  Chevy  Chase  the  previous  week.  The

Iowa  State  Championships 


Roland  M.  Hoerr  outplayed  Fred  Bradley,  last  year's  winner,  in  the  final 
round  of  the  men's  singles,  and  Bradley,  with  Olin  Sweet  as  partner,  annexed 
the  doubles  in  the  Iowa  State  championship  tournament,  held  on  the  courts 
of  the  Hes  Moines   Colt'  and   Country   Club   from   July   1!7   to  August   :.'.      Mrs. 

D.  B.  Foster  of  Kansas  City  had  a  walkover  in  the  women's  singles,  and  the 
Misses  Denman  and  Scribner  triumphed  in  the  mixed  doubles. 

The  final  round  of  the  singles  was  a  disappointment,  as  Bradley  sprained  his 
ankle  following  the  city  tournament,  and  was  in  no  form  to  give  Hoerr  a 
match.  Mr.  Felt  of  Kansas  City  gave  complete  satisfaction  as  official  referee.

Championships  of  the  Carolinas 

W.  O.  Stacy  of  Texas,  treated  players  and  spectators  to  the  surprise  of  their 
lives  at  the  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Carolinas  during  the  week 
of  June  22.  An  utter  stranger  to  the  Carolinas,  and  showing  up  just  as  the 
tournament  started,  the  Texan,  without  much  effort,  won  through  to  the  finals 
in  both  singles  and  doubles.  With  Coffin  as  a  partner  he  lost  in  the  doubles,

Washington  State   Championships 

The  twenty-fourth  animal  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  State  of 
Washington. 'held  on  the  grounds  of  the  Seattle  Tennis  Club,  beginning  August 
JO,  was  marked  by  the  largest  entry  list  in  its  history,  98  in  men's  singles, 
52  in  women's  singles.  54  teams  in  men's  doubles,  28  in  women's  doubles,  45 
in  mixed  doubles  and  25  entries  in  junior  singles,  and  also  by  the  large  num- 
ber of  long  and  hard  fought  matches. 

The  final  round  of  singles  brought  together  II.  V.  D.  Johns  and  H.  C. 
Brock,  two  Californians.  The  former  played  the  same  careful  and  steady 
game  that  he  had  shown  throughout  the  tournament,  and  this  resulted  in  a 
straight  set  defeat  of  his  more  brilliant   but   less  steady  opponent. 

In  the  doubles.  Breck  and  Johns  defeated  S.  L.  Russell  and  R.  W.  Fulton, 
but  it  was  a  much  closer  and  more  exciting  match  than  was  expected,  being 
easilv  the  most  interesting  match  of  the  week.  Russell  and  Fulton  started 
out  by  taking  the  first  set,  6/3,  but  Breck  and  Johns  came  back  strong  and 
won  thi'  next  set.  6/2.  The  third  set  took  twenty-six  games  to  decide,  the 
Californians  finally  winning.  14/12.  Not  discouraged  in  the  least.  Russell  and 
Fulton  came  back  and  took  the  fourth  set,  6/4.  Breck  and  Johns  then  won  the 
fifth  and  deciding  set.  6/4.  by  their  superior  team  work. 

In  the  women's  singles  Miss  Livingstone  of  Seattle,  who  had  already  won 
the  Oregon  State  and  Pacific  Northwest  championships,  was  fortunate  in  the 
draw  and  went  through  easily,  her  hardest  match  being  with  Mrs.  Northrup 
of  Portland.  In  the  doubles,  Mrs.  Bragdon  and  Miss  Miller,  who  won  last 
'year,  were  again  triumphant  in  straight  sets,  losing  only  fifteen  games  in  five 
matches,  and  having  onlv  one  close  match,  the  semi-final  with  Miss  Fording 
and  Mrs.  Northrup  of  Portland,  which  they  won  6/3.  7/5.  In  the  mixed 
doubles.  Miss  Livingstone  and  Kelleher  defeated  Mrs.  Lyell  and  Cardinall  in 
the  final  round.     The  summaries  :

Massachusetts  State   Championship 

Nat  W.  Xiles  again  won  the  Massachusetts  championship  in  the  annual 
ournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club.  Boston,  begin- 
ling  June  11.  R.  C.  Seaver,  the  former  champion,  defeated  J.  J.  Armstrong 
n  the  final  round  of  the  tournament,  6/4,  3/6,  6/0,  3/6,  6/4.  In  the  chal- 
enge  round  Xiles  triumphed  over  Seaver  in  three  straight  sets,  6/4.  6/1,  6/2. 

From  a  not  particularly  large  but  distinctly  good  draw.  Seaver,  E.  II.  Wbit- 
lpy.  captain  of  the  1913-14  Harvard  team  :  .1.  .1.  Armstrong  of  St.  Paul,  one 
if  its  members,  and  A.  S.  Pier  of  the  Longwood  C.  C.  emerged  as  serni-final- 
sts.  Piir  had  several  close  calls  on  the  way  up.  playing  an  exceedingly  long 
natch  with  D.  S.  Xiles  in  the  third  round,  and  losing  the  second  set  at  love 
n  the  fourth  round  against  Lawrence  Curtis,  one  of  the  substitutes  of  the 
larvard  team. 

An  intensely  conservative  game  was  that  between  Seaver  and  Whitney  in 
;he  semi-finals.  Both  men  played  from  the  back  court,  taking  few  chances  at 
he  net,  and  in  those  few  cases  faring  ill.  Seaver  was  a  little  the  more  ac- 
:urate  and  the  more  aggressive,  enough  so  to  turn  the  trick.  In  the  first  set 
te  ran  to  a  3/1  lead,  only  to  be  caught  up  with  and  passed.  With  Whitney 
eading  at  4/3,  Seaver  pulled  up  and  added  three  straight  to  his  pile.  In  the 
econd  set  all  Whitney  could  annex  was  the  fourth  game,  the  final  score  being 
eturned  as  6/4,  6/1. 

The  surrender  of  experience  to  youth  was  not  realized  in  the  final,  from 
phich  Seaver  came  forth  as  tournament  winner  and  Xiles'  challenger.  It 
V&s  endurance  largely  that  told  the  difference  between  Seaver  and  Armstrong 
n  a  five-set  battle  which  lasted  over  three  hours.  In  every  set  Armstrong 
■utplaced  Seaver,  but  his  error  column  was  never  small.  Seaver  had  the  re- 
luisite  material  for  each  crisis  and  showed  that  his  1914  form  was  as  good 
is  that  of  a   few  years  ago. 

,  That  Xiles  had  learned  to  solve  his  old  master's  game  was  demonstrated 
'eyond  doubt  in  the  challenge  round.  After  he  had  settled  dowrn  the  cham- 
ion  won  as  he  pleased,  passing  Seaver  every  time  he  tried  to  take  the  net, 
nd  outplaying  him  in  driving,  when  both  were  back.  Xiles  served  in  most 
tffective  fashion,  enabling  him  to  take  the  offensive  with  little  opposition.

Nat  W.  Niles  and  W.  M.  Washburn  became  Massachusetts  State  doubles 
champions  in  the  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Brae  Burn  Country 
Club,  West  Newton,  on  May  31.  They  defeated  H.  C.  Johnson  and  E.  H.  Whit- 
ney, former  champions,  in  one  of  the  longest  and  most  stubbornly  contested 
battles   in   the  history   of  the   competition,   0/1,   4/6,    7/."..    2/6,  6/4. 

Whitney  started  poorly,  but  improved  after  the  first  set.  which  he  and 
Johnson  lost,  largely  due  to  Washburn's  fine  play.  The  second  was  bitterly 
fought,  finally  going  to  Johnson  and  Whitney.  They  fought  hard  for  the  odd 
one,  but  were  nosed  out,  7/5.  Again  the  champions  came  from  behind  and  won 
the  fourth  set  at  6/2.  The  last  was  touch  and  go  up  to  the  final  game,  in 
which  Johnson  made  fatal  errors.     The  summaries  :

Kentucky  State   Championships 

By  George  Biggers,  Lofisyille.  Ky. 

The  fourth  annual  Kentucky  State  championship  tennis  tournament  was 
held  on  the  courts  of  the  Audubon  Country  Club,  Louisville,  starting  Septem- 
ber 1,  and  it  was  one  of  the  most  successful  competitions,  in  every  way, 
ever  conducted  in  the  State.  The  entry  list  was  unusually  large.  It  was 
the  first  time  the  tournament  had  ever  been  held  in  Louisville,  the  metropolis 
of  Kentucky,  hence  it  was  given  more  publicity  and  the  results  reached 
more  tennis  enthusiasts  throughout  the  State  than  usual.      Previously,   Estill

Springs  had  a  monopoly  on  this  event.  The  tournament  was  brought  to  a 
lose  on  September  7.  after  one  week  of  continuous  play  and  perfect  weather. 
)n  the  last  day.  Shelton  Arterburn  won  the  championship  from  Harry  Grin- 
pad,  a  promising  young  player  who  had  been  recognized  the  year  before  as 
he  best  that  the  State  had  produced.  Arterburn  is  no  youngster  on  the 
ourts  in  Louisville,  having  participated  in  many  tournaments  and  has  been 
within  a  reaching  distance  of  several  championships,  only  to  fall  down  at 
he  crucial  moment.  He  won  the  Kentucky  title  from  Grinstead  after  live 
iard  fought  sets,  the  scores  being,  6/4,  4/6,  5/7,  (5/2,  6/4.  Grinstead  was 
way  off  the  form  he  displayed  the  previous  year.  He  made  145  errors,  36 
lacements,  and  was  guilty  of  six  double  faults.  Arterburn  played  a  con- 
istent  game,  and  his  cannon  ball  shots,  placed  accurately,  chased  Grinstead 
intil  a  defeat  was  a  happy  relief  from  the  grind.  Grinstead  had  been  out 
f  form  all  season.  In  the  Falls  Cities  tournament,  held  earlier  in  the  sum- 
aer,  Grinstead  was  defeated  by  Jimmy  Means,  a  fairly  good  player,  who  was 
^oted  for  his  ability  to  play  good  tennis  and  his  inability  to  defeat  anyone, 
ggterburn's  victory  was  a  popular  one,  for  he  had  been  the  runner-up  so 
ften  that  the  tennis  fans  wanted  to  see  him  gain  a  title.  With  his  brother, 
Covington,  Shelton  held  the  State  doubles  championship  several  years  ago. 
ihelton  Arterburn  and  Kenneth  Bixby  defeated  Harry  Grinstead  and  Sid 
Hp>el  in  the  men's  doubles,  the  scores  being,  3/6,  6/4,  6/0,  6/8,  6/2.  Miss 
lary  Shreve  Lyons  and  Harry  Grinstead  won  the  mixed  doubles  title  from 
iiss  Mary  Mason  and  Shelton  Arterburn,  6/2.  6/4,  5/7,  6/4.  Miss  Madelle 
Lyons  won  the  women's  singles  honors  from  her  sister,  Miss  Mary  Shreve 
iyons,   by   default. 

Illinois  State    Championships 

The  biggest  field  that  ever  participated  in  any  tennis  contest  in  the  West 
/as  entered  in  the  Illinois  State  tournament,  which  began  on  the  courts  of 
he  Wanderers'  Club,  Chicago,  July  11.  The  programme  showed  that  there 
,-ere  132  men  and  24  women  entered,  exceeding  the  entries  of  1913  by  over 
fty.  Playing  conditions  were  perfect,  and  all  the  twenty-five  grass  courts 
fere  in  use.  The  greensward  resembled  velvet,  and  the  ground  under  it 
ras  as  hard  as  cement.  In  the  singles,  Alex  Squair  annexed  the  cham- 
ionship  by  defeating  Ralph  Burdick  in  the  final  round  in  a  long  five-set 
Etch,  and  in  the  doubles.  W.  T.  Hayes  and  J.  IT.  Winston  defeated  Weber 
nd  Green  in  the  final  round  in  three  straight  sets.  Mrs.  C.  N.  Beard  won 
he  women's  singles,  defeating  Miss  Mary  K.  Voorheis  in  the  final  round, 
nd  in  the  doubles,  Miss  Steever  and  Mrs.  Beard  defeated  Miss  Neely  and 
Irs.  Brewer  in  the  final  round.  W.  T.  Hayes,  who  needed  only  one  victory 
o  gain  permanent  possession  of  the  trophy,  was  defeated  in  his  semi-final 
patch  with  Ralph  Burdick.  The  first  two  sets  went  to  Burdick  and  he 
lad  the  next  all  but  one  point,  when  Hayes  rallied  and  took  the  game. 
Hieing  the  set  and  finally  winning,  7-5.     In  the  next  set  Burdick  never  got 

game.  The  latter,  however,  came  back  strong  and  von  the  final  set  and 
natch.  When  the  final  round  between  Squair  and  Burdick  was  called  a  large 
:alleiy  lined  the  sides  of  the  court,  which  the  players  declared  was  in 
ieellent  condition.  Squair  started  off  by  taking  the  first  set,  his  well 
"aced  in  court  shots  keeping  his  opponent  guessing.  Both  players  served 
fell,  and  P.urdick's  back  court  work  was  especially  brilliant.  The  next  set 
rent  to  Burdick.  Although  Squair  played  the  better  tennis  he  was  unable 
o  handle  the  balls  that  were  volleyed  at  him  from  the  back  court  by  his 
pponent.      Both   players   were   after   the  points   in   the  next   set   and  played 

careful  game,  making  every  shot  tell.  Nearly  every  game  in  this  set  went 
o  deuce,  with  Squair  winning.  Burdick  evened  up  the  match  by  taking- 
he  next  set  in  whirlwind  fashion,  having  abandoned  his  slow  but  sure 
aeties  ;ind  relying  on  taking  his  opponent  with  a  rush,  which  he  did.  With 
he  match  all  even  and  one  set  to  play,  the  two  men  settled  down  to  the 
low,  careful  game  again.  Squair  proved  himself  the  better  at  this  style 
nd  soon  had  Burdick.  5/1.  He  dropped  Hie  next  game.  The  deciding  game 
vms    a    long    drawn    out    affair,    which    finally    went    to    Squair,    giving    him    the

set  and  match.  In  the  men's  doubles  both  Hayes  and  Winston  and  Weber 
and  Green  played  good  tennis  from  the  start.  The  first  set  was  the  most 
stubbornly  fought  match  that  had  been  played  during  the  entire  tournament, 
and  it  was  necessary  to  complete  twenty-six  games  before  the  result  was 
decided  in  favor  of  Weber  and  Green.  Every  man  played  the  best  tennis 
that  he  knew.  The  back  court  work  of  both  sides  was  perfect,  and  when 
they  volleyed  the  ball  to  each  other  at  the  net  the  spectators  were  breath- 
less as  to  the  outcome.     The  summaries  :

New  Hampshire  State   Championships 

For  the  second  successive  year.  James  Nowell  of  Boston.  Mass..  won  thej 
White  Mountains  and  New  Hampshire  State  championship  in  singles,  defeat 
ing  King  Smith,  winner  of  the  tournament,  in  the  challenge  round,  on  the 
courts  of  the  Crawford  House  Tennis  Club,  Crawford  Notch,  N.  II.,  beginning 
July  30.  In  (lie  doubles.  Nowell  and  C.  B.  Wilbar  were  defeated  by  Smith  and 
Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk  in  straight  sets. 

Thirty  entries  from  New  York,  Boston,  Philadelphia  and  Lowell  made  ar 
auspicious  list  of  contenders.  The  play  as  a  whole,  however,  was  not  up  t( 
the  high  average  of  1911  and  1912,  still  the  semi-finals  in  singles  found  foui 
good  men  on  hand.  In  the  final  between  Smith  and  L.  H.  Martin,  the  forme) 
dropped  the  second  set,  but  thereafter  won  as  he  liked.  In  the  challongi 
round  Smith  showed  his  best  form  in  the  second  set,  which  he  won.  but  fron 
the  middle  of  the  third  set  to  the  end  he  was  completely  outplayed. 

The  doubles  did  not  furnish  any  unusual  tennis  until  the  final  round,  whicl 
was  limited  to  tbree  sets.  Smith  and  Hawk  started  off  like  a  whirlwind,  tak 
ing  the  first  set,  6/2.  Changing  courts,  the  winners  went  absolutely  to  piece 
even  as  Nowell  and  Wilbar  seemed  to  And  themselves.  The  result  was  a  6/.' 
win  for  the  Boston  team.  The  third  set  was  for  blood,  and  though  Hawk  ani 
Smith  came  through  at  6/3,  the  fight  was  much  closer  than  the  score  indi 
cates.     The  summaries  :

Pennsylvania  State   Championships 

Richard  Norris  Williams.  2d,  won  the  singles  in  the  Pennsylvania  State 
championship  tournament,  held  on  the  courts"  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club  of 
Philadelphia  during  the  week  beginning  June  15.  The  doubles  went  to  Wal- 
lace F.  Johnson  and  Alexander  D.  Thayer. 

The  big  surprise  of  the  tournament  was  the  victory  of  S.  W.  Pearson  over 
W.  F.  Johnson,  the  winner  in  1913,  and  whose  three  consecutive  successes 
gave  him  the  old  cup  outright, 

Williams'  opponent  in  the  final  round  was  William  T.  Tilden,  Jr..  who  was 
defeated.  G/4.  6/0,  .1/(3.  6/2. 

Play  in  the  doubles  was  not  so  interesting  as  in  the  singles  matches.  When 
Johnson  and  Thayer  defeated  Williams  and  Carpenter  in  the  third  round  of 
play  the  State  champions  disposed  of  the  most  likely  aspirants  for  the  cup. 
Their  opponents  in  the  finals  were  P.  B.  Hawk  and  Robert  H.  Hervey,  but  the 
latter  were  defeated  in  straight  sets.     The  summaries  :

Rhode  Island  State  Championships 

The  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Rhode  Island,  held  on  the  courts 
of  the  Agawam  Hunt,  East  Providence.  R.  1.,  beginning  August  1,  was  featured 
by  the  playing  of  Elia  Fottrell  of  California,  who  secured  one  leg  on  the  beau 
tiful  championship  bowl  for  the  winner  of  the  singles. 

In  the  semi-finals  Fottrell  defeated  Whitney,  last  year's  champion,  quite 
easily,  and  in  the  other  half  II.  A.  Mackinney  and  Russell  N.  Dana  had  a 
battle  royal.  With  the  set  2-all  and  the  games  in  the  fifth  set  8/8  the  two 
probably  set  a  precedent.  Because  of  the  intense  heat  and  the  fact  that  both 
players  were  nearly  exhausted  by  their  efforts,  it  was  agreed  to  turn  a  racket 
to  decide  who  should  play  Fottrell  for  the  championship.  Mackinney  called 
"rough"  and  lost.  In  the  doubles  Jones  and  Henshaw,  who  have  been  win- 
ning the  title  for  years,  again  were  returned  the  victors.     The  summaries  :

The  twentieth  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Texas,  held  on  flic  courts 
of  the  Texarkana  (Ark.)  Tennis  Club  during  the  week  of  June  22,  produced

supplanted  Harvey  MaeQuiston  in  the  singles,  and  J.  B.  Adoue.  Jr..  and  J.  II. 
Shelton  of  Dallas  dethroned  the  men  who  defeated  them  in  1913,  the  Mae- 
Quiston brothers. 

The  final  match  was  a  contest  between  Russ,  an  experienced  general,  and 
Adoue.  who  had  improved  greatly  in  the  past  year.  Russ  finally  broke  up 
Adoue's  driving  game  by  continually  forcing  his  far  backhand  and  taking  the 
net.  where  his  volleys  were  safe  and  sure. 

Sixteen  teams  were  entered  in  the  doubles  event,  which  was  won  by  Adoue 
and  Shelton  with  the  loss  of  but  one  set.  Their  play  was  far  superior  to

New  Mexico  State  Championships 

The  first  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  New  Mexico  was 
held  on  the  courts  of  the  Roswell  Tennis  Association,  October  2C*  to  23.  Un- 
fortunately the  weather  was  unfavorable  on  account  of  rain,  and  the  at- 
tendance was  thereby  affected,  but  the  courts  were  kept  in  good  condition,  and 
the  playing  as  a  rule  was  excellent.  N.  A.  Ferguson  of  El  Paso,  proved  him- 
self to  be  the  class  of  the  tournament.  He  played  fifty-five  games  in  the  sin- 
gles and  lost  only  one.     In  the  final  round  he  defeated  Major  E.  P.  Spencer. 

In  the  doubles  the  closest  match  was  that  between  Simpson  and  Harlow  and 
Lynch  and  Browning  in  the  first  round,  the  latter  winning  by  9/7,  3/6,  6/2. 
Baker  and  Herring  came  through  the  lower  frame  rather  easily,  but  were  de- 
feated for  the  title  by  Ferguson  and  Jette.     The  summaries :

Wyoming  State  Championships 

Without  the  loss  of  a  set.  Dr.  Herbert  T.  Harris  won  the  singles  champion- 
ship, and  Dr.  Chester  Harris  and  Julian  Snow  the  doubles  title  of  Wyoming, 
in  the  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Basin  Tennis  Club  of  Basin,  Wyo., 
during  the  week  of  July  26. 

While  the  entry  list  was  smaller  than  usual — twenty-four  in  the  singles 
and  twelve  teams"  in  the  doubles — it  was  regarded  as  the  most  successful 
tournament  ever  held  in  the  State.  Fine  weather  prevailed,  and  the  hard 
courts  were  in  excellent  condition. 

The  final  round  of  singles  brought  together  Dr.  H.  T.  Harris  and  Julian 
Snow,  the  former  winning  an  interesting  match,  6/1,  6/3,  6/4.  In  the  doubles, 
Dr.  Chester  Harris  and  Julian  Snow  won  the  championship  in  a  hard  fought

7/5,  4/6,  S/6. 


Colorado  State  Championships 

Brooke  Townsend  won.  the  championship  of  Colorado  at  the  tournament  held 
on  the  courts  of  the  Denver  Country  Club,  beginning  September  1.  It  was  his 
second  successive  victory  for  the  title  and  the  Walsh  challenge  trophy.  He 
defeated  Don  Harker  in  the  final  round,  chiefly  because  of  his  greater  steadiness 
and  endurance,  coupled  witli  the  ability  to  speed  a  bit  in  the  pinches. 

John  Moroy  and  Bill  Graham,  two  or  Colorado's  veteran  stars,  captured  the 
doubles  in  the  final  match  with  Eugene  and  Tyson  Dines.  By  their  victory, 
Morey  and  Graham  became  permanent  possessors  of  the  Country  Club  chal-

Oklahoma  State  Championships 

The  eighth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Oklahoma  was  held 
in  Oklahoma  City,  August  10  to  14  inclusive,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Okla- 
homa Citv  Golf 'and  Country  Club.  The  four  cement  courts,  dark  green  in 
color  used  for  the  first  time  bv  many  of  the  players,  proved  very  satisfactory, 
and  the  majority  of  those  present  favored  making  Oklahoma  City  the  perma- 
nent meeting  place  for  the  state  tournament. 


142  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  tournament  was  efficiently  handled  by  Referee  A.  U.  Thomas  of  Mc- 
Alester.  On  the  evening  of  August  11  the  annual  meeting  of  the  State  Lawn 
Tennis  Association  was  held,  the  following  officers  being  elected  :  President, 
A.  U.  Thomas.  McAlester ;  Vice  President,  Charles  T.  Speice,  Kingfisher;  Sec- 
retary-Treasurer, Charles  K.  Boardman,  Oklahoma  City;  Executive  Committee, 
the  above  officers  and  A.  B.  Walker,   Fairview,  and  T.  L.  Bouscaren,  Tulsa. 

Roland  M.  Hoerr  of  St.  Louis,  again  carried  off  the  honors,  defeating  Charles 
T.  Speice  of  Kingfisher,  in  the  final  of  the  singles.  This  gives  Iloerr  a  second 
leg  on  the  handsome  Spalding  trophy,  upon  which  the  following  names  have 
been  inscribed  :  John  T.  Bailev.  Albion.  Okla..  1910  ;  Charles  T.  Speice,  King- 
fisher. Okla.,  1911;  John  T.  Bailev,  Albion.  Okla.,  1912;  Roland  M.  Hoerr,  St. 
Louis.  Mo..  1913  ;  Roland  M.  Hoerr,  St.  Louis.  Mo.,  1914. 

Hoerr's  play  throughout  was  strong  and  steady  and  he  always  seemed  to 
have  plenty  of  reserve  force.  He  lost  but  one  set  to  Paul  Darrough  of  Hugo, 
okla.,  who  was  runner-up  in  the  1913  tournament. 

W.  A.  Horrell  of  Pasadena,  Cal..  played  an  excellent  game,  his  match  in 
the  semi-finals  against  the  local  champion,  Charles  T.  Speice  of  Kingfisher, 
being  one  of  the  features  of  the  tournament.  Other  notable  matches  were  be- 
tween Horrell  and  Richardson  of  Oklahoma  City.  Monnett  of  Norman  and 
Brown-  of  Anadarko.  McNeill  and  Wooten  both  of  Chickasha,  Walker  of  Fair- 
view  and  Davis  of  McAlester,  Cook  of  Pawhuska  and  Williams  of  Oklahoma 
City,  and  Frank  Staley  of   Fairview  and  Richardson. 

Iloerr  and  Horrell  carried  away  the  title  of  State  champions  in  doubles,  de- 
feating Charles  T.  Speice  and  R.  E.  Conger,  the  1913  title  holders,  in  the  finals.

West  Virginia  State  Championships 

BY  It.  A.  JOHNSONj   Parkersburg,  W.   Va. 

In  spite  of  the  heavy  rain  which  held  up  play  for  fully  a  day  and  a  half, 
the  ninth  annual  invitation  tennis  tournament,  which  began  on  Monday.  August 
10.  and  continued  through  the  week,  was  .me  of  the  most  attractive  and 
brilliant  events  ever  held  on  the  beautiful  grounds  of  the  Parkersburg  Country 
Club.  "Tennis  Week"  proved  to  lie  one  continuous  round  of  gaiety  for  the 
Bayers  and  friends.  The  lara;e  park  dance  on  Monday  evening,  followed  by 
the'  annual  stag  banquet  and  informal  dance  on  Tuesday,  and  the  brilliant 
club  dance  on   Wednesdav  were  the  social   features  of  the  week,  while  many 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  145 

informal  parties  served  to  keep  this  jolly  crowd  of  tennis  enthusiasts  busy 
every  minute.  The  meet  was  marked  by  sterling  tennis  of  the  highest  class. 
Again  Parkersburg  was  successful  in  carrying  off  the  championship  in  singles 
by  the  heady  and  consistent  play  of  R.  A.  Johnson,  who  won  his  way  through 
the  singles  by  the  cleverest  kind  of  racket  work.  The  doubles  championship 
was  taken,  by  Hugus  and  Beattie  of  Wheeling,  after  a  brilliant  five-set  match 
with  R.  A.  Johnson  and  Benton  Beatty  of  Parkersburg,  who  were  last  year's 
holders  of  the  title.  It  looked  as  if  Parkersburg  would  also  take  this  event 
as  Johnson  and  Beatty  won  the  first  two  sets  with  comparative  ease,  but  at 
this  point  in  the  contest  the  Wheeling  players  again  struck  their  gait  and 
came  back  strong  for  the  last  three  sets  and  match.     The  summaries  :

Minnesota  State    Championships 

By  Frederick   U.   Davis,  Faribault,  Minx. 

The  thirteenth  annual  tournament  of  flip  Minnesota  State  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  for  the  championship  of  the  State  was  held  on  the  clay  courts

continuing-  through  the  following  week.  ,T.  J.  Armstrong,  the  1913  cham- 
pion, did  not  play  in  the  tournament,  and  it  was  generally  expected  that

ever. F.  R.  Albright  of  St.  Paul,  by  brilliant  and  consistent  work,  played 
successfully  through  the  tournament,  defeating  Adams  in  the  semi-finals,  in 
a  spectacular  match,  and  winning  in  the  final  over  Stellwagen  in  straight  sets. 

In  the  doubles,  Albright  and  his  teammate,  J.  C.  DeCourcy,  were  defeated 
in  the  final  by  Stellwagen  and  Trafford  Jayne,  in  the  most  exciting  match 
of  the  tournament,  by  the  score  4/6,  6/3,  3/6,  6/3,  6/4. 

The  special  championship  singles,  open  to  all  men  living  outside  St.  Paul, 
Minneapolis  and  Duluth,  was  won  by  A.  P.  Hubbell  of  Mankato,  defeating  S. 
W.  Kinyon  of  Owatonna,   in  the  final    round. 

In  the  women's  events,  Miss  Marguerite  Davis  of  St.  Paul,  won  the  singles 
championship,  defeating  Miss  Alice  Drake  in  the  final.  Mrs.  Gardner  and 
Miss  Roberta  Ritchie  of  Duluth  won  the  doubles  over  Miss  Curtis  and  Miss 
Drake. 

In  the  final  of  the  mixed  championship  doubles.  Miss  Davis  and  Mr.

Nebraska  State  Championships 

The  third  annual  tournament  of  the  Nebraska  State  Tennis  Association 
for  the  championship  of  the  State  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Wayne 
Tennis  Club,  August  4  to  8.  Perfect  courts,  good  weather  and  the  hospitality 
of  the  Wayne  people  all  helped  to  make  the  tournament  a  great  success, 
in  fact,  the  best  in  the  history  of  the  association.  Hard  fought  matches  were 
the  rule.  Sixty  players  actually  took  part,  although  there  were  seventy-one 
entries.  Harry  A.  Koch  of  Omaha,  again  won  the  singles  event,  for  the  third 
consecutive  year,  by  defeating  Frank  Garey  of  Fairmont,  in  the  challenge 
round,  three  sets  to  one.  Garey's  playing  was  the  feature  of  the  competition, 
it  being  his  first  appearance  at  any  of  the  tournaments  of  the  association. 
Davis  and  Ellis  of  Beaver  City,  won  the  doubles  championship  through  su- 
perior team  work  and  the  sensational  work  of  Ellis  at  the  net.  They  defeated 
McKillip  and  Rankin  three  sets  to  one  in  the  challenge  round.  One  of  the 
most  noteworthy  matches  in  doubles  was  that  between  McKillip  and  Rankin 
and  Stiehm,  the  University  of  Nebraska  coach,  and  Morgan.  The  first  set 
went  15/13.  and  lasted  over  two  hours.  After  this  set  McKillip  and  Rankin 
ran  away  with  the  other  two.  Ellis  of  Beaver  City,  won  the  consolation 
singles,  and  Madden  and  R.  Powell  of  Omaha,  the  consolation  doubles.  The

California  State  Championships 

By  Carl  R.  Gardner. 

For  the  third  successive  year  the  State  tournament  was  held  on  the  three 
asphalt  courts  of  the  Claremont  Country  Club,  Oakland,  but  took  place  at  a 
later  date  than  ever  before,  starting  October  24.  In  the  men's  events  new 
champions  came  into  vogue.  John  St  radian,  who  has  played  second  fiddle  to 
"Billy"  Johnston  for  several  years,  severely  trounced  his  rival  in  the  fourth 
round.  Johnston's  condition  was  none  too  good,  and  after  putting  a  world 
of  "pep"  into  the  first  four  or>-five  games  and  leading  at  4/1,  the  pace  told 
and  he  crumpled  under  the  heavy  driving  of  Strachan.  The  latter  ran  ten 
successive  games  and  eventually  won  at  6/4,  6/2.  His  play  in  this  tourna- 
ment was  an  improvement  on  anything  he  has  ever  shown,  and  he  handled 
Griffin,  in  the  semi-final,  and  Bowie  Detrick,  in  the  final,  about  as  he  pleased, 
taking  the  championship  without  the  loss  of  a  set. 

Detrick's  work  was  most  commendable,  his  defeats  of  Roberts  and  Batkin, 
en.  route  to  the  final,  being  better  than  any  previous  accomplishment.  He 
was  completely  at  the  mercy  of  Strachan  in  the  final,  however,  and  could 
make  no  headway  in  any  department,  as  the  score  of  6/1,  6/1,  6/3  would 
suggest. 

Strachan  and  Johnston  took  the  doubles,  lolling  through  to  the  final,  where 
they  dropped  a  set  to  Roberts  and  Batkin.  They  seemed  a  bit  too  certain  of 
victory,  and.  after  taking  the  first  set  at  love,  relaxed  and  were  defeated,  6/1, 
in  the  second.  After  that  Roberts  and  Batkin  played  high  class  tennis  and 
nearly  won  the  third  set,  which  finally  went  against  them,  7/5.  The  fourth 
set  and   match   was  won   by    Strachan   and   Johnston.   6/3. 

Mrs.  Wood  (nee  Sarita  Van  Vliet),  for  the  third  time,  won  the  women's 
title,  encountering  strenuous  opposition  from  Miss  Helen  Baker,  whom  she  de- 
feated in  the  semi-final  round.  Consistency  told,  however,  as  it  did  in  the 
final,  when  she  defeated  Mrs.  Niemeyer,  9/7.  6/2.  Mrs.  Niemeyer  is  pretty 
long  on  consistency  herself,  but  Mrs.  Wood  is  the  originator  of  the  term — its 
very  personification — and  she  would  not  be  denied  a  victory.

New  Jersey  State  Championships 

The  tournament  for  the  championship  of  New  Jersey,  held  on  the  courts 
of  the  Englewood  Field  Club  during  the  week  of  June  S.  attracted  an  unusually 
large  number  of  entries,  including  many  of  the  leading  players  of  the  metro- 
politan district. 

G.  Carlton  Shafer.  by  defeating  S.  H.  Voshell  in  the  final  round,  annexed 
the  singles,  and,  paired  with   Wylie  C.  Grant,  also  won   the  doubles.      In   his 


154  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL- 

match  with  Voshell,  shafer  was  at  the  top  of  his  game.  His  opponent  did  not 
have  enough  opposition  in  his  matches,  and  had  not  worked  up  the  combina- 
tion of  severity  and  steadiness  that  would  have  been  necessary  to  win  from 
Shafer. 

The  doubles  provided  some  exciting  matches.  The  final  could  not  be  finished 
on  June  13,  though  Shafer  was  playing  strong.  When  the  match  was  finally 
played  off  some  days  later  in  a  drizzle.  Grant  and  Shafer  won  in  four  stub- 
born sets,  after  having  lost  the  first,  7/9.  Baggs  and  Voshell  were  within  a 
point  of  taking  the  third  also  when  an  unexpected  pick-up  from  Grant's  feet 
sailed  between  them.     The  summaries  :

Bay  Counties  Championships 

Br  Carl  Ii.  Gardner,  San  Francisco. 

The  eleventh  annual  Bay  Counties  championship,  held,  as  usual,  on  the 
rourts  at  Golden  Gate  Park,  under  the  management  of  James  A.  Code  (or 
he  Golden  Gate  Park  Tennis  Club)  was  brought  to  a  successful  close,  at  least, 
o  far  as  the  doubles  were  concerned,  in  October.  The  singles  progressed 
o  the  final  round.  John  Strachan  and  R.  Lindlev  Murray  being  the  last  two 
:ombatants.  This  match  was  started  on  October  24,  but  in  the  second  set 
Murray  sustained  a  badly  twisted  instep.  He  tried  to  go  on,  and  even  played 
rat  the  set,  but  in  the  third  game  of  the  third  set  he  had  to  withdraw. 
>trachan  was  leading.  7/5,  ft/2,  2/0,  but  when  the  match  is  resumed  the 
ioming  season  Strachan  will  be  credited  with  onlv  the  first  set.  Both 
Strachan  and  Murray  reached  the  final  round  without  serious  opposition,  al- 
hrough  Strachan  dropped  a  set  to  Ray  Greenberg  in  the  semi-finals.  Of  the 
wo  finalists,  Strachan  played  in  better  form,  Murray  being  on  hard  courts 
or  the  first  time  in  several  months.  William  M.  Johnston  and  Strachan  won 
he  doubles  rather  easily,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  thev  lost  a  set  to  Johns 
nd  Roberts  in  the  semi-final  round.  This  was  due  largelv  to  overconfidence 
nd  a  disinclination  to  take  matters  seriously.  The  youngsters,  Johns  and 
Roberts,  played  well  and  deserve  credit  for  taking  the  only  set  lost  by  the 
pinners  of  the  tournament.  Griffin  and  Batkin  met  Johnston  and  Strachan 
d  the  final  round  and  put  up  a  good  fight  in  the  second  set.  They  were

Eastern  New  York  Championships 

For  the  second  successive  year  S.  Howard  Voshell  won  the  Eastern 
championship  of  New  York  State,  in  singles,  on  the  dirt  courts  of  the  County 
Tennis  Club  of  Westchester,  at  Hartsdale,  beginning  May  30.  The  final 
round  between  Voshell  and  R.  L.  Baggs  was  disappointing.  It  was  thought 
that  Baggs,  after  his  fine  five-set  match  against  Shafer  in  the  New  York 
T.  C.  finals,  would  at  least  make  a  hard  fight.  But  after  losing  the  first  set 
at  6/4  he  went  to  pieces  and  appeared  to  be  listless  and  outplayed.  F.  B. 
Alexander  and  A.  Bassford.  Jr..  won  the  doubles.  In  the  final  round  against 
Voshell  and  Baggs,  Alexander  dominated  the  match,  and  although  Baggs  and 
Voshell  attempted  to  keep  him  out  of  the  play,  he  would  often  cross  over  on 
Bassford's  side  to  make  the  kill.  YoshelPs  service  was  always  difficult  to 
handle.     The  summaries  :

Manhattan  Doubles  and  Open  Singles 

The  Manhattan  Doubles  and  Open  Singles  comprised  the  programme  of  the 
annual  open  tournament  of  the  New  York  Lawn  Tennis  Club  during  the 
"Week  of  May  23. 

G.  Carlton  Shafer  of  New  York,  who  was  runner-up  in  1013,  took  the  singles 
honors.  S.  II.  Voshell.  the  1913  winner,  being  defeated  by  Louis  Graves  before 
the  semi-finals  were  reached.  Ralph  Baggs  was  Shafer's  opponent  in  the  final 
round,  and  before  Shafer  was  returned  the  winner  the  full  five  sets  were 
played. 

Several  things  combined  to  deprive  the  Manhattan  Doubles  competition  of 
its  usual  interest.  King  Smith  and  Shafer  retained  the  title  almost  without  a 
struggle.  Baggs  and  Voshell  had  entered,  but  passed  up  the  opportunity  of 
getting  revenge  for  last  year,  and  defaulted.  Wylie  Grant  and  Julio  Steinacher 
reached  the  finals  after  defeating  Lovibond  and  Rosenbaum  with  the  loss  of  a 
set  and  then  almost  losing  to  Fitzpatrick  and  Henderson.  Against  Shafer  and 
.Smith  they  made  no  headway.     The  summaries  :

Chevy   Chase   Tournament 

Wallace  P.  Johnson  annexed  the  singles  championship  and  T.  R.   Pell  and 

C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  the  doubles  title,  in  the  seventh  annual  invitation  tournament 
of  the  Chevy  Chase  Club,  held  on  the  club  courts,  just  outside  of  Washington, 

D.  C.  Miss  I.  E.  Pendleton  captured  the  women's  singles,  and  Mrs.  W.  Sulli- 
van and  Miss  Meredith  of  Richmond,  Va.,  the  doubles.  The  mixed  doubles 
honors  were  taken  by  Mrs.  Sullivan  and  W.  F.  Johnson. 

The  final  round  of  the  men's  singles  between  Johnson  and  Pell  was  by  far 
the  best  of  the  tournament,  going  the  full  limit  of  five  sets.  Johnson  had 
everything,  and,  when  necessary,  rushed  Pell  off  his  feet.  The  conditions 
favored  the  New  Yorker,  for  he  was  used  to  dirt  and  Johnson  had  just  come 
off  of  grass.  The  challenge  round  between  Johnson  and  C.  M.  Bull  lasted  only- 
three  sets,  being  won  by  the  former,  but  the  play  was  exceedingly  close 
throughout,  and  both  men  were  in  rare  form.     The  summaries  :

Hot  Springs  (Va.)  Tournament 

Fred  C.  Inman,  of  New  York  City,  got  his  second  leg  on  the  challenge  cup 
in  the  third  annual  open  tournament  of  the  Hot  Springs  Tennis  Club,  Hot 
Springs,  Va.,  beginning  October  12.  The  cup  was  aot  defended  by  Wallace  F. 
Johnson,  last  year's  winner,  and  in  the  final  round  of  the  tournament  Inman 
defeated  John  A.  Allen,  the  old  Yale  player,  in  a  hard  fought  five-set  match. 
The  final  round  of  the  doubles  went  by  default  to  Inman  and  Edgar  Scott, 
partly  owing  to  rain  and  the  enforced  departure  of  Morris  L,  Johnston. 

There  was  a  good  entry  list  in  each  of  the  events  and  although  the  rain, 
which  prevailed  the  greater  part  of  the  week,  was  a  severe  handicap,  the  play 
■was  almost  uniformly  good.     The  summaries  :

Lawn  Tennis  in  Cincinnati  and  Vicinity 

By  Gordon  E.   Small. 
Dayton  Open  Tournament 

Clarence  J.  Griffin,  after  coming  through  the  tournament  of  the  Dayton 
Country  Club  of  Dayton,  Ohio,  beginning  July  IS,  defeated  Clifford  Lockhorn 
in  the  challenge  round  in  a  four-set  match.  Paired  with  Horrell  he  also  won 
the  doubles.  Miss  Lyons  won  the  final  round  of  the  women's  singles,  but 
was  defeated  in  the  challenge  round  by  Miss  Marjorie  Dodd.  In  the  women's 
doubles.  Miss  Dodd  and  Miss  Lyons  were  easily  triumphant. 

The  tournament  was  entirely  successful,  thanks  to  the  able  manner  in 
which  it  was  conducted  by  the  Country  Club,  of  which  G.  S.  Blanchard  and 
E.  C.  Reynolds,  two  prominent  business  men  of  Dayton,  are  the  leaders.  The 
game  has  taken  a  strong  hold  in  Dayton,  and  it  is  not  believed  that  Messrs. 
Blanchard  and  Reynolds  will  be  contented  to  rest  with  the  success  of  local 
tournaments,  but  will  make  strenuous  efforts  to  hold  a  national  competition  in 
the   near  future.     The  summaries  :

Ohio  Lawn  Tennis  League 


The  Saturday  Afternoon  Tennis  League,  composed  of  clubs  in  and  around 
Cincinnati,  had  a  most  successful  season  in  1914.  The  Westwood  Club  again 
won  the  championship,  but  the  race  was  close,  Westwood  barely  nosing  out 
Cincinnati,  winning  by  the  narrow  margin  of  three  sets.  Cincinnati  captured 
a  big  majority  of  the  sots  actually  played,  but  lost  out  through  defaults. 
Westwood  and  Norwood  were  the  only  chilis  to  play  out  every  scheduled  match. 

The  surprise  of  the  year  was  the  showing  of  the  Clifton  Club,  a  newcomer 
to  the  league.  Clifton  finished  very  strong,  mainly  through  the  efforts  of  Dan 
Kiefer,  Jr..  the  eighteen-year  old  lad  who  won  the  Hamilton  County  champion- 
ship at  Norwood.  Kiefer  is  looked  upon  as  one  of  the  most  promising  players 
in  Cincinnati. 

The  League  will  be  continued  in  1015,  with  the  possible  addition  of  the 
Evanston  Club.     The  final  standing  of  the  1914  race  follows  :

Stockbridge  (Mass.)  Golf  and  Tennis  Club  Tournament. — The  annual  tournament 
of  the  Stockbridge  Golf  and  Tennis  Club,  beginning  August  28,  was  the  most 
successful  ever  held  by  the  club.  Hoffman  Niekerson,  formerly  of  the  Harvard 
'varsity  team,  defeated  Edwin  S.  Chase  of  Springfield,  Mass.,  in  the  final  round 
of  the  singles,  8/6,  6/1,  6/4.  In  the  challenge  round,  however,  Niekerson  was 
defeated  by  W.  S.  Cushing,  the  1913  winner,  6/4,  4/6,  6/2,  6/3.  The  doubles  was 
won  by  Chase  and  C.  F.  Cutler,  who  defeated  A.  Doty  and  G.  S.  Keyes  of  Boston, 
in  the  final  round,  6/4,  6/0,  7/5.  Miss  Mollie  Johnson  of  Great  Harrington,  Vt., 
won  the  women's  singles,  and  Mrs.  Rice  and  Mrs.  Garrett  the  doubles.  The 
mixed   doubles    was    taken    by   Mrs.    Rice   and   W.    S.    Cushing. 

South  Jersey  Tournament. — Ocean  City's  distinguished  tennis  player,  Harvey  Y. 
Lake,  retained  the  championship  of  South  Jersey  in  the  tournament  held  at  Ocean 
City,  beginning  September  1.  Edward  Catlett  came  through  the  tournament,  de- 
feating L.  Tremaine  in  the  final  round,  by  default,  but  in  the  challenge  round  Lake 
emerged  the  winner,  6/3,  6/0,  6/1,  and  for  the  twelfth  time  secured  the  South  Jersey 
title.  In  the  doubles  Catlett  and  J.  Kerr  defeated  R.  M.  Brookfield  ami  L.  Tremaine 
in  the  final  round,  6/1,  6/2,  7/5,  and  the  winners  followed  up  their  success  in  the 
challenge  round  by  defeating  Lake  and  Landy  Brown,  4/6,  6/4,  2/6,  6/4,  9/7.  Mrs.  M. 
II.  Kerbaugh  won  the  women's  singles,  defeating  Miss  J.  Sparks  in  the  final  round, 
6/4,   6/3,  and  Miss  Elizabeth   Remington  in  the  challenge  round,   by  default. 

Southwestern  District  Tournament. — As  showing  the  growing  enthusiasm  for  lawn 
tennis,  more  than  forty  entries  were  received  for  tiie  Southwestern  District  tourna- 
ment, held  on  the  courts  of  the  Dallas  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  Dallas,  Tex..  May  17  to 
21.  All  conditions  worked  favorably  for  the  success  of  the  tournament.  The  pre- 
liminary matches  uncovered  nothing  worthy  of  especial  comment.  In  the  first  round 
Hogue  defeated  Adoue,  the  Arkansas  State  champion,  after  losing  the  first  set,  while 
in  another  match,  Rye  of  Dallas  was  credited  with  winning  the  only  set  of  the 
tournament  from  Hoerr,  who  finally  became  champion  and  thus  gained  a  second  leg  on 
the  Elmer  Scott  Cup.  Hoerr's  opponent  in  the  final  round  was  Rees.  the  former 
winning,  7/5,  6/4,  6/3.  The  final  round  of  the  doubles  brought  together  Hoerr  and 
Horrell  against  Hogue  and  Blacklock,   the  former  winning,   4/6,  6/3,  6/3,  9/7. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  189 


Lawn  Tennis  in  Kansas  City 

By  John  Ten  Broeck. 

Probably  a  very  small  portion  of  the  tennis  playing  public  realize  that  at 
he  junction  of  the  Big  Muddy  and  the  Kaw  there  thrives  one  of  the  tennis 
jenters  of  the  United  States.  Fully  twenty  thousand  players,  more  or  less 
jroricient,  took  part  in  this  sport  during  the  season  of  1914.  Four  tourna- 
nents  were  held,  all  of  them  successful  in  the  number  of  competitors  and  in 
)Oint  of  attendance.  In  fact,  so  large  were  the  crowds  at  the  city  champion- 
ships that  it  was  decided  to  charge  admission  to  the  remaining  tourneys, 
vhich  was  done.  This  resulted  in  making  them  a  financial  success,  and  as- 
sures to  Kansas  City  the  ability  to  expend  large  sums  in  the  future  in  ar- 
ranging high  class  tournaments.  There  were  four  open  tournaments,  three 
leing  held  by  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club,  which  at  present  is  the  largest 
>rganization  of  its  kind  devoted  to  tennis,  having  four  fine  clay  courts  and 
:hree  grit  or  gravel  courts.  The  other  tourney  was  held  under  the  auspices 
)f  the  Ivanhoe  Tennis  Club  on  its  four  fine  gravel  courts.  With  the  interest 
Knifested  in  this  popular  summer  game,  the  season  of  1915  will  no  doubt 
;ee  the  inauguration  of  an  exclusive,  high  class  tennis  club  in  Kansas  City, 
rhe  first  tournament  held  was  the  Greater  Kansas  City  championships,  and 
■hough  its  title  represents  a  local  championship  it  has  always  been  an  open 
ournament.  The  competition  was  won  this  year  again  by  .Jack  Cannon  from 
i  line  field,  among  whom  were  Walter  Newell,  the  Missouri  Valley  inter- 
scholastic  champion;  Dix  Teachenor  of  Kansas  University,  It.  A.  Wester,  the 
Ksouri  University  champion,  and  Kenneth  This  of  the  crack  Leland-Stan- 
nrrl.  Jr..  University  team.  Interest  centered  in  the  semi-final  match  between 
'aiiimn  and  This,  which  the  local  champion  won,  allowing  the  Californian 
mlv  two  games.  With  the  presenl  mowing  interest  in  tennis  in  Kansas 
:it'v.  even  the  successful  season  of  1914  no  doubt  will  be  surpassed  in  1915, 
is  it  is  planned  to  send  the  local  talent  into  foreign  fields  for  the  purpose  of 
lettering  their  standard  of  play  and  securing  high  class  talent  for  the  local 
:ournaments.

Uthough  two  separate  committees  were  selected  in  1914  to  rank  the  best 
ten  men  and  women  tennis  players  in  Greater  Kansas  City,  the  task  was  a 
bard  one,  as  manv  of  the  players'  records  were  so  even  as  to  cause  heated 
debate  In  only  one  instance  was  the  choice  unanimous  and  that  was  in  the 
selection  of  John  Cannon  as  the  best  player  among  the  men.  He  was  con- 
sidered as  being  a  full  point  superior  to  any  other  player  in  Kansas  City. 
The  debate  was  strenuous,  however,  as  to  whom  should  fall  the  coveted  honor 
Of  first  rank  among  the  women.  Of  course,  the  argument  was  between_  the 
■nective  merits  of  Mrs.  Yager  and  Miss  Hires,  but  in  the  final  analysis  it 
was  decided  the  former  was  ^clearly  entitled  to  be  ranked  "The  best  woman 
player  in  Kansas  City."  The  rules  laid  down  by  the  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Ranking  Committee  were  followed.  Only  players  participating  in  two  tourna- 
ments  in   Kansas   City   or   vicinitv    were    ranked.      Only    tournament   competi-

tion  was  considered,  and  late  season  play  was  given  greater  weight  than  earl] 
competition.  Among  the  men.  after  Cannon  was  given  No.  1,  his  diminutiy] 
partner,  Teachenor,  was  ranked  No.  2,  although  several  of  the  cornmitte] 
thought  Wester  should  rank  above  the  Kansas  University  champion.  Then 
too,  a  controversy  arose  as  to  whether  Newell  should  not  be  ranked  abet! 
Wester,  having  defeated  the  Missouri  L'niversity  champion  in  the  city  chain 
pionships  early  in  the  season,  but  as  it  was  the  opinion  of  all  that  Wester' 
fight  against  Hoerr  in  the  Missouri  Valley  tourney  was  the  best  tennis  show 
by  any  of  the  younger  talent  during  the  season,  he  was  ranked  above  th 
interscholastic  champion.  The  players  who  showed  the  greatest  improvemen 
last  season  were  Newell.  Poteet  and  Holcomb.  Last  year  Newell  was  rank© 
seventh  and  Poteen  was  not  given  enough  votes  to  gain  a  footing  in  the  firs 
ten,  while  Holcomb  was  not  even  considered.  All  three  of  these  playH 
should  improve  the  coming  season.  Among  those  unranked  who  were  givej 
earnest  consideration  were  Harry  Durall,  Jimmie  Elwell,  Otto  Dubach,  Paii 
Kygerand  and  Dr.  C.  S.  Parker.  In  ranking  the  women,  only  those  playeu 
who  participated  in  the  Central  Western  and  Missouri  Valley  tournament 
were  considered.  The  records  of  Miss  Hires  and  Mrs.  Yager  were  nearfl 
equal.  Miss  Hires  having  won  the  Central  West,  defeating  Mrs.  Yager  in  tq 
final  round,  while  Mrs.  Yager  won  the  Missouri  Valley,  a  later  tournament 
Miss  Hires  having  lost  in  the  preliminary  round.  Practically,  the  same  con 
ditions  existed  between  the  Misses  Sowle  and  Fwins. 

Seranton  (Pa.)  Championship.— This  event,  held  on  the  three  clay  courts  of  tK 
Seranton  Tennis  Club,  proved  such  a  success  that  it  has  been  planned  to  make  it  a 
annual  competition.  Forty-seven  players  started  for  the  "Paar"  Cup.  The  troph 
was  won  by  Roland  von  Maur,  who  defeated  Robert  B.  McClave  in  a  five-set  match 
6/4,   4/6,   6/0,   1/6,   6/2. 

Saratoga  versus  Hoosick  Falls.— Teams  of  the  Saratoga  Golf  Club  of  Saratoga,  N.  YJ 
and  of  the  Hoosick  Falls  Country  Club  of  Hoosick  Falls,  N.  Y.,  met  on  the  courts  o 
the  Saratoga  Golf  Club,  August  22,  with  the  result  that  the  Saratoga  players  wen 
victorious  by  eight  matches  to  one.  The  only  victory  by  Hoosick  Falls  was  secure} 
by  B.  Homer  Hall,  who  defeated  John  P.  Wemple,  6/4,  6/2.  In  the  return  engage 
ment,  however,  at  Hoosick  Falls,  September  12,  the  home  team  won  by  five  matchd 
to  one. 

Sippican  Tennis  Club  Tournament.— The  annual  open  tournament  of  the  Sippicat 
Tennis  Club  of  Marion,  Mass.,  beginning  September  5,  resulted  in  the  success  o 
Nat.  W.  Niles  in  the  singles  and  of  Niles  and  A.  S.  Dabney  in  the  doubles.  Niles  dfl 
feated  .1.  Wheelwright  in  the  final  round  of  the  singles,  6/4,  6/1,  6/3,  thus  seeurB 
permanent  possession  of  the  Chapman  Challenge  Cup,  and  in  the  final  round  of  th! 
doubles  Niles  and  Dabney  defeated  H.  C.  Johnson  and  H.  A.  Mackinney,  4/6,  6/4,  7^ 
6/S,  6/4. 

Seattle  (Wash.)  Tennis  Club  Interscholastic  Tournament.— The  competition  of  191 
was  a  marked  improvement  over  the  affairs  of  the  two  previous  years,  especially  l 
the  quality  of  the  tennis  shown.  Ross  Williams  repeated  his  success  of  1913  in  tn 
singles,  and  so  gained  permanent  possession,  for  the  Queen  Anne  High  School,  of  thl 
Treat  Cup.  Williams'  opponent  in  the  final  round  was  Ralph  Miller,  the  former  beinl 
returned  the  winner.  7/5,  6/3,  6/2.  In  the  doubles  it  looked  as  if  Williams  and  nil 
partner,  Leo  Lagerstroni,  would  also  win,  but  Waller  and  Morimitsu  of  the  Wesl 
Seattle  High  School,  captured  the  honors  in  a  five-set  match,  3/6,  4/6,  6/3,  6/4,  7/5.    I 

Rocky  Mountain  Intercollegiate  Tournament.— University  of  Colorado  representative* 
won  both  singles  and  doubles  in  the  1914  Rocky  Mountain  intercollegiate  tournamenil 
played  Saturday.  May  23,  on  the  City  Park  courts  in  Denver.  In  singles  the  Colorafll 
men  had  things  all  their  own  way.  Matt  Axelrood  and  Richard  Scott,  the  two  Un| 
versitv  of  Colorado  players,  were  thrown  in  different  halves  of  the  draw,  and  botj 
played  through  the  tournament  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  In  the  final  round  both  mel 
were  phvsicallv  exhausted  from  their  efforts  earlier  in  the  day,  and  after  AxelrjM 
had  taken  the  first  set,  9/7,  Scott  defaulted,  relinquishing  the  title  to  his  teammatM 
The  doubles  were  more  hotly  contested.  Hammond  and  Drummond,  the  (  oloradj 
School  of  Mines  team,  met  Axelrood  and  Scott  in  the  finals  and  won  the  first  se<| 
9/7,  by  consistent,  steadv  playing.  The  Colorado  men  showed  marked  improvement  ll 
the  last  two  sets  and  won,  6/2,  6/1.  Besides  the  University  of  Colorado  and  « 
School  of  Mines.  University  of  Denver  and  Colorado  College  were  represented  in  till 
tournament.  The  University  of  Utah  was  also  entered,  but  the  team  did  not  arrKN 
in  time  for  the  matches.

Br  Dr.  N.  A.  Goddard. 

It  can  truthfully  be  said  that  at  last  lawn  tennis  has  come  into  its  own  in 
Milwaukee.  The  year  1:>14  showed  tremendous  increase  both  in  the  number 
of  competitors  in  tournaments  and  in  pastime  playing.  The  State  tournamenl 
was  held  at  the  Town  Club  in  August,  and.  as  usual,  the  Chicago  contingent 
won  both  the  singles  and  doubles  events,  but  doing  so  by  a  narrower  margin 
than  in  yens  past,  due  to  the  excellent  showing  of  some  of  the  younger 
Milwaukee  players.  Although  the  State  tournament  arouses  much  enthusiasm 
among  the  players  in  and  about  Milwaukee,  it  is  not  the  event  that  the  name 
implies,  inasmuch  as  few  players  from  other  parts  of  the  State  participate. 
This  failure  of  up-State  players  to  enter  the  State  tournament  may  be  due  to 
the  fact  that  Milwaukee  is  not  centrally  enough  located,  but  the  impression  is 
that  they  remain  out  through  fear  of  the  prowess  of  the  Chicago  players. 
The  proposition  has  again  and  again  a-risen  in  regard  to  holding  a  State 
tournament  for  Wisconsin  players  exclusively,  but  this  arrangement  has  its 
drawbacks  and  the  question  still  remains  a  debatable  one  as  to  the  advisability 
of  such  a  procedure. 

The  City  tournament  in  1914  was  held  at  the  Blue  Mound  Club,  and  al- 
though there  were  fewer  entries  than  in  the  previous  year,  an  enjoyable  time 
was  spent,  both  by  players  and  the  gallery,  duo  to  the  lavish  hospitality  of  the 
club  and  the  excellence  of  the  courts.  The  singles  championship  was  won  by 
R.  Hamilton.  Milwaukee.     No  doubles  were  played. 

The  new  organization,  the  Milwaukee  Tennis  Association,  held  its  first 
series  of  inter-club  matches,  which  were  an  unqualified  success.  The  Asso- 
ciation is  composed  of  the  following  clubs,  with  their  representatives  :  Allis- 
Chalmers  Tennis  Club,  H.  V.  Nye  ;  East  Side  Tennis  Club,  Dr.  N.  A.  Goddard  ; 
Kilbourn  Tennis  Club,  H.  O.  Kuechenmeister  ;  Washington  Park  Tennis  Club, 
E.  L.  Lipman  ;  Cutler-Hammer  Tennis  Club,  L.  A.  Watson  ;  National  Tennis 
Club,  R.  B.  Roehr :  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  E.  R.  Benson  ;  Pirates  Tennis 
Club.  R.  Hamilton.  The  total  membership  is  three  hundred.  This  Association 
has  filled  a  long  felt  want  in  furnishing  inter-club  matches,  and  has  developed 
an  interest  in  the  sport  that  could  not  have  been  aroused  in  any  other  way. 
The  Washington  Park  Club  won  the  singles  and  doubles  championship  trophies 
is  well  as  the  club  trophy,  the  National  Club  being  second. 

The  Washington  Park  boys  have  a  reason  to  feel  elated.  Their  team,  with 
two  exceptions,  is  composed  of  youngsters  who  have  played  the  game  at  the 
most  for  only  three  years,  and  who  never  had  the  advantages  of  being  taught 
by  veterans.  Bertram  L.  Thelen  and  Louis  J.  Rechcygl  are  the  only  players 
on  the  team  whose  membership  dates  back  prior  to  1911. 

Not  only  in  their  own  tournament  have  the  Park  boys  shown  their  mettle, 
but  they  have  lived  up  to  their  reputation  as  being  the  gamest  and  steadiest 
in  other  matches.  In  the  State  touruament,  through  the  efforts  of  Rechcygl 
and  Lipman.  Milwaukee  won  four  out  of  the  eight  cups  which  were  given  as 
prizes  ;  Rechcygl  won  three  out  of  the  four  Milwaukee  cups,  the  other  four 
going  to  Chicago.  It  was  the  first  year  for  a  long  time  that  the  Chicago 
players  did  not  win  the  majority  of  prizes.  The  work  of  Stuckert  and  Thelen 
in  this  tournament  should  not  be  passed  without  comment.  Stuckert  gave 
Al.  Lindauer  of  Chicago,  a  fine  battle  and  had  him  all  but  defeated.  In 
doubles,  he  and  Bert  Thelen  gave  Hayes  and  Lindauer  a  fine  run  in  a  semi- 
final match.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  only  one  Milwaukee  player.  Reg.  Ham- 
ilton, advanced  any  further  in  singles  and  that  no  team  got  further  than  the 
semi-finals  in  doubles,  the  Washington  Park  boys  made  a  creditable  showing. 

In  the  Milwaukee  Tennis  Association  the  Washington  Park  Club  finished 
Brst.  It  defeated  Kilbourns,  7/0:  West  Side,  6/1;  Allis-Chalmers,  7/0; 
Pirates.  4/?,:  Cutler-Hammers,  6/1;  Nationals,  5/2.  and  East  Side.  7/0'.  The 
Goddard  trophy,  which  is  a  challenge  cup  donated  by  Dr.  N.  A.  Goddard, 
president  of  the  association,  for  the  player  who  did  not  lose  a  match  through- 


192  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

out  thp  entire  season,  also  went  to  Washington  Park.  At  the  end  of  the 
season  only  three  players  of  the  seven  elubs  in  the  association  remained  unde- 
feated— Lipman,  Stuckert  and  Thelen — all  from  the  Parks.  The  Goddard  cup 
was  played  for  by  these  three  and  was  won  by  B.  L.  Thelen,  who  becomes 
owner  of  it  for  one  year.  Only  four  double  teams  fought  their  way  through 
without  being  defeated.  They  were  Lowe  and  Puis.  Lipman  and  Thelen, 
Stuckert  and  Riley,  of  Washington  Park,  and  P.enson  and  Seefeld  of  the 
West  Side.  In  the  play-off,  Lipman  and  Thelen  of  the  Washington  Park 
Club,  were  victorious,  thereby  winning  the  doubles  championship  of  the  asso- 
ciation for  V.»14. 

The  National  Tennis  Club  traces  its  organization  from  the  old  Longwood 
Tennis  Club,  which  had  only  a  single  court  on  private  property  from  1000  to 
1903.  The  Longwood  Club  at  that  time  had  just  four  members.  The  follow- 
ing year  the  club  shifted  the  scene  of  its  activities  from  Roehr's  residence  to 
its  present  location,  National  Avenue  between  Thirteenth  and  Fourteenth 
Avenues,  combining  with  the  old  Glenwood  Club  members.  Since  then  the 
organization  has  always  been  known  as  the  National  Tennis  Club. 

In. 1904  the  club  boasted  a  membership  of  six.  Since  that  time  its  member- 
ship has  constantly  grown  as  the  interest  in  the  game  of  tennis  was  mani- 
fested and  developed."  In  1008  the  membership  reached  such  a  number  as  to 
warrant  the  building  of  two  new  courts.  In  that  year  the  National  Club  took 
over  again  the  members  of  the  old  Courtland  Tennis  Club.  We  now  enjoy  a 
membership  of  from  twenty  to  twenty-five  men,  among  them  some  of  the  best 
players  in  the  city,  namely,  Lowe,  E.  J.  Thelen.  O.  Puis,  Graebner,  E.  Puis, 
Reuss  and  Kleinow. 

Inter-club  matches  with  other  local  independent  organizations  have  been 
played  regularly  from  year  to  year,  and  we  have  had  much  success  in  defeating 
most  of  our  opponents.  In  1014  we  were  members  of  the  Milwaukee  Tennis 
Association,  which  comprises  the  local  independent  clubs.  A  schedule  was 
arranged,  and  matches  with  all  clubs  in  the  association  were  played.  We  fin- 
ished in  second  place  after  a   strenuous  campaign. 

This  association  bids  fair  to  enliven  the  interest  in  tennis  during  1915,  even 
more  so  than  in  1014.  ami  the  National  Tennis  Club  will  again  be  in  the  field 
contending    for   championship    honors. 

At  the  end  of  the  season,  a  banquet  was  given  by  the  association  at  the 
Tfister  Hotel,  at  which  the  cups  were  presented.  The  season  of  1915  promises 
tn  he  the  best  in  tennis  that  the  city  has  ever  enjoyed,  and  the  sport  has  cer- 
tainly taken  a  permanent  position  as  the  cleanest  and  the  best  of  all  outdoor 
athletics.

Junior  Championships 

First  Junior  Metropolitan   Championships 

One  of  the  features  of  the  tennis  season  of  1914  was  the  innovation  sprung 
by  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  in  holding  the  first  annual  junior  metropolitan 
championship  for  boys  under  eighteen  years  old.  The  competition  was  decided 
on  the  dirt  courts  of  the  club  at  Forest  Hills,  Long  Island,  X.  V..  during  the 
week  of  September  14. 

Ninety-six  future  champions  responded  to  the  call  in  singles  and  twenty- 
eight  pairs  in  doubles.  The  boys  who  showed  the  greatest  promise  were  Harold 
Throckmorton  of  Sewaren,  X.  .1..  the  winner:  II.  W.  Forster  of  New  York,  the 
runner-up  :  Charles  Garland  of  Pittsburgh  and  C.  M.  Sneed  of  Beaumont,  Tex. 

The  player  who  made  the  greatest  hit  in  the  tournament  was  C.  Donaldson, 
twelve  years  old,  of  Brooklyn,  X.  V.  Although  hardly  higher  than  the  net 
itself,  young  Donaldson  wielded  a  14%  ounce  racket  like  a  veteran. 

The  best  match  of  the  tournament  was  in  the  semi-final  round  between 
Throckmorton  and  Garland.  It  was  anybody's  affair  in  the  first  two  sets  until 
the  superior  age  and  strength  of  Throckmorton  told. 

In  the  doubles  Selig  and  Wolff,  both  of  Long  Island,  came  through  without 
the  loss  of  a  set.  Their  team  work  gave  them  the  advantage  over  the  indi- 
vidual brilliancy  of  the  others. 

A  record  was  established  in  the  running  of  the  tournament  in  two  days 
and  two  afternoons  of  play.     The  summaries  :

Metropolitan  Junior   Indoor  Championships 

The  first  tournament  for  the  Metropolitan  Junior  Championship,  held  by 
the  Seventh  Regiment  Tennis  Club,  at  the  armory  of  the  regiment.  New 
York  City,  December  2S  to  31,  was  entirely  successful.  The  entry  list, 
restricted  to  boys  under  eighteen  years  old,  brought  out  eighty-three  in  the 
singles  and  thirty-two  pairs  in  the  doubles. 

Herbert  L.  Bowman  of  Mount  Vernon  High  School  won  the  singles,  defeat- 
ing L.  M.  Banks  of  Adelphi  School  in  the  final  round,  while  the  doubles  was 
taken  by  R.  S.  Goldman  and  J.  W.   Wolff  of  the  Ethical  Culture  School. 

At  the  start  of  the  tournament  it  was  believed  that  either  H.  W.  Forster, 
runner-up  to  Harold  Throckmorton  in  the  Metropolitan.  Junior  Championship 
at  Forest  Hills,  L.  I.,  in  the  fall,  or  R.  B.  Haines  would  get  to  the  final 
round  in  their  half,  but  Banks  defeated  them  both  in  straight  sets.  Bowman 
got  to  the  final  in  a  very  easy  manner,  and  then,  won  from  Banks  after  a 
hard  fight. 

The  doubles  did  not  produce  nearly  so  good  tennis  as  the  singles,  except 
that  the  winners,  Goldman  and  Wolff,  played  a  heady  game  and  teamed 
splendidlv.     The   summaries :

Lawn  Tennis  in  St.  Louis.— Mr.  Ross  of  the  Triple  A,  St.  Louis,  writes  as  follows 
The  Triple  A  Club,  which  is  the  only  club  in  the  city  that  encourages  all  kinds  ol 
outdoor  sports,  held  nine  tennis  tournaments  during  the  season  of  1914,  namely:  city 
championship  for  boys  under  sixteen  years,  city  championship  for  girls  under  sixteen 
years,  city  championship  for  women.  Central  championship  for  men,  city  championship 
for  men,  club  championship  for  men,  state  championship  for  women,  state  champion- 
ship for  boys  under  sixteen  years,  state  championship  for  girls  under  sixteen  years, 
anil  Missouri  Valley  Championship  Conference.  The  high  schools  of  the  city  also 
held  their  tournaments  on  the  Triple  A  courts.  Miss  Isobel  Hull,  who  managed  the 
women's  and  children's  tournaments,  deserves  great  credit  for  the  able  manner  in 
which  she  handled  the  youngsters.  Roland  M.  Hoerr,  the  Triple  A  star,  cleaned  the 
boards  of  all  the  championships,  winning  the  Missouri  Valley  Conference,  Central 
championship,  city  championship  and  club  championship.  A.  Von  Reppert,  was  runner- 
up  in  the  singles  in  the  Central  and  club  championships.  0.  D.  Jones  was  runner-up 
in  the  city  singles.  Hoerr  and  Jones  won  the  Central  doubles,  with  Grover  C.  Holt- 
haus  and  A.  Von  Reppert  as  runners-up.  In  the  city  championship  doubles,  the  same 
thing  happened.  In  the  club  championship  doubles  final,  Reppert,  paired  with  Walter 
Orunden,  defeated  E.  R.  Thomas  and  M.  Stein,  two  young  players  who  showed  that 
next  season  they  will  have  to  be  reckoned  with.

Morgan  Park  (111.)  Academy  Interscholastic  Tournament. — The  Morgan  Park  Academy 
interscholastic  tennis  tournament  was  held  on  May  1,  2  and  4,  and  proved  to  be  a 
strong  attraction  for  the  pupils  of  the  different  high  schools  and  academies.  Entries 
were  sent  in  from  a  distance,  some  of  those  being  Plumbe  and  Emerson  from  Inter- 
laken,  Vogel  from  Racine,  Calfin  from  Wheaton,  and  Reps  from  Cedar  Rapids.  The 
tournament  was  one  of  the  best  provided  during  the  season  of  1914  for  the  high 
school  and  academic  tennis  enthusiasts.  There  is  no  question  about  the  supremacy  of 
Arthur  Hubbell,  who  won  the  singles  championship.  He  was  also  academy  champion 
in  1913.  The  doubles  honors  went  to  Carver  and  Tarrent  of  Hyde  Park  High  School 
of  Chicago.  These  boys  played  a  consistent  game  during  the  season,  and  not  only 
covered  themselves  with  glory  in  the  above  tournament,  but  also  won  the  City  high 
school  doubles  championship  for  1914.  Carver,  who  also  entered  in  the  singles  of  the 
Morgan  Park  tourney,  was  unfortunate  in  meeting  Hubbell,  the  winner,  in  the  matches 
and  was  put  out.  Had  he  been  able  to  go  a  few  more  rounds  he  might  have  made  a 
better  showing,  inasmuch  as  lie  probably  was  the  next  best  player  to  Hubbell  entered 
in  the  tournament.  In  the  semi-final  round  of  the  singles  Kittelman  defeated  Frankel, 
6/0,  4/6,  6/1,  and  Hubbell  won  from  Fromherz,  6/0,  6/1,  6/3.  In  the  final  round,  Hub- 
bell  defeated  Kittelman,  5/7,  6/2,  6/4,  6/2.  The  final  round  of  the  doubles  brought  to- 
gether Carver  and  Tarrent  against  McLaughlin  and  Lyons,  the  former  pair  winning. 

Nassau  and  Queens  County  Championship. — On  the  courts  of  the  Great  Neck  Hills 
Country  Club,  Great  Neck,  Long  Island,  May  30,  R.  B.  Gatcomb  won  the  singles,  and 
A.  F.  and  R.  L.  von  Bernuth  the  doubles  in  the  championship  tournament  of  Nassau 
and  Queens  County.  Gatcomb  had  R.  L.  Pate  as  opponent  in  the  final  round  of  the 
singles,  and  it  took  four  sets  for  Gatcomb  to  win.  The  von  Bernuth  brothers  were 
forced  to  five  sets  before  they  conquered  Hobart  and  Harrison.  The  summaries:  Men's

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  259 

Annual    Meeting    of   the    United    States 
National    Lawn  Tennis   Association 

After  a  hard  fight,  which  was  truly  national  in  character,  the  delegates  to 
the  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association, 
held  at  the  Waldorf-Astoria  February  5,  voted  to  hold  the  national  all- 
comers" tournament  on  the  courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  at  Forest 
Hills,  L.  I.  The  fight  for  the  tournament  was  centered  on  Forest  Hills  and 
Newport.  The  vote,  which  was  followed  with  the  closest  interest  by  the 
delegates,    resulted   in  favor  of   the   West   Side   Tennis   Club,    by    129   to   119. 

After  the  announcement  of  the  vote,  Secretary  E.  F.  Torrey  moved  that  the 
pote  be  made  unanimous.  This  was  done  after  Palmer  E.  Presbrey  seconded 
the  motion. 

Henry  W.  Slocum  led  those  who  favored  keeping  the  championship  in 
Newport,  explaining  that  many  improvements  had  been  made  in  the  Casino 
grounds.  Others  who  spoke  for  Newport  were  G.  P.  Gardner,  Jr.,  W.  J. 
Clothier,  Richard  Norris  Williams,  2d,  E.  F.  Torrey  and  James  S>.  Cushman. 
A  determined  opposition  to  Newport  developed,  many  of  the  most  prominent 
devotees  of  the  game  favoring  a  change.  Karl  H.  Behr  led  those  in  favor 
of  changing  to  New  York.  R.  D.  Little,  Holcombe  Ward  and  Harold  H. 
Hackett  also  favored  New  York.  President  Julian  S.  Myrick  of  the  West 
Side   Tennis   Club  presented  the  advantages  of  his   club. 

The  women's  singles,  doubles,  and  mixed  doubles  were  awarded  to  the 
Philadelphia  Cricket  Club.  As  last  year,  the  indoor  men's  and  women's 
singles  and  doubles  were  assigned  to  the  Seventh  Regiment,  N.  G.  N.  Y.,  as 
well  as  the  junior  national  indoor  championship.  To  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic 
Association  was  awarded  the  clay   court  championship   tournament   for  1915. 

The  report  of  the  Davis  Cup  Committee  was  read,  and  it  was  unanimously 
decided   not   to   send    a   challenge   to   Australia    for   1915.    owing   to   the   war. 

In  the  election  for  the  officers  of  the  association  Raymond  D.  Little  of 
New  York  withdrew  from  the  delegates-at-large.  and  Holcombe  Ward  and 
W.  M.   Washburn    tied  with   150   votes  each,   and  Ward  withdrew. 

The  following  officers  of  the  association  were  elected  :  Robert  D.  Wrenn, 
New  York  City,  President :  A.  L.  Hoskins,  Philadelphia.  Vice-President :  E. 
F.  Torrey,  Jr.,  Clinton.  N.  Y.,  Secretary ;  Richard  Stevens,  Hoboken,  N.  J., 
Treasurer.  Executive  Committee — New  England,  Palmer  E.  Presbrey,  Boston  ;

Minneapolis ;  Southwestern,  E.  L.  Scott,  Van  Vleck,  Texas ;  Pacific,  Dr. 
Sumner  Hardy,  San  Francisco ;  Middle  States,  C.  Frederick  Watson,  New 
York  Citv  :  Middle  Atlantic.  F.  C.  Colston.  Baltimore:  Southern.  L.  D.  Scott, 
Atlanta,  '  Ga.  ;  Western.  L.  H.  Waidner.  Chicago:  Inter-Mountain,  O.  J. 
Salisbury,  Salt  Lake  Citv.  The  following  were  elected  delegates-at-large — 
W.  A.  Larned.  New  York  Citv  :  W.  M.  Washburn.  New  York  City  ;  W.  J. 
Clothier.  Philadelphia:  Craig '  Biddle.  Philadelphia;  George  T.  Adee,  New 
York  City  ;  Clinton  L.   Childs,  Pittsburgh. 


At  the  meeting  of  the  executive  committee  of  the  United  States  National 
Lawn  Tennis  Association,  held  March  19  and  20,  1915.  at  New  York,  it  was 
decided  to  make  the  national  championship  tournament  at  the  West  Side 
Tennis  Club,  Forest  Hills.  L.  I.,  a  real  open  tournament,  to  send  a  team  of 
Eastern  players  to  the  Pacific  Coast  and  to  admit  no  new  sectional  doubles 
tourneys  except  the  Northwestern. 

When  it  was  voted  to  move  the  national  championship  from  Newport  at 
the  annual  meeting  of  the  national  association  it  was  realized  that  the 
entry  list  probablv  would  break  all  records  for  this  country  and  might  prove 
unwieldy.     Motions  were  made  to  restrict  the  entries  to  ranked  players,   but 


260  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

these  were  all  defeated  on  the  ground  that  it  would  be  un-Ameriean  to  make 
such  a  restriction  and  that  furthermore  many  a  coming  star  might  remain 
undiscovered. 

A  resolution  was  passed  that  the  national  singles  championship  for  1915 
shall  be  an  open  event,  as  heretofore,  with  the  following  provisions : 

1.  That  all  entries  must  be  made  through  the  secretary  of 
the  club  or  sub-association  of  which  the  applicant  is  a  member. 

2.  That  the  entry  list  shall  close  at  least  ten  days  before 
fthe  opening  of  the  tournament. 

3.  That  the  entrance  fee  of  each  player  shall  be  at  least 
equal  to  the  amount  charged  for  a  season  ticket  (covering  ad- 
mission and  reserved  seat)  to  members  of  clubs  or  sub-associa- 
tions belonging  to  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

The  committee  found  a  very  strong  sentiment  in  favor  of  retaining  the 
national  championship  as  an  open  event,  but  feels  that  the  provisions  laid 
down  will  eliminate  the  danger  of  having  too  large  an  entry  list.  The 
committee  feels  that  in  endeavoring  to  obtain  this  result  it  will  receive  the 
hearty  co-operation  not  only  of  the  secretaries  of  the  clubs  but  of  all  the 
tennis  players  throughout  the  country. 

It  was  further  voted  to  give  members  of  clubs  or  sub-associations  belonging 
to  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A.  the  privilege  of  obtaining  tickets  for  the  national 
championships  at  special  rates  and  that  the  president  of  the  association  be 
empowered  and  instructed  to  appoint  a  sub-committee  from  the  executive 
committee,  of  which  he  shall  be  chairman,  to  make  such  arrangements 
regarding  details  in  connection  with  the  national  tournament  as  seem 
advisable. 

The  report  of  the  committee  to  consider  the  question  of  increasing  the 
sectional  doubles,  referred  at  the  annual  meeting  to  the  executive  committee 
with  power  to  act,  was  adopted. 

This  report  stated  that  the  New  England,  Middle  States  and  Middle 
Atlantic  sections  were  now  properly  represented  by  the  Eastern  Doubles 
and  should  not  be  broken  up  into  separate  sections.  Of  the  sections  qualified 
under  the  report  to  apply  for  sectional  doubles,  the  Northwestern  alone 
made  application  and  was  admitted,  so  that  the  teams  eligible  to  compete  in 
1915  are:     Pacific  States,  Western,  Eastern,.  Southern  and  Northwestern. 

In  connection  with  the  sectional  doubles  it  was  decided  that  the  executive 
committee  would  frown  in  the  future  upon  the  practice  of  a  team  playing 
in  the  doubles  championship  in  a  section  in  which  neither  member  of  the 
team  resides. 

The  executive  committee  recommends  that  the  various  clubs  giving  tourna- 
ments seriously  consider  including  an  event  for  juniors  in  conjunction  with 
their  other  events.  The  motion  to  make  this  recommendation  was  put  to  a 
vote  and   unanimously   carried. 

In  view  of  the  fact  that  invitation  tournaments  have  been  growing  in 
number  from  year  to  year  and  because  these  frequently  hamper  smaller 
clubs  in  holding  open  tournaments,  the  executive  committee  voted  to  recom- 
mend that  all  clubs  holding  such  tournaments  turn  them  into  open  events 
in  1916. 

The  reports  of  the  committees  on  balls,  association  colors  and  standard 
medals  for  national  champions  were  adopted.  With  regard  to  the  medals,  it 
was  decided  to  award  gold  tennis  balls  to  all  winners  of  the  men's  and 
women's  national  championship  singles  and  doubles  since  these  events  were 
inaugurated   and   in   the   future. 

It  was  decided  to  send  a  team  to  the  Panama-Pacific  International 
Exposition  tournament.  This  team  is  to  be  composed  of  not  more  than 
four  men,  and  all  expenses  are  to  be  paid  by  the  national  association.  This 
is  an  innovation  for  the  national  association,  but  the  executive  committee 
feels  that  it  is  not  establishing  a  precedent,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the 
event  in  conjunction  with  the  exposition  is  really  of  international  importance 
and  should  therefore  be  handled  the  same  as  Davis  Cup  matches.  _  The  picking 
of  the  team  was  referred  to  the  committee  on  international  affairs,  the  same 
committee  that  picked  last  year's  Davis  Cup  team.

selves for  the  playing  of  their  respective  Ties  upon  a  ground  or  grounds, 
and  upon  a  date  or  dates  convenient  to  those  concerned  ;  but,  in  the

7.  When   gate    money    shall    be    taken,    one    half   of   the    profit   shall 
belong  to  the  visiting  Nation  ;  or,  in  the  case  of  a  Tie  being  played  on 
neutral  ground,  one  third  each  to  the  visiting  Nations,  and  the  remain- 
ing  fraction   of   profit   in   each    case   shall  go    to   the   Nation   in   whose  • 
Country  the   Tie  shall  be   played. 

8.  The  Challenge  Tie  shall  be  played  in  the  country  of  the  Champion

two  years  immediately  preceding  a  Tie,  provided  always  that  he  be  a 
bona  fide  Amateur  ;  but,  no  one  shall  be  entitled  to  plav  for  more  than 
one  Nation  in  this  Competition  during  the  same  year.  During  the 
time  that  a  player  may  be  qualifying  to  play  for  a'  Nation  under  the 
residential  qualification,  he  may  play  for  the  Nation' for  which  he  shall 
have  been  last  previously  qualified. 

10.  The  Lawn  Tennis  Association  or  Corresponding  Organization  of 
each  of  the  Nations  concerned  shall  appoint  a  Captain  of  its  Side. 
In  default  of  such  appointment  a   Side  shall  choose  its  own  Captain. 

11.  For  each  Tie  a  Referee,  from  whose  decision  there  shall  be  no 
appeal,  shall  be  appointed  by  common  consent  of  the  Captains  of  the 
competing  Sides.  He  shall  have  power  to  appoint  Umpires.  He  shall 
decide  any  point  of  law  which  an  Umpire  may  profess  himself  unable 
to  decide,  or  which  may  be  referred  to  him  on  appeal  from  the  decision 
of  an  Umpire  by  the  players.  He  shall  decide,  if  he  be  called  upon  to 
decide  by  the  Captain  of  either  Side,  whether  or  not  a  Match  or 
Matches  shall  be  stopped  owing  to  the  state  of  the  courts,  the  state  of 
the  weather,  darkness,  or  other  unavoidable  hindrance. 

12.  (a)  Each  competing  Nation  shall,  twenty-one  days  before  the 
date  fixed  for  the  commencement  of  a  Tie.  nominate  to  the  Committee 
of  Management  not  more  than  four  players,  without  specifying  who 
shall  play  in  Singles  and  Doubles.  Different  players,  however,  may  be 
nominated  by  a  Nation  for  different  Ties. 

(b)  Each  Captain  shall,  twenty-four  hours  before  the  time  fixed  for 
the  commencement  of  play  in  each  Contest,  give  notice  of  the  com- 
position of  his  Team  to  the  Executive  Committee,  and  his  Team  shall 
be  selected  from  the  four  players  previously  nominated  for  the  Tie. 
Such  selection  by  the  Captain,  however,  shall  be  regarded  as  solely  for 
the  convenience  of  the  Executive  Committee,  and  may  be  varied  by 
him   before  the  commencement  of  play. 

(c)  For  the  Second  Round  of  the  Singles  Contest  in  any  Tie,  the

and  to  one  additional  vote  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction  thereof  mem- 
bers of  it  over  ten.  Allied  associations  shall  not  be  entitled  to  any  vote.

from  it.  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E  and  F  G.  the  ends  of  which 
are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F  and  E  G.  Halfway  between  the 
side  lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn  the  half  court  line  I  U, 
dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the 
right  and  left  courts.  <  >n  each  side  of  the  net.  at  a  distance  of  21 
feet  from  it.  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and 
M  N. 

THE    BALLS. 
2.     The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  2%  inches,  nor  more  than 
2  9-16    inches    in    diameter  ;    and    shall    weigh    not    less    than    1  15-16 
ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 


THE    GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net :  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become  server. 
and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out  ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  se+s. 


272  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TE'NNIS    ANNUAL. 

FOOT   FAULT    RULE. 

6.  The  server  shall  before  commencing  to  serve  stand  with  both 
feet  at  rest  behind  (i.  e..  further  from  the  net  than)  the  base  line 
and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary  continuation  of  the  half 
court  and  side  lines,  and  thereafter  the  server  shall  not  run,  walk, 
hop  or  jump  before  the  service  has  been  delivered,  but  the  server 
may  raise  one  foot  from  (and.  if  desired,  replace  it  on)  the  ground, 
provided  that  both  feet  are  kept  behind  the  base  line  until  the 
service  has  been  delivered. 

Official   Interpretation   of   Law  6: 

If  a  foot  be  lifted  and  replaced,  there.must  be 
no  change  of  position  that  can  possibly  be  con- 
sMered  a  step. 

7.  The  service  shall  be  delivered  from  the  right  and  left  courts 
alternately,  beginning  from  the  right  in  every  game,  even  though  odds 
be  given  or  owed,  and  the  ball  served  shall  drop  within  the  service 
line,  half  court  line  and  side  line  of  the  court  which  is  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served  or  upon  any  such   line. 

8.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  commit  any  breach  of  Law  7,  or  if 
the  service  be  delivered  from  the  wrong  court,  or  if  the  ball  served 
drop  in  the  net  or  beyond  the  service  line,  or  if  it  drop  out  of  court 
or  in  the  wrong  court.  If  the  server  in  attempting  to  serve  miss  the 
ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count  a  fault ;  but  if  the  ball  be  touched, 
no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is  thereby  delivered, 
and  the  laws  governing  the  service  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  until  the  striker-out  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8.  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net:  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  service, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  be  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court :  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults:  or  If  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play:  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by   law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
bounded  bv  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him.  or  anything 
that  he  wears  or* carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking:  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once  :  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports,  or  the  ground  within  his  opponent's 
court,  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it  has 
passed  the   net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."     But  when  a  permanent 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  273 

fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player ;  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player  ;  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  ;  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  that  player,  except  as  below. 
If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that 
player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except  as 
below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all; 
and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 
that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all  ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con- 
cluding set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  move  than  an  hour,  the 
player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  wnen  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  in  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 
*  All  matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the  aus- 
pices of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis  Association  shall  be  the  best 
two  in  three  sets,  with  a  rest  not  exceeding  seven  minutes  after  the  second 
set. 


274  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  follows  : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 
2S.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  36  feet  in  width;  4%  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service 
lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service 
side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so.  and  the  op- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third, 
and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall 
serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the 
subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

31.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set,  either  partner  of  the  pair 
which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve  ;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  game  of  the  new 

32.  The  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the 
game :  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  delivered  to  his  partner ; 
and  the  order  of  service  and  striking  out  once  established  shall  not 
he  altered,  nor  shall  the  striker-out  change  courts  to  receive  the 
service,  till  the  end  of  the  set. 

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  between  the  service 
line  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

34.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  as  provided  in 
law  33,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  anything  he  wears  or 
carries.

Cases  and  Decisions 

By    James    Dwight. 
Officially  recognized  by  the  U.  8.  }?.  L.  T.  A. 

I.  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
It  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.  If  he  attempts  to  return  the  service  he  is 
deemed  ready. 

IV.  The  striker-out  calls  "not  ready,"  for  a  second  service.  The 
ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 
fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference,  since  a  fault  cannot 
be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — The  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  "not  ready,"  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or 
not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into  the 
court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 
it  before  it  falls.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  so? 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  plav  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke'.' 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — 'Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  over 'the  net.      Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  plaver's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground" by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player   touches   the   net   beyond   the   inside   posts,   and   claims   that   he 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  277 

does   not    lose    the   stroke    because   there   should   be  no  net  more   than 

three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.      la  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  on 
opposite  sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court   loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net   and  bounds   into   the   opposite   court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  The  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is   returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary? 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own   side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  The  server  had  previously  served  a 
fault.      He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision.— The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. —  It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court   under  all   circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next  ? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being 
thirty-lifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was   played  in  his  first  service  it  is 


27S  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  the  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
ers to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  What 
is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let."  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
that   the   umpire   has    called    "play."      Has   he   any    redress  S 

Decision. — Ko. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

Decision. — The  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands' the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have  the   stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The    ball    strikes   the   ground   close   to   a   line ;    the   scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal  to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand  ? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Division. — No.  

UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Lawn  Tennis.) 
Both    of    the    opponents    of    the    servers    in    doubles    are    strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  throughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch  it  in 
doing*  so. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  279 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  ;  it  is  still   in  play  until   hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"'  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court  ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until   a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net.  and  nothing 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good ; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court  ;  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  The  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net   in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  the  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net.  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him,  or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being-  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  flip  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  alwavs  open  to  any  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  tVinninsr  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
thp  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  alwavs  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  plaved.  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter  ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

9.     It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire — 

(a)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before  the 
commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the  net  during 
play,  if  asked  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its  height  has  altered. 

(b)  To  call  the  faults  (subject  to  Regulation  10)  and  lets  unless 
he  delegates   such  power. 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to  call 
them,  and  to  record  them  upon  the  Umpire's  scoring  sheet.  (See 
example  below.) 

(d)  To  call  the  games  and  the  sets  at  the  end  of  each,  or  when 
asked  to  call  them,  and  to  record  them  on  the  Umpire's  scoring 
sheet. 

(e)  To  direct  the  Competitors  to  change  sides,  in  accordance  with 
Law  24.

"in  play"  or  not.  to  call  "play,"  and  at  the  conclusion  of  the  rally 
to  give  his  decision  (subject  to  Regulation  11)  or  direct  the  com- 
petitors to  play  the  stroke  again. 

(g)  To  decide  all  doubtful  or  disputed  strokes,  and  all  points  of 
law  (suoject  to  Regulations  10  and  11),  and  to  be  responsible  for 
the    proper    conduct    of    the    match.

The   score   of   the  Server   should   be   called   first. 


NOTE — At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with  the 
name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1,  B  wins"  or, 
"B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called  thus,  "three

decision   on   such   a   point,   the   Umpire   shall   submit   it   to  the   Referee 
whose  decision  shall   be   final.

17.  When  a  number  of  competitors  is  not  a  power  of  2,  there  shall 
be  byes  in  the  first  round.  The  number  of  byes  shall  be  equal  to  the 
difference  between  the  number  of  competitors  and  the  next  higher 
power  of  2,  and  the  number  of  pairs  that  shall  meet  in  the  first  round 
shall  be  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  number  of  competitors 
and  the  next  lower  power  of  2.  The  byes,  if  even  in  number,  shall  be 
divided,  as  the  names  are  drawn,  in  equal  proportions  at  the  top  and 
bottom  of  the  list,  above  and  below  the  pairs.  If  uneven  in  number, 
there  shall  be  one  more  bye  at  the  bottom  than  at  the  top.     Thus —

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9.  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  "the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing 
odds)    should   be  classified  as  follows  :

288  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table,  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),  the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall   be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may.  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law   25  must  be  strictly  observed. 

23.  In  all  tournaments  sanctioned  by  the  Association  the  use  of 
spikes  longer  than  one-quarter  of  an  inch  is  prohibited. 


INSTRUCTIONS    FOR    HANDICAPPING. 

GIVEN    ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  better  to  the 
poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth  and  every  subsequent 
sixth  game  in   each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second,  fourth,

Four-sixths  of  fifteen  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second, 
fourth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corresponding  games 
on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the  second,  third, 
fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth,  eleventh,  twelfth  and  corre- 
sponding games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  given  on  every  game  of  each  set. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same  games 
as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two  strokes  given 
on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the  same 
games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  two  strokes  on  the  same  games  as 
for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others.

and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4), 
thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are  three  strokes  and 
two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen 
series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  odds  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same  quanti- 
ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
These  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  291 

or  separately.  In  order  tbat  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  talile  for  owed  odds  ■ 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
sixth   and   coi  responding  games   in    each    set. 

Fifteen    (15i    is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  same. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth'  (15.1),  fifteen  and"  two-sixths  (15.2).  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty  i .  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (ir>.4), 
fifteen  and  live-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.8  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  ami  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (4iii.  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in   that   table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  to 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,   so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may    be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  "it  is  easier  to  owe  15.  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty  i.  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men,  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  foi 
official   sanction   for  the   tournament,   stating  dates  and   other   particu- 


292  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

•ars.  If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 
A  printed  circular  shouJd  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts  ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 

(5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and 

(6)  the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
"Tournament   Regulations.") 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although. 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and  therefore  not  engraved  until  after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south  side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they   are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players   and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  293 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,   light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it,  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
sbould  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  It 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
Is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  •  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
Invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy*  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in.  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are   put   in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
oourt  frequently. 

Wrhen  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use.  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  one 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.     After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 


294  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  right,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  broken 
stone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  egg,  will  answer 
the  purpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  stone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  is 
put  on  the  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  well  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suffice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  whereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  tin-  court  as 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  six-inch  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
cracked  stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  be  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  if 
it  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  too  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  *  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
is  played  on  at  all.  and  any  depressions  or  uneven  spots  corrected  as 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain 
storm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  the  players' 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  drainage  more  difficult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very*  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to  the  surface.  It  is  also  well  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations ;  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
earth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  much  leveling  and  rolling, 
and  the  rolling  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by  rain  or  hose-pipe.     Any   inequalities  which   the  heavy  pres- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  295 

sure  of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  be.en  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sods  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  The  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  :  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  *  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use.  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
fveather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
The  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
cannot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use, 
Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are -very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  found  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble   court. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.       In   every   case,  unless   it  be  of  grass,   and  the   lines  are 


296  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  In  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  ;  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it  ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  The  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines. 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.  It  should  be 
watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass,  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  in 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
sod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  it  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  is 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
soled  shoes  without  heels.

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 


As  a  double  court  practically  includes  every  line  to  be  found  in  a 
Bingle  court,  it  is  best  to  take  first  the  measure  for  the  latter.  Hav- 
ing determined  the  position  of  your  net,  plant  in  the  ground,  in  the 
line  chosen,  two  pegs,  27  feet  apart  (at  the  points  A  and  B  in  the 
diagram).  Then  take  two  measures  and  attach  their  respective  ends 
to  the  pegs  A  and  B.  On  the  first,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal 
of  the  court,  take  a  length  of  47  feet  5  inches  ;  on  the  other  39  feet ; 
pull  both  taut  in  such  directions  that  at  these  distances  they  meet 
in  a  point  C.  This  will  give  one  corner  of  the  court.  At  that  point  F, 
21  feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.  The 
other  corner,  D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  O,  may  be 
found  by  interchanging  the  measures  and  repeating  the  process.  The 
same  measurements  on  the  other  side  of  the  net  will  complete  the 
exterior  boundaries  of  the  court.  By  prolonging  the  base-line  4  feet 
6  inches  in  each  direction,  and  joining  the  four  new  points  thus 
obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.  It  only 
remains  to  mark  the  central  line.  This  is  done  by  joining  the  middle 
points  of  the  service-lines.  If  a  double  court  alone  be  required,  the 
interior  side-lines  need  not  be  prolonged  to  meet  the  base-lines. 
Remember  that  in  all  cases  the  net-posts  must  stand  at  a  distance 
of   three   feet  from   the    side-lines.

FOOT  FAULT  RULE. 

Every  effort  to  bring  about  the  careful  observance  of  this  rule 
during  the  coming  playing  season  will  be  used  by  the  Executive 
Committee,  who  will  welcome  the  cooperation  of  all  club  officers  in 
connection  with  tournaments  held  under  the  sanction  of  the  National 
body.  If  every  club  holding  an  authorized  tournament  will  make  a 
special  effort  to  secure  for  their  tournament  a  "Foot  Fault  Commit- 
tee," and  will  have  such  committee  carefully  study  and  post  them- 
selves as  to  just  what  constitutes  a  foot  fault  and  then  rigidly  enforce 
such  rule,  material  good  will  be  accomplished  in  connection  with  the 
legitimate  interests  of  the  game. 

Ihe  Executive  Committee  especially  requests  that  all  clubs  giving 
tournaments  with  the  sanction  of  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A.  include  in  their 
printed  notices  direct  information  that 

"THE  FOOT  FAULT  RULE  MUST  BE  OBSERVED,"

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  331 


What  is  New  in  Tennis 

Since  the  introduction  some  years  ago  of  the  Spalding  Gold 
Medal  rackets,  originally  made  in  two  models,  it  has  been  our  con- 
stant aim  to  improve  and  expand  this  special  line  of  rackets  to 
meet  the  demands  and  requirements  of  what  we  might  call  the  com- 
posite experience  of  experts  from  all  over  the  States,  Europe  and 
Australia. 

Practically  every  reasonable  requirement  that  can  be  looked 
for  in  a  racket — stringing,  distribution  of  weight,  playing  surface, 
grip,  shape — is  present  in  the  one  or  the  other  of  the  Spalding  Gold 
Medal  models,  and  until  now  we  felt  sure  we  had  the  "last  word" 
in  racket  manufacture. 

We  did  not  sit  back  and  rest  on  our  laurels,  however,  content 
with  what  we  had  accomplished,  but,  as  has  always  been  the  Spalding 
custom,  strove  to  excel  ourselves,  and,  in  the  new  Spalding  "Auto- 
graph" racket  we  feel  sure  that  we  have  succeeded  in  producing  an 
implement  that  is  unquestionably  the  finest  ever  made.  Reinforced 
inside  the  depressed  throat  with  selected  rawhide,  and  outside  from 
the  shoulders  down  into  the  very  handle  itself,  it  minimizes  to  the 
smallest  degree  the  possibility  of  a  broken  frame.  The  upper  part  of 
the  frame  is  beautifully  beveled,  and  the  handle  made  entirely  of 
cedar.  The  stringing  is  of  the  finest  grade  of  lambs'  gut,  done  by  the 
most  expert  stringers  in  our  shops.  The  racket  is  highly  polished 
and  finished  in  either  brown  or  black.  The  brown  style  has  brown 
throatpiece,  brown  rawhide  reinforcement  at  shoulders  and  maroon 
trimming  gut.  All  white  stringing,  in  "expert"  style.  The  black 
style  has  black  throatpiece,  black  rawhide  reinforcement  at  shoulders 
and  black  trimming  gut.  White  vertical  and  black  cross  strings,  in 
"expert"  style.  Handles  are  5,  5%  or  5%  inches  in  circumference. 
Price,    including  a   waterproof   cover,   $10.00. 

The  "International"  is  the  1915  addition  to  our  $S.00  Gold  Medal 
models  and  rounds  out  the  greatest  line  of  high  grade  rackets  ever 
offered  to  the  public.  Graceful  lines,  lots  of  playing  surface  and 
raised  throatpiece,  it  gives  the  player  confidence  in  his  strokes  as  soon 
as  he  grasps  it. 

In  addition  to  the  "International,"'  the  line  of  $8.00  rackets  in- 
cludes such  favorites  as  the  Gold  Medal  No.  GMB,  All-Comers,  Olympic, 
Model  H,  and  the  ever-popular  "Hackett  and  Alexander,"  each  with 
its  own  particular  point  of  popularity.  Excellent  rackets,  ones  that 
were-  "championship"  class  only  a  few  years  ago,  are  Models  GX, 
DH  and  EH,  which  sell  at  $5.0O,  while  the  "Tournament,"  at  $4.00  ; 
the  "Slocum,"  at  $3.50;  the  Nassau  and  Lakeside,  at  $3.00;  Oval, 
$2.50;  Greenwood,  $2.00;  Geneva,  $1.50,  and  Favorite,  $1.25,  are  all 
representative  of   Spalding  quality   at   their   respective  prices. 


332  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Speed  on  the  court,  ability  to  last,  an  all-around,  well-balanced 
game  are  three  qualities  necessary  to  a  good  player.  The  Spalding 
Championship  Ball  has  all  these,  and  wherever  it  is  used  we  are 
certain  our  judgment  will  be  confirmed.  Made  in  two  weights  of 
covers — No.  00  for  turf  courts  and  No.  OOH  for  hard  courts.  The 
latter  ball  has  met  with  remarkable  success  on  hard  courts  through- 
out the  country,  so  much  so  that  it  is  popularly  known  as  the 
"Spalding  Hard  Court  Ball,"  and  was  selected  as  the  official  ball 
of  the  Clay  Court  tournament  of  1914,  held  at  Cincinnati,  and  has 
been  again  officially  adopted  for  the  Clay  Court  championship  of  1915, 
to  be  held  this  year  on  the  courts  of  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic  Asso- 
ciation, June  26  and  following  days. 

Incidentally,  it  may  be  mentioned  that  the  challenge  match  of 
the  Davis  Cup  tournament  of  1914  was  played  over  a  Spalding  No.  9-0 
championship  net. 

For  clubs  holding  tournaments,  many  articles  are  now  absolute 
necessities  that  were  unknown  a  few  years  ago.  While  nets,  posts,  and 
all  the  direct  paraphernalia  of  the  game  itself  must  be  correct  and 
in  good  shape,  the  umpire's  chair  and  a  scoring  tree  are  just  as  much 
a  part  of  the  setting  nowadays  as  seats  for  the  spectators,  and  for 
clubs  holding  tournaments  a  "club"   racket  press  is  most  essential. 

To  have  a  favorite  racket  put  out  of  commission  by  some  "chair 
caner"  has  more  than  once  caused  the  loss  of  a  match,  as  many 
players  can  testify.  We  make  a  specialty  of  restringing  rackets, 
using  the  best  of  materials,  and,  what  is  even  better,  brains.  Our 
stringers  are  men  who  are  employed  continually  throughout  the 
year,  not  for  a  few  months  in  the  season  only — and  coming  in  con- 
tact with  the  leading  players,  who  naturally  go  to  Spalding's  for 
their  requirements,  these  men  are  in  an  unequaled  position  to  obtain 
at  first  hand  all  the  little  niceties  of  stringing  that  experience  has 
shown  to  be  most  effective  and  which  goes  to  make  up  that  "just 
a  bit  better"  that  distinguishes  the  expert  from  the  ordinary  player. 
All  of  which  is  at  the  command  of  our  patrons. 

Several  players  who  found  the  glare  of  a  semi-tropic  sun  on  Southern 
courts  most  trying  during  the  past  winter  took  a  leaf  out  of  the 
base  ball  player's  notebook  and  used  a  form  of  sun-glass  invented  by 
Manager  Fred  Clarke  of  the  Pittsburgh  National  League  base  ball  club 
for  the  use  of  outfielders.  The  arrangement,  which  is  fastened  to  the 
player's  cap  or  hat,  is  substantial  but  not  cumbersome,  and  has  a 
hinged  attachment  which  permits  the  glasses  to  be  turned  up  out  of 
the  way  when   not  needed.      They   cost   $10. 

Another  novelty  is  an  improvement  over  the  regulation  sweatband. 
It  consists  of  a  sweatband  and  visor — or  sunshade — combined,  and 
sells  for  50  cents. 

Probably  next  to  the  racket  a  player's  shoes  are  the  most  important 
part  of  his  equipment,  and  necessarily  so.  for  an  ill-fitting  pair  is  a 
handicap    right    from    the   start.    A   style   that   has   found   favor   with 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  333 

many  prominent  players  is  the  Spalding  No.  BBH,  which  is  ideal 
for  tournament  play  on  turf  courts,  and  fitted  with  officially  approved 
blunt  spikes  in  soles  and  heels.  It  is  high  cut,  with  finest  quality 
kangaroo  uppers,  white  oak  soles  and  spring  heels,  and  sells  for  $6.00 
per  pair. 

For  clay  court  use,  No.  AB  is  the  most  desirable  style.  It  laces 
all  the  way  down  to  the  toe,  being  just  high  enough  to  give  support 
to  the  ankle  and  yet  not  bind  too  tightly.  High  cut,  drab  calf, 
Blucher  style,  with  heavy  red  rubber  section  soles.  No.  AB  costs  $5.00 
per  pair. 

A  canvas  shoe  much  favored  by  players  who  desire  something  stronger 
than  the  ordinary  type  of  "sneaker"  for  clay  courts  is  the  Spalding 
No.  HH,  which  is  really  a  high  "sneaker"  with  an  extra  heavy  sole 
of  best  quality  rubber.  No.  HH  costs  $2.25  per  pair,  and  low  cut,  of 
same  quality — when  it  is  known  as  No.  H — costs  $2.00  per  pair. 

In  this  connection  it  is  well  to  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  we 
also  resole  rubber  soled  shoes  of  our  own  make,  the  work  being  done 
in  the  Spalding  shoe  factory  where  the  shoes  are  made.  This  is  a 
convenience  that  is  obvious,  and  one  that  other  dealers  are  unable  to> 
offer. 

Tennis  players  who  contemplate  being  present — either  as  contest- 
ants or  spectators — at  the  clay  court  championships  at  Pittsburgh  in 
June,  or  the  National  Championships,  to  be  held  this  year  on  the 
courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  at  Forest  Hills,  Long  Island. 
in  August,  are  invited  to  make  use  of  the  Spalding  stores 
in  both  Pittsburgh  and  New  York  as  their  headquarters.  A  corps  of 
specially  selected  stringers  will  be  on  hand  and"  no  effort  will  be 
spared  to  make  Spalding  service  coequal  with   Spalding  quality.

Standard  Policy 


A  Standard  Quality  must  be  inseparably  linked  to  a  Standard  Policy. 

Without  a  definite  and  Standard  Mercantile  Policy,  it  is  impossible  for  a 
Manufacturer  to  long  maintain  a  Standard  Quality. 

To  market  his  goods  through  the  jobber,  a  manufacturer  must  provide  a 
profit  for  the  jobber  as  well  as  for  the  retail  dealer.  To  meet  these  conditions 
of  Dual  Profits,  the  manufacturer  is  obliged  to  set  a  proportionately  high  list 
price  on  his  goods  to  the  consumer. 

To  enable  the  glib  salesman,  when  booking  his  orders,  to  figure  out 
attractive  profits  to  both  the  jobber  and  retailer,  these  high  list  prices  are 
absolutely  essential;  but  their  real  purpose  will  have  been  served  when  the 
manufacturer  has  secured  his  order  from  the  jobber,  and  the  jobber  has  secured 
his  order  from  the  retailer. 

However,  these  deceptive  high  list  prices  are  not  fair  to  the  consumer,  who 
does  not,  and,  in  reality,  is  not  ever  expected  to  pay  these  fancy  list  prices. 

When  the  season  opens  for  the  sale  of  such  goods,  with  their  misleading 
but  alluring  high  list  prices,  the  retailer  begins  to  realize  his  responsibilities,  and 
grapples  with  the  situation  as  best  he  can,  by  offering  "special  discounts," 
which  vary  with  local  trade  conditions. 

Under  this  system  of  merchandising,  the  profits  to  both  the  manufacturer 
and  the  jobber  are  assured ;  but  as  there  is  no  stability  maintained  in  the  prices 
to  the  consumer,  the  keen  competition  amongst  the  local  dealers  invariably 
leads  to  a  demoralized  cutting  of  prices  by  which  the  profits  of  the  retailer  are 
practically  eliminated. 

This  demoralization  always  reacts  on  the  manufacturer.  The  jobber  insists 
on  lower,  and  still  lower,  prices.  The  manufacturer,  in  his  turn,  meets  this 
demand  for  the  lowering  of  prices  by  the  only  way  open  to  him,  viz.:  the  cheap- 
ening and  degrading  of  the  quality  of  his  product. 

The  foregoing  conditions  became  so  intolerable  that  16  years  ago,  in  1899, 
A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  determined  to  rectify  this  demoralization  in  the  Athletic 
Goods  Trade,  and  inaugurated  what  has  since  become  known  as  "  The  Spalding 
Policy." 

"The  Spalding  Policy"  eliminates  the  jobber  entirely,  so  far  as  Spalding 
Goods  are  concerned,  and  the  retail  dealer  secures  the  supply  of  Spalding 
Athletic  Goods  direct  from  the  manufacturer  by  which  the  retail  dealer  is 
assured  a  fair  and  legitimate  profit  on  all  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  and  the 
consumer  is  assured  a  Standard  Quality  and  is  protected  from  imposition. 

"The  Spalding  Policy"  is  decidedly  for  the  interest  and  protection  of  the 
users  of  Athletic  Goods,  and  acts  in  two  ways: 

First.— The  user  is  assured  of  genuine  Official  Standard  Athletic  Goods. 

Second.  —  As  manufacturers,  we  can  proceed  with  confidence  in 
purchasing  at  the  proper  time,  the  very  best  raw  materials  required 
in  the  manufacture  of  our  various  goods,  well  ahead  of  their 
respective  seasons,  and  this  enables  us  to  provide  the  necessary 
quantity  and  absolutely  maintain  the  Spalding  Standard  of  Quality. 

All  retail  dealers  handling  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  are  requested  to  supply 
consumers  at  our  regular  printed  catalogue  prices — neither  more  nor  less — the  same 
prices  that  similar  goods  are  sold  for  in  our  New  York,  Chicago  and  other  stores. 

All  Spalding  dealers,  as  well  as  users  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  are  treated 
exactly  alike,  and  no  special  rebates  or  discriminations  are  allowed  to  anyone. 

This  briefly,  is  "The  Spalding  Policy,  which  has  already  been  in  successful 
operation  for  the  past  16  years,  and  will  be  indefinitely  continued. 

In  other  words,  "The  Spalding  Policy"  is  a  "square  deal"  for  everybody.

Standard  Quality 


An  article  that  is  universally  given  the  appellation  "Standard"  is  thereby 
conceded  to  be  the  criterion,  to  which  are  compared  all  other  things  of  a  similar 
nature.  For  instance,  the  Gold  Dollar  of  the  United  States  is  the  Standard  unit 
of  currency,  because  it  must  legally  contain  a  specific  proportion  of  pure  gold, 
and  the  fact  of  its  being  Genuine  is  guaranteed  by  the  Government  Stamp 
thereon.  As  a  protection  to  the  users  of  this  currency  against  counterfeiting  and 
other  tricks,  considerable  money  is  expended  in  maintaining  a  Secret  Service 
Bureau  of  Experts.  Under  the  law,  citizen  manufacturers  must  depend  to  a 
great  extent  upon  Trade-Marks  and  similar  devices  to  protect  themselves  against 
counterfeit  products— without  the  aid  of  "Government  Detectives"  or  "Public 
Opinion"  to  assist  them. 

Consequently  the  "Consumer's  Protection"  against  misrepresentation  and 
"inferior  quality"  rests  entirely  upon  the  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the 
"  Manufacturer." 

A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  have,  by  their  rigorous  attention  to  "Quality,"  for 
thirty-nine  years,  caused  their  Trade-Mark  to  become  known  throughout 
the  world  as  a  Guarantee  of  Quality  as  dependable  in  their  field  as  the 
U.  S.  Currency  is  in  its  field. 

The  necessity  of  upholding  the  Guarantee  of  the  Spalding  Trade-Mark  and 
maintaining  the  Standard  Quality  of  their  Athletic  Goods,  is,  therefore,  as  obvi- 
ous as  is  the  necessity  of  the  Government  in  maintaining  a  Standard  Currency. 

Thus  each  consumer  is  not  only  insuring  himself  but  also  protecting  other 
consumers  when  he  assists  a  Reliable  Manufacturer  in  upholding  his  Trade- 
Mark  and  all  that  it  stands  for.  Therefore,  we  urge  all  users  of  our  Athletic 
Goods  to  assist  us  in  maintaining  the  Spalding  Standard  of  Excellence,  by 
insisting  that  our  Trade-Mark  be  plainly  stamped  on  all  athletic  goods  which 
they  buy,  because  without  this  precaution  our  best  efforts  towards  maintaining 
Standard  Quality  and  preventing  fraudulent  substitution  will  be  ineffectual. 

Manufacturers  of  Standard  Articles  invariably  suffer  the  reputation  of  being 
high-priced,  and  this  sentiment  is  fostered  and  emphasized  by  makers  of 
"  inferior  goods,"  with  whom  low  prices  are  the  main  consideration. 

A  manufacturer  of  recognized  Standard  Goods,  with  a  reputation  to  uphold 
and  a  guarantee  to  protect  must  necessarily  have  higher  prices  than  a  manufac- 
turer of  cheap  goods,  whose  idea  of  and  basis  of  a  claim  for  Standard  Quality 
depends  principally  upon  the  eloquence  of  the  salesman. 

We  know  from  experience  that  there  is  no  quicksand  more  unstable  than 
poverty  in  quality— and  we  avoid  this  quicksand  by  Standard  Quality.
