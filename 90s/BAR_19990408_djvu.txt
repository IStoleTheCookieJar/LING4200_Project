anti-LGBT 

violence 

report 

by Mark Norby 


A colorful and energetic group of 
f \ activists and concerned citizens 
J. lL gathered around the leader¬ 
ship of Community United Against 
Violence (CUAV) at a public forum 
and press conference Tuesday, April 6 
at the San Francisco Main Library. 
The event was CUAV’s annual an¬ 
nouncement of anti-lesbian, gay, bi¬ 
sexual, and transgender (LGBT) vio¬ 
lence and hate crimes committed in 
1998, and is the groups fifth report in 
association with the National Associ¬ 
ation of Anti-Violence Programs. 

As outrage and frustration perme¬ 
ate the country in the wake of the bru¬ 
tal murders of Matthew Shepard in 
Wyoming and Billy Jack Gaither in Al¬ 
abama, the LGBT community mem¬ 
bers at Tuesday’s event seemed alert 
and anxious, as CUAV’s Director of 
Client and Advocacy Services Jennifer 
Rakowski delivered statistics that prove 
the community has miles to go before 
it sleeps. “These tragedies are a re¬ 
minder,” said' Rakowski, “that homo¬ 
phobia, racism, and hate are lethal, and 
all too often a motive for violence.” 

As in the San Francisco vigil for 
Gaither last month, transgender peo¬ 
ple were a highly visible community 
at CUAV’s forum; the group has seen 
dramatic increases in incidents of vi¬ 
olence over the last year. “The at¬ 
tempted murder of Leonard ‘Lynn’ 
Vines, who was shot six times [in New 
York] after hearing the words ‘We 
don’t allow no drag queen faggots in 
this neighborhood,’ is just one exam¬ 
ple of the extreme violence commit¬ 
ted against this group in our commu¬ 
nity,” Rakowski stated.

jtk fter months of receiving nomina- 
tions for Pride Parade grand mar- 
shal, the San Francisco Lesbian, 
m Gay,. Bisexual, Transgender 

•JL, Pride Celebration Committee, 

Inc. has decided to open the process of se¬ 
lecting this year’s grand marshal by having 
a community vote next Saturday, April 17 
to pick parade leaders in two categories: in¬ 
dividual and organization. 

The list of 18 nominees represents vir¬ 
tually every segment of the queer commu¬ 
nity. From youth to religious leaders to 
community activists, a wide spectrum of 
people are nominated. Some people were 
nominated by friends or others in the les¬ 
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) 
community, while parade committee mem¬ 
bers nominated others, said Executive Di¬ 
rector Teddy Witherington. This year’s 
pride events take place June 26 and 27; the 
theme is “Proud Heritage, Powerful Future.” 

“The board’s roll was to look at the 
nominating list as a whole and fill in gaps,” 
Witherington told the Bay Area Reporter. 

To honor, organizations that have served 
the community, there is a separate entry for 
organization grand marshal. Those nomi¬ 
nees are the AIDS Emergency Fund (AEF), 
Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays 
(PFLAG), and the Sisters of Perpetual In¬ 
dulgence. 

Witherington and Calvin Gipson, pride 
board president, said the community vote 
represents a “bold new direction” for the se¬ 
lection of this year’s marshal. For the pub¬ 
lic vote, a polling place will be open at 18th 
and Castro streets from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. 
Pride committee volunteers, complete with 
festive balloons and banners, will staff the 
polling place. Officials said anyone can vote, 
regardless of residency, although only one 
vote per person per category is allowed. 

“The staff are enthusiastic about it,” said 
Witherington. “This event represents more 
than San Francisco.” 

It’s jilso possible to vote by mail; ballots 
will appear in local publications next week 
that can be mailed to the pride office. To re¬ 
duce the chances of people submitting mul¬ 
tiple votes, there will be no voting via tele¬ 
phone or e-mail. Mailed ballots must be re¬ 
ceived by Friday, April 23. 


Individual nominees 

Keith Boykin, executive director of the 
National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership 
Forum and author of the 1996 book One 
More River to Cross: Black & Gay in Ameri¬ 
ca. Boykin served as a special assistant to 
President Bill Clinton and helped organize 
the first meeting between gay and lesbian 
leaders and the president. Boykin is a grad¬ 
uate of Harvard Law School and his work 
with the leadership forum has received wide 
public exposure. 

Barbara Cameron, former executive di¬ 
rector of Community United Against Vio¬ 
lence and one of the people who worked to 
incorporate the pride celebration commit¬ 
tee. Cameron, a Native American, was chair 
of the parade committee for many years 
and founded Gay American Indians when 
she came to San Francisco at age 18. Pam 
David of the Mayor’s Office of Community 
Development told the B.A.R. that Cameron 
is someone who’s “really paid her dues in

Castro hate crime 
reaches D.A.’s office 


by Mark Norby 


i - f| fficers and investigators of 

| v the San Francisco Police 
Department (SFPD) have 
charged 21-year-old Ban Doc Im 
with aggravated assault and an 
anti-gay hate crime in the March 
19 beating of Bradley Davis in the 
Castro District. 

The SFPD claims that Thuan 
Cao Thruang, Im’s alleged accom¬ 
plice in the incident who was 
booked on assault and hate crime 
charges, either is currently or has 
been an employee at Slider’s 
Diner, located at 449 Castro 
Street. Mike Dong, manager of 
Slider’s Diner, told the Bay Area 
Reporter that he has “never heard 
of any of the suspects” and that 
Thruang has not been in his em¬ 
ploy. Although booked in the 
Davis incident, charges against 
Thruang were later dropped. 

Witnesses to the crime report 
that Im and three other men ver¬ 
bally assaulted Davis and then 
chased and beat him unconscious 
at approximately 12:10 a.m. near 
the Castro Theater. Police reports 
indicate that Davis heard the men 
yelling homophobic insults and 
racial slurs, and objected by ap¬ 
proaching them and telling them 
to stop the activity. The suspects 
retaliated by gripping Davis, rip¬ 
ping off his shirt, and then chas¬ 
ing him across Castro Street. 
Davis ran from the suspects and 
fell to the ground near a van 



Bradley Davis. 


parked next to the curb fronting 
Ultimate Yogurt. The suspects 
then began kicking and hitting 
Davis repeatedly while he lay in 
the gutter, leaving him bleeding 
and unconscious. Davis was later 
treated at Davies Medical Center 
where he received several stitches 
for lacerations and a head wound. 

Davis was discovered uncon¬ 
scious near the theater by Officers 
Lisa Frazer and Maria Escobar 
who work together with the San 
Francisco Patrol Special Police, a 
force exclusively hired to monitor 
the Castro District and paid for by 
the Merchants of Upper Market 
and Castro (MUMC). 

After Davis’s beating, the sus¬ 


pects were later seen running into 
the theater parking lot. Frazer and 
Escobar found two of the suspects 
trying to flee in a silver Honda. A 
third suspect was found hiding 
underneath a parked car and two 
others were detained further away 
from the scene. On March 19 
Henry Sai Hung Kwong was also 
booked in the incident, but 
charges were dropped due to non¬ 
complicity and because Im ad¬ 
mitted to instigating the assault 
and battery. 

According to the assigned 
SFPD investigator, Brian Danker, 
Im confessed to police that he 
beat Davis because he “didn’t like 
the guy because he was gay.” The 
officers had asked the district at¬ 
torney to prosecute the case as a 
hate crime in addition to the 
charges of aggravated assault, 
Danker said, thereby aiming to 
deter future hate crime activity 
and acts of violence. 

Im was arraigned on March 25 
and the case is now before Assis¬ 
tant District Attorney Maria Bee, 
who will review the charges later 
this week pending consultation 
with Im’s public defender. 

The Davis incident received 
wide media attention and has 
raised new concerns over the gay 
community’s safety in the city. “If 
this type of violent crime is hap¬ 
pening in the Castro,” stated gay 
Castro resident Michael Tadler, 
“it’s a cause for serious alarm. Do 
we really have to watch our backs 
wherever we go?” ▼ 


April declared STD Awareness Month 


by Mark Norby 


H H esponding to recent public 
health reports indicating 
II %. that sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs) lead to increased 
risk of HIV infection, Supervisor 
Leslie Katz introduced a resolution 
at the a meeting of the Board of 
Supervisors Monday, April 5 de¬ 
claring April STD Awareness 
Month for the City and County of 
San Francisco. Katz was joined by 
Department of Public Health 
(DPH) Director of Sexually Trans¬ 
mitted Disease Prevention and 
Control Services Dr. Jeffrey Klaus- 
ner, in unveiling public service 
posters addressing STD awareness 
as well as the new school screening 
program, an in-school STD testing 
program for all San Francisco high 
school students. 

Last summer the Centers for 


Disease Control and Prevention 
released a report stating that STDs 
increase the risk for HIV infection 
by at least two to five times. The 
report strongly advocated that 
early detection and treatment of 
curable STDs should be widely 
implemented as an HIV preven¬ 
tion strategy. The report also rec¬ 
ommended that all sexually active 
males and females should be 
screened annually, a recommen¬ 
dation that has become more fea¬ 
sible with the availability of urine- 
based diagnostic testing. 

”1 am deeply committed to im¬ 
proving the health of San Francis¬ 
cans,” Katz stated at the board 
meeting, “and addressing the 
problems of sexually transmitted 
diseases and HIV infection is a 
huge part of that. New testing 
procedures will make the screen¬ 
ing process much easier and more 
readily available.” 


In a Wednesday, April 6 inter¬ 
view with the Bay Area Reporter, 
Katz stated in more specific terms 
that genital and anal gonorrhea 
increase the risk of HIV infection, 
as does venereal disease and geni¬ 
tal herpes. “It is these lesser virus¬ 
es,” commented Katz, “that give an 
opportunity for HIV to present it¬ 
self during sexual intercourse, 
whereby infecting the individual.” 

Echoing Katz’s words, Klaus- 
ner stated that “to make STD 
screening easier, the San Francisco 
Department of Public Health has 
made the new urine STD tests 
available at all community health 
centers including [the public] 
City Clinic on 7th Street, and at 
hospitals and selected schools. Be¬ 
cause persons can be infected and 
have no symptoms, it is important 
for sexually active persons to get 
tested for these easily treatable in¬ 
fections,” Klausner said. T

v p - he state Alcoholic Beverage 
" Control (ABC) agency is 
I taking measures to close 
down the city’s beer busts and 
beer benefits, in an effort to pre¬ 
vent the “uncontrolled amount of 
outgoing alcohol” at local bars 
and clubs. ABC officials told the 
Bay Area Reporter they launched 
the action upon receiving an 
“anonymous complaint from 
people in Los Angeles” about the 
Lone Star Saloon, located at 1354 
Harrison Street in the South of 
Market District, after the Interna¬ 
tional Bear Rendezvous weekend 
in mid-February. 

ABC officials informed the 
Lone Star management that beer 
busts and beer benefits are “unli¬ 
censed events,” and that such 
events would no longer be al¬ 
lowed. “Beer busts and beer bene¬ 


fits allow uncontrolled amounts 
of alcohol to be sold for a fixed 
price at the bars and clubs,” ABC 
District Administrator Michael 
Tyrel told the B.A.R. “The prob¬ 
lem is these events allow patrons 
to consume unlimited amounts of 
alcohol.” 

Beer busts and benefits have 
been popular in the gay commu¬ 
nity for many years, and are typi¬ 
cally designed to raise money for 
AIDS organizations like the AIDS 
Emergency Fund (AEF) or Project 
Open Hand. The Lone Star Sa¬ 
loon, which has had a standard 
donation fee of $6 to $8 per cup, 
allowing the cup’s holder the op¬ 
portunity to refill as many times 
as desired, no longer will hold the 
events; instead, it will charge $1 
per beer with a set amount going 
to the designated charity. 

Tyrel said the difference be¬ 
tween a patron purchasing drinks 
individually and purchasing un- 


Alcohol Screening Day today 


by Bob Roehr 


PH o you have a problem with 


Pi 

w 


alcohol? 


The first National Alco¬ 
hol Screening Day can help you 
answer that question. Today 
(Thursday, April 8) has been set 
aside for the innovative free pro¬ 
gram at 2,000 sites across the 
country. In San Francisco, sites 
will be at New Leaf Services for 
Our Community, 1853 Market 
Street and at Borders Books, 400 
Post Street. 

The screening day includes 
three presentations centered on 
the full range of alcohol problems, 
a written screening questionnaire, 
and one-on-one talk with a health 
professional. Referrals to treat¬ 
ment facilities and self-help pro¬ 
grams are also available when ap¬ 
propriate. 

Nearly 14 million Americans - 
one in 13 people - have a problem 
with alcohol, costing society an 
estimated $150 billion a year. 

“Alcohol problems impact all 
aspects of life, damaging physical 
health, job and school function¬ 
ing, interpersonal relationships, 
and mental and emotional well¬ 
being,” says Dr. Shelly Greenfield, 
an assistant professor at Harvard 
Medical School. 

You don’t have to be a fall 


down drunk to have a problem. 
Harmful patterns include the 
abuse of binge drinking and the 
dependence of maintenance 
drinking where you need alcohol 
in order to function. Men are two- 
to three times more likely than 
women to suffer from the prob¬ 
lem. 

“Alcoholism is a disease of the 
brain, with a genetic predisposi¬ 
tion,” says alcohol researcher Dr. 
Ting-Kai Li. Some people’s bodies 
process the chemical differently, 
or their nerve receptors are more 
sensitive to it. Those who are ge¬ 
netically predisposed may be up 
to five times as susceptible to its 
addictive qualities. They physical¬ 
ly become addicted much more 
quickly and at lower levels of im¬ 
bibing. 

Researchers also found that 
there is a cultural component, by 
studying identical twins who were 
raised in different households. 
How and when you start drinking 
can also affect your genetic pro¬ 
clivities to processing alcohol. T

National Alcohol Screening 
Day, call 1-800-405-9200.

limited refills is that “if a patron 
purchases a cup for $10 and ex¬ 
pects to be able to refill it as many 
times as he likes, but the bar¬ 
tender, having recognized that the 
patron is noticeably intoxicated, 
the patron has the right to insist 
on another refill because he pur¬ 
chased the cup with the under¬ 
standing that he is entitled to un¬ 
limited refills.” 

Tyrel also said bars would not 
be allowed to sell a cup for a set 
price and then charge a smaller 
amount per additional refill. 
“That would still allow an uncon¬ 
trolled amount of alcohol to be 
outgoing from the bar,” he said. “If 
a bar wants to hold a benefit 
event, then the proper action for 
the bar owner to take would be to 
advertise the event as such, charge 
standard prices for drinks, then 
follow the event with a set dona¬ 
tion which would go to the spe¬ 
cific charity.” 

Tyrel stated that other bars 
that hold beer busts and benefits 
will be monitored “on a com¬ 
plaint basis.” He further stated 
that the ABC does not have the 
personnel to go around the city, 
closing down the events wherever 
they are held. 

Kevin Owens, owner of the 
Lone Star, declined to comment 
on the ABC’s action, stating that 
“their attorney is handling the 
case and will answer all pertinent 
questions.” Owens’s attorney, Jef¬ 
frey Gibson, declined to comment 
on the situation. ▼

SFGH pharmacy woes 

Long waits, new co-pay plan in effect 


by Cynthia Laird 


JH CT UP/Golden Gate has 
written to San Francisco 
« Mayor Willie Brown and 
Health Director Dr. Mitch Katz to 
ask that the satellite pharmacy at 
San Francisco General Hospital 
(SFGH) be re-opened. The satel¬ 
lite pharmacy was closed last 
month and since then, at times 
the wait at SFGH’s main pharma¬ 
cy has been six hours or longer for 
people picking up their medica¬ 
tions. 

The Department of Public 
Health faces a budget shortfall 
$25.4 million and the pharmacy 
changes are to help ease the 
deficit. Additionally, on Monday, 
April 5, the pharmacy began 
charging prescription co-pay¬ 
ments of at least $2 to most of its 
poor patients. 

At the Health Commission 
meeting Tuesday, April 6, Katz 
gave an update on the pharmacy 
situation, but the new co-pay¬ 
ment plan remains in effect. 
Under the change, MediCal and 
other sponsored patients have the 
option of Filling their prescrip¬ 
tions at outside pharmacies. If 
they continue to get prescriptions 
at the SFGH pharmacy, there’s 
now a collection process for pa¬ 
tients with a MediCal share of 
cost and for co-payments that’s $2 
per prescription up to a maxi¬ 
mum of $10 per visit from pa¬ 
tients without health insurance. 

Katz told the commission that 
the pharmacy and patient ac¬ 
counts departments worked to¬ 


gether to help make the process as 
smooth as possible for people. On 
Monday, the first day of the new 
system, things went relatively 
smoothly; however, Katz noted 
that rainy weather resulted in an 
overall decrease in pharmacy vol¬ 
ume. Approximately 1,200 pre¬ 
scriptions were filled, 20 percent 
less than the daily average of 
1,500. 

“Almost all patients who had a 
share of cost or co-pay did, in fact, 
make their payments,” Katz’s re¬ 
port stated. “The pharmacy col¬ 
lected $1,117.75.” 

Katz said the hospital will eval¬ 
uate the operations on a daily 
basis and make continuous efforts 
to improve the system. Hospital 
officials will address the needs of 
individual patients on a case by 
case basis. 

Dr. Melissa Welch, medical di¬ 
rector for the Community Health 
Network in the city, told the Bay 
Area Reporter that the changes in¬ 
volving the pharmacy were part of 
a restructuring process to ease the 
deficit, and that the pharmacy had 
always been lenient in enforcing 
share of cost payments from pa¬ 
tients. Welch also said that for those 
unable to pay, it’s always been the 
city’s policy to work with people to 
make sure they get their medica¬ 
tions and that policy continues. 

The March 30 letter to Brown 
and Katz from ACT UP/Golden 
Gate asks that the city provide 
funding to re-open the satellite 
pharmacy at Building 80/90 at 
SFGH, primarily because it helps 
people living with HIV/AIDS to 
start and maintain complicated 


treatment schedules. The satellite 
pharmacy closed March 3. 

“Since the closure of the satel¬ 
lite pharmacy, the wait time at the 
main pharmacy has become un¬ 
acceptably long (with wait times 
exceeding one day in some cases). 
If people with HIV/AIDS cannot 
get access to drugs, they cannot 
adhere to complicated treatment 
schedules,” the letter stated. 

ACT UP/Golden Gate also 
stated that in some cases, 
HIV/AIDS patients cannot get 
their drugs at other pharmacies. 
“Not all HIV/AIDS patients at 
SFGH are on ADAP [AIDS Drug 
Assistance Program] or Medicare 
and these patients cannot afford 
to pay out of pocket for their pre¬ 
scriptions. Even for patients on 
ADAP or Medicare, not all of 
their required prescriptions are 
covered by these programs. Last¬ 
ly, sick and indigent people often 
cannot spare the energy or re¬ 
sources to travel to other pharma¬ 
cies,” said the letter. 

Bill Barnes, the mayor’s 
HIV/AIDS policy advisor, told the 
B.A.R. that he has seen the letter 
but declined to comment on it, 
referring inquiries to DPH. 

ACT UP/Golden Gate mem¬ 
bers added that the satellite phar¬ 
macy provided critical patient ed¬ 
ucation services to help people 
living with HIV/AIDS take their 
drugs properly. “The satellite 
pharmacists developed expertise 
specific to HIV/AIDS medications 
and had the time to educate pa¬ 
tients on how to properly take 
their complicated drug regimens,” 
members stated. T

Fundraiser to fight 
Knight initiative tonight 

All Our Families, many of our lawmakers 


by Cynthia Laird 


%P he fight against the anti-gay 
marriage Knight initiative 
II takes off tonight (Thursday, 
April 8) with a reception to bene¬ 
fit All Our Families Coalition’s 
(AOFC) grassroots campaign 
against the measure that state vot¬ 
ers will decide in March 2000. 

Tonight’s event takes place at 
the home of Dr. John Newmeyer 
in San Francisco from 6 to 8 p.m.; 
tickets start at $100 per person. 
Oodles restaurant is catering the 
event. 

Local officials expected to be 
on hand include San Francisco 
Assemblywoman Carole Migden 
and San Francisco Supervisor 
Mark Leno. 

“This event’s funding will be 
used to educate all Californians 
about our families and how the 
anti-gay family Knight initiative, 
appearing on our March 2000 
ballot, hurts all families,” said 
Cheryl Deaner, AOFC’s executive 
director. “This initiative would 
make it public policy that our 
families not be given the same 
rights other families in society 
enjoy.” 

Funds raised at the event will 
also be used to support domestic 
partnership and adoption rights 
issues. 

Leno said it’s important for 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender (LGBT) communi¬ 
ty to fight the Knight initiative, 
even though it will be a daunt¬ 
ing challenge. A Field Poll last 
week revealed that 55 percent of 
California voters favor the pro¬ 
visions of the Knight initiative;

Prescriptions for misery 


L ast week Microsoft founder Bill 
Gates got a lot of fawning attention 
in the press for donating $1.5 mil¬ 
lion to relief efforts aimed at Kosovo 
refugees. While the donation is certainly 
better than nothing, and is desperately 
needed, it must be pointed out that many 
San Franciscans are providing compara¬ 
tively more (and getting a lot less atten¬ 
tion) every time they pick up a prescrip¬ 
tion at San Francisco General Hospital 
these days. 

As Cynthia Laird reports on page four 
of this issue, the Department of Public 
Health has recently initiated a co-pay re¬ 
quirement for patients who use SFGH’s 
pharmacy. By some standards, the payment 
is moderate - anywhere from $2 to $10. But 
it isn’t moderate when you take a look at 
the overall effect on the people shelling out 
the money, and compare the percentage of 
their net worth going into that co-payment, 
versus the percentage of Gates’s net worth 
that went into his donation. 

At last count, Gates’s wealth was esti¬ 
mated at $80 billion. According to our cal¬ 
culator, his $1.5 million outlay consumed 
.0001875 percent of his wealth, which is 
about the same as a $2 outlay eats up when 
someone has assets of $11,000. Anyone 
who has ever been to the SFGH pharmacy 
knows that most of its customers would 
consider themselves blessed to have a net 
worth (financially speaking, of course, 
since “net worth” does not equal “worth”) 
of more than a few hundred dollars. 

The reason so many of our impover¬ 
ished neighbors are donating chunks of 
their income to SFGH is, ostensibly, to 
close a budgetary gap. But it (again) seems 
obvious that the current aversion to what 
Big Money calls “soaking the rich” for the 
money necessary to run our society, has 
ensured that it is the poor who are getting 
soaked - and then hung out to dry. 

When a billionaire coughs up a pittance 
that he will never need, that’s a front page 
story. But Time magazine isn’t likely to 
laud each case of poor San Franciscans giv¬ 
ing the city money that they would other¬ 
wise use for luxuries like a Muni ride 
home. Pity, since each instance is a more 
compelling story, and more trenchant. 
This is a perfect example, by the way, of 


why presidential candidate Steve Forbes is 
wrong when he says “flat taxation” is fair. 
For his system to work, every service of¬ 
fered by the government would have to be 
based on a percentage of the recipient’s 
wealth. If a stamp costs a poor person, for 
instance, one one-hundredth of a 
day’s wage, it would be fair to 
charge Gates the same rate. Not 
the same price, the same percent- , 
age. That’s the way to make 
Forbes’s idea truly fair, but of 
course it’s also likely to lose his 
supporters - the very people who con¬ 
sider it “being soaked” to pay their fair 
share of rent on America. 

While we’re discussing 
presidential wannabes, it’s 
worth reiterating our con¬ 
cerns about George W. Bush, the son of the 
erstwhile president. His recent comments 
about hate crimes and gay adoptions have 
confirmed our fears about him. The man 
either has faulty judgment or a deep, deep 


mean streak. In either case, he’s not anyone 
we would want to see running this coun¬ 
try and making decisions that affect the 
lives of millions of hardworking gay and 
lesbian Americans. 

(But, before anyone accuses us of being 
too dismissive of the right-hand side of the 
legislative aisle, we urge them to read 
our new columnist, Dale Carpenter, 
on page 11. He expresses the view of 
a gay Republican, which is illustra¬ 
tive even when it fails to convince us. 
We hope you enjoy reading it, too. 
Rail against what he says if you must, 
x but remember: it’s better to know 
what’s going on the minds of 
the GOP than to not know.) 

Finally, since we’re on the 
subject of elections, we hope 
everyone will take advantage of this year’s 
unprecedented opportunity to vote for the 
Pride Parade marshals. It’s your celebra¬ 
tion. Don’t waste your chance to be more 
involved than ever before. ▼ 




Week of pride in city of love 


by Malcolm Lazin, 
co-chair/founder of PrideFest 
America 


^|p he gay and lesbian civil rights move¬ 
ment is coming of age. And PrideFest 
ll America, to be held in Philadelphia 
from April 26 through May 2, illustrates 
how much we’ve matured. 

The nation’s largest annual gay and les¬ 
bian symposium and festival, PrideFest ’99 
will bring together 17 national and 47 re¬ 
gional organizations plus major cultural in¬ 
stitutions for a week of serious debate and 
analysis on subjects ranging from the work¬ 
place and the media to religion and the arts. 
A discussion of this magnitude would not 
have been possible 10 years ago. More than 
half of the 64 organizations participating 
did not even exist then! 

Included in the programming is a Na¬ 
tional Teen Panel; National Gay and Lesbian 
Leaders Symposium, in collaboration with 
National Public Radio; Gays and the Holo¬ 
caust, in collaboration with the U.S. Holo¬ 
caust Memorial Museum; the Tom Stod¬ 
dard National Role Model Award; the Inter¬ 
national Arts Award, in collaboration with 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the 
National Workplace Symposium, in collab¬ 
oration with Human Rights Campaign, Out 
for Business, and the University of Pennsyl¬ 
vania’s Wharton School, a daylong program 
at which IBM will be honored with Pride¬ 
Fest America’s Business Leadership Award. 

PrideFest originated in 1993 as a region¬ 
al event to highlight the organizations that 
serve us; to attack pernicious stereotypes by 
demonstrating the reality of our communi¬ 


ty; and to undermine homophobia by pre¬ 
senting role models. PrideFest America, 
while continuing to embrace those goals, 
has also become the national venue for a 
civil rights movement, in all of its compo¬ 
nent parts, to come together annually to ex¬ 
amine where we’ve been, where we are, and 
where we need to go. 

And while pride parades are still impor¬ 
tant, we need to move beyond that, as 
Jews, African-Americans, and femi¬ 
nists have done. The African-Ameri¬ 
can civil rights movement learned 
that while “black is beautiful” is im¬ 
portant, a community needs to 
look inward and examine the sub¬ 
stantive basis for pride and the rea¬ 
sons that African-Americans de¬ 
served respect. The same 
is true of the gay and les¬ 
bian civil rights move¬ 
ment, and the proof for 
that is reflected by the panoply of PrideFest 
America. 

Since Stonewall, we have grown in re¬ 
markable communal and organizational 
strength. Just look at the organizations that 
now serve and reflect us - 64 of them at 
PrideFest America. 

Examine our National Authors Panel 
with this year’s panelists of Patricia Nell 
Warren, Edmund White, and Andrew Sulli¬ 
van. Ten years ago, such an event would 
have been virtually unthinkable because 
there was so little “out” and quality work. 
Can you imagine trying to present a pro¬ 
gram about gay life 10 years ago? And yet 
today, as is reflected in our National Film 
Panel, there is an explosion of gay and les¬ 
bian cinematic artistic expression. 


We have a National History Project. This 
year we are honoring Barbara Gittings, who 
in my humble opinion is our Rosa Parks. 
We are honoring her at and in collaboration 
with The Free Library of Philadelphia, the 
nation’s first public library. We pay tribute 
to her because 30 years ago there was virtu¬ 
ally nothing about us in the card catalogs of 
this nation. Barbara, as a non-librarian, led 
the charge at the annual meeting of the 
American Library Association. That led to a 
study group. And today our nation’s li¬ 
braries are enriched with information by 
and about us. William Gordon, 
executive director of the Ameri¬ 
can Library Association, will pay 
tribute to Gittings. In this pro¬ 
gram, we see more than any 
pride parade can ever 
demonstrate. We see our 
history. We learn that we 
stand on the shoulders of 
others. We recognize the cost of invisibility. 
And we learn through this role model that 
one person can make a difference and that 
difference can be profound. 

We invite you to PrideFest America be¬ 
cause through this extraordinary seven-day 
substantive celebration, you will learn more 
about our community and yourself. In the 
process you will feel the yearlong real pride 
in being blessed as a gay and lesbian living 
during and (we hope) actively participating 
in our long sought dream of respected 
human dignity. T

8 April 1999 BAY AREA REPORTER 7 



The irony of satire 

I have been reading with great interest about the 
Archdiocese of San Francisco and the Sisters of Per¬ 
petual Indulgence. Maurice Healy, spokesperson for 
the Archdiocese, is positioning the church somewhere 
just right of Jerry Falwell in his holy war against the 
Sisters. It appears that the right wing of the church 
continues to push for erasing the division between it¬ 
self and the state. The irony is that the Sisters may be 
better than the church at communicating Jesus’s 
teachings of tolerance, compassion, service, and love. 
The church’s menacing tone sounds not only homo- 
phobic, but borders on hateful. 

The satirical Sisters do have a reputation for guer¬ 
rilla street theater - they follow in the legacy of the 
San Francisco Mime Troupe. Yet my progressive 
Catholic friends embrace the Sisters because beneath 
the ribald humor they share the same mission. 

The right wing of the church, as represented by 
Mr. Healy and Archbishop William Levada, does not 
speak for all Catholics, all Christians, or indeed Amer¬ 
icans of differing spiritual persuasions. The an¬ 
nouncement that the Catholic League is boycotting 
San Francisco will not negatively impact the econo¬ 
my. After all, San Francisco is not on the top of the 
“must see list” for most bigots and homophobes. This 
boycott and the other political activities of the church 
also remind us that they may no longer be entitled to 
their tax-exempt status. 

Occasionally, the Sisters’ ribald humor may offend 
- but so did Lenny Bruce’s. However, I find 
Mr. Healy and Archbishop Levada’s at¬ 
tempts to twist the truth and to trivialize 
the profound suffering of Jewish people 
(by declaring this group of street per¬ 
formers akin to “neo-nazis”) far more of¬ 
fensive. (Did they forget that lying was 
a sin?) The church did not come to the 
aid of homosexuals as they were sent to 
their deaths in the Nazi camps. Long be¬ 
fore the Catholic Church was pressured to put its im¬ 
mense resources to help people with AIDS, the Sisters, 
who were mostly poor, were trying to educate the pub¬ 
lic about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and 
raise money for AIDS charities. 

When the Catholic Church aligns itself with the 
extreme right wing of the political spectrum they 
make themselves less relevant as spiritual leaders. 
Jesus’s work would be truly extended if Archbishop 
Levada and Maurice Healy attended Castro Street on 
Easter Sunday and prayed with the Sisters instead of 
trying to ban them. You can bet the Sisters will be 
praying for Archbishop Levada and Maurice Healy.

l-G-N-O-R-A-N-C-E 

One evening recently I had a telephone call from a 
Catholic nun who I happen to be well acquainted 
with. She had two questions regarding the Sisters of 
Perpetual Indulgence to ask the gay community. First 
question - Why do the “Sisters” think it is amusing to 
publicly insult and hurt a group of women who have 
supported their causes, probably, more than any other 
religious group? 

My answer is that the Sisters are obviously igno¬ 
rant of the sacrifices that Catholic nuns make in order 
to help the sick and poor throughout the world. It is 
that kind of ignorance we often find when religious 
fanatics discuss homosexuality. It is the ignorance 
that leads to intolerance and violence. 

The second question - Why haven’t more 
thoughtful and sensitive men and women in the gay 
community spoken out against the Sisters’ ridiculous 
and unkind behavior? Their struggle for acceptance 
in society is not helped by the Sisters’ vulgar, arrogant, 
and insensitive spectacle now in its 20th year. 

I’ll answer the second question based on personal 
feelings. I have not ever found the Sisters of Perpetu¬ 
al Indulgence to be amusing. Many people do, so it 
was just easier to “go with the flow” and not think 
about who might be hurt. Also, they do in fact raise 
money for good causes. Does the gay community 
need this method to raise money? Certainly not! 
What about political correctness? Shouldn’t it apply 
to a relatively small and vulnerable group of women 
as well as to larger racial and ethnic groups? Very def¬ 
initely, yes! 

So, dear Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, no one 
expects you to behave like grown men. Can’t you just 
show some R-E-S-P-E-C-T? 

As for San Francisco’s mayor and board of super¬ 
visors, allowing and condoning the mockery of good 
people and their religious beliefs in public places re¬ 
flects very badly on the city’s reputation for love and 
tolerance. 

John A. Triglia 
Santa Rosa, CA 

[We have to wonder, considering your obvious igno¬ 
rance of the Sisters, why she asked you. May we ask, 
since you say the community “certainly ” doesn't need to 
raise hundreds of thousands of dollars the way the Sis¬ 
ters do, how much you’ve raised in your respectful way?] 


Holy weakness 

As an active member of the Archdiocese of San 
Francisco I am curious as to whether Archbishop Lev¬ 
ada is going to allow William Donohue and his 
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights to be 
the official spokesperson for the archbishop, or will 
the archbishop clarify that in fact the organization has 
nothing to do and is not affiliated with the archdio¬ 
cese? 

The ad that ran in the March 29 Chronicle was so 
inflammatory I fear that if the archbishop remains 
silent he may well have to take responsibility for vio¬ 
lence that could very well be directed towards mem¬ 
bers of his diocese. By remaining silent, he could in 
fact encourage acts of violence similar to those di¬ 
rected towards Matthew Shepard, Joel Gerhart, and 
Brian Wilmes. 

In this season of Holy Week it seems more neces¬ 
sary than ever for the archbishop to speak out on be¬ 
half of love, compassion and understanding for all, 
and to condemn the preaching of hate in the name of 
the Catholic Church.

Skirt the issue 

While we here had to deal with the controversy re¬ 
garding the Sister of Perpetual Indulgence and the 
Catholic Church the Vatican had its own small con¬ 
tretemps. It seems a drag queen (and founder 
of Wigstock) named Lady Bunny attempt- 
f ed to tour the Vatican in a tasteful but 
chaste zebra-print cocktail frock, garner¬ 
ing a lot of attention, and when the Swiss 
Guard found out who and what it was she 
was firmly ejected. Obviously the basic 
problem the church has is that it does 
not approve of men wearing long dress¬ 
es in sumptuous fabrics. Oh - except of 
course bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the occa¬ 
sional pope.

Weapons of mass distraction 

Regarding the brouhaha surrounding the Easter 
Sunday party hosted by the Sisters of Perpetual In¬ 
dulgence of San Francisco, I say party on! No one 
group owns the rights to a particular festival nor a 
street, even the Roman Catholic hierarchy in San 
Francisco. For administrators of the church, defense 
weapons like aggression, violence, and excommuni¬ 
cation have been successfully used to stop groups 
from disagreeing in the past. However, to be “credi¬ 
ble” today, the church must get real about its own 
checkered history, especially regarding its treatment 
of any dissenting group. According to Pope John Paul 
II, gays and lesbians are subhuman and can only be 
worthy of grace if they have no intimate life with an¬ 
other human being. Pope John Paul II seems to un¬ 
derstand little about the nature of human beings or 
their sexual diversity. He definitely dislikes being chal¬ 
lenged or educated. Through the centuries, there have 
been many teachable moments where the church 
could have grown but chose not to: issues of clergy 
pedophilia, its own status as an entity filled with gay 
clergy yet rampant homophobia, its catastrophic poli¬ 
cies on reproduction and the realities of overpopula¬ 
tion, its role in the genocide of native peoples in the 
Americas, its role in the Crusades, its second-class 
treatment of women and its extermination of heretics 
during the Inquisition. In the discussion regarding 
San Francisco church officials comparing the Sisters 
of Perpetual Indulgence to Nazis, no one mentioned 
that the then pope, Pius XII, said and did nothing 
during the extermination of six million Jews, Gypsies, 
disabled, Jehovah’s Witnesses and homosexuals. 
Those outraged Catholics who scream “Catholic¬ 
bashing” at the first sign of criticism must realize that 
the church’s more culpable actions in the past and 
present are based on historical events and are not per¬ 
sonal attacks. Feelings of victimization overcome the 
potential for a more honest debate and real spiritual 
growth. Although there are millions of excellent 
Catholics, clergy and nuns who selflessly perform acts 
of mercy as Christ taught, the governing body is sadly 
leading the modern Church to irrelevancy, ridicule 
and in a few centuries, to a few pages in history books.

‘Son of Nun’ one of fun? 

Biblical scholars have observed that the Bible was 
not written to reveal-anything but to conceal things. 
One item I uncovered recently was that the name 
“Joshua, son of Nun” was, almost certainly, a eu¬ 
phemism that can be translated as “Joshua, the fag¬ 
got.” 

If the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence want to call 
themselves “nuns” they have priority.

No cutting! 

The lesbian and gay community knows very well 
the importance of choice when it comes to control¬ 
ling our bodies, particularly when such choices affect 
our health and sexuality. That’s why we were gratified 
to see the B.A.R.'s report that the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) no longer condones infant cir¬ 
cumcision. [“Academy of pediatrics no longer recom¬ 
mends circumcision ,” March 11.] 

The most shameful part of the new AAP policy, 
however, is its promotion of the idea that “parents 
discuss the subject with their pediatrician and make 
an informed choice.” Any “choice” about surgically al¬ 
tering a person’s genitals when there is no medical 
need should remain with the individual. Because in¬ 
fants are too young to choose, parents should not be 
permitted to usurp the child’s fundamental rights to 
bodily integrity and eventual self-determination. 

Social customs that involve genital cutting of un¬ 
consenting male, female, and intersex children are the 
very first attack on our sexuality. They deserve closer 
scrutiny by and a more prominent place in the agen¬ 
da of the lesbian/gay movement.

No Victorian 

In the letter from Reid Condit (“Housing, boink- 
ing, and community,” B.A.R. March 4, 1999) Mr. 
Condit refers to a “Victorian bathhouse such as has 
existed for years in downtown Portland, Oregon. A 
few friends and I are still trying to figure just what he 
is referring to. The couple we have downtown are 
anything but “Victorian.” Old perhaps, Victorian no! 

If we are missing something, we’d like to know.

No smoking! 

I read with absolute horror the letter written con¬ 
cerning the smoking in bars on Polk Street by Josie R. 
Lynn [“Ventilation, not legislation,” March 11]. Par¬ 
ticularly the erroneous statements that the exhaust 
from automobiles is more deadly than secondhand 
smoke, and that people that smoke live as long as peo¬ 
ple who do not smoke. I am in the health profession 
and it is a proven fact that service workers (both 
smokers and non-smokers) have a higher rate of lung 
cancer and other respiratory diseases than other pro¬ 
fessions. This is a direct result due to exposure to sec¬ 
ond hand smoke. 

As a non-smoker I resent the arrogance of smok¬ 
ers who feel that because I wish to drink in bars that 
in turn I must be subjected to breathing air filled with 
smoke pollutants. Bottom line, people - as of Janu¬ 
ary 1997 it is against the law to smoke in bars. And 
the fact that Wayne Friday (a member of the police 
commission) is openly complaining that police are at¬ 
tempting to enforce this law is unbelievable. One 
wonders what the next law will be that Mr. Friday ad¬ 
vises the police to ignore! 

I am a gay man and I frequent the gays bars on 
Polk Street. And it is a sad statement of fact that the 
bars on Castro Street are trying to provide a smoke- 
free environment while the bars on Polk Street fla¬ 
grantly violate the no smoking law. 

Some bars like the Giraffe Video Lounge have gone 
to great expense to provide a room for smokers to use 
- and yet the bartenders actually encourage their pa¬ 
trons not to use this room, and to continue to smoke 
in the main bar. Two bartenders in particular fla¬ 
grantly continue to smoke behind the bar themselves, 
and then sarcastically tell their customers that smok¬ 
ing is against the law. All of this occurs while they’re 
putting ashtrays out on the bar for their customers to 
use - completely ignoring the law. And this scene is 
repeated in practically every bar on Polk Street - the 
QT, Reflections, The White Swallow, etc. 

Again, I repeat myself - it’s against the law to 
smoke in bars. Please cooperate and be considerate of 
your fellow gay brothers and sisters. Let’s all try to live 
complete, healthy lives - if you want to continue to 
smoke that is your choice, but don’t make others pay 
for that choice by poisoning the air that they breathe.

No comparison 

In regards to your comparison of the two Mr. 
Marcuses [Out There, March 18]: Allow me to say that 
it is possible to love them both, albeit for different rea¬ 
sons. Luke Ford may be wrong about a lot of things, 
and quite possibly the alter ego of Matt Drudge, but 
straight porn star, Mr. Marcus, is all that he says he is 
and more. Please sign me: 

A fan.

No ‘queers’ 

When leaders of the gay movement refer to our 
community as “queers,” it is harmful. Attempts to take 
the sting away from this word, which has been used'to 
put down gay people for decades, only serves to un¬ 
dermine our struggle to be treated with the dignity 
and respect we deserve and demand. After many years 
and a great deal of lobbying, gay has become univer¬ 
sally accepted. “Queer” is an awkward and demean¬ 
ing alternative to define our community. 

I do not want to see the New York Times writing 
about the “queer” community, nor do I want to see 
President Clinton praising his “queer” nominee for 
ambassador to Luxembourg. 

As gay people, we constantly face powerful right 
wing forces that are working to undermine our self- 
respect. Referring to ourselves as “queers” confuses 
our straight supporters, and plays right into the hands 
of those who want to keep gays on the margins of so¬ 
ciety. Worst of all, this label, defined as strange, sus¬ 
picious, or ludicrous, reinforces the negative identity 
that many of us work hard to overcome after first re¬ 
alizing our sexual orientation. 

As a young activist in the 1970s, one of the first gay 
rights slogans I learned was “gay is good.” It still is. 

Marc Paige 
Cranston, Rl 

No shouting! 

Many in the queer community believe that those 
who commit brutal anti-gay murders should receive 
the death penalty, for a variety of reasons (justice, de¬ 
terrent effect, etc.). Of course, this opinion is both 
valid and understandable. Others, such as myself, op¬ 
pose the death penalty under all circumstances, and 
would strongly argue that putting murderers to death 
is not the way to attribute value to a murder victim’s 
life. Of course, this opinion is equally valid. 

It would seem that a debate on this subject, with 
both sides holding respect for those who disagree 
with them, is in order. However, Janice Van Cleve 
[“No more marching to Auschwitz,” Mailstrom, March 
25] seems uninterested in a civilized and intelligent 
discussion. Apparently, she would rather make per¬ 
sonal attacks against those of us who oppose the 
death penalty, painting us as “liberal” (to use her out¬ 
dated, meaningless term) and elitist, and strongly im¬ 
plying that we don’t care as much about these out¬ 
rages as she does. That’s simply not the case. We are 
no less appalled than she is, and we demand justice 
no less strongly. We simply don’t believe the death 
penalty is justified under any circumstances. 

Van Cleve needs to learn that she does her side no 
favors by throwing around hot-button phrases (“sac¬ 
rifice our people,” “marching dutifully to Auschwitz”) 
and ad hominem attacks. Such arguing techniques are 
a sure sign that the person arguing has no facts or 
ideas behind their opinions, just emotion. Maybe 
she’d like to try again, and explain calmly and re¬ 
spectfully why she thinks that the death penalty does 
queers or anyone else any good. Then I or another 
death penalty opponent could respond to her, and we 
could have an intelligent discussion instead of a 
shouting match. 

Steve 0mlid 
San Francisco 

No Klaas 

Janice Van Cleve is entitled to her medieval views 
on the death penalty but she has a hell of a nerve pro¬ 
moting Hitler analogies. Nazi Germany had the death 
penalty and it was enforced big time. When the right 
wing took back Nicaragua they tried to undo the San- 
dinistas abolition of the death penalty and bring back 
anti-gay legislation. 

Every repressive state in the world has also had the 
death penalty along with anti-abortion, anti-gay, etc., 
laws. Take a look at the places that have abolished the 
death penalty, such as England, Sweden, Holland, 
France, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Costa Rica, etc., 
and then look at the backwaters that have it such as 
Singapore, Cambodia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Ser¬ 
bia, the United States, ad nauseam. 

.1 realize the strong emotional feelings by many in 
favor of the death penalty but those who oppose it in 
principle have to be consistent. Otherwise we’ll be like 
Marc Klaas, a nice cocktail party liberal I once shared 
the same employer with. Marc was “opposed” to the 
death penalty until the issue hit his life. You either 
think the state has a right to kill someone in cold 
blood or you don’t. But don’t accuse those of us who 
don’t, of marching to Auschwitz. It’s much easier to 
make a case that the opposite is true.

[So when people change their opinions about, say, 
homosexuality because they know someone gay, that's 
good; when people change their minds about increased 
AIDS funding because they know someone with AIDS, 
that's good; but when people change their opinions 
about murderers because they know someone who's 
been murdered, that's bad. Is that right?]

Rookie supe’s outburst 
earns her brickbats 


by Wayne Friday 


ou> Mr. P res *dent, are not 
president of just one seg- 
II ment of this community. You 
had an opportunity to bring peo¬ 
ple together on this issue; where 
was your leadership?” That was 
rookie Supervisor Alicia Becerril, 
appointed to her seat on the 11- 
member city legislative body just 



Supervisor Alicia Becerril 


over two months ago, giving 
Board President Tom Ammiano a 
public tongue-lashing at a packed 
meeting of the supervisors last 
week. Her outburst was apparent¬ 
ly prompted because she disap¬ 
proved of the way he handled the 
controversial street closing last 
Sunday of a single block of Castro 
Street for a 20th anniversary cele¬ 
bration by the Sisters of Perpetual 
Irrelevance ... err, Indulgence. 

Becerril, who few ever heard of 
before her appointment to the 
board a couple of months ago 
(and few will likely hear of again 
after next year’s district elections) 
giving Ammiano a lesson on 
’’leadership?” Where I come from, 
taking a position on an issue and 
stayin’ with it despite opposition 
organized by the powerful arch¬ 
diocese of the city (as Ammiano 
did) says a hell of a lot more about 
“leadership” than Becerril’s ap¬ 
proach of first voting for the street 
closure and then flip-flopping two 
weeks later (after she got the po¬ 
litical bejesus scared out of her by 
a few dozen phone calls from 
those within her faith, apparently 
complaining that she would sup¬ 
port such a plan in the first place.) 

You, Supervisor Becerril, have 
no space preaching to anyone 
about what does or does not con¬ 
stitute “leadership.” I went to two 
political type house parties over 
the weekend (in addition to the 
Sisters’ birthday party on Castro; 
more on that subject later) and if 
I heard it once I heard the ques¬ 
tion a dozen times: Who does Be¬ 
cerril, with two months on the 
board, think she is? 

Incidentally, Becerril, who is an 
attorney, told reporters after her 
tirade that “I like to respect peo¬ 
ple, and, if I don’t” - and she ob¬ 
viously holds little for Ammiano 
-“I have a hard time showing it.” 
Perhaps the Examiner put it best 
when it headlined a front-page 
story on her outburst last week 
with “Becerril returns public nas¬ 
tiness to City Hall.” Now we know 
who will be the heir to Quentin 
Kopp, the last purveyor of “public 
nastiness” on the board of supes. 

As for Ammiano, well, he 
mostly shrugged and said “I un¬ 
derstand your frustration and 
your need to lash out” - after all, 
he used to be a teacher and is 
probably used to childish out¬ 
bursts - “and I offer you an olive 


branch.” Most people would 
probably agree that Ammiano’s 
response was an example of 
“leadership,” something the rook¬ 
ie supervisor apparently has 
much to learn about. 

No question on one thing, 
however. Whether they agreed 
with Ammiano’s position on the 
overblown Sisters controversy or 
not, his detractors on the board 
agreed with those who count him 
as an ally: the angry outburst from 
the newest appointed member was 
way out of line. As one well- 
known city official put it 
Sunday, “All she gained 
for herself was a guaran¬ 
tee that a serious oppo¬ 
nent will surely emerge 
when she tries to keep 
her job next year.” 

As I said, I did at¬ 
tend the Sis¬ 
ters’ Castro 
Street celebra¬ 
tion on Sun¬ 
day. To say I never was a fan of the 
Sisters and their antics is an un¬ 
derstatement, but Sunday really 
wasn’t about them and their silly, 
self-promoting, sometimes em¬ 
barrassing “theatre” (sic). Sunday, 
was, in my mind at least, about 
First Amendment rights, and I 
wasn’t going to let right wing, gay- 
hating Archbishop William Leva¬ 
da (whom most Portland resi¬ 
dents were happy to see leave that 
city) keep me away no matter how 
offensive some parts of it might 
have been. Most of the city’s gay 
community has probably seen 
enough of the Sisters of Perpetual 
Irrelevance (20 years is a long time 
of these campy drags in nun’s 
habits) and have grown tired of 
the act, but it was not the Sisters 
who made the celebration: it was 
the Catholic Church, the Arch¬ 
bishop, and the church newspaper, 
Catholic San Francisco. 

One last note on the subject: 
Supervisor Mark Leno easily 
bested that anti-gay representa¬ 
tive from the Catholic Church on 
last Thursday’s nationally-tele¬ 
vised NBC Today show. In fact, 
Leno looked every bit as good as 
the handsome Matt Lauer, who 
interviewed him. 

Politics and people 

East Bay Dems are Green with 
envy. It’s pretty clear that former 
Oakland mayor Elihu (Eli Who?) 
Harris should have been attending 
to some would-be constituents in 
the East Bay’s 16th Assembly Dis¬ 
trict, instead of hiring an office 
staff in Sacramento and arranging 
committee assignments, those few 
days before the election. Green 
Party activist Audie Bock spent 
only $34,000 and won that seat, 
while the well-known Democrat 
Harris dropped more than 
$500,000 and had the official 
backing of the state party machin¬ 
ery. The 16th District covers most 
of Oakland, is 65 percent Democ¬ 
ratic, and has always sent a Demo¬ 
crat to Sacramento. Party mem¬ 
bers across the state are still 
scratching their heads trying to 
figure out how a man who just 
completed eight years as Oakland’s 
mayor, after being the assembly- 
man from that very district for a 
dozen years, blew it so badly. No 
question: the election of the un¬ 
known, minor party candidate 
over the machine Democrat was a 
clear referendum on Harris, who 
was a totally unproductive mayor 
for the past eight years and then an 


arrogant candidate who seemed to 
believe all he needed was the bless¬ 
ing of his party. Now, with Jerry 
Brown as mayor and Bock as as¬ 
semblywoman, things should get 
pretty interesting in Oakland very 
soon. (Incidentally, Claude Ever¬ 
hart shouldn’t be expecting too 
many young, energetic political 
hopefuls to be beating a path to his 
door for a long time - unless per¬ 
haps they want to learn how not to 
run a political campaign.). 

Some at San Francisco City 
Hall are saying that Har¬ 
ris’s embarrassing de¬ 
feat last week, and the 
complete collapse of 
the Democratic ma¬ 
chine there, could 
spell trouble for 
Mayor Willie Brown. 
His Honor was one of 
those who 
talked Harris 
into running 
for the Assem¬ 
bly again, but I doubt he’s losing 
much sleep over it. Harris’s unex¬ 
pected loss, incidentally, means 
there are no African-Americans 
from Northern California in the 
Legislature. 

South Bay Democrats are 
working hard to get Assembly¬ 
woman Elaine Alquist (Santa 
Clara) to run as their candidate 
against incumbent Representative 
Tom Campbell, a onetime mod¬ 
erate Republican who was among 
those voting to impeach President 
Bill Clinton. 

First Governor Gray Davis 
appointed Jeremy Hallisey to 

run the S.F. governor’s office; last 
week Davis appointed his father, 
prominent San Francisco attor¬ 
ney Jeremiah Hallisey, to the 
powerful California Transporta¬ 
tion Commission. The elder Mr. 
Hallisey, long a power in Democ¬ 
ratic party politics, has served as 
a University of California regent 
and California State University 
trustee; he was co-chair of Gover¬ 
nor-elect Davis’s transition team. 

New York’s Reverend AI 
Sharpton, the controversial civil 
rights and political activist, will 
be in San Francisco April 18 and 
will speak at the 10:30 a.m. ser¬ 
vice at the Macedonia Missionary 
Baptist Church (2135 Sutter 
Street; 346-1154 for info). 

National Republicans are re¬ 
portedly worried sick that former 
Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke 
could actually win their party’s 
nomination in that crowded May 1 
special election in the Louisiana 
First Congressional District; Duke 
already has the endorsement of the 
racist Council of Conservative Cit¬ 
izens (the group that Senate Ma¬ 
jority Leader Trent Lott and Geor¬ 
gia Representative Bob Barr - both 
Republicans - have addressed). 
Maybe a little help from the rest of 
the GOP White Boys Club could 
help put the racist Duke over the 
top in the GOP district, and let’s see 
how George W. Bush runs with 
that guy in the 2000 elections. 

Our Quote of the Week is from 
state Senator John Burton, whom 
Supe Becerril says told her to “do 
whatever you want from the gut” 
when expressing yourself after her 
recent appointment, as her reason 
for shooting her mouth off board 
President Ammiano. Burton said, 
"That’s the advice I give everyone 
- go with your gut - but that does¬ 
n’t mean you take a dump in the 
middle of the board of supervisors 
meeting.” ▼

T he first international meeting of Amnesty International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender 
(LGBT) human rights activists was held in London March 26-29. In all, 47 activists from 25 differ¬

Delegates broke into spontaneous applause on the arrival of the Albanian representative who succeeded in 
attending, despite the war in Kosovo and interruption in Balkan travel, by making a 1000-miie detour.

Women’s wear gaily 


by David Bianco 


This month in gay history: Rudi 
Gernreich, co-founder of the Mat- 
tachine Society and designer of 
the topless bathing suit, dies in 
Los Angeles, April 21, 1985. 

R udi Gernreich secured a 
place for himself in fashion 
history as the designer of 
one of the most controversial 
pieces of women’s wear, the top¬ 
less bathing suit. But in gay histo¬ 
ry books he’ll also be remembered 
as a co-founder of the Mattachine 
Society, the early gay rights orga¬ 
nization. 

Born in Vienna in 1922, 
Gernreich showed early 
artistic talent. He was in¬ 
troduced to fashion design 
by his aunt, who owned a 
dress shop where Gernreich 
spent many hours after school 
sketching clothes and 
learning about fabric. 

When he was 12, a 
designer saw his 
sketches and offered 
him an apprenticeship in London, 
but his mother vetoed the move. 

In 1938, Gernreich and his 
mother left Austria, along with 
thousands of other Jews fleeing 
Hitler. The Gernreichs had friends 
in Los Angeles and decided to set¬ 
tle there. Living near Hollywood 
was a dream come true for the 
teenage boy. “I’d seen movies and 
read American magazines and 
suddenly I was there!” Gernreich 
later said. Gernreich quickly be¬ 
came fluent in English and even¬ 
tually spoke it without a trace of 
accent. In 1943, he obtained 
American citizenship. 

Gernreich put himself through 
art school by running errands for 
various advertising agencies. After 
graduation, his first job was as a

costume sketch artist for lesbian 
designer Edith Head at RKO Stu¬ 
dios, but he “hated every minute.” 
A dance performance by Martha 
Graham inspired him to make a 
career shift, and he joined the 
Lester Horton Dance Troupe. 
Dance, he later observed, influ¬ 
enced his fashion designs: “[It] 
made me aware of what clothes 
do to the rest of the body - to the 
hands and feet and head.” 

By the late 1940s, Gernreich 
recognized his limited dancing 
talent and returned to designing. 
Some of his first designs were cos¬ 
tumes for his former dance 
troupe. At the Horton Studio in 
1950, he met Harry Hay, whose 
young daughter took dance 
classes there. Hay later re¬ 
called that Gernreich stared 
at him from across the stu¬ 
dio. They made a date for 
dinner, and “we fell 
madly in love, of course,” 
Hay later recalled. 
Gernreich had had 
only had short flings 
with men before 
Hay. Because the de¬ 
signer still lived with his mother 
and Hay was married, they car¬ 
ried on their romance at hotels 
and in friends’ apartments. 

Hay, a Communist organizer, 
had written a prospectus for a ho¬ 
mosexual rights group and was 
looking for people to help him 
start it. He showed the plan to 
Gernreich, who told him, “This is 
the most dangerous thing I have 
ever read - and I’m with you 100 
percent.” 

Together with two other men, 
Hay and Gernreich started the 
Mattachine Society, the first long¬ 
standing gay rights organization. 
They distributed flyers at gay bars 
and in the gay areas of beaches, 
trying to recruit members. Meet¬ 
ings were held in secret at mem¬ 
bers’ homes. “The whole group 
was fearful,” Martin Block, an 
early member, said, “although I 
think Rudi was more so ... be¬ 
cause he was an immigrant.” 

Gernreich and Hay had been 
lovers for a year when Gernreich 
temporarily moved to New York 
for a design opportunity. The dis¬ 
tance hurt their relationship, and 
when Gernreich returned to Cali¬ 
fornia, the two broke up. Hay 
speculated that Gernreich’s career 
ambitions clashed too much with 
Hay’s consuming gay political 
work. Gernreich left the Matta¬ 
chine, and Hay honored the 
group’s secrecy pledge by keeping 


mum about Gernreich’s involve¬ 
ment until after the designer’s 
death. 

Gernreich’s career soon soared 
with a line of simple, comfortable 
women’s clothing. In 1952, his 
“nothing-inside-but-you” bathing 
suit (without a molded, built-in 
bra) was both controversial and 
sought after. It was only a short 
step to the fashion item that made 
him famous. In an interview in 
1962 in Women’s Wear Daily , 
Gernreich observed that some 
women on the Riviera wore only 
bikini bottoms. Soon topless 
bathing suits would be the rage, 
he said. WWD printed his predic¬ 
tion, and, concerned that another 
designer would scoop him, Gern¬ 
reich produced the topless suit 
himself. Photographs of the first 
topless bathing suit, modeled 
from behind, appeared in Look 
magazine in June 1964 and 
launched Gernreich into 
overnight celebrity. 

Gernreich’s design was de¬ 
nounced by everyone from the 
Vatican to the Kremlin. In St. 
Tropez, officials warned that 
wearing the suit would bring 
“legal repercussions,” and heli¬ 
copters patrolled the beaches for 
offenders. Many stores refused to 
carry the suit, but a total of 3,000 
topless suits were sold by rep¬ 
utable establishments like B. Alt¬ 
man and Lord 8c Taylor. 

The uproar over the topless 
bathing suit overshadowed Gern¬ 
reich’s other designs, which in¬ 
cluded the first miniskirts. In 
1967, he was inducted into the 
Fashion Hall of Fame. Through¬ 
out his career, Gernreich contin¬ 
ued to shock the fashion world - 
he was the first to use models with 
shaved heads, for example - and 
to advocate for freedom in cloth¬ 
ing. 

Gernreich’s gay identity was 
not publicly revealed until his 
death from lung cancer in 1985. 
At that time the American Civil 
Liberties Union announced that 
Gernreich and his lover, Dr. 
Oreste Pucciani, had endowed a 
trust for litigation and education 
on lesbian and gay rights. ▼

A plea for 
political diversity 


by Dale Carpenter 


" ' he reaction of many gay left 

leaders to the emergence of 
H gay conservatives from the 
closet has been a mixture of mis¬ 
understanding (“They’re intoler¬ 
ant”), condescension (“They 
don’t understand social change”), 
bemusement (“They’re oxy¬ 
morons”), and pity or contempt 
(“They’re self-hating”). 

Gay conservatives have long 
lived in a double closet. Our gay 
friends shunned conservatives; 
our conservative friends shunned 
gays. We were anathema to both 
sides because we upset settled ex¬ 
pectations about what it means to 
be gay. We often found the pro¬ 
gay left and the anti-gay right in a 
curious alliance to shut us up. 

Left-wing activism has occu¬ 
pied the field of gay politics at 
least since Stonewall. The left has 
dominated the columns of gay 
newspapers and magazines, con¬ 
trolled the content of gay radio 
shows and public-access televi¬ 
sion programs, and monopolized 
the leadership of our political or¬ 
ganizations. To be gay has been to 
be left-wing. Of course, this 
stereotype of gay politics has al¬ 
ways been a lie, like the lie that we 
are all pedophiles or that we all 
have great taste in interior design. 
It’s easy to see why America be¬ 
lieved the lie. For far too long, the 
only people who were willing to 
advocate gay civil rights were self- 
styled progressives. 

But there have always been 
conservatives in our midst. The 
difference now is that we are com¬ 
ing out of the closet in large num¬ 
bers, thanks in part to the ad¬ 
vances in legal equality won al¬ 
most entirely by the gay left over 
the past 30 years. In a sense, the 
gay left has created a beast it can 
no longer control, a burgeoning 
movement of disparate elements 
and ideas. The “out” gay popula¬ 
tion today is more diverse, ideo¬ 
logically and otherwise, than ever 


before. That trend will accelerate. 

The political left, which has 
been preaching the value of diver¬ 
sity for some time, should wel¬ 
come this development. It is good 
for the whole movement. It is 
good “externally” because it 
erodes the uninformed straight 
American’s facile notion that gays 
are one-dimensional. Also, gay 
conservatives subvert prejudice in 
the very place it is breeding 
most hotly today: on the polit¬ 
ical right, and especially in 
the Republican Party. 

Our greater diversi¬ 
ty is also beneficial “in¬ 
ternally” because gay polit¬ 
ical dialogue will at last ring 
with a real clash of 
ideas and priorities. 

One test of the value 
of an idea is its power 
to get itself accepted in the mar¬ 
ketplace of ideas. The emergence 
of gay conservatives makes our 
“market” a more competitive one. 
Our decisions will be better be¬ 
cause they will be more fully in¬ 
formed. Further, we will finally be 
able to tap a huge reservoir of pre¬ 
viously unused energy, ideas, and 
talent: The movement will need 
those assets if it is truly to reach 
every corner of the nation. The old 
“progressive coalition,” by itself, 
will not get us to the next plateau. 

The price of admission to the 
gay civil rights movement should 
be that you are passionately com¬ 
mitted to legal and social equality 
for gays. It should not be that you 
must oppose the death penalty, or 
that you support higher taxes to 
pay for more social programs, or 
that you would love to see the 
Sandinistas run Nicaragua again, 
or that you subscribe to any other 
leftist cause. 

Most of all, gay conservatives 
can no longer be dismissed as 
oxymorons, or that old favorite, 
“self-hating.” We are too numer¬ 
ous, too self-confident, too com¬ 
mitted to gay legal and social 
equality, to be sent away with a 
wave of the hand. It is arrogance 


defined to equate an idea you 
think flawed with some deep- 
seated flaw (like “self-hatred”) in 
the person arguing for that idea. 
Gay conservatives have not fought 
out of one closet only to be 
shoved into another by a new 
breed of intolerance masquerad¬ 
ing as a defense of the traditional 
gay civil rights movement. 

The gay left must come to a 
painful realization: Liberalism is 
not another, as yet latent, 
component of the gay 
chromosome. You may 
be born with a sexual 
orientation; but the 
lessons of life and friends 
and education give you this or 
that political orienta¬ 
tion. Like straight 
Americans, we each 
learn those lessons 
differently, depending on the sig¬ 
nificance we extract from our ex¬ 
periences and the importance we 
place on the many contending 
and complex values that comprise 
a person’s view of the world. That 
we should all arrive at the same 
place is not likely or even desir¬ 
able; that we should respect each 
other as we work for real freedom 
is essential. 

The movement for gay civil 
rights has been sensitive to the need 
for every kind of diversity - race, 
sex, age, class, etc. - except one: po¬ 
litical diversity. The board of the 
leading gay civil rights organization 
in my home state of Texas, for ex¬ 
ample, has long had few or no Re¬ 
publicans. The same is true of the 
boards of many of our local, state, 
and national political organiza¬ 
tions. Those organizations will 
never represent the true diversity- 
and therefore the promise - of gay 
America until they do. ▼

|ps$ riday, April 2, 1 a.m., The 
Power Exchange, 74 Otis 
Street: The SFPD reports 
that a rowdy raucous broke out 
inside The Power Exchange dur¬ 
ing Friday’s Feast II party. Two 
suspects apparently broke out 
into a violent argument which re¬ 
sulted in one suspect pulling a 
knife from his pocket and bran¬ 
dishing it before the other sus¬ 
pect. The fight carried out onto 
adjacent Gough Street, involving 
several other partygoers who 
joined the brawl. An unidentified 
person called police from a pay 
phone and 14 SFPD squad cars 
appeared on the scene within 
minutes. As the throngs of police 
officers arrived, the brawl dis¬ 
persed and several individuals 
were reported running from the 
scene. However, the two main 
suspects were apprehended, 
handcuffed, and transported to 
the SFPD Southern Station. The 
knife was not found and the sus¬ 
pects were released due to lack of 
evidence. Police wish to inform 
the public that anyone seen run¬ 
ning from a crime scene is con¬ 
sidered a suspect and could be 
charged in such incidents. 

Tranny trashes hotel, 
boyfriend 

Friday, April 2, 12 a.m., near 
6th and Folsom streets: The man¬ 
agement at a South of Market res¬ 
idential hotel reports that the 
evening was interrupted by the 
sounds of screams and breaking 
glass. A transgendered resident, 
subsequently identified as the 
suspect, apparently discovered 
that her boyfriend had been two- 
timing her. The suspect beat the 


victim, trashed the room, and 
began hurling clothes, furniture, 
bottles, and various accessories 
from the fifth-floor window. As 
police arrived and exited their 
squad car, the officers had to 
dodge flying “bits and pieces and 
furniture,” according to the report 
made by SFPD. The victim chose 
not to press charges, but the sus¬ 
pect was transported to San Fran¬ 
cisco General Hospital because of 
an asthma attack that she suffered 
in the midst of her violent fit. 

Punch and a hug: $200 

Thursday, April 1, 2:30 a.m., 
2300 block of Market Street: 
While walking down the 
2300 block of Market 
Street, a man was ap¬ 
proached by a female 
who asked him “How 
are you doing?” Be¬ 
fore he had a chance 
to answer her, the 
woman punched 
him in the face and 
the victim fell to 
his knees on the 
sidewalk. A second female then 
wrapped her arms around him 
from behind in “a bear-hug fash¬ 
ion” while a third suspect, a male, 
snatched his wallet from his hack 
pocket. The wallet contained $200 
and a couple of credit cards. All 
three were last seen running east- 
bound on Market Street. The vic¬ 
tim staggered to Orphan Andy’s 
diner and called the police, but of¬ 
ficers were unsuccessful in finding 
the trio. The suspects were later 
described as an Asian female, 22 
years old, 5 feet 5 inches tall, 115 
pounds, wearing a green jacket; a 
black female, 22 years old, 5 feet 4 
inches tall, 110 pounds, wearing a 
dark blue sweatshirt and blue 
jeans; and an Hispanic male, 22 
years old, 5 feet 5 inches tall, 125 
pounds. If seen, the public is 


asked to contact the San Francisco 
Patrol Special Police at the num¬ 
bers listed below. 

Anti-government spy 
in the Castro 

Thursday, April 1, 4 a.m., 17th 
and Castro streets: Early Thursday 
morning a “noticeably crazed 
man” approached a customer of 
Orphan Andy’s diner who was 
standing outside the restaurant 
and subjected the victim to 
“screaming paranoid accusations 
and a physical attack,” according 
to the San Francisco Patrol Spe¬ 
cial Police. The suspect began 
yelling “You’re a government 
spy sent to kill me!” As 
the victim started to 
back away from the 
suspect, the scream¬ 
ing man grabbed 
him, pushed him to 
the ground, and 
forcibly sat on 
him while yelling 
for someone to 
call the police, as 
he wanted to 
make a citizen’s arrest on the vic¬ 
tim for being a spy against the 
U.S. government. Responding of¬ 
ficers arrested the suspect and 
charged him with assault. 

Poppin’ pills and 
gulping GHB 

Friday, April 3, 2:30 a.m., 9th 
and Folsom streets: A man was 
caught in a side alley possessing a 
small quantity of ecstasy and 
GHB, two popular party drugs. 
The suspect told officers that he 
had been “out partying” and had 
consumed both of the drugs at 
once. The remainder of the drugs 
in his possession were confiscated 
and the GHB was poured out 
onto the street. The man was cited 
for possessing controlled sub¬ 
stances and then released. 


Polk Street gays harassed 
at Polk Street gay bars 

Several Polk Street gay bars 
have reported to the SFPD the in¬ 
creasing occurrence of anti-gay 
language and insults being direct¬ 
ed at their gay clientele. One Polk 
bar reported that a patron at¬ 
tacked the bartender “because he 
is gay and because the clients of 
the club are gay,” according to the 
police report. Bartenders and 
bouncers in the area are advised 
to call the police at the first sign of 
a problem. Patrons are asked to 
call 911 in the event of a threaten¬ 
ing incident, and are warned to 
avoid escalating a potentially vio¬ 
lent situation by avoiding the 
threatening individual. 

Calling all johns 

There has been a total of 15 
men and women arrested on 
prostitution charges over the last 
week in the Polk and Tenderloin 
districts, and a total of 25 johns 
booked who will be required to 
attend a new “John School,” which 
is being hosted by the District At¬ 
torney’s office. Every john attend¬ 
ing the school will be required to 
pay a $500 fee to attend. Those 
who do not pay the fee and do not 
attend will be issued a warrant for 
their arrest. ▼

( A DISCUSSION ABOUT LIVE WORK. NO. 1 IN A SERIES } 


Lies that disappear 
like a fist when you 
open your hand. 



■W- •mrOWLONGIS THE SHELF LIFE OF A LIE? 
m ■ The San Francisco Residential Builders 

l m have recently been the subject of a bar- 

§ M rage of Bold Faced Lies in the altema- 

■ m tive media about new “live-work” 

JL JL housing units. The spore of the lie is 
that our members have been evicting tenants and 
businesses South cf Market to build new “live-work” 
units. This is a bold-feced, unmitigated falsehood 
No member of the Residential Builders has evicted, 
or “displaced,” a single tenant or business in any of 
the more than 1000 units of new housing we have 
built on abandoned industrial sites South of Market 
since such construction began back in 1996. 


No tenant has been evicted. 
No business has been evicted. 
Never. 

A wise person once said that a 
lie is like counterfeit money— 
many people who would not coin 
it, circulate it without qualms. 

The lie about the Residential 
Builders Association “evicting” 
tenants and businesses South of 
Market has been widely repeated 
in the press and by the chatter 
mouths on talk radio. Such a lie 
is a fist in the face of our hard¬ 
working membership. 

We are stating God’s truth 
against a fist full of lies —that 
we have evicted no one for “live- 
work” while building desperately 
needed new housing. 

We cannot open the tightly 
clenched fists of our detractors. 
But we can, and will, bare our 
own hands. 

On this page we freely dis¬ 
close the addresses of sites where 
we have built live-work units 
South of Market since 19%. 

Anyone can go to the 
Planning Department, the Rent 
Stabilization Board or the 
Sheriff’s Department and con¬ 
firm that there have been no 
evictions at these sites. The reck¬ 
less suggestions by opponents of 
live-work that we have been 
evicting tenants or displacing 


existing businesses are bold 
damnable lies. 

City records show that the con¬ 
dition of these sites—if they were 
not already vacant lots— were 
vacant, earthquake or fire-dam¬ 
aged structures, empty warehous¬ 
es, junkyards, long abandoned 
railway tracks or temporary park¬ 
ing lots. Many of these vacant 
sites have been breeding grounds 
for crime that South of Market 
neighbors have complained about 
for years. 

What San Francisco’s planning 
bureaucracy calls “live-work” is 
loft living type construction built 
on the sites of abandoned industri¬ 
al-use buildings which has added 
successfully, without controversy, 
to the housing stock in cities from 
New York to Oakland. Mayor 
Jerry Brown is proposing 10,000 
new live-work sites for Oakland: 
only the Bay Guardian thinks that 
is a bad idea. 

The second lie propagated by 
the no-growth ideologues who are 
attacking live -work is that the 
new housing is driving small busi¬ 
ness out of town, particularly in 
the South of Market. Statistics 
clearly show otherwise. 

The City’s gross receipts and 
payroll taxes are substantially 
higher than ever before. And the 
most dramatic increase in new

small businesses is in the City’s 
South of Market where start-up 
high tech firms, some from 
Silicon Valley, have given the 
area the nickname “Cyber- 
Gulch.” Live-work is providing 
satellite office housing for 
employees of these new small 
businesses who would otherwise 
bid into the present compacted, 
over-priced city housing market, 
further raising prices for all. 

The South of Market in San 
Francisco is the only area zoned 
to allow residential-mixed resi¬ 
dential business-at-home use. 
Live work units fit like the stamp 


to the envelope, the high-tech 
lifestyle requirements of the new 
high-tech generation, where 
home-offices are wired into larg¬ 
er office complexes. Live-work 
units are built to accommodate 
the needs of the wired genera¬ 
tion, and the wired generation is 
moving into the South of Market 
because live-work units are there. 
For once, by zoning this area to 
accommodate live-work, the City 
did something right. But the no¬ 
growth grouches are trying to 
wreck it by lying about the facts. 

Think about it. Live-work 
works for San Francisco. 

Meanwhile rents continue to 
increase because there is a mini¬ 
mum of growth in the San 
Francisco housing stock. Home 
prices and apartment rents are so 
hideously high here because the 
city put the breaks on building 
new housing two decades ago. 
The policy of down-zoning to 
curb new apartment construction 
came in the era of the freeway 
revolt when San Francisco didn’t 
want growth. The City nonethe¬ 
less grew during the past quarter 
century with little new housing to 
keep pace. Now we are paying 
the price, such as $1800 and up a 
month for a one-bedroom apart¬ 
ment and junior two bedroom 
homes selling for as much as half 
a million dollars. 

The net result of this no 
growth policy is that San 
Francisco’s housing prices are 
the highest in the nation. 

The people who created the 
current housing crisis by champi¬ 
oning no-growth policies are 
now opposing live-work devel¬ 
opment even in abandoned 
industrial areas. 

The policies of the no-growth 
ideologues have created a stran¬ 
glehold on housing and strained, 
often to the breaking point, the 
quality of life of San Francisco 
citizens who simply cannot 
afford to live here anymore. 

The time has come for a reck¬ 
oning. We move to open the dis¬ 
cussion by laying the truth on the 
table.

Faerie Clara Voyant and Sister Vicious Power-Hungry Bitch at last Sunday's 20th anniversary party. 


Sisters’ Easter party 
draws big crowd, 
few problems 


by Cynthia Laird 


T he sun was shining and Cas¬ 
tro Street was full as an esti¬ 
mated crowd of 5,000 to 
7,000 were on hand Easter Sunday 
to celebrate the 20th anniversary 
of the Sisters of Perpetual Indul¬ 
gence. The Sisters capped over two 
weeks of controversy set off by the 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese with 
a fun-filled afternoon with plenty 
of drag queens and others decked 
out in big hair, big bonnets, 
gowns, and costumes. Police de¬ 
tained two men during the event, 
one on a psychiatric hold and one 
on charges of assault for taking a 
swing at - and missing - another 
male partygoer. 

Some of the Sisters looked re¬ 
splendent in their Easter attire, 
while others wore their tradition¬ 
al black nun habits. Several peo¬ 
ple dressed as Tinky Winky, or 
wore the tiny purple triangle- 
topped toy on their head. The 
Teletubby was “outed” in Febru¬ 
ary by the Reverend Jerry Falwell. 

Over the years, the Sisters have 
donned mock nun habits and 
staged street theater events that 
have upset some and thrilled oth¬ 
ers, but through it all the group of 
predominantly gay men has 
raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for charity and spread a 
message of safer sex as a response 
to the AIDS epidemic. 

The good works done by the 
Sisters were overshadowed last 
month when the Catholic Church 


strongly opposed a vote by the San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors to 
close off one block of Castro Street 
for the celebration. After a guest 
commentary in Catholic San Fran¬ 
cisco likened the Sisters to neo- 
Nazis, phone calls and e-mails 
poured into City Hall. Initially, 
many of the communications were 
from angry Catholics but as the 
controversy kept growing, sup¬ 
porters of the Sisters also Spoke up. 

Rookie Supervisor Alicia Be- 
cerril stirred things up when she 
proposed the Sisters change the 
date of their street party; that idea 
went down to defeat at a packed 
Board of Supervisors meeting 
March 29, when the board refused 
to rescind the street closure per¬ 
mit on a 9 to 2 vote. Joining Be- 
cerril on the losing side was Su¬ 
pervisor Amos Brown, a Baptist 
minister. 

The weeks of almost daily cov¬ 
erage of the issue by the local and 
national media guaranteed lots of 
free publicity for the Sisters’ street 
party and the result was in evi¬ 
dence Sunday when throngs of 
people poured onto Castro Street 
throughout the day. 

Reconciliation a priority 

There also seems to be a spirit 
of reconciliation between the Sis¬ 
ters and the archdiocese; last Fri¬ 
day, April 2 it was reported that 
Archbishop William Levada is 
willing to meet with the Sisters in 
the hopes of working out their 
differences. Levada objected to the 
Sisters throwing a street party on 


the holiest day of the Christian 
calendar. 

Board of Supervisors President 
Tom Ammiano spoke of that rec¬ 
onciliation during his opening re¬ 
marks at the street party. “The 
message of Easter is to resurrect 
that spirit of coexistence. There’s 
been somewhat of a tear in the 
seamless fabric. I know the Sisters 
and I make reconciliation a prior¬ 
ity,” said Ammiano. 

Supervisor Leslie Katz encour¬ 
aged the crowd to acknowledge 
the financial contributions made 
by the Sisters over the years. “Ap¬ 
plaud the First Amendment so we 
can all be out here today express¬ 
ing our diverse opinions,” Katz 
said. “The winner in all of this is 
our Constitution.” 

Supervisor Mark Leno also 
spoke, denouncing the Knight ini¬ 
tiative, which the Catholic Church 
supports. State Senator Pete 
Knight (R-Palmdale) has qualified 
a measure for the March 2000 bal¬ 
lot where state voters will decide 
whether to amend the Family 
Code to state that marriage is be¬ 
tween one man and one woman. 

Bars along Castro Street were 
doing a brisk business and some, 
such as Twin Peaks, provided a 
great opportunity for people¬ 
watching through its huge win¬ 
dows. Inside, the mood was festive 
and most of the patrons had only 
praise for the Sisters and con¬ 
tempt for the Catholic Church. 

“I can’t believe the Catholic 
Church didn’t move Easter,” one 
man said sarcastically. T

J The first and only pill clinically 
proven to treat hair toss m men. 

PROPECIA is a medical breakthrough - the first pill that effectively treats male 
pattern hair loss on the vertex (at top of head) and anterior mid-scalp area. 

By all measures, the clinical results of PROPECIA in men are impressive:* 

• 83% maintained their hair based on hair count (vs. 28% with placebo). 

• 66% had visible regrowth as rated by independent dermatologists 
(vs. 7% with placebo). 

• 80% were rated as improved by clinical doctors (vs. 47% with placebo). 

• Most men reported an increase in the amount of hair, a decrease in hair loss, 
and improvement in appearance. 

*Based on vertex studies at 24 months of men 18 to 41 with 
mild to moderate hair loss. 


Scientists have recently discovered that men with male pattern hair loss have an increased 
level of DHT in their scalps. PROPECIA blocks the formation of DHT and, in this way, appears to 
interrupt a key factor in the development of inherited male pattern hair loss in men. 

Importantly, PROPECIA helps grow natural hair- not just peach fuzz- and is as convenient to 
take as a vitamin: one pill a day. 

Only a doctor can determine if PROPECIA is right for you. PROPECIA is for men only. 
Further, women who are or may potentially be pregnant must not use PROPECIA and should 
not handle crushed or broken tablets because of the risk of a specific kind of birth defect. 

(See accompanying Patient Information for details.) PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling. 


You may need to take PROPECIA daily for three months or more to see visible results. 
PROPECIA may not regrow all your hair. And if you stop using this product, you will gradually 
lose the hair you have gained. There is not sufficient evidence that PROPECIA works for 
recession at the temporal areas. If you haven't seen results after 12 months of using PROPECIA, 
further treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. A very small number 
of men experienced certain side effects, such as: less desire for sex, difficulty in achieving 
an erection, and a decrease in the amount of semen. Each of these side effects occurred in 
less than 2% of men. These side effects were reversible and went away in men who stopped 
taking PROPECIA. They also disappeared in most men (58%) who continued taking PROPECIA. 

So start talking to your doctor. And stop thinking further hair loss is inevitable. 

CALL 1-888-806-3725 or visit our website at www.propecia.com today to receive 
detailed product information, including clinical "before and after" photographs.

(finasteride) 

Helping make hair loss history 


^ MERCK 






16 BAY AREA REPORTER 8 April 1999 



Patient Information about PROPECIA* 
(Pro-pee-sha) 

Generic name: finasteride (fin-AS-tur-eyed) 


PROPECIA** is for use by MEN ONLY. 

Please read this leaflet before you start taking PROPECIA. Also, read the information included with PROPECIA each time you 
renew your prescription, just in case anything has changed. Remember, this leaflet does not take the place of careful discussions with 
your doctor. You and your doctor should discuss PROPECIA when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. 

What is PROPECIA used for? 

PROPECIA is used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss on the vertex and the anterior mid-scalp area. 

PROPECIA is for use by MEN ONLY and should NOT be used by women or children. 

What is male pattern hair loss? 

Male pattern hair loss is a common condition in which men experience thinning of the hair on the scalp. Often, this 
results in a receding hairline and/or balding on the top of the head. These changes typically begin gradually in men 
in their 20s. 

Doctors believe male pattern hair loss is due to heredity and is dependent on hormonal effects. Doctors refer to this 
type of hair loss as androgenetic alopecia. 

Results of clinical studies: 

For 12 months, doctors studied over 1800 men aged 18 to 41 with mild to moderate amounts of ongoing hair loss. A 
II men, whether receiving PROPECIA or placebo (a pill containing no medication) were given a medicated shampoo 
(Neutrogena T/Gel®*** Shampoo). Of these men, approximately 1200 with hair loss at the top of the head were studied 
for an additional 12 months. In general, men who took PROPECIA maintained or increased the number of visible scalp 
hairs and noticed improvement in their hair in the first year, with the effect maintained in the second year. Hair counts 
in men who did not take PROPECIA continued to decrease. 

In one study, patients were questioned on the growth of body hair. PROPECIA did not appear to affect hair in places other than 
the scalp. 

Will PROPECIA work for me? 

For most men, PROPECIA increases the number of scalp hairs, helping to fill in thin or balding areas of the scalp. 

Men taking PROPECIA noted a slowing of hair loss during two years of use. Although results will vary, generally 
you will not be able to grow back all of the hair you have lost. There is not sufficient evidence that PROPECIA works 
in the treatment of receding hairline in the temporal area on both sides of the head. 

Male pattern hair loss occurs gradually over time. On average, healthy hair grows only about half an inch each month. 
Therefore, it will take time to see any effect. 

You may need to take PROPECIA daily for three months or more before you see a benefit from taking PROPECIA. 
PROPECIA can only work over the long term if you continue taking it. If the drug has not worked for you in twelve 
months, further treatment is unlikely to be of benefit. If you stop taking PROPECIA, you will likely lose the hair you have 
gained within 12 months of stopping treatment You should discuss this with your doctor. 

How should I take PROPECIA? 

Follow your doctor's instructions. 

■ Take one tablet by mouth each day. 

■ You may take PROPECIA with or without food. 

■ If you forget to take PROPECIA, do not take an extra tablet. Just take the next tablet as usual. 

PROPECIA will not work faster or better if you take it more than once a day. 


Who should NOT take PROPECIA? 

■ PROPECIA is for the treatment of male pattern hair loss in MEN ONLY and should not be taken by women 
or children. 

■ Anyone allergic to any of the ingredients. 

A warning about PROPECIA and pregnancy. 

■ Women who are or may potentially be pregnant: 

- must not use PROPECIA 

- should not handle crushed or broken tablets of PROPECIA. 

If a woman who is pregnant with a male baby absorbs the active ingredient in PROPECIA, either by swallowing 
or through the skin, it may cause abnormalities of a male baby's sex organs. If a woman who is pregnant comes into 
contact with the active ingredient in PROPECIA, a doctor should be consulted. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will 
prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets are not broken or crushed. 

What are the possible side effects of PROPECIA? 

Like all prescription products, PROPECIA may cause side effects. In clinical studies, side effects from PROPECIA were 
uncommon and did not affect most men. A small number of men experienced certain sexual side effects. These men 
reported one or more of the following: less desire for sex; difficulty in achieving an erection; and, a decrease in the amount 
of semen. Each of these side effects occurred in less than 2% of men. These side effects went away in men who stopped 
taking PROPECIA. They also disappeared in most men who continued taking PROPECIA. 

The active ingredient in PROPECIA is also used by older men at a five-times higher dose to treat enlargement of the 
prostate. Some of these men reported other side effects, including problems with ejaculation, breast swelling and/or 
tenderness and allergic reactions such as lip swelling and rash. In clinical studies with PROPECIA, these side effects 
occurred as often in men taking placebo as in those taking PROPECIA. 

Tell yoOr doctor promptly about these or any other unusual effects. 

■ PROPECIA can affect a blood test called PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) for the screening of prostate cancer. 

If you have a PSA test done, you should tell your doctor that you are taking PROPECIA. 

Storage and handling.' 

Keep PROPECIA in the original container and keep the container closed. Store it in a dry place at room temperature. 

PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided 
that the tablets are not broken or crushed. 

Do not give your PROPECIA tablets to anyone else. It has been prescribed only for you. 

Keep PROPECIA and all medications out of the reach of children. 

THIS LEAFLET PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ABOUT PROPECIA. IF AFTER 

READING THIS LEAFLET YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK YOUR DOCTOR.

nondiscrimination ordinance 
which occurred in 1995. 

Adam Colton, the openly gay 
Novato teenager who’s been the 
victim of two highly publicized 
anti-gay hate crimes. Colton was 
nominated by someone who said, 
“He is our powerful future.” Last 
September, Colton, 17, came out 
of the closet at home and at school 
and started a Gay/Straight Alliance 
at San Marin High School; he was 
attacked a week later. After a sec¬ 
ond attack in February, the Nova¬ 
to community held a rally to con¬ 
demn anti-gay violence. 

Another North Bay teenager, 
Steven Cozza, 14, was nominated 
by a city resident. Cozza started 
the nonprofit organization Scout¬ 
ing For All last year in response to 
the Boy Scouts of America’s anti¬ 
gay policies. Cozza, who describes 
himself as heterosexual, has start¬ 
ed a petition and hopes to get one 
million signatures to present to 
Boy Scout officials to get them to 
change their policies. He has 
marched in previous Pride Pa¬ 
rades to support the LGBT com¬ 
munity for the last four years.

minister Don Fado, who defied 
his denomination and led 150 
clergy - some in absentia - in per¬ 
forming a holy union for Sacra¬ 
mento Methodist lay leaders Ellie 


Charlton and Jeanne Barnett in 
January. Recently, United 
Methodist Bishop Melvin Talbert 
filed a formal complaint against 
Fado and 68 clergy who partici¬ 
pated in the event. 

Latino figure skating champion 
Rudy Galindo was nominated at a 
pride board meeting. Withering- 
ton said Galindo was nominated 
because he’s out in a public way in 
a sport with lots of closeted peo¬ 
ple. In 1996 after skating for over 
15 years, Galindo competed at the 
U.S. Nationals in his hometown of 
San Jose, where he won the com¬ 
petition after a stellar performance 
that saw him upset two former 
U.S. champions to became the old¬ 
est gold medalist in 70 years. 

Longtime gay rights activist 
Harry Hay was nominated as an 
example of “Proud Heritage.” Hay 
was one of the founders of the 
original Mattachine Society in

cleansing in Kosovo with hatred 
in the United States. He said, 
“America will not be able to be a 
force for good abroad unless we 
are good at home.” 

Clinton drew upon his own 
experience growing up in the 
South when he said, “It is very 
easy to get into a social system 
where you always get to think a 
little better of yourself because 
you’ve always got someone that 
you can dehumanize. And that’s 
really what this whole issue with 
gays is today in America.” 

It was the only time he used 
the word gay, or lesbian, or ho¬ 
mosexual in a statement of more 
than 2,000 words, roughly four 
times the length of this article. 
His language in support of hate 
crimes legislation was forceful, 
but also generic. 

The meeting came a day after 
the National Coalition of Anti- 
Violence Programs reported a 
108 percent increase in anti-gay 
violence in 1998 over the previ¬ 
ous year. The incidents are not 
only growing in number, they are 
becoming increasingly severe. 

“The president has always un¬ 


derstood the importance of 
sending the message that a hate 
crime committed against one 
American is a crime against all 
Americans and is an assault on 
our society’s core values,” said 
Winnie Stachelberg, political di¬ 
rector of the Human Rights 
Campaign (HRC). She called 
upon Congress to pass the Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. 

Chairman Orrin Hatch (R- 
Utah) has scheduled a hearing on 
the bill before the Senate Judicia¬ 
ry Committee on April 28. He 
held a similar hearing last July. 

Rea Carey is concerned that 
the reporting of hate in schools 
be fair and accurate. She said that 
gay youth often see school ad¬ 
ministrators as part of the prob¬ 
lem. Some don’t even acknowl¬ 
edge the presence of gay youth in 
their schools, while others blame 
the teens for bringing anti-gay 
harassment upon themselves by 
being out. 

Carey is executive director of 
the National Youth Advocacy 
Coalition, which aims to improve 
the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
and transgendered youth. 


Dealing with Our Differences 
is “an opportunity to reach a 
large number of students with 
the message of providing a safe 
environment for all students, re¬ 
gardless of their differences,” said 
Kate Frankfurt, director of advo¬ 
cacy and public policy with Gay, 
Lesbian, and Straight, Education 
Network (GLSEN). 

She noted that “the president 
has been cautious in his own lan¬ 
guage” on gay and lesbian issues. 
She emphasized, “Caution will 
not help these students better 
understand these issues. They 
need to be spoken to in very clear 
terms, not information that is 
couched in euphemism.” 

The Family Research Council 
saw Clinton’s remarks as a con¬ 
spiracy “to invade America’s mid¬ 
dle schools and colleges with the 
homosexual agenda under the 
guise of‘teaching tolerance,”’ ac¬ 
cording to its senior director of 
cultural studies Robert H. Knight. 

“The message is anything but 
subtle: support a federal hate 
crimes law and ‘tolerance re-ed¬ 
ucation’ for hapless pupils or be 
complicit in murder.” ▼ 


Jenny Jones case heats up 
with sex , lies, and ambushes 


United Press International 


1 1 ttorneys in a lawsuit stem¬ 
ming from an episode of 

' i The Jenny Jones Show , 
which ultimately led to one guest 
murdering another guest, have 
presented the jury with very dif¬ 
ferent explanations of what really 
happened. Plaintiffs’ attorney Ge¬ 
offrey Fieger said he’ll prove the 
defendants are “greedy corpora¬ 
tions exploiting peoples’ emo¬ 
tions.” 

But in a surprise announce¬ 
ment, a defense attorney in the 
civil trial said the death was linked 
to a gay relationship gone awry. 

Attorney James Feeney says 
he’ll prove that murder victim 
Scott Amedure and convicted 
killer Jonathan Schmitz had a 
sexual liaison after the taping of 
the show, before Amedure was 
killed. Feeney claims the en¬ 
counter was confirmed by Ame- 
dure’s mother. 

The mother is among the rela¬ 


tives of the victim suing the TV 
talk show for $50 million. The 
Amedure family says the 1995 
shooting was triggered by an em¬ 
barrassing “ambush” of Schmitz 
during a show about secret gay 
crushes. Three days later Schmitz 
killed Amedure in his Oakland 
County mobile home. 

Donna Riley, who appeared on 
the talk show with Schmitz and 
Amadure, testified that she did 
not play “matchmaker” for the 
men, and denied encouraging an 
affair by arranging for the two to 
go skinny-dipping together. 

Riley, a single mother, was 
Amedure’s friend and an acquain¬ 
tance of Schmitz before the three 
agreed to appear for a taping of 
the show in Chicago. 

Schmitz later said he thought 
the program about “secret crush¬ 
es” would hinge on Riley an¬ 
nouncing her attraction toward 
Schmitz. Instead, Amedure re¬ 
vealed his feelings, hugged 
Schmitz, and described a 
whipped-cream-and-hammock 


fantasy. 

Riley testified that a day after 
the shooting, a Jenny Jones Show 
producer phoned and asked her 
to appear for a videotaped dis¬ 
claimer about the incident with 
Jenny Jones. Riley refused. 

The plaintiffs claim the Jenny 
Jones Show neglected to investi¬ 
gate Schmitz’s mental problems 
before the program. The defen¬ 
dants - Warner Brothers, Telepic¬ 
tures, and Jenny Jones - claim 
Schmitz knew before going on 
stage that his secret admirer could 
be male or female. 

Another witness at the trial, 
University of Miami-Florida Pro¬ 
fessor Maryatlani Karpos, testified 
that she had warned the show’s 
producers that programs about 
surprise confessions could be dis¬ 
astrous, but said the show’s offi¬ 
cials “just laughed at me.” 

Schmitz is now serving 25-50 
years for second-degree murder. 
He avoided a first-degree murder 
conviction after his attorney argued 
diminished mental capacity. ▼ 


CUAV report 

◄ page 1 

Ammiano and Mark Leno were 
featured speakers at the event, but 
before they delivered their com¬ 
ments the two men stood side-by- 
side, listening with wrinkled 
brows as Rakowski earnestly re¬ 
viewed last year’s murder statistics 
and highlighted some of the wide¬ 
spread violence. 

“The year 1998 was underlined 
with tragedy as anti-LGBT mur¬ 
ders increased 136 percent na¬ 
tionwide” from 14 to 33, Rakows¬ 
ki said. In addition, she illustrated 
that Northern California is not 
immune to the violence, citing the 
horrific deaths of Brian Wilmes - 
who was attacked on Mission 
Street near Van Ness while the of¬ 
fender screamed “Faggot” and 
“Bitches” - and Louis Pearson, 
who was tortured along the shore 
of Lake Mendocino by two at¬ 
tackers who shoved a stick up his 
nose, penetrating into his brain. 


Last year, 434 people braved in¬ 
stitutional, emotional, and psycho¬ 
logical barriers and reported their 
incidents to CUAV. The most dev¬ 
astating trends documented in the 
1998 report were the upsurge of 
law enforcement offenders - specif¬ 
ically police violence against trans¬ 
gendered and transsexual people; 
the increased brutality of attacks; 
sexual assault and rape incidents, 
which increased 80 percent; and 
the cloud of harassment that sur¬ 
rounds gay and questioning youth. 

Survivors of anti-transgender 
violence increased over 20 percent 
from 27 to 33, with the greatest 
number of victims in San Francis¬ 
co and New York. More than 20 
percent of all victims have experi¬ 
enced previous attacks by the 
same perpetrator. 

When Supervisors Ammiano 
and Leno spoke, they briefly and 
eloquently expressed their feelings 
on the current climate of hate and 
violence. “Our elected officials 
must attempt to stop this behav¬ 
ior by passing federal legislation 


protecting the lesbian, gay, bisex¬ 
ual, and transgender communities 
from hate crimes and violence,” 
said Ammiano. (See related story, 
this page.) 

“Those officials who do not 
stand up to such criminal behav¬ 
ior may not pull the trigger,” he 
added, “but they’re loading the 
gun.” 

Leno said, “All fair-minded in¬ 
dividuals have the responsibility 
to stand together and unite 
around the calls for federal laws 
preventing hate crimes and vio¬ 
lence against our community.” 

CUAV has included recom¬ 
mendations in the local analysis 
and urges legislators, law enforce¬ 
ment officials, members of the 
LGBT community, and society in 
general to take part in the strug¬ 
gle to eliminate anti-LGBT vio¬ 
lence. 

“A community will be judged 
not by the presence of hate,” con¬ 
cluded Rakowski, “but by the fail¬ 
ure of concerned individuals to 
respond to hate and violence.” T

Another transgender murder 

Local TG group declares 'state of emergency and national crisis' 


by Vicky Kolakowski 


he murder of Tracey 
Thompson in Wilcox Coun¬ 
ty, Georgia on Tuesday, 
March 30 has prompted local 
transgender activists to declare a 
“state of emergency and national 
crisis” 

Thompson, formerly known 
as Billy Joe Turner, was found se¬ 
verely bleeding from head 
wounds after walking a half-mile 
to a farmhouse in rural Georgia 
from the crime scene. She was 
beaten with a baseball bat and 
later died from the wounds, but 
only after police conducted some 
initial questioning. 

Police say that Thompson 
identified her boyfriend as the as¬ 
sailant, although police have been 
unable to identify the boyfriend. 
Something of a drifter, police have 
had difficulties reconstructing 
^Thompson’s personal life and 
identifying the murderer. 

The murder is the fifth pub¬ 
licly reported murder of a trans- 
gendered person this year, which 
some transgender leaders view as 
an emerging epidemic. 

“Reported cases of transgender 
murders are escalating; since Au¬ 
gust of 1998 there has been ap¬ 
proximately one murder a 
month,” Gwen Smith, a Bay Area 
transgender activist who tracks re¬ 
ports of transgender murders, told 
the Bay Area Reporter. “Since Feb¬ 
ruary of 1999, however, that num¬ 
ber has jumped to two a month.” 

Based on very liberal estimates 
of the transgender population, 
which would yield a conservative 


murder rate, transgender historian 
Candice “Kay” Brown recently cal¬ 
culated that a murder rate of one 
male-to-female transsexual person 
each month comes to an average of 
119 murders per 100,000 transsex¬ 
uals, or an average 16 times greater 
than the national average. This 
murder rate is more than three 
times that of African-American 
men, who have the next highest 
recorded murder rate. 

“And considering that most of 
it is motivated by transphobia, as 
evidenced by the brutality of the 
manner of death [multiple stab¬ 
bing, beating, choking] we are in¬ 
deed seeing the brunt of the hate 
crime in the U.S. as a percentage of 
our population. ... This is a state 
of emergency,” Brown declared. 

Local transgender group TG 
Rage is responding to the murders 
by starting a letter writing and e- 
mail campaign and other activities 
designed to draw the attention of 
the general public to the high mur¬ 
der rate of transgender people. 

Roots of violence 

The causes of the high murder 
rate appear to be more complex 
than simple random transphobic 
violence. Widespread employ¬ 
ment discrimination leads to an 
unusually high unemployment 
rate among transgender people, 
said Rosalyne S. Montgomery of 
TRansgenders United for Equali¬ 
ty (TRUE). Montgomery works as 
an advocate for the low-income 
transgender community in San 
Francisco. 

This economic and social mar¬ 
ginalization places transgender 
people in more high risk situa- 


Shepard suspect pleads 
guilty / gets life in prison 


United Press International 


ne of two men charged with 
killing gay Wyoming stu- 
dent Matthew Shepard has 
pleaded guilty to lesser charges 
and was sentenced to life in prison 
Monday, April 5. 

Russell Henderson pleaded 
guilty to felony murder and kid¬ 
napping near the end of jury se¬ 
lection in the first of two trials 
stemming from a brutal slaying 
that police believe was carried out 
because Shepard was gay. 

Soon after entering the plea, 
Henderson was sentenced to two 
consecutive life prison terms. 
Aaron McKinney’s trial is slated 
for later this year. 

Henderson and McKinney, 
both 21, were charged with first- 
degree murder, robbery and kid¬ 
napping in the October 7 attack 
on Shepard, who was found 
lashed to a wooden fence outside 
Laramie, nearly dead. 

Shepard, a University of 
Wyoming student who was open¬ 
ly gay, died at Poudre Valley Hos¬ 
pital in Fort Collins, Colorado, five 
days later. Henderson and McKin¬ 
ney were already in custody. 

Police said it was Shepard’s 
sexual orientation that drove 
Henderson and McKinney to lure 
him from a Laramie bar, then pis¬ 
tol-whip and beat him into un¬ 
consciousness. 

Eighteen hours later a passer¬ 
by who first thought Shepard was 
a scarecrow hanged onto a fence 
as a Halloween prank took a clos¬ 


er look and discovered that he was 
looking at a savagely beaten 
young man. 

The slaying triggered global 
outrage and calls for tougher laws 
against hate crimes. 

Henderson’s girlfriend, 21- 
year-old Chasity Pasley, pleaded 
guilty December 23 to accessory 
after the fact to murder and will 
be sentenced later this year. Mc¬ 
Kinney’s girlfriend, Kristen Price, 
is slated for trial next month. 

Prior to his sentencing, Hen¬ 
derson told the court he drove the 
truck and helped lash Shepard to 
“the fence, but claimed he asked 
McKinney to cease the beating 
and that McKinney kept it up. 

Outside the courthouse, a 
group of anti-gay demonstrators 
led by Kansas minister Fred Phelps 
shouted slogans as counter¬ 
demonstrators dressed as angels 
tried to block them from view. 

‘Verry homofobik’ 

McKinney’s court-appointed 
lawyer, Dion Custis, says Hender¬ 
son “fabricated” testimony about 
the slaying to save his own life. 
However, a letter attributed to 
McKinney, obtained by KCNC-TV 
in Denver, says that he “flipped 
out” when Shepard told him he was 
gay and “wanted a piece of me.” 

McKinney reportedly wrote, 
“Being a verry [sic] drunk homo¬ 
fobik [sic] I flipped out and began 
to whip the fucker with my gun.” 

Custis says he has not decided 
whether to request that McKin¬ 
ney’s trial be moved out of 
Laramie. ▼ 


tions, transgender activists con¬ 
tend, forcing them to be more de¬ 
pendent upon more dangerous 
lifestyles and relationships. 

“This happens all the time to 
male-to-female transsexual vic¬ 
tims of violence,” Shawna Virago, 
a domestic violence and hate vio¬ 
lence victim advocate for Com¬ 
munity United Against Violence 
(CUAV) in San Francisco, told the 
B.A.R. “Her choices are limited. 
Often she dates someone she 
knows is wrong for her, her friends 
know are wrong for her, but there 
is a fear of being alone, and she 
thinks that having anyone is bet¬ 
ter than no one. Many of us have 
this fear that nobody will find us 
attractive and will want us.” 

In addition, outside of the Bay 
Area some male-to-female trans¬ 
sexuals feel unsupported by either 
the gay and lesbian or the main¬ 
stream straight domestic violence 
groups. Locally, CUAV has devel¬ 
oped an especially strong rela¬ 
tionship with San Francisco’s 
transgender community. 

The problem confronted by 
transgender victims of violence is 
compounded by widespread con¬ 
cern about police abuse of trans¬ 
gender people, which leads trans¬ 
gender people to avoid police in¬ 
volvement in already tense do¬ 
mestic situations, Virago said. 

CUAV held a press conference 
on Tuesday, April 6 to discuss their 
annual report on hate violence at 
which they highlighted the prob¬ 
lems of police abuse of transgen¬ 


der people (see related story, page 
1). The press conference was fol¬ 
lowed by a rally by TransAction on 
Wednesday, April 7 at the San 
Francisco Hall of Justice, to specif¬ 
ically address the problem of po¬ 
lice abuse of transgender people. 
TransAction is a collaboration be¬ 
tween advocates from CUAV, Bay 
Area PoliceWatch, and other 
transgender activists. 

“In over 50 percent of the total 
transgender hate violence cases, the 


offender was a law enforcement of¬ 
ficer,” Virago noted about the local 
findings. “This completely mirrors 
the national trend. There is in¬ 
creased police brutality against the 
transgender community.” 

“People need to realize that 
transsexuals frequently face these 
two problems,” Virago added, “of 
feeling trapped with someone 
they know is wrong, and then 
afraid that the police will abuse 
them if they report it.” ▼

H M IV-positive people face a 
constant and recurring

and have society see them, as 
human beings whose lives are as 
fully valuable as anyone else’s. 
And while HIV activists have 
fought and won many battles 
against AIDS discrimination, 
some key struggles remain. 

One critical issue is the insid¬ 
ious medical discrimination 
practiced by the organ transplant 
infrastructure in this country. 
This discrimination denies life¬ 
saving organ transplants to HIV¬ 
positive people who need them. 
At first glance, some might as¬ 
sume that such discrimination is 
scientifically justifiable but - as 
has been discussed in this col¬ 
umn - a review of the scientific 
literature indicates that HIV-pos- 
itive people can be as successful 
as transplant recipients as HIV¬ 


negative people. Yet, the small 
clique of doctors who control 
most of the organ transplants in 
this country seem simply not to 
value an HIV-positive life as 
highly as an HIV-negative life 
and therefore discriminate 
against those with HIV. 

Another area of medical dis¬ 
crimination that at first blush 
might seem scientifically justifi¬ 
able is fertility services. At the 
present time, there are no ser¬ 
vices available anywhere in the 
U.S. that will assist an HIV-posi¬ 
tive man or HIV-positive woman 
to become biological parents, al¬ 
though there are services to help 
an HIV-positive woman, once 
she is pregnant, to deliver a 
healthy baby. Yet experiences of 
programs in other countries, and 
the experiences of individuals 
who have been determined to be¬ 
come pregnant without medical 
assistance, suggest that this dis¬ 
crimination is also not scientifi¬ 
cally justifiable.

With correct medical care, 
available data suggests that both 
HIV-positive men and HIV-pos- 
itive women can become parents 
with a very high likelihood of 
having an HIV-negative baby. 

“When I tested positive in 
1990, the very first thought that 
came to my mind was ‘Oh God, 
does that mean I can’t have chil¬ 
dren?”’ recalls Rebecca Deni¬ 
son, founder of WORLD 
(Women Organized to 
Respond to Life- 
threatening Diseases) 
and one of the first 
HIV-positive women ac¬ 
tivists to choose pregnan¬ 
cy. “The reaction surprised 
me because I had 
been something of a 
tomboy as a young 
girl and not the type 
to have dreamt of motherhood 
my whole life. I didn’t realize 
what an important part of my life 
that was until I thought it was 
taken away from me. 

“The prospect of illness and a 
shortened lifespan was hard, but 
tolerable. The part I couldn’t ac¬ 
cept was having the opportunity 
to have a child with my husband 
taken away from me.” 

For five years, Denison 
mourned the loss of her chance 
to have a biological child as she 
became an AIDS educator and 
AIDS activist. “But I kept a close 
watch on the science,” she says, 
“and I saw the risks getting lower 
and lower. In 1995, I realized I 
was waiting for someone to give 
me an absolute guarantee, but 
that no one would give me a 
guarantee.” 

Denison became pregnant in 
July of 1995. In October, she 
found out she was carrying twins 
and she gave birth on March 12, 
1996. An HIV viral load test taken 
the day the twins were born 
showed the babies had no de¬ 
tectable HIV viral load. They did 
have a positive HIV antibody test 
because babies carry antibodies 
from the mother for the first year 
or so of life. The twins’ antibody 
test eventually became negative; 
they are healthy and just celebrat¬ 
ed their third birthday. 

Since publicly discussing her 
decision to become pregnant, 
Denison has counseled more 
than 100 HIV-positive women, 
and a handful of HIV-positive 
men, who want to become par¬ 
ents. “I feel there is much more 
acceptance today for HlV-posi- 
tive women who want to become 
pregnant or want to carry a preg¬ 
nancy to term, especially after the 
results of studies that indicate 


that HIV-positive women can 
give birth with less than five per¬ 
cent chance of transmission.” 

But while medical studies 
done for HIV-positive men indi¬ 
cate that the risk of transmission 
is far less, fertility treatments that 
would help men become biologi¬ 
cal fathers with a minimized risk 
are unavailable in this country. “I 
get a lot of phone calls, from men 
especially, saying that fertility 
clinics won’t help them,” 
Denison reports. “No 
fertility provider I 
know of is helping 
people who want to be 
parents reduce the risk 
of HIV transmission to 
each other or to their 
kids.” 

One researcher in 
the U.S. has, in fact, 
been attempting to establish a 
program to assist men with 
chronic viral infections safely be¬ 
come parents. Dr. Ann Kiessling, 
an internationally recognized ex¬ 
pert in assisted reproductive 
technologies, has endured years 
of stops and starts for a program 
using in vitro (test-tube) fertil¬ 
ization. In the procedure, sperm 
is tested for viral load and only 
sperm with non-detectable viral 
load is used to fertilize an egg in 
a test tube. The embryos are al¬ 
lowed to divide and tested again 
for HIV, and only embryos with 
no detectable HIV are implanted 
into the mother’s uterus. 

“We’ve run into extreme insti¬ 
tutional caution and resistance 
about the program,” reports 
Kiessling. “We’ve gotten it start¬ 
ed two different times, and then 
been shut down when the clinics 
it was residing in have merged 
into other institutions and the 
new management didn’t want to 
have anything to do with us. I’ve 
had couples who’ve gotten too 
old to have children while wait¬ 
ing for us to be able to provide 
services, and it’s heartbreaking.” 

Kiessling explains that a num¬ 
ber of factors make it difficult to 
provide such a service in the U.S. 
“The CDC [Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention] in 1990 
received reports of a couple of 
cases were women were infected 
with HIV after artificial insemi¬ 
nation with ‘washed’ sperm and 
issued a statement that the pro¬ 
cedure should not be done,” 
Kiessling notes. “But at that time 
viral load testing of sperm sam¬ 
ples was not available. While I 
find some of the European data 
very interesting and encourag¬ 
ing, and I believe artificial in¬ 
semination with washed and_ 


tested sperm might be safe, the 
Italian researchers have not been 
able to produce the kind of doc¬ 
umentation of their results that 
the CDC would find conclusive 
that the procedure is safe.” 

Kiessling reports that she re¬ 
ceives a lot of calls from couples 
in California, where she under¬ 
stands there is a law forbidding 
the taking of any material from 
an HIV-positive person and plac¬ 
ing it into another person, which 
would effectively outlaw the pro¬ 
cedure. While Kiessling hopes to 
have her program available in the 
Boston area within a year, at pre¬ 
sent she is not aware of any ser¬ 
vices available in the U.S. 

The situation is different in 
Europe. Published treatment 
studies in Germany, Italy, and 
Spain have thus far documented 
births of 37 children in Spain, 157 
children in Italy, and 10 children 
in Germany to HIV-negative 
mothers from HIV-positive fa¬ 
thers through artificial insemina¬ 
tion. With a total of well over 
1,000 artificial insemination atr 
tempts in the three studies, it is 
reported that none of the women 
and none of the babies became 
infected with HIV. In these in¬ 
seminations, sperm was taken 
from the father and “washed” to 
remove any white blood cells in 
the sperm and any free viral par¬ 
ticles. The sperm was then tested 
for an HIV viral load and was not 
used for insemination if any HIV 
was detected. 

In the Spanish study, 94 per¬ 
cent of the washed semen sam¬ 
ples had no detectable HIV and 
were used for insemination; those 
men whose sample was HIV de¬ 
tectable, had an undetectable 
sample on a subsequent visit. 

These results, and Denison’s 
experience, suggest that HIV-pos- 
itive men and HIV-positive 
women can become biological 
parents with a contained risk of 
transmission to their children. 
Though there is not no risk, for 
HIV-positive women receiving 
proper treatment, the risk ap¬ 
proaches that of giving birth to a 
child with some other severe 
health complication. For HIV¬ 
positive men, with proper treat¬ 
ment and using artificial insemi¬ 
nation, the risk may be far less. V

Mark Douglas Buettner 


Mark Douglas 
Buettner left this 
world on March 8, 
1999. Mark was a 
strong warrior, a 
long-time fighter 
and survivor of 
AIDS. He also had a 
gentle soul, one 
which sometimes 
struggled with the 
harsh realities of this world. Mark’s love 
of nature and beauty, and his passionate 
care for the environment, were con¬ 
stants in his life, starting with his first 
word: “flower.” 

While San Francisco was his home 
for many years, Mark always belonged 
to Montana, its mountains, bears, big 
sky, and endless beauty. Throughout his 
life, Mark retained a child-like wonder 
and fascination with nature in all its 
manifestations. Mark was and is the 
great love of my life, a love that tran¬ 
scends definition or explanation. Mark 
was surrounded by the love of his fami¬ 
ly, who knew and loved him as an out¬ 
standing son, a good brother, a caring 
uncle, a loving nephew, and the com¬ 
municator of the family. God blessed us 
with his presence, a beautiful and won¬ 
derful gift. Mark’s uniqueness and spe¬ 


cial qualities will be missed, and we will 
keep him alive in our hearts forever. We 
love you, Mark. 

Donations in Mark’s memory can 
be made to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, 
or Metropolitan Community Church. 

Leonard Patterson Riley 


Leonard Patter¬ 
son Riley was and is 
my friend, coyote, 
husband and hero. 
I’m honored that 
he made me part of 
his life. He was a 
heroic survivor of 
so much. 

He was born 
three months pre¬ 
mature in 1945 and somehow survived. 
He was raised in near-poverty by a sin¬ 
gle mother. He got polio at age ten, 
missing the availability of the vaccine by 
a few months. Nevertheless, he went on 
to become a strong volleyball player, a 
passionately devoted bicyclist, and a 
long-term regular at the Muscle System 
gym on Market Street. He tested posi¬ 
tive for HIV in 1983. He was a partici¬ 
pant in a study that helped bring the 
HIV-fighting drug Sustiva to the phar¬ 
macies. His year-long struggle with 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma ended March 28. 
His last words to me were, “We won.” 

Leonard painted with passion and 
conviction throughout his adult life. 

Keep an eye open for retrospectives of 
his work. 

For information on memorial ser¬ 
vices, contact Rod Brown at 863-1412. 

Donations in Leonard’s memory 
can be made to either AIDS Benefits 
Counselors/Positive Resource Center or 
Lyon-Martin Women’s Health Services. 

Steven Ray Silva 

November 12,1956 — 

March 29, 1999 


Steve (“don’t 
call me Steven!”) 
Silva went to God 
peacefully on Mon¬ 
day morning in the 
presence and with 
the love of George 
Kelly and Jon 
Makay, his San 
Francisco family. 


Though he had a strong will to live, and 
he fought courageously to do so, he 
could not halt the advancements of 
AIDS. 

A carpenter, cook, craftsman, rock- 
n-roller, antiques entrepreneur, active in 
his church and a former resident of the 
Maitri Hospice, Steve will be missed by 
many. 

Steve’s parents, Bud and Bessie Silva 
of Newman, California loved, accepted 
and supported their son throughout his 
life. He is survived by three brothers, 
John, Rusty, and Gary Silva, and an ex¬ 
tended family of aunts, uncles, nieces, 
nephews, cousins and a sister-in-law. 

Steve touched many lives with his 
generosity, quick wit, directness and his 
attention to detail. Steve’s passing may 
have left an empty place in our lives, but 
he will always occupy a very special 
place in our hearts and in our memo¬ 
ries. 

William E. Stephens 
(Uncle Billy) 

1928 —1999 


Bill died sud¬ 
denly April 1,1999, 
with close friends 
by his side, as a re¬ 
sult of a brain 
aneurysm. He lived 
in the city he loved, 
San Francisco, from 
1946, and in the 
Castro for the last 
25 years. He had a 
long career in the US Navy, retiring with 
an honorable discharge in 1984. His 
tenacious spirit and sense of humor 
sustained him through a concerted ef¬ 
fort by the Navy to end his career early 
because he was gay. He lived and died 
the way he wanted to. Never lacking for 
an opinion, he was understood and 
loved by a wide variety of people of all 
ages. He loved to Western dance and 
taught many hesitant students how to 
do so with the expression “If you can 

keep rhythm when you f_, you can 

dance.” Never lacking for energy, he vol¬ 
unteered his time and heart to the 
GSGRA and AIDS support services. He 
will be missed by his many friends, cho¬ 
sen family, and the people he met and 
talked with while he strolled through 
the Castro. At Bill’s request, there will be 
no memorial service. His ashes will be 
scattered at sea. 






Quackenbush backs 
policyholder with AIDS 


by M.R. Richards 
B.A.R. Capitol 
Correspondent 


| -/ alifornia Insurance Commis¬ 
sioner Chuck Quackenbush 
W hied an amicus brief with the 
California Supreme Court Mon¬ 
day, March 29, in support of an in¬ 
surance policyholder with AIDS. 
The policyholder, Mark Galanty, 
was denied disability benefits by 
Paul Revere Insurance Company 
because his illness had manifested 
itself before the policy was issued. 
Galanty stated he was HIV-positive 
when, in 1988, his insurance agent 
solicited his application for the 
policy. However, the policy was 
granted and he paid premiums for 
over two years. 

Eventually Galanty submitted a 
claim for disability benefits because 
he had developed AIDS. Four 
months after they began paying 
benefits, the Paul Revere company 
wanted Galanty’s medical records, 
and several months after that 
stopped paying benefits. Galanty 
filed suit in December 1995 but the 
company received a summary 
judgment in their favor and the 
California Court of Appeals later 
affirmed the decision. In December 
1995, Quackenbush had intervened 
in the case by issuing an order to 
show cause to the insurance com¬ 
pany, alleging that it had passed the 
time period within which they 
could have denied Galanty’s claim 
for an illness that existed prior to 


the date the policy was issued. 

Quackenbush then filed the 
amicus brief with the California 
Supreme Court. Quackenbush 
said, “I am supporting Mr. Galan¬ 
ty in this case to ensure that im¬ 
portant consumer protection 
statutes are not weakened. We 
must not allow insurance compa¬ 
nies to create statutory loopholes 
in order to deny valid consumer 
claims.” Quackenbush expressed 
deep concern about the appellate 
court decision because it would 


severely dilute the strength of 
consumer protection statutes. 

“The legislative intent behind 
the incontestability clause is clear¬ 
ly to protect consumers by pre¬ 
venting insurance companies 
from denying claims after two 
years based on pre-existing condi¬ 
tions,” he said. “It sets a very bad 
precedent to allow the specific lan¬ 
guage of an insurance company 
contract to override a consumer 
protection statute. More impor¬ 
tantly, it is unfair to penalize an 
AIDS victim, who never lied about 
his HIV status and who paid pre¬ 


miums for many years, just when 
he needs his insurance most.” 

Galanty’s attorney, Robert Gi- 
anelli, raised a frightening issue: 
“If insurers are allowed to disre¬ 
gard the incontestability clause, 
they will forever be pointing to 
obscure, old symptoms and argue 
they were prior manifestations'of 
a current disabling condition.. 
Suddenly a higher than average 
cholesterol reading, 10 years prior, 
will be deemed the cause of a dis¬ 
abling heart condition. No con¬ 


sumer will be free from post claim 
scrutiny no matter how long he 
has had his policy.” 

Quackenbush is joined by 
AIDS Project Los Angeles, Cali¬ 
fornia Women’s Law Center, 
Western Law Center for Disabled 
Rights, Protection and Advocacy 
Inc. and the ACLU of Southern 
California. 

When asked why the usually 
low-profile, conservative commis¬ 
sioner would so strongly support 
Galanty’s cause, press aide, Scott 
Edelen said, “It’s very simple. It 
was the right thing to do.” T 


“It is unfair to penalize an AIDS 
victim, who never lied about his 
HIV status and who paid premiums 
for many years, just when he needs 
his insurance most.”

Team SF on gay pride day? It’s a great way to get new members. You 
need two volunteers to work at least one hour during the day. The

Pride Law Fund party Tuesday 


by Vicky Kolakowski 

T wenty years after its found¬ 
ing as a tax-exempt spin-off 
from the Bay Area Lawyers 
for Individual Freedom (BALIF), 
the National Educational Foun¬ 
dation for Individual Rights 
(NEFIR) will grab the spotlight, 
and announce a name change to 
the Pride Law Fund, at its “Spring 
Celebration and Cocktail Party” 
this Tuesday, April 13. 

For the past 15 years, NEFIR 
has funded law students working 
on diverse projects on behalf of 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 


transgender (LGBT) community 
and people living with HIV/AIDS 
in the Bay Area and across the 
country. Because the organization 
funds others to perform legal ser¬ 
vices and provides no direct ser¬ 
vices itself, its efforts have re¬ 
mained largely unknown outside 
of the legal community. 

The event also celebrates the 
formal announcement of a major 
postgraduate fellowship for new 
attorneys. The fellowship will be 
named after the late San Francis¬ 
co attorney Tom Steel, one of the 
nation’s leading legal champions 
for the LGBT community. 

Each year, the Steel Fellowship 


would fund a new attorney for 
that year to support their work on 
projects to address unmet legal 
needs in the LGBT community 
anywhere in the United States. It 
would be the first fellowship of its 
type in the nation. 

The Pride Law Fund an¬ 
nounced the start of a $250,000 
endowment drive to support the 
Steel Fellowship at the BALIF an¬ 
nual dinner last month. 

The Steel Fellowship Commit¬ 
tee has secured a “challenge 
pledge,” with a benefactor agree¬ 
ing to match donations of $500 or 
more, up to a total of $50,000. 
Anyone who supports the fund 


with $500 will be recognized as a 
“Founder” and anyone supporting 
the fund at $1,000 or more will be 
recognized as a “Visionary.” 

Present summer fellowships 
for law students recognize Rober¬ 
ta Achtenberg, Steven Block, Mary 
Morgan, and Steven Richter, and 
provide financial support for law 
students working at a wide range 
of national and local legal support 
and advocacy organizations. 

The spring celebration and 
cocktail party will be held from 5 
to 7:30 p.m. at Restaurant 2223, 
located at 2223 Market Street be¬ 
tween Sanchez and Noe streets. 


The event is free, but a donation 
is suggested. Partygoers can enjoy 
wine, beer, non-alcohol beverages, 
and appetizers. 

Supporters are also encour¬ 
aged to stay for dinner afterwards, 
as the restaurant has also offered 
to donate 10 percent of dinner 
proceeds to support the Steel Fel¬ 
lowship. ▼ 


For info or to RSVP, call the 
Pride Law Fund at (415) 437- 
5711. For dinner reservations, 
call Restaurant 2223 directly at 
(415) 431-0692. 


SF civil grand jury seeks members 


by Cynthia Laird 


j| ocal citizens who have time 
on their hands and who are 
1 W& interested in the workings of 
government have until this Mon¬ 
day, April 12 to fill out a prospec¬ 
tive grand juror declaration to 
volunteer to serve on the 1999- 
2000 Civil Grand Jury of the City 
and County of San Francisco. The 
19 grand jury members serve for 
one year from July to June of the 
following year, and are selected at 
random from a pool of 30 
prospective grand jurors. 

Grand jurors receive a per diem 
fee of $11 for each meeting of the 
entire grand jury and for each com¬ 
mittee meeting not to exceed four 
committee meetings per month. 
During the year it’s estimated that a 
minimum of 500 hours is required 
for grand jury service. 

The function of the civil grand 
jury is to investigate the operations 
of the various officers, depart¬ 
ments, and agencies of the city’s 
government. Each grand jury de¬ 
termines which officers, depart¬ 
ments, and agencies it will investi¬ 
gate during its term of office. 

Therese Stewart, the openly les¬ 
bian president of the Bar Associa¬ 
tion of San Francisco, told the Bay 
Area Reporter that it’s important for 
members of the lesbian, gay, bisex¬ 
ual, and transgender (LGBT) com¬ 
munity to be represented on the 
civil grand jury. “Civil grand juries 
are important on a lot of fronts. It’s 
an incredibly important role, the 
civil grand jury is effectively like a 
public attorney. The civil grand 


jury looks at wrongdoing by gov¬ 
ernment and ought to reflect the 
diversity of the community,” said 
Stewart, who’s a partner at the law 
firm Howard, Rice, Neverovski, 
Canady, Robertson & Falk. 

Stewart added that often, civil 
and criminal grand juries are 
under-represented of a communi¬ 
ty’s diversity. “When the court 
puts out a request [for grand jury 
members], it behooves those in 
communities that are under-rep¬ 
resented to find people and put 
their names in,” Stewart added. 
She acknowledged the long hours 
and low pay for civil grand jurors, 
but said service is important and 
something for people to consider. 

In order to carry out its duties, 
the civil grand jury is divided into 
committees that are assigned to re¬ 
spective departments or areas being 
investigated. The committees visit 
government facilities, meet with of¬ 
ficials, and develop recommenda¬ 
tions for improving city and coun¬ 
ty operations. The civil grand jury 
generally meets on Monday 
evenings for several hours at the 
400 McAllister Street courthouse. 
Committee meetings are held at 
other times at the convenience of 
members and any witnesses. 

Members of the civil grand 
jury are required to “disclose all 
investment and business positions 
in business entities, and income 
from any sources which have done 
business with the city and county 
in the previous two years, and in¬ 
come from all individuals who are 
employees of the city and county, 
and all interests in real property,” 
according to the San Francisco

resentative appointed by the court within

tion 9100. The time for filing claims will 
mot expire before four months from the 
hearing date noticed above. You may ex¬ 
amine the file kept by the court. If you are

Illjl In the glaring light of the San Francisco Ballet’s fourth- 

floor studio, with mirrors harshly reflecting every 
sweaty pore of his hard-working dancers, Helgi J 
Tomasson is staging the final duet from Giselle. I 

This * s ^ an F r ^ nc i sco Ballet’s first production i 

of the famous romantic work, and artistic director 1 
Tomasson is obviously as happy as a debutante 11 
WBB^k with her first mink. 

“I love this,” he says during a break. “Being here 1 
lipilP j n t h e s t u dio, working with the dancers. It’s the most 
pleasure you get from running a company.” He is also 
surprisingly passionate; his usual cool Icelandic demeanor is 
lllll obliterated by Theophile (“Art for Art’s sake”) Gautier’s pathetic 
BBF love story. He urges dancer Vadim Solomakha to remember, “You 
have betrayed her, but she forgives you. Now you’ll never see her, 
never hold her again; you must make us feel what you are feeling.” 
The sweet-faced Solomakha, who partners the Shanghai-born Yuan 
Yuan Tan in her first-ever Giselle, looks slightly befuddled. Later he tells 
me it is hard to simulate “feelings” in the studio, “without costumes, lights, 
real music.” (Rehearsal pianist Michael McGraw emphasizes the rhythmic 
cues with panache, but it is not quite the same thing as Adolphe Adam’s con¬ 
fectionery scoring.) “When I am on stage,” Solomakha says, “it is easy to for¬ 
get about everything but the character; in rehearsal it is difficult.” 

The name of the ballet is Giselle, so naturally everybody thinks in terms 
of its leading lady. Yet this 1841 two-acter concerns not just the innocent 
country girl Giselle, who is betrayed by her noble lover and dies of 
a broken heart. It is also a tale of redemption, uniquely resonant j 

in our deeply cynical age. 

Albrecht, a nobleman fooling around incognito 
amongst the peasants, unwittingly causes Giselle’s 
breakdown and death. How was he to know she took 
their romance so seriously? Now he is doomed, 
by decree of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis 
g|. (ghosts of girls betrayed in love), to dance JjF f 
HI himself to terminal exhaustion. . 

mjk Unless 


the ghost of Giselle can 
help sustain the young man until 
dawn, when the Wilis’ power 
fades. Then she returns to the ^

- H h springtime, and a young 
man’s fancy turn to 
I m thoughts of... genocide. So 
far it hasn’t been a pretty spring at 
all, has it, not with Yugoslav total¬ 
itarian Slobodan “the Slob” 
Milosevic’s “ethnic cleansing” 
(hated term) of Kosovo finally 
looming in the nationalcon- 
sciousness, such that it is. 

We can only be amazed 
at the capacity for de¬ 
nial on the part of iso¬ 
lationists proclaiming 
it’s “not our business.!” 

But like fashion victim 
Cleopatra, there are al¬ 
ways plenty of 
queens of da Nile. 

The flavor of 
fascist aggression 
was in the air last 
week when assuredly non-fascist 
maestro Michael Tilson Thomas 
returned to the podium with the 
San Francisco Symphony and 
prefaced a performance of Wag¬ 
ner’s Siegfried Idyll with an anec¬ 
dote about the composer’s de¬ 
scendant Winifred^ Wagner 
pouring Tilson Thomas tea in 
Bayreuth. When informed that he 
took no sugar, Fraulein Wagner 
declared imperiously, “But the 
Fiihrer took six lumps!” 

Thank the Valkyries there were 
no goose-steps to be heard earlier 
in the week, when incendiary In¬ 
diana-bred violinist Joshua Bell 



Joshua Bell 


took the stage at Herbst Theatre 
accompanied by British pianist 
Simon Mulligan. It’s true that 
we found both musicians to be 
just so Generation seX! Visited 
backstage after the concert, they 
made ejaculations like, “Cool!” 
and, “Neat!” Up close and person¬ 
al (so close one wanted to towel 
him off), Bell uttered sweet yelps 
of joy upon recognizing our 
music critic (who had penned a 
glamorous cover story on 
him for Strings maga¬ 
zine) and graciously 
accepted our own 
paltry offer of con¬ 
gratulations. One 
could also see “the 
Wound”: the scar on 
young Bell’s neck where 
the virtuoso’s in¬ 
strument rubs 
against him in all 
of his dynamic 
thrusts of the bow. 
If one wanted to employ a eu¬ 
phemism, one might call it a hick- 
ey given by Stradivarius. All our 
nurturing instincts kicked in, and 
we wanted to salve that wound 
immediately. 

Rear window 

Filmmaker David Cronen¬ 
berg’s latest sci-fi opus, eXistenZ, 
which opens April 23, will not dis¬ 
appoint his fans. However, anyone 
with a fear of penetration from 
the rear should probably avoid 
this one — or at least take a cell 
phone to the screening to facili¬ 
tate that 911 call. Cronenberg in¬ 
vents living game pods that attach 
to human beings through an um¬ 
bilical cord inserted into a bio¬ 
port. The bioport is a hole made 
at the base of a human’s spine 
which the “UmbyCord” plugs 
into. For a good connection, you 
need lots of lube. eXistenZ scores 
big when humpy, terrified Jude 
Law lies face-down and spread- 
eagled as Willem Dafoe stands 
menacingly behind him with his 
large, phallic Bioport Insertion 
Gun cocked and ready. Law takes 
it like a man. 

Ladies’ woman 

Switching genders for a 
change, word is that the staged 
reading of Irish lesbian novelist 

Emma Donoghue’s play Ladies 




THE LADY IS A TRAMP 

...my life as Frank Sinatra” 

Starring Pam Munter 



Emma Donoghue 


and Gentlemen at the Magic The¬ 
atre had them rolling in the aisles 
when they weren’t weeping at the 
beauty of the very queer romance. 
How often can you say that about 
a staged reading? You still have a 
chance to catch the last weekend 
of the Irish Women’s Playwright 
Fest; don’t miss the fabulous 
Anne Darragh in Mrs. Sweeney.

Steven Watson 


Homosexual plot 

Sometimes it’s good to take a 
step back from the popular scene 
and consider from whence we 
came. Author Steven Watson’s 
Prepare for Saints: Gertrude 
Stein, Virgil Thomson, and the 
Mainstreaming of American Mod¬ 
ernism (Random House) tells the 
story of the inspired creation of 
lesbian icon Stein and homo com¬ 
poser Thomson’s seminal opera 
Four Saints in Three Acts, but it 
also examines the cultural up¬ 
heavals in America in the ’20s and 
’30s, during the time of the 
opera’s gestation. It turns out that 
the institutionalization of the 
avant-garde (MOMA, NYC Bal¬ 
let) was the work of a rather small 
cadre of homosexuals, many of 
whom began their cultural mov¬ 
ing and shaking at Harvard to¬ 
gether. Watson supplies a handy 
chart, with the principal players 
labeled “homosexual/bisexual” 
where appropriate. We learn that 
Stein tried to convince rampant 
ego Ernest Hemingway he was a 
latent homo. Also, Watson writes 
of society hostess Muriel Draper: 
“Pointing young homosexual

K¥ 


Rhino to get 
‘Barebacking’ 

New Fisher play in 2000 


in'Francisco Gay ^Men-s Chorus 


STOLICHNAYA 

RUSSIAN VODKA 


by Richard Dodds 


J ohn Fisher, the San Francisco 
playwright who made a 
merry musical out of Medea, 
is putting himself in the middle 
of the barebacking controversy 
for his newest play. Barebacking 
— a Sex Panic! Comedy will have 
its premiere as part of Theatre 
Rhinoceros’ 1999-2000 season. 
Only the Fisher play and a new 
work by the trio Latin Hustle ( Full 
Front Rudity) are presently locked 
in for the seven-show series at the 
veteran gay and lesbian theater. 

Fisher first gained Bay Area 
renown with such campy 
crossover fare as Medea — the 
Musical and The History of Gay 
Sex. His more recent works in¬ 
clude Combat!, which looked at 
gays in the military during World 
War II, and Titus!, an outdoor 
spectacle staged in the Yerba 
Buena Gardens. 

His latest play will be pushing 
new boundaries, he said. “It will 
definitely be a little harder to take 
than the other things I’ve done,” 
the gay playwright and director 
said. “I don’t feel the need at this 
forum to keep the gloves on.” 

Fisher had become intrigued 
with the barebacking controversy 
when he read a collection of es¬ 
says on the subject by noted gay 
activists and authors in the Har¬ 
vard Gay and Lesbian Review. “I 
began thinking what it would be 
like to be coming out of the clos¬ 
et now that sex has become so 
politicized,” Fisher said, “but I 
couldn’t imagine where I would 
do a play about it because it’s just 
so gay.” 

The idea was still germinating 
when Doug Holsclaw, associate 
artistic director of Theatre Rhino, 
called Fisher to ask if there were 
any projects he would be interest¬ 
ed in developing at Rhino. Fisher 
has since laid out the plot, though 
the play itself is still to be written. 
Holsclaw and Fisher expect its 
premiere will be in the first 
months of 2000. 

“Essentially, it’s a political 
comedy, sort of a farce in a way,” 
Fisher said. “It’s about people 
making decisions, but it’s not 
going to end with them all dying. 
It’s not like an AIDS play.” 

Resistance 

Fisher didn’t hold strong opin¬ 
ions about the new advocacy of 
unprotected sex when he began 
thinking about the play, but as his 
research continued, he began to 
find his sympathies leaning to¬ 
ward those who resist dictated 
sexual behavior. “Not that I’m 
pro-barebacking,” he said, “but I 
do get very itchy about politics 
getting involved in these sorts of 
things.” 

Fisher plans to take the liber¬ 
ties that working at Theatre Rhino 
can offer. “There will be nudity 
and all that stuff,” he said, “and it 
will probably be completely gra¬ 
tuitous. But if I don’t do that, I 
will have missed something in gay 
theater. I feel like it’s time to drop 
my pants and say, ‘I can do that, 
too, damn it. I’m not such a 
prude.’” 

In addition to Barebacking and 
the new comedy show that Latin 
Hustle is developing, Holsclaw 
said the theater is in negotiation

Straight outta 
Hong Kong 

Gay playwright Reggie Cheong-Leen 


by Richard Dodds 


or a kid in Hong Kong in 
the ’50s, movies were the 
thing. American movies. 
“There were movies in Cantonese, 
but we didn’t go to those,” said 
playwright Reggie Cheong-Leen. 
“Television was only on the air 
two hours a day, but my family 
didn’t even have a TV. And there 
was no theater at all.” 

Cheong-Leen’s early notions of 
theater came from the movie ver¬ 
sions of West Side Story, My Fair 
Lady, and The Sound of Music, but 
his first cinematic memories are 
more primal. “Steve Reeves,” he 
said, “made a big impression.” 

While he struggled with his 
sexuality, at one point even con¬ 
templating becoming a priest, the 
images that intrigued and tor¬ 
mented him were white. And 
when he finally did come out, he 
only had eyes for light-skinned 
gents. “I was trying to be a ba¬ 
nana,” Cheong-Leen said, “yellow 
on the outside and white on the 
inside.” 

His own journey of self-dis¬ 
covery as a gay Asian male has its 



Reggie Cheong-Leen 


mirror in his play The Nanjing 
Race, opening this week at the 
New Conservatory Theatre. 
“Eventually, you have to face up to 
who you are,” he said, “and writ¬ 
ing this play was part of the 
process. Now I know there are 
beautiful people in every color.”

an American businessman of 
Japanese and European ancestry, 
who’d rather not acknowledge the 
Nipponese component. On a 
business trip to Nanjing, China, 
where the Japanese staged a par¬ 
ticularly brutal massacre during 
World War II, his usual claims to 
all-American status don’t work, 
especially when he begins to falls 
in love with a hotel floor-boy ob¬ 
sessed with the injustices of the 
past. Meanwhile, another hotel 
valet, this one straight and des¬ 
perate to get out of the country, is 
courting the businessman with 
prospects of financial rewards. 

“Philip has to choose between 
the one who could be helpful or 
the other one whom he really 
likes,” Cheong-Leen said. “There’s 
humor in it, but basically it’s a 
tender story about three people.” 

The play had its first perfor¬ 
mance in 1993 in a staged reading 
at the Cleveland Public Theater’s 
Festival of New Plays. Its first full 
production came the following 
year at the McCarter Theatre in 
Princeton, N.J. In 1995, it was 
named Best New Regional Play by 
the American Theater Critics As¬ 
sociation. And then, nothing. 

“I’ve sent out scripts for years, 
and the few theaters that re¬ 
sponded said it was too hard to 
cast,” Cheong-Leen said. Asian- 
American theater companies 
where the play would logically 
find a home weren’t enthusiastic 
either, telling the playwright that 
his work didn’t address their con¬ 
cerns. 

“If you talk about The Three 
Sisters, it’s all these Russians run¬ 
ning around, but it’s still some¬ 
thing people identify with,” he 
said. “Maybe now that Asians are 
reaching second and third gener¬ 
ations in this country, we’ll be bet¬ 
ter able to accept who we are, and 
not always so eager to blend in, 
and then maybe can move on to 
real drama.” 

Opportunity knocks 

Cheong-Leen, who has made 
his living for 20 years in the gar¬ 
ment industry, had grown dis¬ 
couraged about playwriting when 
the New Conservatory Theatre 
called. Arturo Catricala, NCT’s 
resident director, had heard about 
the play from a friend, and 
tracked down a copy of the script. 
Cheong-Leen had seen several re¬ 
hearsals when he sat down for an 
interview, and he was already feel¬ 
ing his theatrical batteries being 
recharged. 

“After seeing this beautiful 
production, I realized theater is 
still magic for me,” he said. “Ar¬ 
turo has brought out a lot of col¬ 
ors that weren’t in the original 
production. In that production, 
two straight actors played the gay 
characters and a gay actor played 
the straight character. Here it is 
reversed, and you can call it type¬ 
casting, but it works better.” 

Cheong-Leen, 47, didn’t dis¬ 
cover the magic of the theater 
until he saw Follies on Broadway 
in 1971, while he was a business 
administration major at Notre 
Dame. “I first came to the United 
States to go to high school be¬ 
cause it was the thing to do,” he 
said. “I had an aunt in Pittsburgh 
who was a good Catholic, and her

Song of the South 

Robert Altman's ' Cookie's Fortune' 


by Robert Julian 


|| obert Altman is America’s 
most inconsistent director. 
- I Capable of extraordinary 
brilliance ( Nashville, The Player), 
he can also churn out stinkbombs 
like Ready to Wear and Kansas City 
that, for any other director, would 
be career-killers. Cookie’s Fortune, 
the latest addition to the Altman 
catalog, falls somewhere between 
his two extremes. It is a sly and 
simple Mississippi morality tale, 
brought to life by colorful charac¬ 
ters and a strong ensemble cast. 

Patricia Neal plays Cookie, an 
eccentric widow who lives in a 
fine Victorian home in the small 
town of Holly Springs, Mississip¬ 
pi. Cookie is a small-town Miss 
Daisy to her resident friend and 
manservant, Willis (Charles S. 
Dutton). But Cookie’s unhappi¬ 
ness over the loss of her husband 
leads her to suicide. When her es¬ 
tranged nieces Camille (Glenn 
Close) and Cora (Julienne 
Moore) find the body, they hatch 
a plot that ultimately backfires on 
the mean-spirited Camille. 

Altman adopts a slow, mean¬ 
dering pace to tell this story of “just 
desserts,” and the viewer must take 
pleasure in the series of wonderful 
moments the cast delivers —- mo¬ 
ments that do not arrive swiftly. Yet 
it is impossible to criticize Altman’s 
choice, because the timing of the 
story seems so right for the lacon¬ 
ic pace of the small backwater that 
is Holly Springs. Nothing happens 


quickly here, and if Altman ap¬ 
proached this Southern story like 
Herbert Ross, we would have a 
film as embarrassingly false as Steel 
Magnolias. 

Blues background 

The leitmotif of Cookie’s For¬ 
tune is the blues, and composer 
Dave Stewart (formerly of the Eu- 
rythmics) produces wonderfully 
appropriate musical accompani¬ 
ment with evocative steel guitar 
riffs that underscore the action. 
Cinematographer Toyomichi Ku- 
rita captures the overly familiar, 
claustrophobic feel of a small Mis¬ 
sissippi Delta town in all its self- 
conscious glory; and Dona Grana- 
ta’s costumes clearly delineate the 
right from the wrong side of the 
tracks. Although Julianne Moore 
and Glenn Close take the female 
acting honors, Charles S. Dutton 
provides the film’s most irresistible 
charm as the endearing, loyal 
Willie. His is a performance of 
subtlety and quiet confidence. 

Altman’s Mississippi rogues 
gallery includes Liv Tyler as the 
slatternly Emma; Chris O’Don¬ 
nell as the young cop who can’t 
keep his hands off her; Donald 
Moffat as the avuncular town 
lawyer; and Ned Beatty as the 
local police lieutenant. This as¬ 
semblage of small town Southern 
archetypes is made believable by 
the talented cast and Altman’s 
universally acknowledged skill for 
getting actors to work at the top 
of their form. Anne Rapp’s 
screenplay gives the actors an op¬ 


portunity to define the gravity of 
each character’s dilemma without 
ever losing the wonderful sense of 
goofball humor that lurks just 
below the surface. There are many 
funny moments in Cookie’s For¬ 
tune, and although the whole re¬ 
mains less than the sum of its 
parts, it still works — with that 
quintessential^ Southern attitude 
of, “Ah really should go conquer 
the world, but it’s so hot this year, 
Ah guess Ah’ll just have to stay 
right here and see what sort of 
mischief Ah can stir up.” T 


Cookie’s Fortune opens Friday, 
April 9 at Bay Area theatres.

seminary in Erie.” And so, at 
Christmas, he found himself 
singing Christmas carols in Pol¬ 
ish. 

When it came time to apply to 
colleges, he was channeled toward 
Catholic universities. He had a 
choice between Fordham in New 
York and Notre Dame in Indiana. 
“I think if I had discovered New 
York City at that time, I would 
have gone into Greenwich Village 
and never resurfaced.” 

Instead, he found himself at 
Notre Dame surrounded by “all 
these beautiful and healthy jocks, 
but totally not open to anything.” 
He finally found his way out of 



the closet back in Hong Kong, 
when a bohemian cousin who had 
studied at Berkeley introduced 
him to some of her gay friends. 

“But I was miserable in Hong 
Kong,” he said. “It’s very small in 
both space and mentality, and I 
felt claustrophobic. And my father 
was in politics, and I didn’t want 
to jeopardize his situation.” 
Cheong-Leen returned Jo the 
United States, becoming a citizen 
in the 1980s. 

Chinese was the first language 
in the Cheong-Leen household, 
with English as a close second. 
“When you write in English,” he 
said, “but when English is a 
learned language, you’re not con¬ 
strained by the normal rules of 
grammar and usage, and you’re 
free to reinvent it.” 


Cheong-Leen is job-free at the 
moment, as he takes stock of life 
and career, but his dream is to put 
more Asians on stage, to create 
both roles and understanding. 
“And I want to promote the Asian 
man as a sex object,” he said. 

Has he found romance in life 
own life? “Repeatedly,” Cheong- 
Leen replied. “I love the intense 
passion of falling in love, and I’m 
always trying to recreate that. 
Artistic people want that intensity 
of feeling that most people avoid. 
I’m not satisfied just tasting the 
pleasures of life. I’m greedy.” T

Animation nightmare 

'Spike and Mike's Fest J at the Castro 



From 1%9's Bambi Meets Godzilla 


by Gary Morris 


0 ne of the pleasures of the 
counterculture that was 
thought to have disap¬ 
peared along with paper dresses 
and liberals is the “head” movie 
— you know, films like El Topo or 
2001 or Liquid Sky that, while 
hoping for big mainstream audi¬ 
ences, were thought to be secret¬ 
ly aimed at stoners. And it’s cer¬ 
tainly arguable that the last 20 
minutes of 2001 or the entirety of 
El Topo were best appreciated in 
an altered state of consciousness. 

But the phenomenon has con¬ 
tinued to thrive in at least one 
venue: the Spike and Mike Festival 
of Animation. This annual collec¬ 
tion of what’s touted as the best 
in recent short animation has 
enough narrative non-sequiturs, 
existential angst, and antisocial 
activities to appeal to its drug- 
swilling demographic of 18-30- 
year-olds. The downside is that 


you might have to take drugs in 
order to endure some of the en¬ 
tries in this often tiresome mix of 
visual pyrotechnics and concep¬ 
tual cliches. 

The first short, Pierre Coffin’s 
Pings, points to the larger limita¬ 
tions of the series. Having cute ’n’ 
cuddly creatures like the Pings at¬ 
tacked by some malevolent or 
mindless force filigrees this festi¬ 
val, but it was done better 50 
years ago by Tex Avery, who made 
an art of assaulting the Disney 
school of sentimental animation. 
Pings’ painfully predictable litany 
in this realm — one Ping is 
squashed by a polar bear, another 
is eaten by a shark — is more 
stultifying than shocking, and 
seems too thin even for the brief 
3-minute running time. 

Another problem is that too 
many of these shorts devote end¬ 
less resources — the credits are 
sometimes as long as the films — 
and elaborate technical strategies 
to dress up a lack of ideas. Eric 


Fernandes’ Son of Bambi Meets 
Godzilla is a case in point. This 
update of Marv Newland’s classic 
1969 Bambi Meets Godzilla has 
Pixar-perfect computer anima¬ 
tion, but it’s all for naught: while 
Bambi grazes, a big gun pops out 
of the ground and kills Godzilla. 
That’s it. It’s doubtful there’s 
enough acid in the world to make 
this waste of time palatable. (The 
inclusion of Newland’s homely, 
endearing original only empha¬ 
sizes how bad the sequel is.) 

A wobbly-voiced Judy Gar¬ 
land singing “More” is the only 
plus in Busby, Anna Henckel- 
Donnemarck’s technically pol¬ 
ished but pointless homage to 
Busby Berkeley. The filmmaker 
substitutes boring configurations 
of hands for Berkeley’s fun fascist 
geometries, and even her choice 
of “More” is suspect. Why not “By 
a Waterfall” or “Lullaby of Broad¬ 
way” or another song actually as¬ 
sociated with Berkeley? 

Christa Moesker’s Sientje of¬ 


fers a blueprint for riot grrrls 
with a fat-thighed little brat who 
terrorizes her teddy bear, and 


grows to mammoth proportions 
and stomps all over screaming 
adults. Moesker’s lack of inspira¬ 
tion is evident in the film’s cop- 
out “it’s only a fantasy” ending. 
Luc Otter’s VHS/CarrHot is a 
beautiful but brainless exercise in 
high technique distinguished 
only by the distressing image of 
an animated carrot being raped 
— grated, that is — by an ani¬ 
mated grater. 

Camp figures 

Happily, there are a handful of 
entries here that may linger in the 
mind when the lights go down. 
Christophe and Wolfgang Lauen- 
stein’s Balance has the skewed-re- 
alistic look of a Magritte painting 
as five hollow-eyed men, dressed 
alike with numbers painted on 
their backs, try desperately to stay 
upright on a mysterious flat slab 
floating in the air. Reading the 
film as a Holocaust allegory — 
impossible to avoid — adds 
poignancy and a pervasive sense 
of disquiet. 

Emma Calder’s The Queen’s 
Monastery benefits by avoiding 
the curse of obvious computer 
imagery. This award-winning 
short uses engagingly simple lines 
and splashes of watercolor to sug¬ 
gest a house, a room, a love affair, 
and even a war, as battle explo¬ 
sions are visualized in a riot of 
color. 

Digital Domain’s Tightrope, 
about a jester’s battle with a 
masked man as they both traverse 
a tightrope, also gains by subvert¬ 
ing the pompous parading of 
computer technique that afflicts 
most of the entries here. It’s ex¬ 
tremely polished, but uses its 
sheen to powerful effect, as if its 
characters, both of them chilling¬ 
ly near-real, are trapped in a con¬ 
vincing pseudo-reality, with the 
tightrope bouncing tenuously in 
the foreground and a mysterious 
choking fog in the background. 
Queer audiences will enjoy the 
gay subtext, as the queenly jester 
initially tries to befriend/seduce 
the masked man with preening, 
mincing gestures and expres¬ 
sions. But this queen proves to be 
a skilled adversary, too, smiling 
and fluttering his eyelashes as he 
casually unleashes an arsenal of 
unlikely weapons — a yo-yo, a 
juggler’s ball — on the fatally un¬ 
cooperative masked man. ▼

Neato bosso Keanu 

Keanu Reeves rides 'The Matrix' 



by Tim Nasson 


11 |§ ore than a decade has 
' passed since Keanu Reeves 
entertained high school 
kids throughout the world as half 
of the comic duo of Bill and Ted 
in the two Bill and Ted... adven¬ 
tures. 

Before that, Reeves stole The 
River’s Edge in 1986, and Gus Van 
Sants My Own Private Idaho, two 
films much different from either 
of the Bill and Teds or his most re¬ 
cent endeavor, The Matrix. 

In a recent interview, Reeves, 
not your average Joe, was some¬ 
what hesitant to reveal a lot about 
himself, but gradually through the 
time we spent together opened up 
quite a bit and discussed his 
somewhat eccentric childhood 
and his new film The Matrix — in 
which he did all of his own stunts 
— in great detail. 

Keanu, whose name is obvi¬ 
ously not a common one, is the 
personification of a real melting 
pot of nationalities. He was born 
in Beirut to an American mother 
and a half-Hawaiian, half-Chinese 
father. His parents met in Beirut 
while his mother was working as a 
showgirl in a local club. His father 
was working as a geologist. 

The family soon moved to 
Australia, where Keanu’s younger 
sister was born in 1966. Soon af¬ 
terward, his parents divorced, and 
his mother carted her children to 
New York City, where she met 
Broadway and Hollywood pro¬ 
ducer Paul Aaron. Their marriage 
did not last more than a year, yet 
they had already moved again, 
this time to Toronto, where the 
family attained Canadian citizen¬ 
ship, which Keanu still retains. 

There were two more men in 
Keanu’s life during his adoles¬ 
cence. First was the rock ’n’ roll 
promoter Robert Miller. Keanu’s 
mother’s fourth husband was Jack 
Bond, a hair salon owner whom 
she divorced in 1994. 

Through all his stepdads, 
Keanu had a wide variety of expe¬ 
riences. “I got a chance to wrestle 
with rocker Alice Cooper,” he said, 
“and I spent a lot of time one year 
in a Jewish summer camp. 

“I last saw my real father when 
I was 13, when I took a trip to 
Hawaii,” he added. 

Keanu described himself as a 
“middle-class white boy. A bour¬ 
geois, middle-class white boy with 
an absent father, a strong-willed 
mother, and two beautiful sisters.” 

At a young age, Keanu divided 
his spare time between hockey 
and theater. “I sometimes mixed 
the two by reciting Shakespeare 
while tending goal during a hock¬ 
ey game.” 

Dog boy 

Dressed in a black V-neck T- 
shirt under a green sport jacket, 
and blue jeans, Keanu sat com¬ 
fortably in a suite at the Ritz Carl¬ 
ton in Pasadena for our interview. 
Fingernails painted black, face un¬ 
shaven, red string wrapped 
around his left wrist, and hair 
going in more directions than Bill 
Clinton’s missiles, he looked more 
like his alter ego from the rock 
group Dogstar he formed ten 
years ago than a conventional 
movie star. 

The star of The Matrix — the 
sophomore effort of the Wa- 
chowski Brothers, the team re¬ 
sponsible for the lesbian thriller 
Bound — got his start in acting at 


his Toronto high school and then 
“luckily landed a couple of roles 
in television commercials and re¬ 
gional plays.” 

Reeves’ first big break, the one 
that got him noticed by the big 
guys, came when he secured the 
starring role in the homoerotic 
play Wolfboy in Toronto, after he 
had dropped out of high school at 
the age of 17. 

Keanu took the big step of 
leaving Canada behind and meet¬ 
ing up with his stepfather Paul 
Aaron, the producer, in 1986. “My 
first manager thought my name 
‘Keanu’ was too exotic,” Reeves re¬ 
veals. “So we changed it to K.C. 
Reeves. For about a minute. I was 
named Keanu, and that is what I 
wanted to be known as.” 

At 23, Keanu took up another 
hobby that he had been passion¬ 
ate about for years but had never 
had the courage to toy with. “I 
started playing the bass,” he said, 
“and loved it and have been doing 
it ever since, touring with my 
band Dogstar.” 

In fact, Reeves has turned 
down roles in films so that he 
could tour the world with his 
band. 

Some of the films he has 
passed on have ended up being 
better missed. For example, he 
adamantly refused to star in the 
sequel to his box-office smash 
Speed. I asked him if he thought 
his decision to turn that film 
down had anything to do with 
good intuition. 

“I don’t know,” he answered. 
“But in any event, all’s well that 
turns out well.” 

Lately, and throughout his life, 
it seems, everything has turned up 
roses for the versatile actor. Last 
seen on screen opposite A1 Pacino 
in The Devil’s Advocate, Keanu 
took a chance on another action 
film, this one adding sci-fi into the 
mix. 

According to the directors Wa- 
chowskl, whom I spoke to earlier 
in the day, “The comic book and 
graphic novel culture has long ex¬ 
amined the dramatic possibilities 
of alternate realities — places 
where the laws of physics, biology 
or time are made to be broken.” 

“We grew up exploring ideas 
that challenge the current percep¬ 
tions of reality,” said Larry Wa- 
chowski. “And we began our writ¬ 
ing careers developing those ideas. 
The Matrix grew out of the un¬ 
conventional literature that we 
read as well as our long-time in¬ 
terest in and knowledge of classic 
mythology and legend. 


“We believe passionately in the 
importance of mythology and the 
way it informs culture,” he added. 

Looking good 

The directors’ decision to cast 
Keanu had a lot to do with the 
actor’s good looks. 

“Keanu has a boyish quality 
about him that was perfect for the 
role, but at the same time he has a 
maturity that allows his character 
to develop and eventually take 
control of the situation,” Larry 
concluded. 

Keanu responded, “When I 
first read the script I thought it 
was pretty amazing. It has a great 
combination of crazy action, ex¬ 
traordinary characters and some 
interesting themes. And Larry and 
Andy are such great guys — very 
generous and very kind. It all 
evolved into something I hadn’t 
seen before in a film — a meeting 
of heart and soul and spirit and 
action. 

“I play an interesting character 
named Thomas Anderson, known 
later as Neo. He is someone who 
is alienated from the world 
around him and indeed very sus¬ 
picious of life itself. He is search¬ 
ing for something that will some¬ 
how make sense of his life, and 
believes that Morpheus, Laurence 
Fishburne’s character, has the an¬ 
swers to all of his questions.” 

Filmed on location in Australia 
— “because the costs could be 
kept down” — The Matrix takes 
place in a universe run by com- 
’ puters using human beings as bat¬ 
teries for bio-electrical energy. 
This “people power” fuels the ar¬ 
tificial intelligence known as The 
Matrix, which has created a virtu¬ 
al reality to make its inhabitants 
think they are living happy, cre¬ 
ative and productive lives. But in 
reality, they are only providing the 
energy that keeps The Matrix 
going. There are, however, a few 
human beings, including Mor¬ 
pheus (Fishburne) and Trinity 
(Carrie-Anne Moss), who have 
broken free from The Matrix and 
are searching to destroy it, re¬ 
cruiting Neo along the way. 

Though Reeves was seen in a 
sci-fi movie a couple of years ago, 
the dreadful Johnny Mnemonic, he 
is hopeful and confident that The 
Matrix will keep him on the list of 
employable actors. 

“I’m hopeful that I can remain 
successful enough so that people 
want to continue to hire me,” he 
said. “I love making movies, but I 
want to make movies that make 
money.” T

grave, leaving Albrecht with 
the sobering knowledge that he 
destroyed her — but also that 
she loved him enough to forgive 
his betrayal. This is a three-hanky 
affair when it is done right, and 
the Albrecht is every bit as impor¬ 
tant as the Giselle. 

Leading three 

In mid-March, when 
began working on this piece, 
Tomasson was rehearsing 
five couples, of whom the 
leading three — barring 
injuries — would dance 
the opening weekend: 

Lucia Lacarra, a 23- 
year-old Spanish 
ballerina paired 
with Yuri Pos- 
sokhov, SFB’s 
resident hunk; 

Tan and Solo- 
makha, the most 
physically ro¬ 
mantic of the cou¬ 
ples, with their soft attack 
and floating line; and Joan¬ 
na Berman, perennially un¬ 
lucky with partners (they 
seem to be either injured or clue¬ 
less), who may just have hit the 
jackpot with newcomer Pierre- 
Frangois Vilanoba. 

The 6’1” Frenchman with the 
sherry-colored eyes and chiseled 
cheekbones is excited about his first 
Albrecht. (Solomakha has per¬ 
formed the role in Japan, with 
Nagoya’s Ochi Ballet, where he 
danced off-and-on for three years 
after emigrating from his native 
Ukraine.) Vilanoba, who danced 
with the Paris Opera Ballet for 
nearly a decade, followed his wife,

SFB corps member Rachel Rufer, to 
San Francisco, where they enthuse 
about the city, the ballet company 
and Tomasson’s leadership. 

Both Solomakha and Vilanoba 
give their boss high marks for his 
sensitivity to their physical needs. 
(So often, ballet companies treat 
dancers like cannon fodder.) 
Solomakha needed a foot opera¬ 
tion shortly after joining SFB in 
1995, but Tomasson assured him 
the company would wait for his 
recovery. Solomakha admits that 
now other ballet companies have

Both young men, different

Solomakha is all shy, sideways

Vilanoba says simply, “It is beauti¬

very dramatic, very sad.”

My first Albrecht was Igor 
Youskevitch with Ballet Theatre in 
the ’50s. Lean and saturnine, he 
haunted my dreams for decades; 
if you were going to be seduced 
and abandoned, this was the way 
to go. Other notable Albrechts in 
my ballet experience have been 
Donald MacLeary, Anthony Dow¬ 
ell and Rudolf Nureyev (with the 
Royal Ballet), Russians Nicolai 
Fadeyechev, Vladimir Vasiliev and 
Andris Liepa, and ABT’s Mikhail 
Baryshnikov and Wes Chapman. 

My two favorite Albrechts, 
however, were the Danish Erik 
Bruhn and the Hungarian Ivan 
Nagy. Bruhn was the greater all- 
around dancer and artist, but 
Nagy was the most handsome, ro¬ 
mantic male dancer I’ve ever seen. 
His greatest strength — in addi¬ 
tion to his impeccable manners 

— was the way he presented his 
ballerina. With just one look, he 
convinced the audience they were 


watching the most adorable, cher- 
ishable, wonderful woman alive. 

Solomakha, though younger 
and less sophisticated than Nagy 
was when he defected to America, 
reminds me of the Hungarian 
danseur. Their similar willowy 
physique conceals the leg strength 
that makes them such good part¬ 
ners. Their personal modesty on 
stage, such a relief from the in- 
yer-face arrogance that charac¬ 
terizes many male dancers 
today, is both touching and 
makes Albrecht a more 
convincing seducer in 
my view. Even a country 
girl could see through 
a self-absorbed, swag¬ 
gering cad like 
Nureyev, however 
4 thrilling he may 
have been. 

You have to feel 
that Albrecht is 
worth saving; it 
adds a layer of po¬ 
etry and poignan¬ 
cy to a ballet al¬ 
ready loaded with both. 
_ However, all dance drama 
% is achieved by music and 
e movement; acting and 
5 bravura don’t cut it if mu¬ 
sically is missing. Giselle is 
a special case because it is not a 
“classical” ballet. That term is re¬ 
served for turn-of-the-century 
heroic epics like the three great 
Tchaikovsky ballets currently in 
SFB’s repertory. 

It takes stamina, technique, 
theatricality to perform those 
pieces well, as SFB has proved. But 
Giselle is something more, a prod¬ 
uct of an earlier age — half a cen¬ 
tury before the definitive Swan 
Lake production. Despite its 
Rhineland setting, it is a quintes¬ 
sential French ballet and requires 
a style not easily achieved by 
today’s hard-edged technicians. 
The movement, originally chore¬ 
ographed by Jules Perrot and Jean 
Coralli, though much altered in 
158 years, is softer, more poetic 
than what we consider classical. 

This is why the ideal Albrecht 
isn’t necessarily the most macho 
dancer in a company. Tomasson 
danced Albrecht and, though I 
never saw him in the role, I’d bet 
the farm his style was similar to 
Bruhn’s or Nagy’s. If he can pass 
on even half that poetry and 
yearning for beauty to Solomakha 
and Vilanoba — and also to Pos- 
sokhov, Roman Rykine, Maynard 
Parrish and any other SFB men 
technically up to role — we may 
all think we’ve died and been 
transported to the Paris Opera, 
circa 1840. Y

by Tim Pfaff 


or someone who still looks 
shockingly like the post¬ 
adolescent who became one 
of the first young musicians the 
record companies exploited for 
their sex appeal, Joshua Bell has 
matured, artistically, beyond the 
wildest dreams of critics 
like me, who, in the 
early ’80s, received a 
press kit that looked 
and felt like the basest 
pandering to the pre¬ 
sumed sexual prefer¬ 
ences of the music 
press. (Okay, there were 
more 
transcon¬ 
tinental 
phone 

calls than usual that week, but 
what does that prove?) His mag¬ 
nificent recital for San Francisco 
Performances at Herbst Theatre 
last week — a beautifully bal¬ 
anced program, handsomely 
played start to finish — was al¬ 
most enough to banish the image 
of those stone-washed jeans for 
good. 

I say almost because Bell’s sen¬ 
sual connection with his instru¬ 
ment and physical response to the 
music (this avid golfer makes any 
number of phrases look like good 
tee-shots with elegant follow- 
through) add to the pleasure of 
his performance — and he still 


dresses smartly. He, in a loose 
post-Nehru black shirt and slacks, 
and his accompanist, the young 
British pianist Simon Mulligan in 
tails over a white T-shirt, were, in 
my companion’s astute observa¬ 
tion, the picture of “Generation 
Sexers.” 

Their playing was masterful 
from the start — taut, energized, 
penetrating and drop-dead beau¬ 
tiful. The balance be¬ 
tween the instru¬ 
ments, critical to the 
success of Schubert’s 
Sonatina in D Major, 
D. 384, was ineffably 
right. Where the violin 
rightly took the lead, in 
the 

poised 
beauty of 
the cen¬ 
tral Andante, Bell let the long, 
shapely melody soar. The pair 
traded the shared material in the 
brisk outer movements with 
suavity and, when appropriate, 
enormous brio. 

The sonatas of Opus 30 were a 
highlight of Anne-Sophie Mut¬ 
ter’s and Lambert Orkis’ traversal 
of the complete cycle of the ten 
Beethoven sonatas for piano and 
violin last fall, but Bell and Mulli¬ 
gan in no way suffered by com¬ 
parison in the ensuing reading of 
the Sonata No. 7 in C Minor, Op. 
30, No. 2. It was a deeply gestural 
reading from both men, sensitive 
to both the keen interplay be-

Baby Bell 

Violinist Joshua Bell's SF recital at Herbst Theatre 


wouldn’t mind if San Francisco 
Performances brought Mulligan 
back for a solo recital. 

At any rate, the pair’s lithe, 
smoky readings of Gershwin’s 
Three Preludes in the familiar 
Heifetz transcriptions emerged 
even more appealing than on 
Gershwin Fantasy, Bell’s recent 
debut CD for Sony Classical 
(where he plays them with John 
Williams) and a high-water mark 
of the Gershwin centennial just 
past. That CD also included the 
premiere recording of a delectable 
new Fantasy for Violin and Or¬ 
chestra on Porgy and Bess, by 
Alexander Courage, in which Bell 
reportedly had a strongly shaping 
hand. 

Due out soon is the commer¬ 
cial release of the film The Red Vi¬ 
olin, by director Francois Gerard, 
whose 32 Short Films about Glenn 
Gould four years ago broke im¬ 
portant new ground in music- 
themed movies. Bell is the violin¬ 
ist on the soundtrack and even 
has a several-second cameo, 
though he dares fans to find him 
in the 18th-century costume and 
sideburns. The soundtrack CD 
will also include The Red Violin 
Chaconne the violinist commis¬ 
sioned from composer John 
Corigliano and premiered with 
the San Francisco Symphony last 
season. 

Bell makes music in more ways 
than just playing. Increasingly he 
composes his own cadenzas for 
the major concertos, and he al¬ 
ways seems involved with some 
new commission or other. His 
taut, beautifully planned and ide¬ 
ally realized recital at the Herbst 
hardly needed another encore — 
and in truth kept its shape better 
for not indulging one — but I had 
hoped, as I have for three years 
now, that he’d play “Air,” a ten- 
minute piece Aaron Jay Kernis 
wrote for him. Thankfully, the 
piece, in a version orchestrated by 
the composer that Bell has not yet 
played publicly, will appear on an 
Argo CD of new Kernis pieces due 
for imminent release. 

The Bay Area has been fortu¬ 
nate to hear a number of impor¬ 
tant works by Kernis, one of the 
best and most original composers

tween the instruments and the 
composer’s classical rhetoric. Like 
their predecessors, Bell and Mulli¬ 
gan left no note or phrase uncon¬ 
sidered while simultaneously 
keeping their interpretation safely 
this side of fussy. Still, little things 
counted, though they all were 
marshaled into a cogent tracing of 
the work’s strong architecture. 

What’s always impressed me 
about Bell’s playing is his grasp of 
whole movements and the line of 
a piece start to finish. Vivid as any 
phrase or figure may be, it has a 
place — and a deftly gauged one 
— in trajectory that seems fully 
conceived before it is begun. Hot 
spots of in-the-moment spon¬ 
taneity along the way seem the 
more vivid for having a context, 
and Bell’s beautifully dispatched 
ornaments were not only mean¬ 
ingful, they were knock-outs. 

Exhibitionist encore 

The pair’s sure feeling for 
idiom translated directly into a 
searing account of Bartok’s Rhap¬ 
sody No. 1 and a yet more ravish¬ 
ing one of the tricky, mercurial 
Romanian Dances. Bell’s haunting 
harmonics in the latter marked 
one of the expressive high-points 
of the evening, and his accom¬ 
plished gypsy fiddling elsewhere 
was engaged and engaging. 
Wieniawski’s Variations on an 
Original Theme — a last-minute 
add-on that Bell called “an encore 
whether you want it or not” — 
provided the expected exhibition¬ 
ist music for the fiddlephiles, but 
Bell’s consummate taste in such 
virtuoso fare, and his uncommon 
security and sweetness of tone in 
the stratospheric passages, an¬ 
chored the virtuoso displays in a 
deep musicality. 

As a recitalist, Bell has been 
highly adventurous in choosing 
partners, having performed with 
powerhouse pianists as individual 
as Olli Mustonen and Jean-Yves 
Thibaudet. The risks have some¬ 
times showed. In his last recital 
for San Francisco Performances, 
with Thibaudet, there was as 
much competition as collabora¬ 
tion, and the results were mixed. 
Mulligan turns out to be a major 
find and something of an ideal 
match for him. And I, for one,

For min mo mi to jack-off with menjM

See the Thing Itself! 


by Philip Campbell 


H fter two weeks of spectacu¬ 
larly successful program¬ 
ming, the San Francisco 
Symphony (SFS) is entering the 
season of spring with vigor and 
style. March went out like the 
proverbial lion with Rossini’s Sta- 
bat Mater, and the week of 
Passover and Easter saw Michael 
Tilson Thomas, back from hiatus, 
in a delightful preview of the up¬ 
coming Stravinsky festival in 
June. 



Conductor Roberto Abbado 


Regular patrons at Davies Hall 
were jolted back from the slow 
pace set by Herbert Blomstedt’s 
annual guest conducting stint 
with the SFS debut of young 
Roberto Abbado. The nephew of 
renowned conductor Claudio Ab¬ 
bado, Roberto has been making a 
name for himself in the opera 
world, and he was wise to choose 
Rossini’s religious masterpiece to 
introduce himself here. 

There is more than a whiff of 
operatic greasepaint in the big 
tunes and glorious choruses of the 
Stabat Mater. It remains a beauti¬ 
ful and pious work, but as one 
wag remarked, “That’s the happi¬ 
est piece of sad music I know.” 
Without the pervasive somber¬ 
ness of Verdi’s Requiem, Rossini’s 
score is nevertheless comparable 
in using theatrical flourishes to 
make a sacred statement. 

The sorrows of the mother of 
Christ are portrayed in a sequence 
of arias, duets, quartets and cho¬ 
ruses, accompanied by full or¬ 
chestra. Roberto Abbado was in 
confident control of his large 
forces, and he coaxed them to 
powerful effect. The mood of re¬ 
strained passion was exquisitely 
appropriate, with many moments 
of startling intensity. 

The big surprise of the evening 
was Peruvian tenor Juan Diego 
Florez. His smoldering good looks 
and ringing voice brought great 
excitement to the first aria, “Cujus 


Animam Gementem.” Also mak¬ 
ing his local debut, Florez should 
be snapped up by the Opera man¬ 
agement quickly. Slight only in 
stature, he is a real presence on the 
brink of a promising career. 

The other soloists were also ex¬ 
ceptional. Soprano Patricia 
Racette and mezzosoprano Su- 
sanne Mentzer displayed beauti¬ 
ful tone in both large and intimate 
moments, and bass Roberto Scan- 
diuzzi was more than able to fill 
the hall with rich sound. Vance 
George’s Symphony Chorus 
sounded predictably full and 
lushly harmonious. 

The evening began with prin¬ 
cipal cellist Michael Grebanier es¬ 
saying the solo role in Ernest 
Bloch’s Schelomo. Anyone who 
does not know this deftly orches¬ 
trated and moving piece should 
hasten to hear it. Grebanier is not 
a “star” performer, but his 
thoughtful and technically secure 
performance seemed just right for 
Bloch’s alternately meditative and 
extroverted “Hebraic Rhapsody.” 
The orchestra was in beautiful 
communion with their colleague. 

Center stage 

Last week, MTT breezed in 
with a foretaste of what he has in 
store for us in June, before he 
turns the podium over to a string 
of guest conductors in the inter¬ 
im. I saw him recently on Union 
Street, walking his big poodle and 
looking very hip in black jeans 
and a letterman’s jacket. It was a 
San Francisco vignette that had 
me thinking of what a fixture he 
has become here. When he walks 
to center stage at Davies Hall, he 
is also at the center of Bay Area 
music-making. 

His Good Friday concert 
opened with a very big perfor¬ 
mance of Wagner’s lovely 
Siegfried Idyll. Written as a birth¬ 
day morning surprise for Cosima 
Wagner and scored for small 
chamber forces, the concert ver¬ 
sion is more typically Wagnerian. 
Of course, MTT couldn’t resist 
showing off the beautiful new 
sonority he has encouraged from 
his orchestra and, if this Idyll was 
far from an early morning sere¬ 
nade, it was a sweet eye-opener on 
its own terms. 

Big name, big guy, big star bari¬ 
tone Thomas Hampson then 
joined the orchestra for Mahler’s 
Songs of a Wayfarer. He was not in 
the best of voice, but he compen¬ 
sated with ringing power at times 
and sustained a sense of sadder- 
but-wiser intimacy in the quieter 
moments. His German is not per¬ 
fectly idiomatic, yet he clearly has a 
genuine grasp of the words, and he 
conveyed a perfectly tasteful “con¬ 
cert” style. His slight detachment 
only added poignancy and irony. 

After intermission he returned

working in America — not the 
least of them the surpassingly 
beautiful Colored Field, written 
for the San Francisco Symphony’s 
English horn virtuoso Julie Ann 
Giacobassi (long my single fa¬ 
vorite player in the orchestra), 
premiered by the Symphony and 
recorded by it for Argo. On April 


12, the ace Peabody Trio (gradu¬ 
ates of the San Francisco Conser¬ 
vatory) will give the eagerly await¬ 
ed local premiere of Kernis’ The 
Four Seasons of Futurist Cuisine. A 
word to the wise... 

Even in a week of string-player 
thrills, it was hard to top seeing 
the Symphony’s associate princi¬ 
pal cellist, Peter Shelton, back on 
the Davies Hall stage. It’s nice to 
have you back where you belong, 
Peter. ▼ 


for Debussy’s Trois Ballades de 
Francois Villon. Hampson’s voice 
seemed perfectly suited to these 
delicate masterpieces. The archaic 
French could hardly be deemed 
unidiomatic in his pronunciation 
— who would know the differ¬ 
ence? The important thing was 
the cumulative effect, and by the 
time Hampson twinkled his way 
through the concluding paean to 
the women of Paris, he had the 
audience in the palm of his hand. 

As always, Tilson Thomas gra¬ 
ciously avoided stealing any of the 
thunder from his guest artist. He 
got his chance to tear the place up 
with his own no-holds-barred in¬ 
terpretation of what he called 
Stravinsky’s “take no prisoners” 
Symphony in Three Movements. 
If Stravinsky is indeed the com¬ 
poser of the twentieth century (he 
certainly gets my vote), then this 
Symphony and MTT’s take on it 
make a good Exhibit A. 

With a breathtaking encore 
from The Firebird, MTT made a 
real “spring forward” and more 
than likely sold a considerable 
number of tickets to the June 
Stravinsky festival. There are sev¬ 
eral interesting programs before 
then, but I urge music lovers to 
leave room on their schedule for 
the Stravinsky celebration. ▼

Part 2, “A Wondrous 
Bestiary” provides de¬ 
tailed descriptions of 
over 190 species (pri¬ 
marily birds and mam¬ 
mals) with document¬ 
ed homosexual or 
transgendered behav¬ 
ior, including descrip¬ 
tions of alternative 
heterosexual behav¬ 
iors that don’t quite 
fit the tidy “Family 
Values” book of sex¬ 
ual etiquette. 

Male bonding 

Literally teeming 
with examples, the 
book begins by sim¬ 
ply listing observed 
forms of homosex¬ 
ual and transgender 
behavior in five 
general categories: 
affection, sex, 
courtship, pair-bonding and par¬ 
enting. What could be more affec¬ 
tionate than two male bats, wings 
gently embracing, nuzzling each 
other’s penis; or two male giraffes 
“necking” (long necks wrapped 
around each other), engaged in an 
erotic dance of licking and sniff¬ 
ing; or two female Bonobo 
chimps French-kissing while 
manually stimulating each other’s 
clitoris? 

Or demonstrate greater sexual 
virtuosity than two male dol¬ 
phins, one inserting his penis into 
the other’s blow-hole, spiraling 
together through the water; or 
two whales, side-by-side, prehen¬ 
sile penises entwined; or a pair of 
female hedgehogs writhing on the 
ground in the thralls of mutual 
oral sex? 

Or show more meaningful and 
permanent bonding (some for 
life, even in species not normally 
known for long-term straight 
couples) than pairs, trios and 
sometimes quartets of lesbian 
grizzly bears raising their cubs; or 
two male lions defending each 
other from the sexual advances of 
others; or the promiscuous, open 
sexual relationships of male 
flamingos, who nevertheless stay 
together season after season? 

And what of those issues that 
even now divide the human gay 
community? Bisexuality: It occurs 
in more than half of the mammal 
and bird species showing same- 
sex behavior, including stable, 
sexual trios of Canada geese (2 fe¬ 
males and 1 male) and black 
swans (2 males and 1 female). 

Gender issues: Consider whip- 
tail lizards — not a male among 
them — lesbian reptiles who 
court and mate, then give virgin 
birth to daughter clones of them¬ 
selves; or ruffs (a type of sand¬ 
piper) with four varieties of 
males, each sporting different 
plumage advertising sexual roles: 
some strictly homosexual, some 
bisexual, some entirely celibate. 

And transvestite/transgender 
behavior? Bagemihl devotes much 
energy elaborating on animals 
who physically “disguise” them¬ 
selves as the other sex, as well as 
those who behave like the oppo¬ 
site sex. For example, in bighorn 
sheep, males and females live 
most of the year in sex-segregated 
herds. Certain boy sheep, howev¬ 
er, prefer to live with the girls. In a 
particularly ironic twist, while 
males in male herds frequently 
engage in homosexual activities 
year-round, males in the female 
herd act just like the girls — only 


letting males mount them in the 
mating season. 

The list goes on — pederasty, 
incest, interspecies sex (chimps 
and Savanna baboons often get it 
on), tools (orangutans are quite 
handy with dildos, thank you), 
and if you thought we invented 
gay beaches, think again. Male 
walruses have had exclusive sea¬ 
side hide-aways for quite some 
time. And speaking of exclusive, 
you simply have to be gay to join 
some clubs of mallard drakes 
(males only, please!). 

Taking on Science 

In later chapters, Bagemihl 
takes on the scientific community, 
challenging their preconceptions 
and exposing fallacies in the many 
theories invoked to explain away 
homosexuality and transgender 
behavior: theories such as homo¬ 
sexuality as misplaced heterosex¬ 
uality (which one of you is the fe¬ 
male?); homosexuality as domi¬ 
nance assertion (I’ll mount you to 
put you in your place, but I’m not 
really gay); or homosexuality as a 
result of opposite sex scarcity (fe¬ 
males have sex when males aren’t 
around — the “prison syn¬ 
drome”). Sound familiar? 

Biological Exuberance, unfortu¬ 
nately, is not an easy read. It is too 
dense to be easily rewarding for 
those not into animal behavior 
texts, even with its richly detailed 
examples and photographs. And 
while I would encourage anyone to 
read it, I do not expect it to make 
its way to many home bookshelves. 
I do very much look forward to 
seeing its impact on the scientific 
disciplines it sets out to berate. 

In the final chapter, Bagemihl 
presents his own synthesis of the 
philosophies and mythologies of 
indigenous human cultures with 
recent scientific trends (Chaos 
Theory, Biodiversity, Gaia Theory 
and General Economy) to create a 
new approach to animal (and 
human) sexuality, for which he 
coins the term “biological exuber¬ 
ance.” This effort is less successful. 
What starts out as cogent, tightly 
woven and well-presented turns 
wistful and vaguely unsatisfying. 

Bagemihl’s message, though, is 
rampantly optimistic and conta¬ 
gious: Life’s infinite variety is a 
pure celebration and full expres¬ 
sion of earth’s biological exuber¬ 
ance. To steal one of his quotes: 
“The universe is not only queerer 
than we suppose, it is queerer 
than we can suppose.” And thank 
Gaia for that! ▼ 


Natural acts 


Plenty of homosex in the animal kingdom 


by Rod O’Neal 


Biological Exuberance: Animal 
Homosexuality and Natural Di¬ 
versity by Bruce Bagemihl, Ph.D.; 
St. Martin's Press, $40 

B irds do it! Bees do it!” And 
(forgive me, Cole Porter) 
even gay manatees do it! But 
what they do is not anything Jerry 
Falwell would like us to see. Ac¬ 
cording to Bruce Bagemihl in Bi¬ 
ological Exuberance, Animal Ho¬ 
mosexuality and Natural Diversi¬ 
ty, the evidence is in: homosexu¬ 
ality and transgendered behavior 
is pervasive in the animal world. 
So saying, one of the most often- 
used arguments in the ongoing 
debate on homosexuality’s place 
in the natural order has just met 
its natural match. 

Until recently, animal behav- 
iorists have generally weighed in 
on the “unnatural” side of the de¬ 
bate: homosexual behavior is 
something uniquely human, not 
something that occurs in nature. 
This book may do much to re¬ 
verse this perception. In nearly 
800 pages of tightly argued evi¬ 
dence, Bagemihl presents obser¬ 
vations of over 400 animal 
species. His conclusion: not only 
do homosexual and transgen¬ 
dered behaviors abound in the 
animal kingdom, but sexual be¬ 
havior in general is much more 
varied and pleasure-focused than 
previously thought. The world, as 
it turns out, is a very queer place 
indeed. 

The first of two parts, “A Poly- 
sexual, Polygendered World” es¬ 
tablishes homosexual and trans¬ 
gendered behavior as integral 
parts of animal life, challenges the 
prejudices of the scientific com¬ 
munity, exposes fallacies in the 
many theories trivializing these 
behaviors, and presents a new 
paradigm that celebrates the di¬ 
versity of life and embraces a full 
sexual spectrum.

Vulgar Favors by Maureen Orth; 
Delacorte Press, $24.95 

unity Fair journalism, at its 
!Ji best, reflects the art of the 

subtle innuendo, delivered 
sotto voce by an elegant woman 
who hides her whispers behind 
bejeweled fingers. At its worst, it is 
scurrilous half-truths and outra¬ 
geous gossip coated in a layer of 
objectivity thinner than chiffon. 
Maureen Orth, who trailed gay 
serial killer Andrew Cunanan in 
the pages of VF, now offers her 
book-length version of the story. 
Vulgar Favors is not simply VF 
journalism at its worst, it is, with¬ 
out a doubt, the most patently of¬ 
fensive, poorly researched, and 
quintessentially homophobic 
book I have ever read. 

Orth’s work offends from the 
opening page of the prologue, 
where she reports two telephone 
calls she received at home from an 
unidentified male, presumed by 
the author to be Andrew Cunanan 
himself. She reports, “My hus¬ 
band recognized the same gay 
male voice.” And just how does 
one identify a “gay male voice” — 
may we presume a high-pitched 
whine, or is a simple lisp the req¬ 
uisite designator? Orth doesn’t 
bother to provide descriptive de¬ 
tails, just a ridiculous, undefined 
stereotype which she uses to draw 
her conclusion. This example de¬ 
fines the Orth modus operandi, 
but it is only the tip of a homo- 
phobic iceberg large enough to 
sink the RSVP cruise line. 

Orth attributes the poor po- 
licework in the Cunanan man¬ 
hunt to the cops’ fear of a gay 
backlash from the newly-empow¬ 
ered gay community. The possi¬ 
bility that the murders of gay men 
simply took a lower priority in the 
notoriously homophobic law-en¬ 
forcement community never oc¬ 
curs to Orth. But Orth lets the 
reader know she’s really done her 
homework, pub-crawling 
through gay bars from San Diego 
to Miami. You haven’t lived until 
you hear this middle-aged, mar¬ 
ried heterosexual woman from 
Washington DC describe the 


leather community. 

“Leather,” we are 
told, “is a neutral 
word for sado¬ 
masochistic sex.” In 
San Diego, Orth in¬ 
forms us, no gay man 
is ever invited to an 
“A-list” party unless 
he uses crystal meth. 

And — my favorite 
Orth factoid — “Porn 
stars are the super¬ 
models of the gay 
world.” 

Clueless 

Throughout this 
dreadful opus, Orth 
comes across as a total¬ 
ly clueless voyeur who 
is not only incapable of 
understanding the mi¬ 
lieu she is covering, but 
who remains complete¬ 
ly unbalanced in her 
presentation of that milieu. She 
sees gay men as chickens and*- 
hawks; whores and pimps; addicts 
and pushers — all hell-bent on 
self-destruction to a disco beat. It 
is the worst kind of stereotyping 
because she fills in her broad gen¬ 
eralizations with out-of-context 
quotes by people like Armistead 
Maupin, gay bartenders, and valu¬ 
able surveys of the upstanding gay 
community like the “1998 Koch 
Crime Commission Report.” She 
uses specific quotes to generalize 
the gay community and substan¬ 
tiate her own homophobia. Then 
there is the little matter of techni¬ 
cal research. 

Orth alleges that Gianni Ver¬ 
sace was HIV-positive at the time 
of his death, something his fami¬ 
ly denies. Why would any re¬ 
spectable journalist make this al¬ 
legation, true or not? What bear¬ 
ing does it have on anything? In 
the sections of the book devoted 
to Cunanan’s stint in the Bay 
Area, Orth stops short of outing 
Harry deWildt, but dishes his 
poor wife Margot as a “big-boned 
Mellon heiress.” (Margot is a Hill¬ 
man, not a Mellon.) 

In her acknowledgments, she 
thanks the San Francisco bar 
owners who helped her at the 
“Alta Vista” and the “Lyons Pub” 
(has the coffee shop chain gone

gay, or did Phyllis Lyon open a 
queer bar?). I could go on, but 
why bother? 

Maureen Orth’s Vulgar Favors 
is perfectly designed to assist the 
religious right in its ongoing as¬ 
sault on gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
Americans. Where Orth’s sexual 
politics lie is not hard to fathom, 
but she seems to have had a great 
time slumming her way through 
the demimonde on an expense ac¬ 
count. One can only hope that 
gay/lesbian book vendors will 
send this one right back to the 
publisher as soon as it arrives. ▼

by Michael Bronski 

' | 1 ebruary 9,1999 was the fifth 
§P anniversary of the death of 
my lover of almost 20 years, 
Walta Borawski. He was 46 at the 
time of his death. I was 44.1 am 
now 49. He is still dead. I will be 
50 this May. 

February 25,1999 was the first 
anniversary of the death of my 
mother, Eleanor Bronski. She was 
76 at the time of her death. I was 
48. She was 28 when I was 
born. I will live another 28 
years if I live as long as she 
did. 

Three years ago I was con¬ 
stantly, and inexplicably, 
stilled by the mystery of 
death. How can it be so 
permanent? How can it 
exist so completely not only 
in its strik¬ 
ing, but in 
the absences 
it creates? 

These days I am more often stilled 
by the mystery of time. How old 
would Walta have been this year? 
How old am I? Does he stay 46 
while I get older? How long will I 
live now that I am almost 50? In 
this age of AIDS uttering memen¬ 
to mori to gay men is simply re¬ 
dundant. Yet not a day passes 
when I do not wonder how long I 
have to live. How long I have to 
write. How long I have to con¬ 
sciously shape my life and my 
world. During the past year I have 
come to acknowledge that death 
— and in particular these two 
deaths — has profoundly shaped 
how I now view my life, my work, 
my career. 

My primary identification is 
that of a writer, a cultural critic 
and commentator. I have always 
written and for the past 25 years 
have made a living of it. It is how 
I make money, how I communi¬ 
cate, how I negotiate my everyday 
dealings with the world. But when 
Walta died in 1994, my relation¬ 
ship . to my writing radically 
changed. My emotional life had 
been centered on Walta. Our 
nearly twenty years together were 
sustaining, complex, and exhila¬ 
rating; the intensity of nursing 
him to his death was alternately 
fatiguing and incredibly reward¬ 
ing. When he died, I was left not 
only with the always-expected 
(yet always inconceivable) emo¬ 
tional shock, but faced with con¬ 
fronting the mundane, practical 


The Middle Ages 


problem of what I was going to do 
next. Not only how I was going to 
spend my time, but how, and 
where, was I going to redirect the 
enormous emotional involvement 
I had in my relationship with 
Walta. 

At the age of 44 I attacked my 
career with a new sense of pur¬ 
pose and freedom. I edited an an¬ 
thology of gay male sexual writing 
and one of contemporary essays 
of gay male politics and culture. I 
signed a contract to write a book 
— The Pleasure Principle — on 
the impact of gay culture on 
mainstream culture and began 
writing with an intensity I 
had not conjured up for 
years. Walta’s death — 
and his absence in the 
material world — had 
allowed me to reimagine 
what I might do, attain with 
my life, my 
writing, my 
career. It was 
not as if 
being with Walta for those years 
had prevented me from doing any 
of this — although I wrote prodi¬ 
giously (and had published a 
book and had numerous essays in 
anthologies), much of my energy 
and focus was on my relationship 
with Walta. If anything, after his 
death, I realized that it was Walta’s 
unconditional love and support 
for those years that let me bloom 
in a new way now. It was with bit¬ 
tersweet realization that I finally 
acknowledged that the death of 
the man I love had — in some 
perfectly logical, yet perverse way 
— moved me not only into a new 
life, but a new stage of my career 
as well. 

I had a similar realization 
when my mother died in 1998.1 
had finished writing The Pleasure 
Principle and was making last- 
minute changes and correcting 
galleys. My parents knew what the 
book was about but, like much 
about my homosexuality and 
writing about gay issues, much 
went unspoken. Weeks after her 
death, after I saw the mock-up of 
the book’s cover — a beautiful, 
but blatantly sexual photograph 
of a naked man hiding his genitals 
behind extended hands — I real¬ 
ized that I felt a great relief at her 
death. I would not have to see the 
pain and disappointment on her 
face when she saw the cover. I 
would not have to hear her at-

Life between deaths 


tempting to hide, once again, her 
sense of shame and failure that I 
had turned out so much differ¬ 
ently from how she and my father 
had imagined. I would not have 
to, once again, feel her disapproval 
that I had hurt her and my father 
no matter what I had achieved. 
While feeling grief at her death, I 
also felt an exhilarating sense of 
relief that I would no longer be 
judged and found wanting by the 
woman who brought me into the 
world — whose ability to love me 
was as conditional and hampered 
as Walta’s was unlimited and free. 

In her novel Rat Bohemia 
Sarah Schulman has a character 
comment that “paying for your 
lover’s funeral is a gay man’s bar 
mitzvah. It is how you know that 
you have become a man.” While 
Walta’s death — and all of my at¬ 
tendant medical, emotional, and 
moral responsibilities — ushered 
me into a new stage in life, it was 
my mother’s death that moved me 
finally into what felt like full 
adulthood. (In US culture, I think 
it is only the death of parents that 
allows us to become sufficiently 
adult, not children anymore. This 
may be particularly true for gay 
men and lesbians since so many of 
us choose not to raise children of 
our own.) Yet this passage — ad¬ 
vanced as it was with two deaths 

— has also made me acutely 
aware, more perhaps than even 
AIDS, of my time as a living per¬ 
son, my own death, and life. 

It is between these two deaths 
that I feel my life now exists. Both 
freed me to grow and to mature as 
a thinker, a writer, a person. But 
both are also constant reminders 
that, at almost 50, my own time is 
limited, circumscribed. As my 
birthday approaches I find that I 
am not anxious about getting old 

— turning 40 was a revelation to 
me, I began to really feel like an 
adult — but am more and more 
aware of my responsibility to my¬ 
self to be productive, intimately 
involved with my writing and the 
world, aware of every waking mo¬ 
ment and the choices I make: to 
be alive. T

Laboratory for the arts 

Artists-in-residence program at Yerba Buena Center 


by Aimee Ts’ao 


§. % eated on the floor in a circle 
in the corner of the studio, 
J nine people listen as 
Manoranjan, an Odissi dancer 
from India, expresses himself in 
heavily accented English. Anne 
translates this into French for 
Djedje, who is from Cote d’Ivoire, 
on one side of the circle, while 
Steve renders it into Chinese for 
Wen on the other side. Ralph 
Lemon, poised on his haunches, 
takes in the swirl of the multilin¬ 
gual, intercultural communica¬ 
tion with serene intensity. He is 
midway through a three-week res¬ 
idency at the Yerba Buena Center 
for the Arts, where he is develop¬ 
ing work for the second part of his 
trilogy, Geography: Race/Spiritual¬ 
ity/Home. From 1985 to 1995, he 
headed his own dance company, 
choreographing in his own post¬ 
modern style. Then he abruptly 
changed directions and began a 
seven-year odyssey, an enormous 
exploration to find and distill ma¬ 
terial and experiences into the Ge¬ 
ography Trilogy. 

After watching the videotape 
of the afternoon’s movement ex¬ 
perimentation, Manoranjan is ex¬ 
plaining that he feels uncomfort¬ 
able. Odissi, originally a sacred 
dance form performed in tem¬ 
ples, doesn’t lend itself to impro¬ 
visation and cross-fertilization, 
and he is not happy with the day’s 
work. Though the rest of the 
group have been and will contin¬ 
ue working together for another 
ten days, he is only a one-time 
guest. Later in an interview, 
Lemon explains that Asako Taka- 
mi, an Odissi dancer herself, 
thought Manoranjan would be a 
great addition to the workshop, 
and though he was on tour in 
Southern California, he flew up 
for the day. While Takami does 
not share Manoranjan’s feelings, 
it is because she is not Indian, and 
therefore does not have the cul¬ 
tural involvement that he does. 
Lemon is continually amazed at 
what he is learning about working 
with people from other cultures, 
that he cannot make assumptions 
about how anyone else views his 
current process of creation, that 
he must leave himself open to 
constant adapting and changing 
to suit the needs of the individuals 
in the group, including himself. 

The following week in the 
Yerba Buena Forum, Lemon gives 
an informal presentation of the 
material his multicultural group 
has been working on. He said, 
“This project is turning out to be 
more anthropology than choreog¬ 
raphy. In the first part, Race, I 
worked with eight men from Cote 
d’Ivoire, and ended up discover¬ 
ing that they were more con¬ 
cerned with spirituality. Race was¬ 
n’t an issue for them. This second 
part, Spirituality, brings together 
people from the countries where 
Buddhism began and developed, 
India, China and Japan. And they 
are more concerned with their art 
forms and being artists than with 
spirituality.” Given these discover¬ 
ies, you’d have to say that the 
workshop is a success, because 
learning and exploration, and not 
producing a finished performance 
piece, are the primary goals.

John Killacky 


Killacky, Yerba Buena’s Executive 
Director. It is not beside the point 
that Killacky has been a dancer 
and dance company manager 
himself, and has fought his own 
personal battle against paralysis 
resulting from the surgical re¬ 
moval of a benign spinal tumor. 
He knows first-hand how vital the 
proper support and nurturing are 
to the development and growth of 
endeavors, artistic and otherwise. 

In an interview last month, 
Killacky said, “The Center is 
about allowing artists to make 
new work. It’s different from a 
museum, which is about showing 
the best work. Yerba Buena does¬ 
n’t have a permanent collection or 
resident performing companies. 
We have no ‘institutional ego’ to 
break down. The question is, how 
do we best serve the community? 
During the twenty years of plan¬ 
ning and building the Center, a lot 
of promises were made, and now 
it’s time to give back to the artists’ 
community.” 

Starting out with a simple 
“land grant” approach, Killacky 
opened up the rehearsal studio to 
artists who don’t have facilities 
where they can create. Then, 
through grants from Phyllis Wat- 
tis and the Doris Duke Charitable 
Foundation, the Center was able 
to formalize the program. Besides 
Ralph Lemon, other choreogra¬ 
pher artists-in-residence include: 
Margaret Jenkins, who has been 
rehearsing for over a year on her 
latest full-length work to be 
shown in the fall; Robert Moses, 
who worked with Sara Shelton 
Mann on a section of a piece that 
premiered a few weeks ago at 
Theater Artaud; and Stephen 
Petronio, from New York, who has 
also been using the space as part 
of a four-year residency in part¬ 
nership with San Francisco Per¬ 
formances. 

Before coming to San Francis¬ 
co, Killacky was the Performing 
Arts Curator at the Walker Arts 
Center in Minneapolis, where “we 
did a lot of commissioning of 
work, and frankly, not every piece 
worked. In the arts world we have 
to justify research and develop¬ 
ment in an odd way. The corpo¬ 
rate world understands it. Things 
like nylon, penicillin and post-its 
were discovered by accident, not 
because someone was deliberately 
trying to invent them. That is why 
a laboratory is so important, it’s a 
place where things are discovered. 

I just gave a talk in Los Angeles on 
venture capital models for the 
arts. Basically, one third of the 
money you invest will tank, one 
third will return nothing, and the 
last third will return big. You are 
not remembered for the things 
that didn’t work out, only what 
was successful. If the arts world 


could function under that para¬ 
digm, it would be a lot healthier. 
And artists would be given a lot 
more freedom. Let’s put the onus 
not on the final product, but on 
allowing the artist to have the 
process in a timely way.” 

Working together 

The idea of partnerships is also 
central to Killacky’s way of think¬ 
ing about artistic development. “I 
love the symbiotic nature of it all. 
The Center does not exist without 
partners. It is important that we 
all work together, Theater Artaud 
and Brady Street in dance, but we 
also do theatre and music, be¬ 
cause it’s not a good time for 
artists, and we need to help where 
we can by providing space and re¬ 
sources. I’m also meeting with 
San Francisco Ballet and Oakland 
Ballet because I’m eager to see if 
there’s a way we can work with 
them. I think the Center should 
be a home for lots of different 
forms, from classical to avant- 
garde, from conceptual to tradi¬ 
tional.” 

The Duke Foundation Grant 
application was a collaborative ef¬ 
fort between Yerba Buena Center 
for the Arts and San Francisco 
Performances. “The Foundation 
found it odd that two organiza¬ 
tions would apply together. We do 
separate things, but they are com¬ 
plementary; we are interested in a 
residency program for the devel¬ 
opment of work, and San Francis¬ 
co Performances wants to develop 


Ralph Lemon in Geography 


the presentation side of the work 
in their residencies. It’s really 
compatible, and we now share 
staff as well.” 

During the two-and-a-half 
years that Killacky has been at 
Yerba Buena, he has succeeded in 
making it renowned for the qual¬ 
ity and breadth of its dance pro¬ 
gramming, as well as its offerings 
in music and theater. In one of the 
more ambitious residencies, the 
Paul Taylor Dance Company is 
currently installed at Yerba Buena 
for an entire month (March 20 


through April 18) rehearsing, per¬ 
forming, screening archival films, 
and running a three-day confer¬ 
ence on the Dancemaking of Paul 
Taylor. Upcoming residency 
events include Axis Dance Com¬ 
pany, OnSite Dance Company, 
and Joe Goode Performance 
Group. As Killacky put it, “We are 
hired for what we know, but our 
work is what we don’t know. Our 
job is to research and find new 
artists.” And your job, dear audi¬ 
ence, is to go and see what he has 
found. ▼

his company, but across the continent 
and around the globe. He’s also won a 
slew of awards for his work. 

Soon Labayan will be making his 
mark on the Middle East as he and his 
dancers perform their prize-winning 
pieces in Jordan at the Amman Inter¬ 
national Theater Festival, and also in 
concert in New York City. 

Fortunately, those of us interested 
in Labayan’s Finest pieces need not 
travel across the continent or the At¬ 
lantic Ocean to see them. He’ll be giv¬ 
ing San Franciscans a sneak preview 
of his grand show on April 12 and 13 
at Brady Street Dance Theater. 

Cellist Marika Hughes will play 
the Bach Cello Suite #1 for Labayan’s 
newest dance, choreographed specif¬ 
ically for the Jordan performance and 
dedicated to the memory and honor 
of Jordan’s King Hussein. 

Also on the bill are two dances that 
received Isadora Duncan Awards for 
Outstanding Achievement in Chore¬ 
ography. 

“Cloth” is a duet inspired by the 
Bible’s “Song of Songs,” with its sen¬ 
sual and evocative imagery. The 
dance was originally commissioned 
by Jhan Otto Theater in Potsdam, 
Germany, for the International Dance 
with Objects Festival. And “Puirt a 
Beul” combines the company’s full 
spectrum of dance styles and tech¬ 
niques, showcasing the dancers’ phys¬ 
ical daring, vitality, ecclecticism and 
versatility. The name refers to a style 
of Gaelic “mouth music” intended for 
dancing. 

A fourth dance piece, “Damas,” 
which took top prize at an interna¬ 
tional festival in Tokyo, Japan, is in¬ 
spired by an Asian matriarchal ritual 
that explores female strength and 
power. It’s set to music by Arvo Pari 
and Henryk Gorecki. 

Labayen migrated from Southeast 
Asia to America in 1973, and trained 
with the finest ballet schools in New 
York, San Francisco and Europe. After 
15 years in the country, feeling the 
schizophrenia of simultaneously 
being and not being American, he re¬ 
turned to Southeast Asia to re-expe¬ 
rience and define his cultural identi¬ 
ty. The heightened knowledge from 
his experience spurred him to create 
dances that incorporate Asian cultur¬ 
al themes, including rituals and prac¬ 
tices of Asiatic indigenous tribes. 
Labayan says his choreography inte¬ 
grates ballet technique, American 
modern dance and Asian ritual ges¬ 
tures "to create a potent, strangely 
beautiful hybrid language of image, 
experience and passion.’’ ▼ 


Award-winning works by Enrico 
Labayan will be featured April 12- 
13, 8pm, at Brady Street Dance 
Theater, 60 Brady $t. in San 
Francisco. Tickets are $10-$25 
(sliding scale). For reservations, 
phone 241-3770 or 241-2484.

Leather tribes 
hunt fresh blood 




by Mister Marcus 


1 % o you think being into 
leather is only about getting 
%F laid and winning a title? Or 
maybe you think it’s only about 
bondage and discipline, kinky sex, 
dungeon parties, orgies and being 
a good top or a good bottom? 

Well, then, think again. What 
about the men and women who 
put themselves on the front lines, 
raising money for the less fortu¬ 
nate, or for causes that will bene¬ 
fit not only leather people, but the 
whole LGBT community? 

What about those people who 
toil behind the scenes to insure a 
benefit works; who get the word 
out about demonstrations and 
picketing and meetings and fund 
raising events? 

Sure, leather contests and title¬ 
holding is part of leather culture, 
but not all of it. The fact that we 
have fun (the key word) while 
doing contests and being activists 
is what makes leather life worth¬ 
while. Bonding becomes more 
meaningful; the feeling of broth¬ 
erhood and sisterhood is en¬ 
hanced; and being accepted for 
who and what we are is all part of 
the bargain. 

I bring these ideas to your at¬ 
tention for a reason: Next week¬ 
end, leather men and women not 
only from San Francisco, but from 
all over the country will converge 
here to share ideas, expertise, in¬ 
spire wavering souls, and hopeful¬ 
ly give impetus to those of you 
who may be wondering about 
your lifestyle choice. 

Yes, I’m referring to the 
third annual Leather 
Leadership Conference, 
for the first time being 
held outside the con¬ 
fines of New York City. 

While he would be 
the last one to take 
credit for it, John 
Weis, the current 
chairman of GMSMA 
in New York, is the man who 
managed to inspire others to 
gather and share ideas, tap into 
various expertise, and utilize all 
the great talent out there to make 
our community stronger. As a re¬ 
sult, we’ve become more success¬ 
ful in many worthwhile efforts, 
and have significantly enhanced 
the once-tarnished image of the 
Leather Nation. 

At the conference, a legion of 
people who know the ins and outs 


Dean Prager won the Mr. August 2000 spot on the Millennium Bare 
Chest Calendar last Thursday, April 1. Mr. September will be chosen 
next Thursday, April 15. 


Former Chicagoan Faye Foltz won 
the Ms. Los Angeles Leather Con¬ 
test in early March, and will com¬ 
pete for the IMsL '99 title in Las 
Vegas in July. 


of fundraising, consciousness 
raising, and other facets of our 
tribal rites will conduct work¬ 
shops and demonstrations. Hope¬ 
fully they’ll attract people who are 
wavering or unsure of what direc¬ 
tion they want to take as gay 

persons. 

The fact is, some of the holy 
cows in the leather com¬ 
munity are getting 
burned out. They’ve 
been carrying the load 
for years. We need new 
blood, new ideas, and 
new strategies. 

While we know 
the talent is out there, 
signing up recruits is 
no easy task. If you’re a leather 
man or woman who has been 
holding back, here’s a chance to 
explore what the leather commu¬ 
nity is all about. You really owe it 
to yourself to explore the possibil¬ 
ities of doing something mean¬ 
ingful and accomplishing a goal 
or two. Trust me, it’ll make you 
feel good about yourself. 

The majority of the conference 
activity will take place at the 
Golden Gate Holiday Inn (Van 
Ness Ave. at Pine), with related 
parties and dances at other loca¬ 
tions. Registration for event will 
take place Friday, April 16 from 
1800 to 2200 hours, but don’t wait 
till the last minute because at 
2000, Guy Baldwin will give the 
welcome and keynote address. 

The schedule of events is as 
follows: 

Saturday, April 17, from 0900 
to 1030: workshops centering on 
media expertise, organizing, and 
kinky families. 

Between 1100 and 1230: pan¬ 
els on volunteers, people of color, 
presentations, leather, SM 8c the 
radical right, and community 
bonding — all just before the 
lunch break! 

Froml400 to 1730: more in¬ 
formation on reaching out to the 
next generation, leadership (skills, 
leather on the Internet, and model 
community work. You can glean 
worthwhile information on inter¬ 
actions with deaf leather people, 


laws about leather activity, leather 
events, and educating sash queens 
on S/M and community outreach. 

On Sunday morning, April 18, 
there will more workshops on the 
leather credo, SM vs. Abuse, and 
POC issues. 

Following the 1130 to 1300 
brunches, there will be a lecture 
on leather/SM history. 

From 1430 to 1530, the ple¬ 
nary session takes place.

Palm pilot 




by Sweet Lips 


Michael Greer as Mona Lewinski in Palm Springs. 


| oing to that capital of ga-ga 
, rp fun in the desert, Palm 
Springs? If you are, Sweet 
Lips has a show for you! The all- 
new Michael Greer show runs 
April 8 through 14 at the ever- 
popular Rock Garden Club. 
Don’t miss Michael’s new act 
“Mona Lewinski!” Of course, it 
was a lot newer an act on the 
cover of the New Yorker last 
month, but better late than never. 
For reservations to 
Michael/Mona, call (760) 327- 
8840. 

But what if you’re stuck in 
town this week, like the rest of 
us? Here’s a rundown of hap¬ 
pening and hoedowns in Lips’ 
little corner of the world. 

The Giraffe video and chan¬ 
delier lounge will be featuring a 
special dinner each Wednesday 
night starting at 7 p.m. and 
catered, of course, by Dennis 
(“Truffles ’n’ trouble”) Tyler. 
That’s on lovely lower Polk- 
strasse, of course. 

The sexy (“eat him up!”) John 
David is on the plank Mon.-Fri. 
8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Kimo’s, great 
for that early morning wake-up- 
call, and he gets a very interesting 
crowd — hi, Jimmy! 

Job Interview 
Dept.: Michael ^ 

Sparks, all 6 ft. 4 1 

in. of him, wants * 
to be a barback at 
the 1100 Club, and what 
a hunk he is. 

What do you 
say, boys, do we 
give him an op¬ 
portunity to flex all that muscle? 


Thank you, Ron¬ 
nie Lynn of Tango 
Tango on California 
St. for the huge blown- 
up Lips that look as big 
as a raft. And yes, La Lips 
is back from her P.V. 
vacation, tanned, 
toned (well, 
maybe not 
toned) and back 
at work 6 a.m. to 
Noon at the 1100 Club. 


The New Gold Room has a 
great new look and is doing great 
business. As I “write” this, Frank 
of the New Gold is making hun¬ 
dreds of Easter baskets for chil¬ 
dren in hospital. Now there’s a 
solid milk chocolate heart. 

Surprise — the 1100 Club 
with Yours Truly on the plank 
will be having a special Thurs.- 
Sun., 9-11 a.m. All well drinks 
and domestic beer for only $2. 
Try to beat that around town! ▼ 


Mister Marcus 

M previous page 

at the Eagle. Congratulations are 
in order all around and I’m sure a 
good time was had by all. 

Parade update 

The alphabet-soup parade is 
nearly upon us. You may recall, 
the leather community’s dissatis¬ 
faction with the Pride Parade 
committee came to a head last 
year with a face-to-face con¬ 
frontation that ended amiably. It 
settled with the leather-pride con¬ 
tingent getting their preferred 
spot in the parade line-up. 

In order to avoid another con¬ 
frontation this year, the leather 
community is invited to meet 
with the parade committee at 


1500 on Saturday, April 10 at the 
Eagle. There, a public forum will 
be held, hosted by parade chair 
Calvin Gipson, Treasurer Stephan 
Edwards and parade executive di¬ 
rector Teddy Witherington. 

A survey will be taken to gath¬ 
er information on how best to ef¬ 
fect communication with us. 
They want to hear from you, so 
put on your thinking cap now to 
come up with suggestions for im¬ 
provement. Be there if you have 
any input, or don’t bitch about it 
later. 

Also, on Sunday, April 18, 
there will be a $7 beer bust, raffle 
and auction at Daddy’s, from 
1600 to 1900, to raise money for 
entry fees and other expenses for 
the leather contingent in the pa¬ 
rade. Support both efforts. It’s 
your parade, after all. ▼ 



Jose Cebollero is Mr. Philadelphia 
Leather 1999 as of March 5. He'll 
be among the contenders for the 
IML '99 title in Chicago in May.

Comedy tonight (or whenever) 


by Gregg Shapiro 


J. f ou didn’t have to watch the 
W Grammy Awards in Febru- 
II ary, where the latest not-so- 
funny Mel Brooks/Carl Reiner 
2000 Year Old Man album won in 
the comedy category, to know 
that comedy albums will proba¬ 
bly never reach the same popu¬ 
larity they once enjoyed during 
the 1970s. That’s not to say that 
there aren’t more deserving discs 
released. Here’s a run-down of 
just a few. 

Currently on tour, The Fire- 
sign Theatre (who have been 
around for almost as long as 
Brooks and Reiner) released Give 
Me Immortality Or Give Me 
Death (Rhino) last year. A spoof 


of the ever-changing world of 
format radio, complete with 
commercials from mattress sell¬ 
ers, mysterious mega-corpora¬ 
tions (US Plus), airlines, movies 
(the universally hated Pull My 
String and the forthcoming Glac¬ 
ier), prescription beer, and the 
lottery. Sportscaster Chump 
Threads, celebrity 

reporter/”stalker” Danny Vanilla, 
live traffic reports (from Captain 
Happy Panditt in the traffic- 
copter), DJ Bebop Loco, sex ther¬ 
apist Dr. O’Nann Winquedinque 
(“an old-hand at self-love”) and 
reporters Harold Hiphugger and 
Ray Hamberger (French pronun¬ 
ciation) populate the airwaves 
with multiple references to Joe 
Camel and the millennium. The 
station changes formats through¬ 


out the course of the disc, going 
from “souped-up, suggestive, de¬ 
sensitized, bite-me, environmen¬ 
tal now radio” to “detoxified, gen¬ 
der-blind, re-babblized, up-all¬ 
night talk radio.” 

GLAMA (Gay and Lesbian 
American Music Awards) nomi¬ 
nee Sandra Bernhard’s live 
recording of her recent hit stage 
show I’m Still Here... Damn It 
(TVT) is almost as wickedly 
funny and brilliant as the almost 
ten-year-old recording of her 
show Without You I’m Nothing. 
Recorded prior to the Broadway 
opening of I’m Still Here... during 
a 1998 Valentine’s Day perfor¬ 
mance, Bernhard takes on the 
topics of the day (last year’s days, 
at least) including cell phones, the 
deaths of famous people (John 


Denver, Princess Diana, Mother 
Teresa, Gianni Versace), self-im¬ 
portant celebrities and fashion 
models, *69, caller ID, bottled 
water, Courtney Love, Lilith Fair, 
hepatitis, National Geographic, 
Christine McVie, spiders, Moroc¬ 
co, and her house-painter Her- 
minio. She even makes reference 
to Without You I’m Nothing. 

I’m Telling You For The Last 
Time (Universal) is also a record¬ 
ing of a live performance. It cap¬ 
tures, on disc, Jerry Seinfeld’s his¬ 
toric return to stand-up comedy 
during the summer of 1998. It’s 
good to know that there are 
enough humorous topics to go 
around so that there is virtually 
no duplication of material. How¬ 
ever, Seinfeld, like Bernhard, does 
riffs on taxis and telephones. Se¬ 


infeld also covers airports, Flori¬ 
da, candy, male-female relations, 
extreme sports, late-night televi¬ 
sion programs, travel and gam¬ 
bling, to name a few. 

Part Beastie Boys, part Mickey 
Katz, 19.99 (Sire/Warner Broth¬ 
ers) by M.O.T. (Members of the 
Tribe) is comedy you can dance 
to. Ice Berg and Dr. Dreidle per¬ 
form songs such as “Emmes G,” 
“Psychosemitic,” “Double Dutch 
Lunch,” “Kosher Nostra,” “Ha¬ 
vana Nagillah” and “Viva Oy 
Vegas,” updating Jewish humor 
and taking it where it’s never 
gone before. ▼

and 10.

men toward their arena of great¬ 
est possibility was Muriel’s meti¬ 
er.” 

After one slogs though many 
chapters on the raising of funds 
and other preparations for the 
opera, the book Finally pays off 
with a quite fun account of Four 
Saints’ opening night at the 
Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hart¬ 
ford, Connecticut. We learn, for 
example, that aesthete Carl Van 
Vechten made three entrances 
(he later raved that “the Negroes 
[the opera’s cast] are divine!”) 
And the Stein/Thomson/choreo- 
grapher Frederick Ashton/direc¬ 


tor John Houseman confection 
really was the forerunner of the 
modern multimedia perfor¬ 
mance. There would have been no 
Glass/Wilson Einstein on the 
Beach without it, no Ashley Per¬ 
fect Lives, no Anderson United 
States I-IV. And then where would 
we be? 

We’re looking forward to An¬ 
derson’s performance of Moby 
Dick, which Cal Performances has 
announced for October 26-30 at 
Zellerbach Hall. We can’t think of 
a better collaborator for great gay 
author Herman Melville. When 
we discussed her new musical the¬ 
atre project with her in an inter¬ 
view last year, we asked Laurie An¬ 
derson, why Moby Dick? 

“What I love about the book 


— when you try to tell the story 
in film, it comes off as, ‘Guys go 
fishing!”’ Anderson said. “I don’t 
know if you saw that Moby Dick 
on cable a few months ago? 
Patrick Stewart was Ahab, and 
he did all these over-the-top 
Shakespearean monologues: ‘I 
am darkness leaping out of light!’ 
I’m interested in that contrast be¬ 
tween the grittiness of being on a 
whale ship, and looking for some¬ 
thing you want, knowing that it 
will kill you. 

“And everyone dies in the end, 
of course, except Ishmael, who is 
left to tell the tale... Ishmael always 
reminds me of the nerd in the 
back of the rock ’n’ roll tour bus, 
you know, who’s busy writing 
down everything people say, and

Class reunion 

The highlight of In Your Ear, 
an album of music from indepen¬ 
dent films (1ml Trax/Hybrid), is 
songwriter Zane Campbell’s pre¬ 
viously unreleased “Post-Mortem 
Bar” from Norman Rene’s 1990 
AIDS film Longtime Companion. 
It’s the song which goes with that 
great scene in which everybody 
we’ve lost to the plague is reunited 
on a beach to tell their stories and 
catch up, and it’s a pretty good 
song in its own right. The album 
also includes Jill Wisoff’s “Wel¬ 
come to the Dollhouse” from the 
film of the same name; Mor¬ 
phine’s “Sheila” from Spanking 
the Monkey; and The Pogues’ 
“The Old Main Drag” from Gus 
Van Sant’s My Own Private 
Idaho. Hey, who knew indie film 
was so goddamn tuneful?

Black horse 

Not to end on a down note, 
but Black Tar Heroin: The Dark 
End of the Street is a real-life 
Streets of San Francisco set to air 
later this month on HBO. Steven 
Okazaki’s documentary follows 
the downward trajectories of five 
heroin addicts, ages 18 to 25, lured 
by Mexican, or “black tar” heroin. 
A dealer notes in the film, “Of all 
the heroins in the world, Mexican 
heroin is the worst. It looks like 
shit and does your body like shit.” 

The young people profiled in 
Black Tar Heroin include Jake, 21, 
and Oreo, 19, both of whom work 
as prostitutes to support their 
habit. Oreo (he’s half-black) has 
been turning tricks since he was 
14; Jake finds whoring “degrad¬ 
ing” and says he’s been raped four 



BALLET ► 


< OPERA 


Dueling intercoms, War Memorial Opera House 


Opera plaza 

Heard over the intercom out¬ 
side the disabled entrance to the 
War Memorial Opera House: “I’m 
sorry, you’re here to see the ballet. 
You have just pressed the inter¬ 
com for the opera. For entree, 
you’ll have to press the other 
buzzer.” 

Coulda hadda V8 

Here’s the advance word on a 
new play by SF luminaries Kevin 
Killian and Rex Ray, Vegetable 
Kingdom: the plot involves TV 
game show producers trying to 
get late vegetarian/frozen-foods 
queen Linda McCartney and 
FluxuS diva/vocally-challenged 
Yoko Ono, historic nemeses, on 
their show as celebrity contestants 
to pump up the ratings. Knowing 
the wit and wisdom of Killian and 
Ray, we’re sure the eggplant will 
fly! In fact we’d bet our celery on 
it. The cast of local arts celebs in¬ 
cludes CCAC curator Larry 
Rinder, who has his finger in the 
pie of the upcoming Whitney Bi¬ 
ennial; artists Phoebe Gloeckn- 
er, Cliff Hengst, Scott Hewick- 
er, and many more. Small Press 
Traffic presents VK on Saturday, 
April 10 at 7:30 p.m. at New Col- 


times. Two of the five addicts 
know they’re HIV-positive. None 
of them have happy stories. If, like 
us, you have to look away when 
needles pierce veins, you’ll miss 
much of the film. Still, the docu¬ 
mentary is an honest portrayal of 
some true lives that are part of our 
urban landscape. Check your

Naiad, nifty and not 


by Deborah Peifer 


Those Who Wait by Peggy J. Her¬ 
ring; Naiad, $11.95 

Omaha's Bell by Penny Hayes; 
Naiad, $11.95 

When Some Body Disappears by 
Therese Szymanski; Naiad, 

$11.95 

t’s not the worst thing in the 
. world to have a best friend 

who shares every intimate de¬ 
tail (when, where, how many) of 
her fabulous sex life when you’re 
not getting any, although when 
she does it following a particular¬ 
ly nasty break-up, it ranks right 
up there with root canal on the 
pain scale. Cheryl’s lover, Mickey, 
left her by leaving a note on their 
kitchen table: “I’m in Mexico with 
my new lover. I’ll be back in a 
week. We’ll talk then.” That’s cold, 
but what do you do with the torch 
that you’re carrying when the ex 
returns raring to jump back in 
bed, and you realize she has no in¬ 



tention of giving up those regular 
flings? Peggy Herring explores 
friendship, love, relationships, and 
family, with delicacy and dexteri¬ 
ty. Her main characters are care¬ 
fully and believably drawn. Those 
Who Wait is an entertaining read. 

Is Penny Hayes a time traveler? 
How else can her skill at capturing 
the past be explained (oh yes, I 



suppose intelligence, lots of re¬ 
search, and real writing skill might 
do it, but what fun is that)? In her 
latest, Omaha’s Bell, she artfully 
paints a portrait of women’s lives 
in the late 19th-century American 
West that is fascinating, funny, and 
full of feeling. Her characters are 
vivid, the plots compelling. I par¬ 
ticularly admire her ability to give 



her readers all the information we 
need about those times without 
ever resorting to tedious lectures. 
Omaha’s Bell rings entirely true. 

On another note, albeit a flat 
and untuneful one, we have (oh, 
god) the 3rd Brett Higgins mys¬ 
tery, When Some Body Disappears, 
an exercise in reader abuse so se¬ 
vere that Amnesty International 


should look into the matter. Our 
hero, on the lam from both the 
law and the Mafia types she pissed 
off over the years, is still pretend¬ 
ing to be dead and using the name 
Sam. Her lover, Allie, continues to 
call her Brett, however, which 
seems not a wise choice what with 
the hiding and all. When Brett 
and Allie see a man murdered on 
a deserted street, they chase the 
gunman for many blocks, and 
tfien return to the murder scene, 
where some body has disap¬ 
peared. They wait for the police 
even though the body is gone, and 
even though being seen by the po¬ 
lice in a crime-scene kind of situ¬ 
ation is not a good idea when you 
are hiding from them. If you can 
imagine such a thing (try), 
Therese Szymanski’s writing is ac¬ 
tually getting worse, her plots 
more ridiculous. Her characters 
are down to a mere fraction of a 
dimension, and the dialogue is 
painfully drab and stilted. In the 
absence of a guarantee of eternal 
life, and maybe even then, you do 
not have a moment to waste on 
When Some Body Disappears. ▼ 


Palpable pain 


by Deborah Peifer 


Watermark by Karin Kallmaker; 
Naiad, $11.95 

0%. f all Karin Kallmaker’s very 
fine novels, my favorite is 
Touchwood, her extraordi¬ 
nary exploration of love between 
generations. The tale of Louisa 
and Rayann, two adults terrified 
by their feelings for each other be¬ 
cause of the seemingly insur¬ 
mountable gap in their ages, of¬ 
fered a believable, indeed, perfect¬ 
ly rational, hope for true love de¬ 
spite difficulties. Please believe 
that the novel was considerably 
more complex and much more 
entertaining than my brief expli¬ 
cation. Her newest novel, Water¬ 
mark, is a sequel to Touchwood, 
and, mirabile dictu, it may even be 
better. 

Theresa is just beginning her 
new job at a huge ad agency when 
she encounters Rayann, boss from 
hell, a cold bitch who uses lan¬ 
guage to wound and appears in¬ 
capable of any hint of kindness or 
fellow feeling. Moments later, 
Theresa quits in a rage’ We learn 
what Theresa does not know, that 
Rayann’s true love, Louisa, has 
been hit by a drunk driver, and is 
dying by excruciatingly painful 
inches. When, after a series of in¬ 
terim events, Theresa and Rayann 
end up working at another 
agency, Theresa is furious when 
she realizes that Rayann doesn’t 
even remember her, and horrified 
when she discovers that Rayann 
has been transformed from pas¬ 
sionate bitch to lifeless shell. 

The movement toward friend¬ 
ship, lust, love is the framework of 



this novel, but its heart is Kail- 
maker’s stunning exploration of 
loss. Rayann’s pain is rendered 
palpable as we journey with her 
through the devastation of living 
on after any reason for living has 
exploded in death. Kallmaker has 
always been a fine writer, but in 
Watermark she exhibits a depth 
that is gut-wrenching. In a telling 
moment, Rayann is stuck on the 
Bay Bridge, when she looks out 
the window: “The sunset in the 
rearview mirror was incredible. 
She only noticed it because it was 
another beautiful sunset she was¬ 
n’t watching with Louisa.” 

Don’t think that Watermark is 
unrelentingly dreary, though, be¬ 
cause Kallmaker uses a sure end to 
bring humor, love and friendship 
into the mix. Her characters, 
major and minor, are completely 
alive, always fascinating, and we 
care about them passionately.-This 
is a rich, compelling, wonderful 
novel, one that will live long in 
your memory and your heart. ▼

mber Adds Up. 


THE REAL STORY ON PHONE CHAT SYSTEMS. 

OUR NUMBERS ADD UP. 

Some people spend thousands of dollars on a high priced dating 
service. We call these people dumb. 

Some people spend $3.99 a minute to find the love of their life 
or a one night stand. 

We call these people dumber. 

And we mean that in the nicest possible way. 

We don't mean to be arrogant, brash or rude but 
why would you spend hundreds and sometimes 
thousands of dollars when the largest most popular 
gay chat line costs under 80 cents a day? 

If you want to throw away your money — why not 
give it to the charity of your choice. Doesn't that 
make more sense? 

The Number is the largest, most popular gay chat 
line in the U.S. With just one phone call you will 
reach a wide array of choices from 1 on 1 chat to 
locker rooms, group conferences, professional services, 
voice notes, private rooms and more. 

And of course - being big - has its advantages - no 
matter what anyone tells you! The Number has more 
guys on its system, from the San Francisco area, than 
any other phone system out there. And the really cool 
thing about it is that The Number costs less than anyone 
else! Don't take their word for it. Look at the other ads, 
check their rates and see for yourself. The Nu 
costs as low as 80 cents a day when taking a 
membership for $24.00 — allowing you to 
times as you like for the entire month! Or -1 
$12.00 - you will receive unlimited access to 
service for three full days! 

So let's recap, shall we? 

1. The Number is the largest, most popular gay chat phone line in the United States 
(The Number family has locations in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, 
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles as "Malefon", New York, Boston, 
Amsterdam, London, Manchester, Paris and Cologne.) 

2. The Number has the most options and the hottest guys from your area. 

3. The Number costs less then any other phone service out there. 

We just thought you should know. 

Thanks for reading.
