1, INTRODUCTION 

The renewable energy based power generation generates less voltage it will be increased by the dc- 
dc converter. The multilevel inverter has used in industrial application for high power conversion such as 
reactive power compensator, FACTS devices, traction drives. In photovoltaic power generation the boost 
DC—DC converters are widely used. In semiconductor devices the soft switching characteristics is attained 
and also reduce the switching losses by the Cuk converter based on discontinuous capacitor voltage mode. 
The Cuk converter switches are on and off by zero voltage and current switching [1]. The step up converter is 
used in the switched mode power supply device. The Cuk converter based power generation has not use the 
inductor filter at the output side and transferring the quality power by using the control methods. The Cuk 
converter having a continuous current at both input and output sides and used for performance analysis. 
Interleaved Cuk converter is used to reduce the input current ripple and also to improve transient 
performances. The advantages of Cuk converter having better efficiency attributable to cancellation of source 
current ripple, reduction of ripple content in both output voltage and current, and improvement of transient 
performance [2-4]. The step up converter generate large output voltage ripples and slow transient response 
due to the pulsating output capacitor current and the right-half plane zero in transfer function from duty 
ratio to output voltage. The KY converter has less output voltage ripples and fast transient response 
compared with the boost converter. The integrated KY converter has designed with power components 
including energy transferring capacitor, inductor, and filter capacitor are evaluated [5]. The KY converter has

integration of synchronous rectified boost converter and coupled inductor. This converter has analyzed the 
relationship of output voltage and load current. 

The KY converter has high voltage gain by the integration of two converters such as boost and 
inductor coupled. The leakage inductance of the coupled inductor is used to attain the zero voltage switching 
(ZVS) and the current stress on the charge pump capacitors and the decreasing rate of the diode current can 
be limited due to the use of the coupled inductor and output current is non-pulsating [6]. The KY converter 
based multilevel modular inverter has decrease the voltage and current stress of switching device and 
increase the efficiency of the converter based system. The output voltage of the Cuk based multilevel inverter 
has increases the high gain by the turn’s ratio and duty cycle. The output of the KY converter has both buck 
as well as boost converter [7]. The H bridge inverter has used to reduce the power switches, losses, voltage 
stress and converter cost. The multilevel inverter has reduces the harmonics and improve the performance of 
the converter system. The photovoltaic energy based inverter system has effective and efficient power 
electronic device interface with source. The inverter has operated in both symmetrical and asymmetrical 
mode [9-11]. 


2. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

The multilevel inverter has to decrease the voltage stress and harmonic distortion. The multilevel 
inverter has used more number of switches as compared to conventional two level inverters [8]. The 
multilevel inverter based hybrid converter such as Cuk and KY. The controller of KY Converter utilizes the 
maximum power point tracking control method for generating high power from the photovoltaic source [12].

The renewable energy such as solar and fuel cell generate the dc voltage having less magnitude. The 
voltage is improved by the Cuk and KY converter is cascaded and the dc link output is fed into the multilevel 
inverter will generate comparatively less total harmonic distortion and improved the efficiency of the inverter 
fed renewable energy system [13-14]. The dc link voltage is compared with reference voltage and is fed into 
the PI control based pulse width modulation will regulate the output of the Cuk based fuel cell. The KY 
converter utilizes the maximum power point tracking for improving the voltage gain as well as regulates the 
voltage.

3.1. Solar Power Generation 

The solar based renewable energy produces the power from radiation. The semiconductor material 
used to convert the sunlight radiation into electricity. The photovoltaic system has an important for 
distributed power generation. PV system consists of number of solar cells these are connected in series for 
generating electrical power with high potential. The photons of light fall on the semiconductor material and 
the electrons flow in the material [17]. The proposed solar power generation has nonlinear power can change 
with the environmental condition, less maintenance and cost effective. The voltage produced from the PV 
cell depends on the semiconductor used and also varying temperature, insolation etc. The PN junction 
absorbs the radiation and forms the electron hole pair [15]. Thus the light energy is converted to electrical 
energy. The single diode PV module is shown in Figure 2.

The Cuk converter has achieved the stable operation and use the inductor and capacitor for reducing 
the ripple at the output. The converter reduces the switching losses and conduction losses using the MOSFET 
switches. In Cuk converter the low range of passive elements is used for leading the current regulation. The 
inductor used as the filter for decreasing the harmonic ripple. In capacitor is used for transferring the energy.

The multilevel inverter is used to reduce the harmonics and increase the performance of renewable 
energy system. The cascaded H bridge multilevel inverter is used the single dc source with switched 
capacitor for attaining high efficiency. The cascaded multilevel inverter generate multilevel with less power 
supply. This inverter reduces the power switches and function as unidirectional characteristics. The single dc 
source is used to increase the level and also decrease the total harmonic distortion [18].
