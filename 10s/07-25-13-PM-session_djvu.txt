PROCEEDINGS, 

THE  JUDGE:     Court  is  called  to  order.  Let 
the  record  reflect  all  parties  present  when  the  court 
last  recessed  are  again  present  In  the  court. 

Major  Fein? 

MR.  FEIN:     Your  Honor,  the  next  dataset 
CIDNE-Iraq,   CIDNE  Afghanistan  sets.     These  go  to 
Specifications  4,   5,    6  and  7  of  Charge  2. 

Your  Honor,   essentially,   to  use 
PFC  Manning's  own  Words,   the  inventory  of  SIGACTS  that 
he  released  to  WikiLeaks  is,   quote,   one  of  the  more 
significant  documents  of  our  time  because  it  reveals 
the  true  nature  of  the  21st  century  asymmetric  warfare. 
Prosecution  Exhibit  42 .     The  document  that  was  included 
the  CIDNE-I  and  CIDNE-A  SIGACTS  on  the  SD  card. 

To  truly  understand  why  PFC  Manning  himself 
considered  these  SIGACTS  so  important  begs  the 
question:     What  is  a  SIGACT? 

By  definition,  a  SIGACT  is  a  report  of 
significant  activity  captured  in  theater.  SIGACTS 
capture  enemy  activities,   our  responses  and  our  TTPs  to

win  our  wars . 

For  example,   if  the  mlli'tary  convoy  were 
hit  by  an  lED,   -that  event  would  be  captured  in  a 
SIGACT. 

Your  Honor,   what  else  would  be  captured  in 
a  SIGACT?     Where  and  when  the  attack  happened,  which 
unit  was  Involved,   the  type  of  lED,   how  successful  the 
attack  was,   whether  there  were  any  casualties,  which 
enemy  organizations  are  responsible  for  the  attack, 
what  tactical  intelligence  we  gathered  from  the  attack 
and  what  steps  we  took  in  response  to  the  attack. 
Simply  put.   Your  Honor,   SIGACTS  detail  how  we  defeat 
our  enemies  and  what  enemies  use  to  harm  us . 

Your  Honor,   how  do  we  use  SIGACTS? 

Mr.   Hall  testified  that  commanders  in  the 
field  use  SIGACTS  every  day  to  make  tactical  decisions . 

Mr.   Hall  testified  that  intelligence 
analysts  are  often  tasked  to  provide  the  commander  with 
insights  into  what  events  have  taken  place  along,  for 
example,   a  main  supply  route  over  a  certain  period  of 
time .

Intelligence  analysts  pull  all  SIGACTS 
taking  place  on  that  supply  road.     They  plot  those 
events  on  a  map  so  that  the  commander  can  visualize  the 
enemy  and  what  the  enemy  is  doing  or  not  doing. 

These  aids  help  the  commander  understand 
the  enemy  trends  and  decide  whether  to  continue  using 
that  supply  route  or  redirect  the  convoy  in  a  different 
direction . 

Commanders  use  SIGACTS  every  day  to  make 
decisions  to  defeat  the  enemy  and  protect  our  soldiers . 

As  Captain  Fulton  testified,   the  commander 
of  210  Mountain  relied  on  her  predictive  analysis  and 
he  was  no  different.     Captain  Fulton,   on  a  weekly 
basis,   briefed  Colonel  Miller  on  enemy  trends  they  were 
identified  based  off  of  SIGACTS  by  PFC  Manning.  Those 
SIGACTS  helped  Colonel  Miller  decide  how  to  employ  the 
sources,  protect  soldiers. 

Sergeant  First  Class  Anica,  he  also  gave 
the  court  an  example  of  how  the  date  of  a  SIGACT  does 
not  necessarily  correlate  to  its  value  to  commanders . 
He  testified  about  an  event  that  happened  during  a

previous  deployment  where  two  soldiers  were  captured  by 
enemy  forces .     He  explained  how  the  unit  reviewed 
SIGACTS  for  the  three  to  four  years  to  determine  what 
enemy  was  located  In  that  area  and  what  tactics, 
techniques  and  procedures  those  In  that  area  employed 
In  order  to  figure  out  where  those  two  soldiers  could 
be  found. 

Those  SIGACTS  help  the  unit  determine  who 
was  responsible  for  the  captured  and  where  they  were 
being  held  captured. 

Sergeant  First  Class  Anlca  testified  that 
he  trained  PFC  Manning  prior  to  the  deployment  on  the 
use  of  SIGACTS  and  how  critical  they  are,   even  older 
SIGACTS  and  how  the  enemy  understands  our  forces . 

Why  do  we  store  SIGACTS  In  SIPRNET? 

SIGACTS  are  only  available  on  SIPRNET 
because  they're  an  Invaluable  resource  that  Is 
released.   Your  Honor,   to  the  enemy  to  not  only  teach 
them  about  our  TTPs  but  reveal  what  we  know  about  them. 

Each  Intelligence  professional  from  210 
Mountain  testified  to  this  point.     They  testified  that

with  this  tactical  Insight,   the  enemy  can  adjust  and 
become  more  successful  In  carrying  out  their  attacks. 

Why  do  we  safeguard  the  tactical  reports? 
Because  those  reports  help  us  to  make  all  the  tactical 
decisions  necessary  to  defeat  the  enemies. 

The  value  of  the  tactical  reports  correlate 
to  the  exclusive  use  and  benefit  of  this  Information. 
This  Is  the  type  of  Information  PFC  Manning  disclosed 
to  WlklLeaks  knowing  that  terrorist  organizations  use 
WlklLeaks  to  gather  Intelligence  such  as  the  marine 
table   (Inaudible) . 

This  Is  not  purely  historical  data  without 
any  value  as  the  defense  argued.     Instead,  this  Is 
data,   this  data  Is  extremely  valuable  for  tour 
commanders  as  part  of  the  military  decision— making 
process  to  make  realtime  decisions  that  ultimately  save 
our  lives . 

Furthermore,   Your  Honor,   the  value  of  the 
tactical  Information  to  our  enemies  Is  without 
question  —  well.   Is  without  question  the  value, 
especially  given  the  fact  that  OBL  himself,  Osama  bin

Laden  himself,   asked  for  Information  and  received  It, 
the  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE  database  for  Afghanistan. 

And  now,  because  of  PFC  Manning,   this  Is 
the  type  of  tactical  Information  that  was  and  Is  In  the 
hands  of  OBL  on  the  day  he  died  and  currently  In  the 
hands  of  all  enemies  of  the  United  States . 

Your  Honor,   the  Combined  Information  Data 
Network,   CIDNE,   Is  the  direct  reporting  system  used  by 
all  forces  within  the  US  CENTCOM. 

The  program  manager  testified  that  he ' s 
(Inaudible)  to  separately  track  our  combine  operations 
In  Iraq  and  also  track  In  Afghanistan. 

Your  Honor,   you  heard  testimony  that  a 
significant  activity  generally  consists  of  key  leader 
engagements,   mission  report  logs  which  track  troop 
movements    (Inaudible) ,    focus  on  duty,  status 
whereabouts  and  known  DUST  worm,   which  will  you 
describe  the  names  of  captured  or  missing  service 
members  In  the  TTP  that  we  employ  to  locate  our  missing 
service  members .

Include  the  names  of  detained  persons  and  local 
nationals     some  of  whom  made  these  sources  for 
neighboring  U.S.   source  forces,    (inaudible).  Certain 
weaponry  they  use  against  the  United  States . 

Your  Honor,   within  seven  weeks  of  having 
access  to  SIPRNET,  PFC  Manning  deliberately  chose  to 
download  and  steal  a  portion  of  the  CIDNE— I  Iraq 
database  containing  more  than  380,000  SIGACTS  and  a 
portion  of  the  CIDNE— A  Afghanistan  database  containing 
more  than  90,000  SIGACTS. 

PFC  Manning  had  extensive  experience 
dealing  with  SIGACTS  at  Fort  Driom  and  FOB  Hammer. 

PFC  Manning  provided  weekly  briefings  based 
on  SIGACTS  based  off  also  their  anticipated  need 
because  they  were  going  to  employ  first  Afghanistan  and 
then  Iraq. 

At  FOB  Hammer,  members  of  the  PFC  Manning 
unit  testified  that  PFC  Manning  had  constant  exposure 
to  AO,   particularly  the  SIGACTS  related  to  lEDs . 

So  what  did  Private  First  Class  Manning  do 
with  these  trained  skills?     Starting  in  late  December

of  2009  he  began  exporting  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
SIGACTS  from  2004  to  2009.     That's  six  years  or  72 
months  of  SIGACTS  from  two  different  databases. 

The  CIDNE  databases  contained  an  export 
feature  to  allow  intelligence  analysts  to  export 
SIGACTS  in  30— day  increments  as  part  of  their  study  of 
enemy  trends  over  a  period  of  time . 

Therefore,   in  order  to  export  the  SIGACTS, 
Private  First  Class  Manning  had  to  export  them  in 
monthly  increments . 

Put  another  way,   he  had  to  click  the  export 
classic  Excel  function  on  the  bottom  right  of  the  CIDNE 
screen.     He  had  to  push  it  72  times  per  database  to 
accomplish  this  feat.     That's  a  total  of  144  times  he 
had  to  click  export  to  take  all  the  SIGACTS  from 
CIDNE— A  and  I  databases  at  this  time,  the  first  part  of 
January . 

Pulling  the  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE 
Afghanistan  database  even  required  more  diligence  and 
advanced  understanding  of  the  networks  on  SIPKNET . 

PFC  Manning  was  stationed  in  Iraq  at  the

time,   deployed  in  Iraq. 

The  main  CIDNE  Afghanistan  database  was 
inaccessible  in  Afghanistan,   a  specific  design 
limitation . 

Mr.   Holifeld  testified  that  CENTCOM 
maintained  CIDNE  servers  in  Tampa  as  well  as  both 
theaters  of  operation  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan . 

The  CIDNE— Iraq  and  Afghanistan  servers  do 
not  share  the  same  information . 

The  CIDNE  Afghanistan  database  is  only 
available  to  users  hooked  up  to  servers  located  in 
Afghanistan  or  the  backup  server  in  Tampa. 

Your  Honor,   the  defense  seems  to  imply  that 
PFC  Manning  downloaded  SIGACTS  to  create  local  backup 
disks.     In  case  the  SIPRNET  or  D6-A  doesn't  work,  the 
defense  presented  no  evidence  that  this  actually 
occurred.     In  fact,   the  evidence  for  CIDNE— A  is  to  the 
contrary. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that 
PFC  Manning ' s  computer  connected  with  the  CIDNE 
Afghanistan  server  in  Tampa  between  1  and  7

January  2010,   the  Centaur  logs,   again  measuring  net 
flow  data  captured  this  activity  that ' s  at  Prosecution 
Exhibit  152,   Your  Honor. 

The  logs  also  show  that  the  only  times  that 
PFC  Manning ' s  computer  connected  to  the  CIDNE— A  servers 
in  Tampa  were  between  1  and  7  January  2010  and  no  other 
time  in  the  103  days  recorded  in  the  Centaur  logs. 

Mr.   Holifeld  testified  that  PFC  Manning 
pulled  the  last  batch  of  SIGACTS  from  the  SIGACT  Iraq 
database  on  3  January  2010,   on  3  January  2010. 

He  also  testified  that  PFC  Manning  pulled 
the  batch  of  SIGACTS  from  CIDNE-A  database  four  days 
later,   on  7  January  2010,    7  January,  2010. 

Private  Manning  stored  the  CIDNE  databases 
in  a  password  protected  folder  named  yadda  dot  tar  dot 
bz2  at  dot  NC.     You  heard  from  Special  Agent  Shaver, 
and  that  was  on  an  SD  card  that  was  later  found  and 
admitted  as  PE92 . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  also  testified  that 
this  folder  on  the  SD  card  was  created  on  30 
January  2010.

He  testified  that  he  was  able  to  view  the 
content  of  this  folder  by  using  the  same  password 
PFC  Manning  provided  Adrian  Lamo  on  his  chats . 

He  testified  that  within  the  yadda  folder 
there  were  three  different  files  in  that  encrypted 
file. 

The  portions  of  the  CIDNE-I  and  CIDNE-A 
databases  containing  the  SIGACTS  were  stored  under  the 
file  names  Iraq  underscore  events  dot  CSV  —  excuse  me, 
IRQ  underscore  events  dot  CSV  and  AFG  underscore  events 
dot  CSV. 

These  are  two  CSV  files  which  you've  heard 
is  essentially  the  same  as  an  Excel  spreadsheet. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  the 
file  name  IRQ  dot  CSQ  was  last  written  on  5 
January  2010  and  the  Afghanistan  file  was  written  three 
days  later,   8  January  2010. 

Your  Honor,  we  knew  that  PFC  Manning  took 
his  SD  card  containing  more  than  470,000  SIGACTS  from 
the  CIDNE-A  and  CIDNE-I  databases  with  him  on  R  and  R.

Maryland  where  he  stayed  during  R  and  R.     It  was  during 
this  time  In  R  and  R  when  PFC  Manning  transferred  the 
SIGACTS  from  his  personal  computer  to  WlklLeaks  and 
then  his  SD  card  onto  his  SD  card  for  safekeeping. 

Your  Honor,  the  evidence  shows  that  the 
transmission  occurred  prior  to  1  February  2010  while 
PFC  Manning  was  In  Boston  visiting  friends .     A  transfer 
to  WlklLeaks  occurred  prior  to  1  February,    2010,  while 
PFC  Manning  was  In  Boston . 

How  do  we  know  this?     PFC  Manning 
forenslcally  wiped  his  computer  and  reinstalled  the 
operator  system  on  30  January  2010.  Prosecution 
Exhibit  Alpha  and  126  Bravo  are  the  Install  logs  from 
PFC  Manning ' s  personal  computer . 

THE  JUDGE:     What  was  the  Prosecution 

Exhibit  ? 

MR.  FEIN:  Yes,  ma'am.  Prosecution  Exhibit

through  86.     78  through  86  show  PFC  Manning  executing  a 
7— pass  disk  erase.     After  three  hours  and  48  minutes  It 
was  complete,    forenslcally  wiping  his  machine  on  31 
January  20,10,   not  one  time.   Your  Honor,   seven  times, 
and  after  three  hours  It  was  complete . 

Mr.   Johnson  testified  that,  based  off  his 
review  of  this  log,   that  PFC  Manning  successfully  wiped 
all  of  the  evidence  that  had  been  deleted  on  his 
personal  computer  on  this  date.     This  occurred  while  he 
was  still  In  Boston.

Agent.  Shaver  was  able  to  recover  from  March  2010  on  his 
personal  map;^   there  are  no  other  SIGACTS  on  the 
computer,   not  a  single  remnant  of  470,000  SIGACTS  from 
30  January  2010  and  forward  —  excuse  me  —  31 
January  2010  on  his  personal  computer. 

The  only  reasonable  explanation  for  this. 
Your  Honor,   Is  that  PFC  Manning  erased  any  evidence  of 
the  transmission  of  the  SIGACT  to  WlklLeaks  when  he 
wiped  the  free  space  on  his  computer  on  31  January 
2010. 

Otherwise,    some  remnant  of  the  470,000 
SIGACTS  would  likely  be  on  his  computer  like  the  volume 
dot  txt  and  other  recovered  docviments.  The 
transmission  had  to  have  occurred  prior  to  31 
January  2010. 

Once  returning  from  Boston,   PFC  Manning 
left  that  SD  card  along  with  other  possessions  of  his 
at  his  aunt ' s  house  In  Maryland,   and  that ' s  after 
disclosing  the  SIGACTS  to  WlklLeaks  while  he  was  In 
Boston .

the  SIGACTS  on  the  SD  card,    PFC  Manning  wrote  and 
stored  a  document  he  called  read  me  dot  text  admitted 
into  evidence  as  PE42 . 

Your  Honor,   displayed  on  the  screen  is 
PE42 .     WikiLeaks,   note  to  WikiLeaks,   PFC  Manning  note 
to  WikiLeaks  explaining  the  items  of  historic 
significance,   although  he  ignored  his  training  and 
experience  when  it  came  to  compromising  classified 
information . 

It  is  clear  he  applied  the  same  training 
and  experience  to  identify  the  SIGACTS  themselves  were 
historical  significance  and  compilation  was  more  of 
significant  documents . 

Your  Honor,   what  did  PFC  Manning  also  know 
in  late  January  2010,   that  this  information  was  also 
significant  to  the  enemies  of  the  United  States, 
removing  the  fog  of  war  that  protected  us  from 
unconventional  enemies  and  those  that  fight  on  the 
asymmetric  battlefield. 

Although  he  is  the  source  of  these  SIGACTS 
would  be  protected  if  the  information  was  sat  on  for

perhaps  90  to  100  days,   he  would  be  protected  as  the 
source  if  it  was  sat  on  between  90  and  180  days. 

He  knew,   he  knew  that  all  of  the 
intelligence  and  individuals  named  within  those  reports 
would  never  be  protected  once  it  was  removed  from  the 
classified  SIPRNET  system  and  released  to  the  world. 

Your  Honor,   again  that  is  Prosecution 

Exhibit  42. 

Your  Honor,   how  proud  was  PFC  Manning  of 
his  actions  knowing  he  was  able  to  get  away  with  this 
and  finally  start  down  the  path  of  obtaining  the 
worldwide  notoriety .

In  this  particular   (inaudible) ,   Your  Honor, 
this  is  not  a  picture  of  a  person,   of  a  troubled  person 
conflicted  by  his  action  as  the  defense  wants  you  to 
believe.     This  is  a  picture  of  a  person  who  thought  he 
was  finally  becoming  famous  with  that  information  on 
the  SD  card . 

Your  Honor,   the  CIDNE  SIGACTS  were  the 
first  large  scale  thefts  of  information  by  PFC  Manning. 
It  is  clear  that  PFC  Manning  viewed  the  SD  card  as  his 
own  trophy  for  his  accomplishments. 

Could  he  have  kept  the  information  erased 
on  his  personal  computer  and  not  copied  over  to  SD  card 
after  disclosing  the  contents  to  WikiLeaks?     Yes.  But 
just  like  he  created  the  mock  tasking  order  that  we 
would  talk  about  later  detailing  his  intent, 
PFC  Manning  wanted  to  forever  memorialize  for  himself 
the  fruit  to  his  labor  as  he  continued  to  exfiltrate 
U.S.   Government  databases  and  portions  thereof . 

Even  five  months  later.    Your  Honor,  on 
26  May  2010,   PFC  Manning  stated  to  Adrian  Lamo  that  he 
provided  what  he  called  highlights  of  the  disclosures

which  included  the  SIGACTS  within  the  CIDNE  databases . 
That's  on  page  46,   Your  Honor,   of  the  Lamo  chats.  Thus 
admitted  to  providing  portions  of  the  CIDNE— A  and  A 
database  to  WikiLeaks  and  recognizing  the  inherent 
importance  of  these  docviments . 

When  PFC  Manning  extracted  records  from  the 
CIDNE  database  to  his  personal  computer,  he  completed 
his  theft  of  those  records . 

The  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE  databases  are 
stored  on  a  classified  system  and  only  available  to 
authorized  personnel  with  a  need  to  know  and  who  could 
access  them  on  SIPRNET. 

At  no  time  was  PFC  Manning  authorized  to 
house  those  records  on  his  personal  laptop  or  on  his  SD 
card  at  his  aunt's  house. 

Furthermore,   PFC  Manning  converted  the 
information  of  the  records  from  the  CIDNE  databases 
from,   he  conveyed  them  to  WikiLeaks  for  publication. 

PFC  Manning  specifically  intended  for  the 
records  to  be  released  and  WikiLeaks  obliged.  The 
United  States  devoted  significant  resources  to  protect

this  classified  Inf  orma'tlon . 

Mr.  Lewis  testified  that  foreign 
Intelligence  services  will  pay  for  the  Information 
precisely  because  Its  exclusive  possession  provides  a 
significant  benefit  to  the  United  States .  The 
publication  of  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE  databases 
completely  deprived  the  United  States  of  this  exclusive 
possession  of  the  use  of  that  Information. 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  knew  the  charge 
documents  for  specifications  5  and  7  of  charge  2  were 
classified.     These  documents  are  probably  marked  secret 
within  the  classified  Information  field  of  SIGACT 
reports . 

Further,   these  docioments  are  located  on 
SIPRNET  and  the  United  States  has  not  made  these 
documents  available  to  the  pijbllc .     They  were  closely 
held. 

The  charged  dociiments  themselves  for 
specifications  5  and  7  of  charge  2  relates  to  the 
national  defense  of  the  United  States .  Lieutenant

testified  the  docioments  contained  a  type  of  Information 
which  would  cause  serious  harm  to  national  security  and 
thus  should  be  secret . 

It  was  the  type  of  Information  that  could 
be  useful  to  our  adversaries  and  the  type  of 
Information  that  PFC  Manning  knew  would  be  useful  to 
the  adversaries . 

Admiral    (Inaudible)   US  CENTCOM  deputy 
commander  and  the  OCA  testified  that  the  charge 
documents  within  both  datasets,   the  CIDNE-I  SIGACTS  and 
CIDNE-A  SIGACTS,   are  classified  at  secret  level  because 
their  release  could  cause  harm  to  national  security. 

Your  Honor,   If  I  may  have  a  moment. 

THE  JUDGE:  Yes. 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  and 
Major  Hurley  have  relocated  to  the  witness  box  In  order 
to  look  at  classified  Information  and  I  have  handed

value  of  the  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE-A  database  far 
exceeds  the  statutory  mlnlmTuns . 

Specifically,   Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  the 
Foreign  Intelligence  Services  of  multiple  countries 
actively  seek  information  contained  within  the  SIGACTS 
and  would  pay  money  from  the  SIGACTS  from  CIDNE 
Afghanistan . 

The  Foreign  Intelligence  Services  seek 
information  pertaining  to  the  United  States  military 
tactics,   techniques  and  procedures,   TTPs,   which  show 
operation  strategies,   responses  to  attacks  and  the 
units  involved  in  TTPs  and  military  operations  in 
Afghanistan  detailed  in  classified  reason  nvimber  1 . 

Your  Honor,   when  you're  finished  looking  at

I ' 11  continue . 

THE  JUDGE:      I  have. 

MR.  FEIN:     Yes,  ma'am.

Mr.   Lewis  called  his  valuation  conservative  as  set. 
forth  in  classified  reason  2 . 

Your  Honor,   a  Foreign  Intelligence  Service 
has  paid  $50  each  for  docioments  containing  information 
similar  to  that  found  in  the  SIGACTS.     Mr.  Lewis 
determined  that  a  Foreign  Intelligence  Service  would 
value  at  least  30  percent  of  the  SIGACTS  from  the 
CIDNE-A  database . 

Based  on  Mr.   Lewis'   evaluation  and  the 
price  paid  per  document,   the  90,000  SIGACTS  from  the 
CIDNE— A  database  are  worth  approximately  $1.3  million 
to  a  Foreign  Intelligence  Service . 

Your  Honor,   that  is  30  percent  of  90,000 
documents  times  $50 . 

Your  Honor,  Mr.   Lewis  also  testified  that 
the  value  of  the  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE-I  Iraq  database 
far  exceeded  the  statutory  minimums . 

Specifically,   Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  the 
Foreign  Intelligence  Services  of  multiple  countries 
actively  seek  information  contained  in  the  SIGACTS  and 
would  pay  for  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE— I  rack  database.

tactics  and  procedures  which  show  operational 
strategies,   responses  to  attacks  and  the  units  involved 
in  TTPs  of  military  operations  in  Iraq  as  detailed  in 
classified  reason  number  3. 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  country  2  would 
pay  at  least  $10,000  for  the  records  in  the  CIDNE-I 
rack,   the  SIGACTS  in  the  CIDNE-I  rack  database,  and 
Mr.   Lewis  called  his  valuation  conservative  as  set

A  Foreign  Intelligence  Service  has  paid  $50 
for  docviments  containing  information  similar  to  that 
found  in  the  SIGACT.     Mr.   Lewis  determined  that  a

Based  on  Mr.   Lewis'   evaluation,   the  price 
paid  per  document,   the  380,000  records,   SIGACTS  in  the 
CIDNE— I  database  are  worth  approximately  $1.9  million 
to  a  Foreign  Intelligence  Service  which  is  10  percent 
of  $3,850,000  times  $50.

THE  JUDGE :  Do  you  request  to  retrieve  them

Your  Honor,   the  ACIC  report  provided 
PFC  Manning  with  the  actual  knowledge  that  the  enemies 
of  the  United  States  would  use  classified  Information 
obtained  from  WlklLeaks  against  the  United  States  and 
knowing  that  PFC  Manning  deliberately  disclosed  this 
document,  this  document  to  the  world  through  WlklLeaks.

PFC  Manning  knew  that  it  must  also  be  presumed  that

That's  on  page  21,   Your  Honor,  of 
Prosecution  Exhibit  45 . 

So  you'll  see.   Your  Honor,   that  this  charge 
document  serves  as  another  warning  to  PFC  Manning  as  to 
the  dangers  of  posting  information  on  the  internet 
generally  and  once  more  on  WikiLeaks  specifically.

types  of  information  contained  in  that  report  as  well 
as  its  markings,   the  accused  knew  that  the  unauthorized 
release  of  that  single  report  itself  could  cause 
serious  damage  to  national  security. 

As  you  heard  from  Ms.   Gwynn,   the  ACIC 
document  is  only  available  on  SIPRNET.     At  the  time  it 
was  taken  from  the  U.S.   Government  or  on  (inaudible)

PFC  Manning  that  it  was  a  classified  information  and

THE  JUDGE:     How  many  times  did  you  say? 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   114  times  beginning 
on  19  November  2009  which  is  essentially  within  a  few 
days  of  PFC  Manning  having  access  to  SIPRNET  without  a 
soldier  to  his  left  or  right  during  RIP/TOA. 

Your  Honor,   the  first  time  the  United 
States  can  prove  PFC  Manning  viewed  the  ACIC  report  was 
on  1  December  although  he  accessed  the  website  on  19 
November.     PFC  Manning  was  on  the  ACIC  website  viewing 
that  docTunent  weeks  before  Christmas  Eve  of  2009. 

Your  Honor,   what  did  PFC  Manning  do  after 
reading  the  ACIC  docTiment,   ignoring  the  warnings 
eniomerated  in  the  document  and  then  compromise  the  ACIC 
document  to  WikiLeaks .     He  obsessively  followed  its 
release  and  (inaudible)   in  the  amount  of  press  the 
release  was  receiving. 

And  in  the  Assange  chat  PFC  Manning  makes 
clear  his  need  to  monitor  the  attention  his  actions 
were  receiving . 

PFC  Manning  told  Julian  Assange  that  a  US

Government  official.    Lieutenant  Colonel  Packnett, 
confirmed  the  authenticity  of  the  ACIC  reports  to  the 
New  York  Times  laughing  this  action  is  contravention  of 
the  typical  policy  to  protect  classified  information  by 
neither  confirming  or  denying  the  authenticity  of 
classified  information. 

Your  Honor,   that's  clearly  stated  in  the 
Assange  chats  page  13 . 

Your  Honor,   the  accused  repeatedly  searched 
cables  on  WikiLeaks .     He  repeatedly  accessed  it  and 
ultimately  disclosed  it  to  WikiLeaks .     The  intelligence 
report  relates  to  national  defense  discussing 
specifically  our  vulnerabilities  to  WikiLeaks  and  the 
terrorist  organizations  their  actions  aid. 

This  docTiment  was  classified  and  not 
released  publicly  until  PFC  Manning  took  it  upon 
himself  to  unilaterally  decide  the  world,   including  the 
enemies  of  this  country,    should  receive  it . 

Your  Honor,   the  next  charged  document  is 
the  Apache  video.     This  is  specification  2  of  charge  2.

for  release,    the  video  is  compromised  by  PFC  Manning 
with  over  38  minutes  of  footage  from  United  States  to 
the  Apache  helicopter. 

Ultimately,   the  WikiLeaks  was  posted  to  the 
world  on  5—8—2010,   to  the  activist  organization  on  15 
February  2010. 

With  regard  to  the  content  of  the  video. 
Your  Honor,   you  heard  primarily  from  Chief  Warrant 
Officer  5  John  LaRue  has  been  an  Apache  helicopter 
pilot  more  than  quarter  of  a  century  flying  Apache 
helicopters.      (Inaudible)   depicts  the  display  of  the 
Apache  helicopter. 

He  shows  the  angles  of  depicts  how  pilots 
use  technology  on  aircraft  and  exposes  our  use  of  laser 
technology  to  obtain  key  metrics . 

Overall,  the  video  documents  the  actions 
and  experiences  of  U.S.  service  members  conducting  a 
wartime  mission. 

With  regard  to  the  manner  in  which  the 
video  is  treated.   Chief  LaRue  testified  that  the 
footage  contains  a  sort  of  information  preserved  to

facill'ta'te  lessons  learned  by  our  aviation  communl'ty 
and  that  protected  from  compromise  by  placement  on 
SIPRNET  system. 

The  Information  Is  reviewed  and  sanitized 
prior  to  any  potential  public  release.     Although  the 
Apache  video  Is  classified.   It's  sensitive. 

The  senior  pilot  testified  that  this 
Information  Is  the  same  type  he  had  been  taught  and 
himself  teaches  never  to  release . 

Why  Is  that.   Your  Honor? 

As  Chief  LaRue  explained,   this  Information 
benefits  our  adversaries  by  communicating  our  tactics, 
techniques  and  procedures  and  Informing  them  on  the 
limitations  of  the  U.S.   government's  technology. 

Your  Honor,  the  defense  would  have  you 
believe  that  a  verbatim  transcript  of  the  Incident  had 
already  been  made  public  and  this  somehow  showed  the 
video  wasn't  closely  held  and  excuses  the  accused's 
conduct .     This  United  States  myth  Is  actually  a  red 
herring .

topics  also  addressed  in  open  source  material,    so  is 
true  the  incident  depicted  in  the  charged  video  was  no 
secret . 

However,    just  like  every  other  piece  of 
protected  U.S.   government  material  in  this  case,   at  no 
point  was  the  entirety  of  this  video  officially 
released  and  no  point  were  images  made  piiblic  and  no 
point  was  the  TTP  information  contained  disclosed. 
Even  the  book  itself  didn't  describe  the  weapons  or 
engagement  response . 

Moreover,   the  transcript  in  the  Finkel  book 
is  not  actually  verbatim  although  the  portions  are 
similar .     There ' s  been  no  evidence  that  the  embedded 
journalist  ever  saw  the  video,   and  the  author  mentions 
the  sensitivity  of  protecting  the  sources  and  methods 
from  which  the  content  is  derived,   the  content  of  his 
book . 

What ' s  more  is  that  based  especially  AIT 
and  on— the— job  training  already  discussed,   PFC  Manning 
knew  the  value  of  the  video  to  the  enemy  as  well  as  the 
need  to  protect  the  information  it  contained.

Disregarding  the  sensitivity  of  this 
material,   PFC  Manning  thought  the  video  was  cool  and 
decided  to  release  it  to  a  bunch  of  ant i— government 
activists  and  anarchists  to  achieve  a  maximiom  exposure, 
the  maximum  exposure  and  advance  his  personal  quest  for 
notoriety . 

Ultimately,   this  video  is  released  by 
WikiLeaks,   yet  PFC  Manning's  involvement  in  this  tale 
and  the  compromised  region  as  far  back  the  December  of 
the  previous  year.     PFC  Manning  saw,  researched, 
released  and  then  assisted  in  doctoring  the  video  for 
maximiom  impact,   all  notwithstanding  his  understanding 
of  the  nature  of  the  material . 

PFC  Manning  first  saw  the  video  in  December 
of  2009  with  soldiers  in  unit.     Ms.   Showman,  Captain 
Fulton,   Chief  Balonek  all  testified  that  the  video  was 
located  on  the  unit  SIPRNET,   their  SIPRNET  share  drive. 

This  drive  Captain  Cherepko  testified  was 
acceptable  to  any  individuals  with  appropriate 
clearance  such  as  PFC  Manning  and  his  analyst 
colleagues .

Your  Honor,    22  January  2010,  22 
January  2010,   PFC  Manning  left  Iraq  for  his  R  and  R 
leave .     During  this  time  he  erased  his  computer  in 
order  to  destroy  any  evidence  regarding  the  Gharani 
video  and  the  CIDNE  databases,   the  SIGACTS  portions  of 
the  CIDNE  databases . 

By  this  point.   Your  Honor,   in  22  January 
2010,   PFC  Manning  realized  that  his  previous  Gharani 
leak  would  not  be  released  any  time  soon  because  it  was 
encrypted.     This  reality  was  essentially  utterly 
unsatisfactory  to  them. 

Through  researching  the  event,   PFC  Manning 
released  the  Apache  incident  had  been  sijbject  to  a  FOIA 
quest .     This  Apache  video  was  his  opportunity  to  and 
therefore  would  be  his  next  target . 

PFC  Manning,   returning  to  theater  on  14 
February  2010,   less  than  24  hours  later  on  15 
February  2010  he  burned  the  Apache  footage  and  its 
associated  documents  onto  a  disk  from  his  SIPRNET  D6— A 
computer  and  he  took  that  material  out  of  the  T— SCIF  to

That  video     along  with  the  Reykjavik  13

Prosecution  Exhibit  127  is  the  voliime  dot

in  the  disk  found  in  his  shoe  at  the  time  of  his 
arrest . 

However,   Your  Honor,   compromising  Apache 
video  to  WikiLeaks  wasn ' t  going  to  be  enough  for 
PFC  Manning.     The  entire  video  would  not  make  the 
splash  he  wanted  and  garner  the  attention  he  craved. 

PFC  Manning  didn ' t  get  the  reaction  he 
desperately  wanted  from  that  Gharani  video.  It 
couldn ' t  be  released  because  WikiLeaks  didn ' t  have  the 
password.     This  meant  that  PFC  Manning  was  deprived  the 
notoriety  his  actions  deserved. 

If  WikiLeaks  didn't  make  the  press,  how 
could  he  be  the  one  that  hailed  the  source .

biggest  splash  and  it  received  the  most  attention. 

So  accordingly.   Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning 
ultimately  participated  in  editing  the  video  which 
would  later  be  released  by  WikiLeaks  under  the  name  of 
"Collateral  Murder." 

Your  Honor,   this  is  Prosecution  Exhibit  41.

There  should  be  no  transmlt'ted.     The  only  thing  — 

(Whereupon,   there  were  announcements  in  the

MR.  FEIN:     Your  Honor,  these  are  not  the 
actions  of  a  naive  person  stumbling  onto  something  he 
thought  should  be  made  public.     Instead,  this  a  capable 
soldier  being  trained  with  his  experience  regarding  the 
enemy's  priorities  and  resources  and  with  an  agenda. 
Your  Honor,   he's  a  soldier  that  can't  live  on  his

PFC  Manning  used  search  to  search  open

also  edited  the  collateral  one  murder  video  on  his  dot 
source  computer .

although  In  a  clandestlned  form  PFC  Manning  brought  to 
the  attention  of  Captain  Fulton  who  compared  the  link

reaction,  he  burned  the  souvenir  copy  three  days  later. 

Then  In  May  PFC  Manning  discussed  via

Finally,  PFC  Manning's  own  aunt  testified 
that  PFC  Manning  asked  her  to  post  the  edited  version 
on  his  Facebook  account  after  being  confined. 

The  theme  here  is  PFC  Manning's  consistent 
cavalier  attitude  towards  this  material .  Manning  knew 
the  importance  of  the  information  and  that  it  was  only 
available  on  SIPRNET. 

He  even  thought  it  was  classified.  So 
based  on  his  knowledge,   training  and  experience,  he 
knew  it  was  not  pijblicly  available . 

Ms.   Scott,   the  chief  of  FOIA  and  privacy 
section  for  U.S.   CENTCOM,    she  testified  while  the 
investigation  has  been  released  to  the  pijblic  through 
FOIA,   this  specific  video  was  not  released. 

At  every  turn.   Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning's 
handling  and  treatment  of  this  video  has  been  a

THE  JUDGE:  What? 

MR.   FEIN:     I'm  sorry.     Specification  1, 
Your  Honor,   of  charge  3. 

THE  JUDGE:  Okay. 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   you've  heard 
overwhelming  evidence  that  PFC  Manning  started  using 
his  access  to  SIPRNET  less  than  two  weeks  after 
starting  work  In  the  SCIF  at  FOB  Hammer . 

By  March  2010,    the  accused  stole  and 
transmitted  over  20,000  documents  and  watched  the 
world's  reaction  to  the  cables  released.

One  of  the  topics  the  United  States  did  not 
highlight  were  some  of  the  things  PFC  Manning  conducted 
on  SIPRNET  related  to  obfuscating  his  internet 
activity . 

Between  6  December   '09  and  8  March  2010, 
PFC  Manning  searched  19  times  on  SIPRNET  for  terms  such 
as  encryption,   and  that's  what  PFC  Manning  described  to 
Ms.  McNamara  as  encryption  that  has  gone  12  years  not 
being  broken  in  his  chats.     And  MD5,   which  is  an 
algorithm  for  hashing  files . 

Then,   on  8  March  2010  at  22:28,  so 
10:28  p.m.,   PFC  Manning  used  his  access  to  SIPRNET  to 
search  for  rainbow  tables  — 

THE  JUDGE:     What  date  was  that? 

MR.   FEIN:     Ma'am,   that's  on  8  March  2010, 
at  22:28:21  seconds.     More  importantly.   Your  Honor, 
it's  line  417  of  Prosecution  Exhibit  81.     Line  417 
Prosecution  Exhibit  81 . 

That  search  was  for  rainbow  tables .  Why 
would  PFC  Manning  be  doing  research  on  rainbow  tables .

and  gets  to  the  heart  of  Specification  1  of  charge  3 . 

We  know  that  PFC  Manning  was  obsessed  with 
covering  his  own  tracks .     We  know  this  from  his 
personal  Mac  information  erasure  on  31  January  2010 . 
He  performed  a  7— pass  erase  of  his  computer,   not  just 
one.     These  facts  join  a  host  of  others  which  evidence 
PFC  Manning's  interest  in  hiding  his  transgressions. 

He  used  other  people ' s  user  accounts  and  he 
changed  the  default  setting  on  his  dot  22  internet 
browser  to  refrain  from  capturing  internet  search 
history . 

But  at  some  point.   Your  Honor,   at  some 
point,   it  occurred  to  PFC  Manning  that  there  might  be  a 
chance  that  his  activity  was  being  captured  by  audit 
systems  on  the  SIPRNET. 

It  was  easier  to  obfuscate  what  he  was 
doing  on  his  own  machine,   but  not  as  easy  on  the 
SIPRNET.     And,   in  fact,   we  know  that  it  was  a  concern 
of  his  from  his  chats  with  Julian  Assange. 

Your  Honor,   on  page  3,   Prosecution  Exhibit

the  place,    clearing  logs,   not  logging  at  all,    safe,  I 
just  wanted  to  be  certain.     And  this  was  on  6 
March  2010,   talking  about  clearing  logs.     So,  again, 
why  search  on  Intel  link  for  something  called  rainbow 
tables  on  8  March  2010. 

PFC  Manning  SIPRNET  computers  had  a  local 
user  named  FTP  user  on  the  account.     You  heard  from 
Special  Agent  Shaver  that  the  FTP  user,   the  user  name 
was  a  user  account  on  the  D6— A  SIPKNET  computers  and 
was  not  attributable  to  any  particular  person  or  user. 

It  was  an  account  that  would  store  files 
without  any  tie  to  the  actual  user  behind  the  keyboard. 

It  was  an  account  where  one  could  store 
programs  like  Wget  within  the  profile  my  documents  and 
not  have  any  tie  to  the  ultimate  user  behind  the 
keyboard.     It's  an  account  one  could  search  the  SIPKNET 
and  get  closely  held  information  without  any  tie  to  the 
actual  user  behind  the  keyboard. 

In  short.   Your  Honor,   having  access  to  the 
FTP  user  account  could  effectively  anonymize 
PFC  Manning  behind  the  keys  of  the  dot  22  and  dot  40

SIPRNET  computers . 

Fortunately  for  the  United  States,  the 
PFC  Manning's  attempts  to  gain  access  to  the  FPT  user 
account  would  fail  despite  from  the  assistance  from 
Julian  Assange  and  WikiLeaks . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that 
Microsoft  Windows  has  multiple  ways  to  protect 
passwords . 

First,   instead  of  storing  the  actual 
password  in  plain  text,   the  actual  words  of  the 
password,   the  letters  and  nxunbers,  Windows  converts  it 
to  a  unique  hash  value  and  that ' s  called  the  LM  hash . 
LM  hash.     And  it  uses  a  complicated  mathematical 
algorithm  to  prevent  what  Special  Agent  Shaver  called 
bad  people  from  obtaining  passwords . 

Second,   Your  Honor,  Windows,  Microsoft 
Windows  splits  that  algorithm  into  two  pieces,  storing 
one  in  the  computer's  system  file  and  one  in  the 
computer's  SAM  file,    system  file  and  S2^  file. 

Finally,  Windows,   the  last  layer  of 
protection  that  Windows  provides  is  that  it  locks  down

these  two  files,   the  system  file  and  SAM  file.  It 
locks  them  down  so  no  user  except  an  administrator  can 
actually  access  the  content  of  those  files . 

Your  Honor,   no,   he  did  not  have 
administrative  privileges .     PFC  Manning  resorted  to  the 
most  effective  method  of  circumventing  the  sort  system 
on  his  SIPRNET  computer.     He  decided  to  bypass  all  of 
Microsoft  Windows,   the  entire  operating  system  of 
Windows  to  access  the  security  information  on  the 
computer . 

He  did  that  knowing  the  protection 
Microsoft  Windows  has  on  the  SAM  and  system  files. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  if  the 
user  was  to  boot  their  computer  using  a  CD  that  was 
configured  to  run  another  operating  system,   that  user 
could  navigate  to  the  SAM  file  or  system  file  on  the 
hard  drive  and  view  its  contents  because  that ' s  doing 
it  outside  of  Windows . 

One  such  operating  system  is  Linux. 
Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  a  knowledgeable 
person  could  download  a  copy  of  Linux  free  from  the

system,   a  rescue  disk  that  could  be  installed  on  a  CD 
and  that  installation  program  is  called  an  ISO.  ISO. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  an  ISO 
is  an  image.     It's  an  image  file  of  the  CD,   a  copy  of  a 
CD. 

Your  Honor,   Special  Agent  Shaver  testified 
that  PFC  Manning  downloaded  a  Linux  install,   excuse  me, 
rescue  disk  ISO  multiple  times  and  specifically  on  2 
March  2010  at  17:48:51  hours,  17:48:51. 

He  burned  that  Linux  system  operating,  that 
Linux  —  excuse  me  —  rescue  disk  operating  system  ISO 
to  a  CD  on  his  personal  map. 

Your  Honor,   note  Prosecution  Exhibit  125. 
Prosecution  Exhibit  125  is  the  disk  utility  log  for 
PFC  Manning's  personal  Mac  and  specifically  lines  365 
through  382. 

THE  JUDGE:     That  exhibit  was  what? 

MR.   FEIN:      125,    and  it's  lines  365  through 
382 .     This  disk  utility  log  from  the  personal  Mac  shows

You  recall.   Your  Honor,    that  Special  Agent 
Shaver  actually  used  the  exact  same  Linux  ISO  to  view 
the  folder  contents  that  PFC  Manning  would  have .  The 
only  way  Special  Agent  Shaver  explained  that  one  could 
potentially  obtain  access  to  the  SAM  and  system  files 
was  to  boot  the  computer  using  this  Linux  operating 
system  CD. 

Now,   Your  Honor,   you  heard  from  Mr.  Weaver, 
one  of  the  primary  authors  of  AR25— 2,   that  under  25—2 
bypassing  includes  finding  capabilities  that  elevate 
the  user ' s  privileges . 

He  explained  that  traditionally  bypassing 
means  someone  installed  or  modified  a  system  in  order 
to  gain  access  in  an  unauthorized  way,   and  this  is 
exactly  what  PFC  Manning  did  or  at  least  attempted  to 
do. 

By  equipping  himself  with  Linux,  a 
different  operating  system  and  booting  the  government 
SIPRNET  D6-A  computer  using  that  CD,    PFC  Manning 
attempted  to  bypass  and  did  actually  bypass  a  network 
security  system  in  order  to  obtain  a  security  data.

Specifically,    PFC  Manning  breached  built— in 
security  features  within  Microsoft  Windows,   the  Army's 
approved  operating  system,   on  his  D6— A  computer  that 
protected  the  FTP  user  account .     He  wanted  the  account 
log— in  credentials  to  conceal  his  identity  to  continue 
abusing  access  to  SIPRNET  and  classified  information. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that 
PFC  Manning  successfully  obtained  a  portion  of  LM  hash 
value  for  the  FTP  user  account  from  his  SIPRNET 
computer.     And  with  that  portion  of  the  LM  hash  value 
in  his  hand,   PFC  Manning  wanted  a  way  to  speed  up 
cracking  and  decrypting  the  passwords  for  the  FTP  user 
account .     So  he  turned  to  his  two  trusty  sources  for 
information,   WikiLeaks  and  Intel  link. 

Your  Honor,   you'll  see  on  page  6  of 
Prosecution  Exhibit  123,   these  are  the  Assange  chats, 
page  6.     That  on  8  March  between  15:55  and  16:11  on  8 
March  between  15:55  and  16:11  PFC  Manning  chatted  with 
Julian  Assange  and  WikiLeaks  and  provided  a  hash  value 
obtained  from  his  SIPRNET  computer  SAM  file.

a  black  bold  on  the  left  side  of  the  FTP  user . 

He  also  testified  that  he  conducted  a 
process  called  a  hex  dTimp  which  converted  the 
information  on  the  SAM  file  to  a  hash  value .     On  the

Julian  Assange,   not  even  sure  if  that's  the  hash.  I 
had  to  hex  dump  a  SAM  file  since  I  don ' t  have  the

And  Special  Agent  Shaver,   using  EnCase

PFC  Manning  Inquires  about  KN  hash  cracking.  Upon 
hearing  about  the  rainbow  table  resource    he  provides 
the  partial  hash  values,   confirming  It's  a  SAM  file

What  I  mean  by  that  Is  that  that  80C1 
nxomber  that  Is  on  the  bottom  left  was  provided  by  PFC 
Manning  In  his  chats  to  receive  assistance  by  Julian

Your  Honor,   at  16:11:26  on  8  March  2010,

testified  that  rainbow  tables  are  used,   are  tables  that 
are  used  in  order  to  find  known  hash  values  for 
passwords  if  a  known  password  in  plain  text  converts  to 
a  known  hash  value .     Fast  way  to  quickly  determine  what 
that  password  is . 

PFC  Manning  went  to  SIPRNET  in  order  to 
figure  out  if  he  could  find  a  rainbow  table  and  he 
could  not,   but  for  six  hours  after  he  chatted  with 
Julian  Assange  in  order  to  find  a  way  to  get  the  FTP 
user  account  information,   luckily  for  the  United  States 
PFC  Manning  did  not  find  what  he  was  looking  for . 

The  accused  successfully  breached  security 
protocols  and  obtained  the  portion  of  the  hash  value  in

PFC  Manning  knew  what  to  do  in  order  to 
bypass  the  computer  protocol  and  specifically,   that  is,

operating  system,   bypassed  the  security  information 
security  mechanism,   the  use  of  user  name  and  password 
to  gain  access. 

Special  Agent  Shaver,   a  normal  user,  did 
not  have  access  to  a  file .     You  could  only  gain  it  by 
booting  from  a  CD. 

Second,   by  navigating  the  SAM  file  and 
obtaining  part  of  the  hash  value  of  the  password  to  the 
FTP  user  account,   PFC  Manning  attempted  to  bypass  the 
security  mechanism  in  place. 

Using  Julian  Assange  and  WikiLeaks, 
PFC  Manning  tried  to  figure  out  the  password  to  another 
local  user  on  his  SIPRNET  computer,   one  he  did  not 
normally  have  access  to  in  the  course  of  his  work,  so 
he  could  hide  in  plain  sight  and  not  operate  under  the 
potential  fear  of  being  caught . 

Your  Honor,   I  don't  know  if  now  is  a  good 
time  to  take  a  recess  or  I  can  keep  going. 

THE  JUDGE:      It  probably  is.      15  minutes. 

MR.  FEIN:     Yes,  ma'am.

(Court  in  recess.) 

THE  COURT:     Court  is  called  to  order.  Let 
the  record  reflect  all  parties  present  when  the  court 
last  recessed  are  again  present  in  THE  court. 

Major  Fein? 

MR.  FEIN:     Your  Honor,  the  next  dataset  are 
the  GTMO  documents.   Specification  9. 

Your  Honor,   the  next  set  are  the  GTMO 
documents  that  serve  as  a  basis  for  Specification  8  and 
9  in  Charge  2  and  also.   Your  Honor,   Specification  2  of 
Charge  3.     Detainee  Assessments  Briefs,   or  DABs. 

(Inaudible)   PFC  Manning  researched  GTMO 
information  repeatedly  on  Intelink.     He  found  the  DABs 
in  classified  network  and  reviewed  them. 

He  then  discussed  their  contents  with 
Julian  Assange  before  exporting  all  the  records  in  the 
database  by  using  Wget,   unauthorized  program. 

Even  after  PFC  Manning  stole  them  he 
couldn ' t  stop  talking  about  them  with  Adrian  Lamo .  It 
shows  that  he  was  looking  to  get  the  information

published  with  WlklLeaks  from  the  beginning  of  his 
deployment . 

He  was  looking  for  politically  notable 
Information  that  would  garner  as  much  attention  as 
Reykjavik  13  did  In  February  2010. 

Using  the  tools  provided  by  him  In  the 
United  States  to  analyze  Intelligence,   PFC  Manning 
searched  for  Information  that  compromised  to  WlklLeaks 
when  he  found  the  GTMO  DABs,   detainee  assessment 
briefs . 

Your  Honor,  what  are  DABs?     DABs  are  a 
recommendation  to  the  US  SOUTHCOM  commander  for  the 
disposition  of  detainees,  which  Included  the  detainee's 
threat  level  and  Intelligence  value  to  the  United 
States . 

The  DABs  contain  classified  Information 
pertaining  to  United  States  Intelligence  regarding 
terrorists  and  their  organizations  and  classified 
Information  about  terrorist  training,    TTPs,  and 
Intelligence  analysts  of  terrorist  organizations .

demonst.rat.e  the  US  intelligence  gaps  with  terrorists 
and  terrorist  organizations  and  the  extent  of 
cooperation  with  the  United  States . 

Rear  Admiral  David  Woods  testified  as  the 
OCA  for  the  DABs  that  compromising  the  DABs  could  cause 
serious  damage  to  National  Security  and  thus  they  are 
classified  at  the  secret  level . 

THE  COURT:     Who  was  the  person? 

MR.   FEIN:     Rear  Admiral  David  Woods,  the 
previous  demander  of  JTF  GTMO. 

The  DABs  are  housed  in  three  locations,  all 
of  which  are  classified. 

Mr.  Moats,   Your  Honor,  he  testified  as  a 
head  of  the  DAB  branch  that  the  DABs  are  stored  locally 
on  the  GTMO  share  drive  on  SIPRNET,   on  the  JDIMS-I,  a 
unique  system  for  the  JTF  GTMO,   and  also  on  SIPRNET  on 
Intellipedia . 

Mr.  Moats  testified  that  the  DABs  are 
stored  by  document  ID  niomber  and  a  user  can  see  the 
document  ID  niomber  by  scrolling  over  the  link  for  each 
DAB  on  Intellipedia  web  page .

Your  Honor,    on  8  December  2009  PFC  Manning 
first  accessed  the  DAB  website . 

On  5  March  — 

THE  COURT:     What  was  the  date? 
MR.   FEIN:     8  December,  2009. 

Your  Honor,   5  March  2010,   the  Intelink  logs 
show  that  he  attempted  to  download  the  entire  database 
but  could  not  complete  that  download.  Prosecution 
Exhibit  82  shows  PFC  Manning's  manual  attempts  to 
collect  the  DABs . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  PFC 
Manning  started  downloading  DABs  using  the  right  click 
save  method,   as  an  ordinary  user  would  on  5  March  2010. 
And  Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  the  right  click 
method  was  slow  and  wrought  with  errors . 

THE  COURT:     Exhibit  82? 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit 
82  is  an  extract  of  the  Intelink  log  activity  for  5 
March  2010,   Your  Honor,    line  4  of  Prosecution  Exhibit

Why  is  this  important.   Your  Honor? 

Because  the  STunmary  shows  that  PFC  Manning 
failed  in  this  attempt  because  on  the  Intelink  log  data 
there's  a  000  code  at  the  end  of  the  actual  web 
address,   000  code.     Again  Prosecution  Exhibit  82. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  the  000 
code  signified  that  the  download  did  not  go  through. 
It  was  not  complete . 

A  minute  later  PFC  Manning  successfully 
downloaded  the  same  data.     Special  Agent  Shaver  also 
explained  in  a  attempt  that  was  successful  a  download 
was  successful  if  the  code  200  showed  up  next  to  the 
web  address.     So  000  failure;   200  complete. 

On  just  the  first  page  of  Prosecution 
Exhibit  82  there  are  23  attempts  to  download  DABs,  12 
attempts  were  not  successful  with  000  code. 

In  order  to  get  11  successful  downloads  PFC 
Manning  spent  approximately  7  minutes  according  to  the 
Prosecution  Exhibit  82,   Your  Honor,    in  order  to 
increase  the   (inaudible) ,   PFC  Manning  turned  to  an 
unauthorized  program,   Wget .

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that 
Prosecution  Exhibit  157  shows  PFC  Manning  searching  for 
information  on  how  to  make  Wget  run  faster  and  that  was 
on  7  March  2010. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  PFC 
Manning  began  running  Wget  from  dot  22  computer  system 
on  7  March  2010  the  first  time  and  PFC  Manning 
introduced  that  software  onto  his  classified  computer 
in  order  to  do  that . 

Your  Honor,   the  unit  AUP,   authorized  user 
for  which  Captain  Tripp   (inaudible)   will  remember 
testified  prohibited  soldiers  from  executable  code 
which  specifically  includes  dot  EXE  files  to  a  DoD 
computer . 

And  you'll  remember  from  the  testimony 
Special  Agent  Shaver,   Your  Honor,   dot  EXE  files  are 
executable  files . 

Programs  downloading  the  unauthorized  Wget 
EXE  file  violated  AR25-2  paragraph  4-582  as  detailed  in 
Specification  2  of  Charge  3 .

Manning,    after  downloading  Wget  dot  EXE,   had  to  program 
Wget,  how  to  operate  Wget,   did  not  have  a  graphical 
user  Interface  or  GUI,   therefore  It  was  not  as  simple 
as  doioble  clicking  an  Icon  of  an  Installed  program  on 
the  D6— A  computer  and  running  It . 

Your  Honor,   explained  here  Is  Prosecution 
Exhibit  189,  page  1.     This  Is  the  help  file  Special 
Agent  Shaver  testified  he  extracted  from  PFC  Manning's 
computer.     When  I  type  In  Wget— H,   this  help  file 
displays  In  an  MS  dot  prompt.     Because  Wget  Is  a 
command  line  tool.   It  has  many  options  as  displayed  on 
page  1  here . 

PFC  Manning  had  to  research  how  to  program 
Wget  and  how  to  program  It  In  order  to  harvest  the 
entirety  of  US  SOUTHCOM  database  of  DABs .     PFC  Manning 
used  the  document  ID  number,  the  unique  database 
Identifier  In  Wget  to  extract  those  DABs. 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  was  able  to 
download  the  database  In  less  than  four  hours  once  he 
was  able  to  get  Wget  running,  whereas  his  manual 
attempt  on  5  March  had  been  plagued  with  errors .  PFC

Manning's  success  rate  with  Wget.  on  7  March  was  much 
better . 

Mr.   Johnson  testified  that  while  PFC 
Manning  was  harvesting  those  DABs,   he  also  was  talking 
to  Julian  Assange  through  his  chats  and  he  recorded 
that  information . 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  and  Julian  Assange 
discussed  the  value  of  the  DABs,  the  types  of 
information  in  the  DABs,    and  the  status  of  the  uploads. 

That  is  in  the  Assange  chats  pages  3 
through  5 .     Pages  3  through  5 . 

Two  months  after  stealing  the  DABs,  PFC 
Manning  bragged,   telling  Mr.   Lamo  that,   oh,   the  JTF 
GTMO  papers  Assange  has  those,   too.     PFC  Manning  went 
so  far  as  to  characterize  the  DABs  as  a  highlight  on 
the  information  he  stole . 

On  25  April  2011,   WikiLeaks  released 
purported  DABs  on  their  website .     Prosecution  Exhibit 
95  are  the  charged  DABs  in  this  case . 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  95  showed 
that  the  DABs  are  marked  secret  on  the  top  and  bottom

of  each  page.     WikiLeaks  published  the  DABs  because 
they  had  not  been  piiblicly  released  at  that  point  and 
the  information  in  the  DABs  was  not  available  anywhere 
else . 

The  evidence  from  all  the  witnesses 
indicated  that  the  documents  were  closely-held. 

As  a  defense's  witness  Colonel  Retired 
Davis  testified  Defense  Exhibit  Victor,   which  is  a  DAB, 
was  not  necessarily  useful  to  a  prosecutor  who  needed 
the  underlying  evidence  but  Defense  Exhibit  Victor  was 
an  executive  sxommary  of  that  evidence  and  the 
intelligence  reporting  contained  little  public 
information . 

When  PFC  Manning  extracted  the  DABs  to  his 
personal  computer,  he  completed  the   (inaudible)  of 
those  records .     The  DABs  that  were  stored  on  the 
classified  system  with  only  authorized  personnel  with  a 
need— to— know  could  access  them.     At  no  time.  Your 
Honor,   was  PFC  Manning  authorized  to  house  those 
records  on  his  personal  laptop.

converted  the  information  in  the  DABs  when  he  conveyed 
them  to  WikiLeaks  for  pijblication . 

PFC  Manning  specifically  intended  for  the 
DABs  to  be  published  and  WikiLeaks  obliged. 

The  United  States  devoted  significant 
resources  to  protect  the  classified  information  in  DABs 
from  actual  compromise. 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  foreign 
intelligence  services  will  pay  for  the  information 
precisely  because  its  exclusive  possession  provides  a 
significant  benefit  to  the  United  States. 

The  pioblication  of  the  DABs  completely 
deprived  the  United  States  of  the  exclusive  possession 
of  the  use  of  that  information,   exclusive  use. 

Accordingly,   Your  Honor,   by  causing  the 
DABs  to  be  published,   PFC  Manning  substantially 
interfered  with  the  United  States '   ownership  rights  in 
those  records . 

Using  Wget  he  scraped  an  entire  classified 
website .     PFC  Manning  then  placed  the  exported 
classified  records  on  his  personal  computer.  After

transferring  the  records  to  the  personal  computer  he 
talked  about  GTMO  records  with  Julian  Assange,   as  I 
described  before,   as  he  delivered  them  to  their  web 
sites  online  siobmlsslon  program. 

Your  Honor,  In  the  end,  PFC  Manning  felt 
the  GTMO  documents  were  the  highlight  and  were  among 
many  records  he  admitted  to  stealing. 

Mr.  Moats  testified  that  each  DAB,   as  the 
chief  of  the  DAB  branch,   was  the  product  of  80  to  90 
hours  of  work  by  Intelligence  professionals,   each  DAB, 
Your  Honor.     And  Mr.  Moats  testified  that  the  lowest 
ranking  person  that  worked  on  the  DAB  creation  had  the 
grade  of  E4 .     A  specialist  of  the  United  States  Army  In 
2005,   a  specialist  or  E4,   earned  $1,500  approximately 
per  month  In  base  salary. 

Assuming  40  hours  per  week,   that  works  out 
to  an  hourly  wage  of  about  $9,   Your  Honor. 

PFC  Manning  stole  over  700  detainee 
assessments.     Mr.  Moats  testified  that  each  DAB  took 
approximately  80  hours  of  work,   thus  56,000  hours  were 
spent  creating  those  DABs .     Therefore,  the  cost  to

based  off  56,000  hours  at  the  lowest  grade  of  a 
producer  of  the  DABs  at  $9.39  per  hour. 

Your  Honor,   additionally,   DABs  are  valuable 
to  foreign  intelligence  services . 

Your  Honor,   at  this  time  United  States 
requests  that  the  accused  and  Major  Hurley  relocate  to 
the  witness  box  and  I  will  hand  Appellate  Exhibit  617 
to  the  Court  and  the  Defense . 

Your  Honor,  Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  the 
foreign  intelligence  services  in  multiple  countries 
actively  seek  information  contained  in  DABs  and  would 
pay  for  DABs  for  the  US  SOUTHCOM  database. 

The  foreign  intelligence  services  seek 
information  pertaining  to  GTMO  count ert err or ism  efforts 
as  detailed  in  Classified  Reason  Number  7 . 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  country  4  would 
pay  over  $7,000  for  the  records  in  the  US  SOUTHCOM 
database  and  Mr.   Lewis  called  the  valuation 
conservative  as  set  forth  in  Classified  Reason  Niomber

As  a  reminder.   Your  Honor,   the  Index  dot 
dat  file  is  a  file  that  captures  the  internet  history 
of  files  moving  between  web  pages  and  on  the  computer. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  he 
could  tell  that  the  memoranda  were  on  the  machine  by 
looking  at  an  excerpt  of  the  index  dot  dat  file  which 
is  a  file  used,   as  I  just  mentioned,  to  record  the  web 
sites  and  files  accessed  in  Microsoft  Internet 
Explorer . 

According  to  Prosecution  Exhibit  154,  PFC 
Manning  downloaded  the  first  memorandum  on  17 
March  2010.     He  saved  the  first  memorandum  and  the 
second  memorandum  to  his  desktop  in  the  Bradley  dot 
Manning  profile  in  his  My  Documents  folder  on  the  dot 
22  computer  and  that  was  on  21  March  2010. 

Both  documents  that  he  download  were  PDF 
file  names  very  similar  to  the  names  of  the  memorandum. 
All  this  is  reflected  in  Prosecution  Exhibit  154 . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  most 
memorandiim  were  moved  to  the  folder  named  Blah, 
B— L— A— H,   on  22  March  2010.     Both  memorandum  were  moved

folder  itself  —  was  —  the  name  was  "Interesting"  on 
that  same  day.  Your  Honor. 

About  30  seconds  later.   Blah  dot  zip  file

named  Blah  dot  zip  was  placed  on  the  accused's  personal

contained  national  defense  information  as  articulated 
in  Prosecution  Exhibit  180  Alpha  and  181  Alpha. 
Paragraphs  12  through  18. 

Specifically  they  both  contained

memoranda.   Your  Honor,   reasonably  could  be  expected  to 
harm  or  cause  serious  harm  to  the  national  defense  and 
foreign  relations  of  the  United  States . 

Prosecution  Exhibits  180  and  181  Alpha  also 
explained  how  the  Information  contained  In  the 
memoranda  would  be  useful  to  the  enemy  If  released  and 
show  that  the  Information  In  the  memoranda  Is  true,  at 
least  In  part . 

The  dates  the  memoranda  were  posted  on

Prosecution  Exhibit  180  paragraphs  15  and  20. 

These  paragraphs  also  state  that  these 
memoranda  were  never  otherwise  released  outside  the 
classified  United  States  Government  official  channels. 

According  to  Prosecution  Exhibit  141,  the 
open  source  logs  for  bradass87  between  9  April  2010  and 
13  April  12010,   PFC  Manning  looked  at  several  docioments

PFC  Manning  searched  for  the  Inf orniat.lon  on 
the  SIPRNET  computer.     He  saved  it  on  his  dot  22 
computer.     He  moved  it  to  his  personal  Macintosh 
computer  and  then  the  memoranda  were  posted  on 
WikiLeaks . 

Later,   PFC  Manning  accessed  the  information 
to  read  about  the  fallout . 

The  evidence  shows  that  the  accused  had 
reason  to  believe  that  the  information  could  be  used  to 
injure  the  United  States  to  the  advantage  of  a  foreign 
nation . 

Your  Honor,  the  next  dataset  is  the 
Net— Centric  Diplomacy  database  and  the  cables  contained 
within.     This  goes  to  Specifications  12  and  13  of 
Charge  2  and  also  Specification  2  of  Charge  3 . 

The  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  database  contain 
decades  of  classified  closely-held  United  States  cables 
related  to  foreign  policy,   including  sources  of 
intelligence.    Your  Honor.

sijbject  matter  at  the  time  and  focus  on  Iceland. 

PFC  Manning  was  correct .  After  PFC  Manning 
stole  the  cable  and  WikiLeaks  pioblished  it,  PFC  Manning 
claimed  that  the  affect  was  a  recall  of  an  ambassador. 

Having  seen  the  result  of  his  actions,  PFC 
Manning  saw  an  opportunity  for  more  notoriety. 

Thereafter,   PFC  Manning  set  about  to 
compromise  the  entire  NCD  database.   Net— Centric 
Diplomacy  database. 

Instead  of  helping  his  unit,   PFC  Manning 
took  the  opportunity  to  harvest  over  250,000  Department 
of  State  cables  for  release  on  WikiLeaks  and  to  the 
world. 

Ms.   Tann  testified  that  a  cable  is  an 
official  message  of  the  Department  of  State  and  cables 
can  be  sent  between  posts  and  the  Department  of  State 
headquarters  in  DC. 

Ms.   Tann  testified  each  cable  contained  a 
message  resource  number,   which  is  a  unique  identifier.

States  foreign  policy. 

Accordingly,   cables  are  often  classified 
and  contain  sensitive  information  and  information  that 
must  be  closely  guarded  to  enable  the  United  States  to 
conduct  its  foreign  policy  effectively. 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibits  169 
Charlie  through  177  Charlie,   these  are  the  Charlie 
STibexhibits  for  169  through  177,   these  are  the  charged 
cables,   are  examples  of  compromised  cables  as  they 
appear  on  the  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  database.  Each 
cable  and  NCD  contained  a  warning  banner  describing  the 
limited  extent  of  the  user's  authorization  to  view  each 
cable . 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibits  169 
through  178,   the  Alpha  series  of  all  of  those,  169 
through  178,   Department  of  State  officials  described 
the  contents  of  the  stolen  cables .     The  cables

with  sources,    human  rights  actlvls'ts  and  others  at  risk 
of  incarceration,   torture,   or  death  in  the  country  of 
origin . 

The  cables  also  reveal  sensitive 
information  regarding  foreign  relations,  intelligence 
sources  and  methods,   diplomatic  relations  and  foreign 
policy. 

Special  Agent  Bettencourt  testified  that 
the  purported  cables  posted  on  WikiLeaks . org  span 
decades  with  dates  from  1966  up  until  2010. 

And  Mr.  Murphy  testified  that  the  charged 
cables,   that's  again  Prosecution  Exhibit  169  through 
177  and  it's  the  Charlie  series,   contained  information 
that  if  compromised  could  cause  harm  or  serious  harm  to 
the  National  Security.     He  was  a  duly  appointed  OCA  who 
testified  that  the  cables  were  either  secret  or 
confidential . 

Your  Honor,   why  did  the  Department  of  State 
create  NCD?     Ensuring  the  information  and  intelligence 
in  cables  took  on  increased  importance  after 
September  11 .

Mr.   Weiss  Carter,    he  testified  that  acting 
on  the  need  for  intelligence  sharing  the  Department  of 
Defense  providing  Department  of  State  funding  to  make 
it  necessary  the  information  available  on  SIPRNET . 

As  a  result  of  that  funding,  NCD  was 
created  to  share  information  to  all  users  on  SIPRNET. 

Mr.  Weiss  testified  that  NCD  was  a  system 
that  was  specifically  designed  to  provide  the 
Department  of  State  in  the  SIPRNET  community  with 
access  to  diplomatic  reporting  to  ensure  there  was 
information  sharing  across  the  Government  at  all  levels 
from  priorities  to  generalities. 

Thus,  Mr.  Weiss  testified  that  NCD  resided 
only  on  SIPRNET  and  J  links . 

Captain  Lim  testified  that  he  sent  an 
e-mail  telling  his  soldiers  that  NCD  could  be  used  to 
accomplish  the  mission  in  the  S2  shop. 

Captain  Lim  testified  the  210  mission  was 
to  train,   mentor,   advise  and  assist  Iraqi  security 
forces  in  Southeast  Baghdad. 

Captain  Lim  testified  that  NCD  was  useful

for  that,  mission  In  Southeast.  Baghdad  but  not  for 
Iceland;^  Information  pertaining  to  Iceland,  South 
America,  Asia  or  the  rest  of  the  globe. 

Mr.  Madaras  testified  that  he  never  used 
NCD  as  a  35  fox  because  his  focus  was  on  the  210  area 
of  responsibility  and  that  was  In  Baghdad. 

PFC  Manning's  focus  should  have  been  on  the 
same  areas  of  operation  as  a  shared  analyst . 

Your  Honor,   Instead  was  using  NCD  to 
accomplish  his  mission  and  support  his  fellow  soldiers 
as  an  all— source  Intelligence  analyst,  PFC  Manning 
chose  to  harvest  decades  worth  of  SIP  disk,  SIPR 
distribution  cables,  to  gain  his  notoriety. 

In  his  chats  with  Mr.   Lama,    PFC  Manning 
thought  he  was  smart  enough  to  know  what ' s  going  on  In 
the  world . 

The  day  after  returning  from  R  and  R  leave 
and  on  15  February  2010  that's  when  he  compromised 
Reykjavik  13  and  having  observed  the  results  of 
stealing  and  disseminating  that  Information,  PFC 
Manning  went  to  work  on  reaping  more  cables .

From  late  February  to  early  March  2010  PFC 
Manning  worked  on  engineering  a  method  to  steal  the 
entirety  of  the  NCD  database. 

Your  Honor,   note  that  Mr.   Carter  testified 
that  a  user  of  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  can  only  access 
cables  through  the  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  database  web 
page  Interface  on  the  Department  of  State  web  page. 

Mr.  Weiss  also  testified  that  access  to 
cables  on  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  was  limited  because  NCD 
allows  a  user  to  view  through  a  web  browser  or  print  a 
single  cable,   save  a  single  cable  at  a  time. 

When  asked  why  there ' s  no  technical 
restrictions  put  In  place  on  NCD  outside  of  the  web 
browser  requirement,   Mr.  Weiss  answered  that  It  would 
Inhibit  sharing  of  Information,  be  administratively 
difficult  to  manage.   If  not  Impossible. 

Captain  Llm  also  testified  that  an  NCD  user 
can  access  NCD  through  a  website,   a  user  searched  for 
cables  using  key  words  on  the  NCD  web  page . 

He  testified  It  did  not  have  an  export 
function  similar  to  what  CIDNE  had,   click  a  button  and

export  30  days  at  a  time.     And  he  did  not  save  cables. 
He  only  read  them  for  information  related  to  his 
mission . 

Your  Honor,   Special  Agent  Shaver  testified 
that  NCD  was  accessible  only  through  a  web  page  and  the 
only  way  to  access  a  cable  was  to  type  in  the 
information  in  the  search  bar,   click  search,   wait  for 
your  return  to  come  up  on  the  web  page  then  click  the 
specific  cable  in  your  web  browser  and  once  the  cable 
comes  back  it  views  in  the  web  browser  and  at  that 
point  you  can  save  or  print . 

Essentially  you're  pointing  and  clicking. 

Mr.  Weiss  also  testified  NCD  did  not  allow 
for  batch  downloading.     Using  NCD  as  a  normal  user,  PFC 
Manning  never  could  have  accessed  let  alone  downloaded 
over  250,000  cables. 

As  Captain  Lim  and  Special  Agent  Shaver 
testified,  NCD  only  allowed  a  user  to  view  one  cable  at 
a  time  using  a  web  browser  to  view  a  web  page.  This 
was  a  system  limitation  that  PFC  Manning  understood  and 
had  to  bypass  to  accomplish  his  own  personal  task.

PFC  Manning  knew  he  could  not.  physically 
download  over  a  quarter  million  cables  manually  with 
NCD's  organic  functionality  typing  In  251,000  cables 
Into  a  search  bar,   clicking  on  each  Individual  one  and 
right  clicking  to  save  or  print . 

So  he  turned  to  what  he  knew  best  from  his 
experience  with  the  GTMO  DABs,   Wget . 

And,   Your  Honor,   turning  to  Wget  PFC 
Manning  exercised  a  self— help  remedy  In  order  to 
prepare  a  method  for  his  compromise,   or  his 
exflltratlon  as  PFC  Manning  had  actually  called  It  In 
his  personal  tasking  order  for  the  GAP .     His  personal 
tasking  order  for  Department  of  State  Information  to 
create,   as  he  said  to  Adrian  Lamo,   worldwide  anarchy. 

Your  Honor,   that's  Prosecution  Exhibit  30. 
The  Lamo  chat,  page  9,  his  goal  to  create  worldwide 
anarchy . 

PFC  Manning  began  by  searching  for  Wget, 
again,   prosecution  Exhibit  157  shows  that  PFC  Manning 
searched  for  Wget  on  his  NIPRNET  computer  and  Special

on  7  March  2010  was  a  search  to  figure  out.  how  to  make 
Wget  run  faster . 

On  both  7  March  2010  and  27  March  2010  PFC 
Manning  used  Google  to  search  for  the  executable  file 
Wget. 

Then,  Your  Honor,   as  shown  on  Prosecution 
Exhibit  157,   PFC  Manning  downloaded  Wget  onto  his 
NIPRNET  computer . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  Wget 
was  In  PFC  Manning's  users  account  In  March  of  2010  and 
Introduced  again  In  May  of  2010. 

Your  Honor,   Special  Agent  Shaver  testified 
about  Wget .     Wget  was  an  executable  file  that  had  been 
copied  and  placed  In  the  My  Docioments  folder  on  PFC 
Manning ' s  dot  22  SIPRNET  computer . 

We  know  Wget  was  run  from  PFC  Manning's 
computer  because  of  the  PreFetch  files,   the  Microsoft 
Window  files  that  save,   say,   a  slice  of  the  program 
from  memory  when  It  runs  and  that  slice  Includes  the 
exact  location  on  the  hard  drive  or,   as  Special  Agent

drive  for  which  that  file  ran. 

And  each  time  a  different  version  or  each 
time  Wget  is  run  from  a  different  location,   a  different 
PreFetch  file  is  created. 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  188,  188 
shows  the  PreFetch  files  for  Wget  and  all  of  the 
locations  on  PFC  Manning ' s  computer  that  he  ran  Wget . 

Your  Honor ,   it ' s  clear  that  Wget  was  not 
run  by  PFC  Manning  from  a  disk .      So  why  did  PFC  Manning 
have  to  copy  Wget  to  his  computer  and  run  it  to  obtain 
the  state  cables? 

This  is  very  simple.   Your  Honor. 

The  Net— Centric  Diplomacy  database  was  only 
accessible  by  using  a  web  browser,   opening  the  web 
page,   typing  in  the  search  term  and  clicking  the  search 
results . 

Then  the  user  had  to  navigate  to  the  web

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  knew  that.     And  he 
knew  the  process.     That  process,   the  NCD  in  a  D6— A 
computer  required  was  not  fast  enough  or  efficient 
enough  to  afford  him  the  option  to  harvest  over  250,000 
cables  in  such  a  short  period  of  time. 

In  fact,  Mr.  Weiss  testified,   as  I 
mentioned  earlier,  that  NCD  database  did  not  have  a 
function  that  allowed  for  mass  downloading.     So  PFC 
Manning  did,   as  I  said  before  what  he  did  best,   he  used 
Wget  to  bypass  the  NCD  web  page  and  go  directly  to  the 
web  server  to  scrape  all  the  Department  of  State  cables 
directly  from  the  web  server. 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  187  was  the 
demonstrative  aid  that  Special  Agent  Shaver  testified 
about  how  PFC  Manning  used  Wget . 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  PFC 
Manning  used  Wget  on  his  computer,   the  bottom  left,  and 
rather  than  going  straight  up  to  the  web  page  click 
search,   wait  for  the  results  to  come  up  and  then  save, 
he  went  directly  using  Wget  onto  the  web  server  and  was 
able  to  mass  download  all  of  the  Department  of  State

cables  from  that  database . 

What  that  allowed.  Your  Honor,  PFC  Manning 
to  do  was  to  clrcximvent,  to  bypass  the  exact  mechanism 
and  place  on  this  computer  system  the  restrictions  put 
In  place  of  using  a  web  browser  In  order  to  view  these 
documents  and  In  order  to  go  grab  them  and  bring  them 
down  to  his  computer. 

In  order  to  accomplish  this  complex  task  of 
running  Wget,  PFC  Manning  had  to  take  specific  steps  to 
prepare . 

First,   get  and  copy  and  paste  the  list  of 
the  MKNs,   the  unique  Identifiers  from  the  database  from 
the  web  page  to  Itself.     So  he  had  to  query,   as  Special 
Agent  Shaver  testified,   the  newest  cables  published, 
copy  all  the  MRNs,   copy,  paste  and  then  pasted  them 
Into  Excel . 

Second,   PFC  Manning  used  Microsoft  Excel  to 
automatically  link  together  In  a  chain  the  MRNs  that  he 
pasted  Into  a  Wget  command  line  that  he  used  the  Wget 
help  file  to  figure  out . 

Actually,   Special  Agent  Shaver  used  the

term  catenate  organic  function  that  PFC  Manning  had  to 
program  In  order  to  make  this  process  to  occur  quickly 
and  ultimately  for  251,000  plus  cables. 

Finally,   PFC  Manning  copied  and  pasted 
those  lines  from  the  Excel  spreadsheet  with  the  Wget 
commands  Into  what  Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  were 
batch  files.     A  batch  file  allows  you  to  run  a 
executable  program  rapidly  over  and  over  again. 

And  Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  about 
the  different  batch  file  extracts  he  found  on  the  dot 
22  computer. 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  used  Wget  to  create 
a  functionality  that  did  not  exist . 

Whereas  Mr.  Weiss  testified  the  user 
accessed  a  single  cable  using  a  web  browser,  PFC 
Manning  accessed  over  a  quarter  million  cables  by 
Introducing  Wget . 

He  harvested  those  cables  using  Wget  In  Its 
command  prompt  without  any  action  In  the  NCD  graphical 
user  Interface .

the  staggering  niomber  of  connections  to  the  Department 
of  State  cables  servers  and  the  firewall  logs . 

Prosecution  Exhibit  159  shows  that  PFC 
Manning ' s  computer  connected  to  the  Department  of  State 
cables  firewall  more  than  700,000  times  between  28 
March  and  9  April;    700,000  times  between  28  March  and  9 
April . 

PFC  Manning  spent  all  of  his  working  hours 
over  10  days  harvesting  cables  for  the  transmission  to 
WikiLeaks . 

Prosecution  Exhibit  159  also  shows  that  his 
computer  connected  to  the  same  firewall  over  53,000 
times  on  3  May  2010  that's  when  PFC  Manning  went  back 
to  the  NCD  to  harvest  cables  from  March  22  onward. 

Mr.   John  testified  that  PFC  Manning's 
personal  computer  possessed  a  script,   a  program  that 
could  convert  information  from  a  cable  into  what ' s 
called  Base64  format. 

Your  Honor,   Base64  is  an  encoding  layer

Undeterred  by  system  restrictions  and 
limitation,   PFC  Manning  had  harvested  as  much 
information  as  possible  in  the  shortest  amount  of  time 
and  thus  he  had  to  reintroduce  Wget  onto  his  computer 
at  this  time. 

So  at  the  end  of  his  nearly  two— week 
mission  in  March  and  April  2010,  PFC  Manning  had 
harvested  more  than  250,000  cables. 

The  evidence  showed  that  he  harvested  those 
cables  and  packaged  them  and  compressed  them  into 
Base64  for  transmission  to  WikiLeaks . 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  102  is  a

MR.   FEIN:     3  May  2010,   Your  Honor. 

And  that  was  in  the  bloop  folder  in  PFC 
Manning '  s  My  DocTunents  . 

Prosecution  Exhibit  104  also  showed  that

MR.   FEIN:      251,287,   Your  Honor. 
THE  COURT:  Okay. 

MR.   FEIN:     And,   Your  Honor,   if  you 
recollect,   the  backup  xlsx  file  started  with  the  number 
251,288. 

While  WikiLeaks  published  the  251,287 
purported  cables  that  were  dated  through  February  2010, 
the  purported  cables  WikiLeaks  released  did  not  include 
March,   April  and  May  2010. 

PFC  Manning  had  the  cables  from  March 
through  May  2010  ready  to  go  with  his  starting  nxunber 
and  that  backup  dot  xlsx  file  of  251,288.     And  those 
were  the  cables.   Your  Honor,   located  in  the  files  dot 
zip  file  that  Special  Agent  Shaver  testified. 

This  number  of  course,   251,288,   is  the  next 
nxunber  in  line  after  251,287.     That  is  —  so 
ultimately.   Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning,   PFC  Manning 
reintroduced  Wget  to  go  back  and  harvest  the  remaining 
cables  starting  with  251,288  because  he  had  already 
compromised  to  WikiLeaks  251,287  purported  cables  that 
they  released  unredacted.

His  determlna'tlon  and  persistence  had  not. 
ceased.     He  wanted  more  to  Increase  the  effect  in  his 
future  right  at  this  time.     When  extracted  the  records 
from  NCD  to  his  personal  computer,   PFC  Manning 
completed  the  theft  of  those  records . 

The  NCD  records  were  stored  on  a  classified 
system  where  only  authorized  personnel  with 
need— to— know  could  access  them.     At  no  time  was  PFC 
Manning  authorized  to  house  those  records  on  his 
personal  computer . 

Furthermore,   PFC  Manning  converted  the 
information  in  the  cables  from  NCD  when  he  conveyed 
them  to  the  WikiLeaks  for  release . 

PFC  Manning  specifically  intended  for  the 
cables  to  be  pijblished  and  WikiLeaks  obliged.  The 
United  States  devoted  significant  resources  to  protect 
the  classified  information  within  NCD. 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  foreign 
intelligence  services  will  pay  for  information 
precisely  because  its  exclusive  possession  provides 
significant  benefit  to  the  United  States .

By  causing  the  cables  to  be  published,  PFC 
Manning  substantially  interfered  with  the  United 
States '   ownership  rights  of  exclusive  possession  of 
that  classified  information  in  the  records . 

Your  Honor,   the  United  States  requests  that 
the  accused  and  Major  Hurley  relocate  to  the  witness 
stand  and  I  will  hand  Appellate  Exhibit  617  to  both  the 
Defense  and  the  Court . 

Your  Honor,  Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  the 
foreign  intelligence  services  of  multiple  countries 
actively  seek  information  contained  in  the  Net— Centric 
Diplomacy  records  and  would  pay  for  records  from  the 
Net  Centric  Diplomacy  Database . 

The  foreign  intelligence  services  seek 
information  pertaining  to  United  States  strategic  plans 
and  specific  geographic  areas  as  detailed  in  Classified 
Reason  Niomber  5 . 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  country  3  would 
pay  well  over  $1,000  for  the  records  in  the  Net— Centric 
Diplomasy  database  as  set  forth  in  Classified  Reason 
Niunber  6 .

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  he  conducted  a 
search  of  the  Net-Centric  Diplomacy  data  by  using 
specific  groups  of  key  words.     Based  on  his  search  he 
received  900  responsive  hits.     The  hits  constituted  900 
separate  documents  or  cables . 

Mr.  Lewis  testified  that  country  3  would 
pay  over  $2,000  per  document  related  to  the  searched 
key  words . 

Therefore,   Your  Honor,   according  to 
Mr.   Lewis,   the  Net— Centric  Diplomasy  database  is  worth 
over  $1.8  million  to  foreign  intelligence  services.

Wget  on  a  Government  computer. 

Chief  Ehresman  testified  that  soldiers

Mr.  Mllllman  for  approval. 

Mr.  Mllllman,   a  D6— A  contractor,  testified 
that  he  told  the  entire  unit  during  a  shift  change 
brief  In  the  first  month  of  deployment  that  he  owned 
the  computers  and  was  the  proper  authority. 

Your  Honor,   the  first  month  of  deployment 
for  PFC  Manning  would  have  ended,   the  first  full  month 
would  have  ended  at  the  end  of  November,   Your  Honor, 
well  before  March  2010. 

Ms.  Florlnda  White  testified  that  Wget  was 
not  authorized  for  D6— A  computers . 

Mr.  Kits  also  authorized  —  testified  that 
Wget  was  not  authorized. 

PFC  Manning  Introduced  the  Wget  program 
without  requesting  authorization. 

Wget  was  unlike  any  other  program  that  was 
openly  used  by  soldiers  In  the  SCIF .     No  one  else  even 
knew  what  It  was  or  what  It  was  capable  of  doing  that

So  when  does  the  Army  allow  Wget.  on  Its 
networks.   Your  Honor? 

Well,   Chief  Royer  testified,   I'm  sorry. 
Your  Honor,   to  correct  what  I  just  said,   no  one  from 
210  Mountain  that  was  deployed  in  Iraq  at  the  time  had 
ever  heard  of  Wget  including.   Captain  Cherepko  and 
Mr.  Milliman  when  they  were  deployed. 

You  did  hear.   Your  Honor,   from  Chief  Royer 
who  testified  that  Wget  is  used  in  his  op  4  capacity 
for  attacking  Army  networks .     He  uses  Army  Wget  to 
attack  Army  networks .     And  that ' s  only  in  circxunstances 
that  he ' s  ever  been  authorized  to  introduce  Wget  to  a 
Government  computer  system.     He  did  penetration 
testing . 

Chief  Royer  further  testified  that  Wget  can 
be  used  in  spear  phishing  and  social  engineering 
attacks  and  both  Captain  Cherepko  and  Chief  Royer  said 
Wget  scrapes  entire  web  sites  and  can  choose  any  data 
that  it  chooses  to  extracts .

introducing  unauthorized  software  violated  25—2 . 

Mr.  Weaver  testified  that  the  authority  to 
add  software  is  reserved  to  specified  administrators. 
PFC  Manning  did  not  have  administrator  privileges  on 
any  of  his  computers . 

Mr.  Weaver  testified  that  introducing 
software  or  creating  elevated  privileges  constituted  a 
bypass  of  authorized  mechanisms.     He  testified  that 
only  automated  functions  a  user  possessed  were  those 
that  came  and  were  installed  on  the  system  as 
authorized  by  the  Army. 

He  testified  that  a  commander  could 
authorize  music  and  games  on  a  computer  system. 
Mr.  Weaver  also  testified  that  a  user  had  personal 
responsibility  under  25—2 . 

Finally  he  testified  that  a  user  couldn't 
add  executable  files  or  Wget  specifically  under  AR25— 2 . 

Your  Honor,   as  Mr.   Kits,   expert  on  D6— A

Colonel  Miller  -testified  in  regard  to  210 
Mountain's  use  of  mIRC  chat  as  part  of  the  mission. 

Colonel  Miller  testified  that  music,  movies 
and  games  would  have  (inaudible)  morale  and  to  the  best 
of  his  knowledge  were  not  self —executable  files . 

There's  been  evidence.  Your  Honor,   of  movie 
files  to  include  music,  movies  and  games  from  the 
T— drive,   the  share  drive  the  brigade  staff  used;  but 
there  has  been  no  evidence  through  testimony  or 
otherwise  admitted  that  music,   movies  and  games  were 
actually  introduced  to  the  T-drive  or  to  any  SIPKNET 
computer  by  any  particular  soldier. 

There  has  been  no  evidence  presented  that 
movies,   music  or  games  are  executable  programs. 

Additionally,   there's  been  no  evidence  that 
storage  of  movies,   music  and  games  were  prohibited. 
Just  the  introduction,   the  introduction  is  what  AR25— 2 
regulates.      Introduction  of  music,   movies  and  games 
onto  a  computer  system  when  they're  not  authorized  is 
prohibited .

Mr.  Weaver  testified  that  there  Is  a 
significant  distinction  between  Introduction  and 
storage  of  files  according  to  the  regulation. 

Mr.  Weaver  distinguished  this  for  moving 
files  already  on  a  network  like  the  T— drive  because 
moving  files  Is  traditionally  authorized  under  AR25— 2 . 

While  movies,  movies  and  games  and 
authorized  programs  like  mIRC  chat  were  actually 
authorized  by  the  commander,  Wget  was  not.     As  stated 
before,   was  unknown  to  every  single  witness  who 
testified  and  was  In  Iraq  and  FOB  Hammer  at  the  time 
PFC  Manning  was  there . 

Your  Honor,   and  how  PFC  Manning  used  Wget 
Informs  the  knowledge  that  he  knew  It  was  unauthorized. 
He  used  Wget  In  secret .     He  never  asked  for  permission 
to  use  Wget . 

And  Chief  Royer  testified  that  someone 
could  not  even  see  Wget  from  five  feet  away.     It's  a 
command  prompt  run  program. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  Wget 
could  be  run  In  the  background.

Chief  Royer  testified  that  unlike  mIRC  chat 
that  has  a  window  with  chat  rooms  on  It;^  no  one  who  has 
never  seen  Wget  before  would  know  what  It  Is . 

And  Sergeant  Sadtler,   Your  Honor,  he 
testified  that  PFC  Manning  had  the  habit  of  locking  his 
screen  to  hide  what  he ' s  doing  on  his  computer  even 
when  he  was  still  sitting  at  his  computer  If  another 
Individual  walked  up. 

Your  Honor,   the  United  States  Is  not 
arguing  that  PFC  Manning  was  prohibited  from  accessing 
the  NCD  database  Itself  or  from  downloading  Individual 
cables  through  the  NCD  database  Interface. 

However,   PFC  Manning  was  only  authorized  to 
do  so  through  using  a  web  browser  Installed  on  his  D6— A 
SIPRNET  computer  because  that  Is  the  tool,  the  program 
the  United  States  Army  gave  him  to  accomplish  that 
mission  and  he  was  not  authorized  to  Install  or  copy 
any  other  programs  onto  his  computer . 

He  copied  Wget  onto  his  computer  for  one 
purpose  and  one  purpose  only,  and  that  was  to  access 
the  NCD  web  server  directly  and  scrape  It  for  all  the

Department  of  State  cables . 

Your  Honor the  next  set  of  specifications 
and  the  dataset  is  the  Farah  investigation.     This  is 
Specification  10  of  Charge  2 .     Specification  10  of 
Charge  2 . 

Your  Honor,   earlier  you  heard  that  PFC 
Manning  began  helping  WikiLeaks  in  late  2009  when  he 
compromised  the  video  BE22PAX. vnnv,   the  Gharani 
airstrike  video.     The  video,   the  military  operation  in 
the  town  of  Gharani  and  the  Farah  province  of 
Afghanistan.     That  military  operation  resulted  in  US 
CENTCOM  conducting  a  formal  investigation  into  the 
circTunstances  surrounding  the  civilian  casualty 
incident .     The  United  States  stored  that  investigation 
in  a  folder  named  Farah  on  the   (inaudible)   that  is  only 
available  on  SIPRNET.     BE22PAX.zip  and  wmv  was  located 
in  the  video  siobf older . 

Your  Honor,   four  months  after  compromising 
BE22PAX.zip  and  the  video  within  it,    PFC  Manning 
returned  to  the  Farah  folder  located  on  the  CENTCOM  SJ 
web  page  to  download  and  compromise  the  remaining

documents  related  to  that  investigation. 

Special  Agent  Shaver  testified  that  on  10 
April  2010  PFC  Manning  visited  Farah  folder.     Within  2 
hours  PFC  Manning  had  downloaded  more  than  330 
investigative  files  from  the  Farah  folder  onto  his 
SIPRNET  computer. 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  129,    129  is 
an  excerpt  of  the  CENTCOM  SharePoint  logs  showing  when 
PFC  Manning  downloaded  the  docioments  from  the  CENTCOM 
website . 

Your  Honor,   Prosecution  Exhibit  128  is  a 
summary  of  the  portion  of  index  dot  dat  file  on  PFC 
Manning ' s  SIPRNET  computer  showing  many  of  the 
documents  PFC  Manning  downloaded  from  the  CENTCOM 
website  on  the  SIPRNET  computer. 

As  I  explained  earlier.   Your  Honor, 
Prosecution  Exhibit  128  shows  PFC  Manning's  computer 
connecting  to  the  SharePoint  server  and  the  Prosecution 
Exhibit  12  9  are  the  SharePoint  logs  showing  PFC  Manning 
or  showing  files  being  downloaded.

testified  that  PFC  Manning  did  not  take  the  video 
titled  BE22PAX.zip  and  vnnv  or  any  other  zip  file  on  10 
April  2010.     No  files  were  downloaded  that  day  from  the 
CENTCOM  website.     Why  not? 

United  States  argue  it ' s  obvious .     He  had 
already  done  it,   taken  the  videos.     Why  did  he  wait 
until  10  April  2010  to  download  and  compromise  the 
documents  related  to  military  operation?     Why  decide  in 
10  April  2010? 

Your  Honor,   it's  during  this  time  from 
starting  5  April  2010  to  be  exact  that  WikiLeaks 
released  Apache  video  between  7  and  10  April  2010  and 
the  annotated  and  Prosecution  Exhibit  81  the  Intelink 
search  logs,    specifically  lines  628  through  640,  628 
through  640.     PFC  Manning  searched  Intelink  for 
WikiLeaks  11  times  and   'Collateral  Murder'  twice. 

He  was  monitoring  and  reveling  in  the 
reaction  to  the  Apache  video. 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  saw  the  rippling 
effects  caused  by  the  release  of  the  Apache  video  less 
than  a  week  earlier  and  he  craved  the  same  effect  of

that  Gharani  military  operation  especially  considering 
WikiLeaks  had  the  video  since  before  Christmas  and 
hadn ' t  released  it  yet .     PFC  Manning  knew  the  charge 
documents  for  Specification  10  were  classified.  These 
documents  were  probably  marked  secret . 

Of  the  10  charged  docxoments  consisting  of 
141  pages,    90  pages  are  marked  secret  at  the  top  and 
bottom  and  a  total  of  504  classification  markings, 
including  the  paragraph  markings,    appear  in  total. 

Your  Honor,  the  docTunents  were  located  on 
the  SIPRNET  on  the  CENTCOM  SharePoint  page  as  explained 
earlier  with  respect  to  the  compromise  of  the  video. 
Each  of  these  web  pages  had  a  secret  banner  across  the 
top  that  said  "secret"  multiple  times.     When  the  user 
scrolled  down  in  the  video,   each  page  had  that  same 
secret  banner. 

Your  Honor,  Mr.   Hall,    former  intelligence 
analyst  and  expert  testified  that  intelligence  analysts 
are  trained  to  handle  classified  documents  according  to 
their  classification  markings  and  that  only  an  OCA  is 
in  a  position  to  say  otherwise .

Further,   many  former  unit  colleagues  of  PFC 
Manning  testified  that  their  trained  practice  is  to 
treat  information  on  SIPRNET  as  classified. 

Your  Honor ,   even  PFC  Manning ' s  two 
non-disclosure  agreements  that  he  signed  specifically 
state  that  if  he's  uncertain  about  the  classification 
and  status  he  is  required  to  assume  it ' s  classified 
unless  he's  told  otherwise  by  competent  authority. 

The  charge  documents  for  Specification  10 
relate  to  the  national  defense  of  the  United  States, 
Lieutenant  Commander  Hoskins  and  Mr.  Neri,   excuse  me. 
Lieutenant  Colonel  Retired  Neri,   both  testified  that 
the  charged  documents  contained  the  type  of  information 
which  can  cause  serious  harm  in  national  security  and 
thus  should  be  secret . 

And  then  Rear  Admiral  Harward,   the  deputy 
commander  of  US  CENTCOM,   and  an  OCA,   testified  that  all 
the  docTunents  were  properly  classified  at  secret  level . 

Your  Honor,   multiple  witnesses  testified 
that  the  charged  docioments  contained  TTP,  troop 
movements,   close  air  support,   troops  in  combat.

the  edltorgwlklleaks  .  org  or  submit. . 

Your  Honor PFC  Manning  saw  this  2008  and 
jumped  at  the  opportunity  to  continue  disclosing 
closely— held  Information  to  WlklLeaks .  Especially 
after  being  removed  from  the  area  with  readily 
available  SIPRNET. 

Special  Agent  Williamson  testified  that 
shortly  after  the  2008  was  piibllshed  on  7  May,  PFC 
Manning  searched  for  macros  to  extract  the  GAP . 

What  does  that  mean.   Your  Honor?  He 
searched  for  a  process  In  order  to  extract  the  GAP . 
And  by  13  May,  PFC  Manning  had  extracted  Global  Address 
List  and  deleted  the  stolen  files . 

Specification  4  of  Charge  3  accounts  for 
this  criminal  misuse  of  the  NIPRNET  and  Global  Address 
List  Information  system  and  Specification  16  Is  the 
theft  of  the  Global  Address  List  for  his  own  personal 
use . 

Your  Honor,  Specification  4  of  Charge  3

than  its  intended  purpose . 

According  to  AR25— 2  information  systems 
includes  computers  as  well  as  set  of  information 
resources  like  the  Microsoft  exchange  Global  Address 
List . 

Chief  Nixon  testified  that  the  GAL  is  a  US 
Government  product  which  populates  information  at  the 
organizational  level  ultimately  listing  every  person, 
entity,    and  machine  within  a  given  domain,    and  in  this 
case  it's  Iraq.     It  is  the  interface  Outlook  users  use 
as  a  directory  for  e-mails  and  other  contact 
information . 

The  GAL  provides  each  user ' s  e-mail

their  name,  but  their  rank,   their  office  and  their, 
potentially  their  location  of  where  they're  working. 

Your  Honor,   according  to  Chief  Royer,  In 
many  cases  the  user  names  continue  for  that 
deconf llctlon .     Knowing  user  names  makes  the  listed 
Individuals  more  vulnerable  to  attack.     The  Information 
provides  adversaries  a  likely  list  of  longstanding 
e— malls  and  (Inaudible) . 

Moreover,   Your  Honor,   In  the  hands  of  an 
adversary  Intelligence  organization,   the  list  Is  a 
virtual  directory  of  persons  with  security  clearances 
as  you  just  saw  and  Intel  analysts  or  sensitivity 
positions  as  well  as  potential  map  for  the  unit 
structure . 

In  short.   Your  Honor,   the  GAL  becomes  a 
phone  book  for  exploitation.     The  release  of  this  list 
would  render  the  Information  and  potentially  the 
physical  security  for  everyone  on  the  list  vulnerable 
to  exploitation  and  ultimately  compromise  the

effectiveness  of  the  countless  missions  that  those 
soldiers  are  working. 

Chief  Royer  testified  that  the  GAL  would  be 
one  of  the  top  records  that  he  would  seek  as  op  4 . 

So  according  to  Sergeant  Blgelow,  PFC 
Manning  left  the  S2  shop  on  8  May  2010  and  started 
working  In  the  supply  room  around  9  May  2010. 

PFC  Manning  was  upset  at  the  move  but  most 
thought  It  was  entirely  because  of  the  fight  he  had 
with  his  fellow  soldier,  but  he  was  actually  upset 
because  he  lost  his  all— access  pass  to  SIPRNET  and  his 
security  clearance  which  he  needed  to  keep  In  order  to 
continue  compromising  classified  Information. 

PFC  Manning,   however,   quickly  found 
something  else .     Something  that  he  could  do  to  maintain 
relevance  In  the  fast  moving  disclosure  world  and  that 
was  based  off  the  WlklLeaks  2008.     PFC  Manning  quickly 
set  about  refocuslng  his  energies  on  NIPRNET  and 
created  a  tester  for  himself  In  the  process.

Macro  Outlook,   which  Is  also  written  down  In  the  search 
field  on  Prosecution  Exhibit  144. 

What ' s  clear  from  looking  at  the  Google 
search  results.   Your  Honor,   Is  that  that  search  term 
brings  up  potential  pages  In  order  to  figure  out  how  to 
extract  and  exflltrate  that  Information  from  Outlook 
because  Outlook  did  not  have  a  function  to  allow  for 
the  e— malls  to  be  pulled  out  In  batch. 

The  second  search  was  for,    quote,  VBA, 
Outlook  write  text  file,  VBA,   Outlook  write  text  file. 

And  that  returned  the  search  results  that 
are  at  Prosecution  Exhibit  145,  PE145. 

Your  Honor,  VBA  stands  for,   as  Special 
Agent  Williamson  said.  Visual  Basic.     Visual  Basic  Is  a 
program  within  Microsoft  Outlook,   or  excuse  me, 
Microsoft  Office  that  allows  simple  programming  In 
order  to  have  the  Microsoft  Office  Tools  programs 
complete  automated  tasks.     And  that  was  another  process 
that  PFC  Manning  researched  In  order  to  figure  out  how, 
how  to  get  around  the  limitation  within  Outlook  of

downloading  and  exf  lit: rating  all  the  e— malls  . 

Special  Agent  Williamson  also  testified 
that  Visual  Basic  and  macros  are  the  ways  you  could  do 
that. 

Outlook  can  only  save  e— malls  by  user 
clicking  on  "save  as"  and  selecting  dot  txt  file  type. 

Outlook  does  not  have  a  function  to  mass 

export . 

Special  Agent  Williamson  also  recovered  two 
different  types  of  files  related  to  the  Global  Address 
List  from  Staff  Sergeant  Blgelow's  computers.  Those 
two  files Your  Honor are  what  are  In,    from  his 
testimony.   Prosecution  Exhibits  47  and  48.     The  names 
and  then  the  e— malls  files. 

Although  Staff  Sergeant  Blgelow  and  Special 
Agent  Williamson  testified  that  this  Is  ample  evidence 
that  PFC  Manning  used  that  account  at  the  same  time  on 
gmall,   financial  records,   reach  out  to  Adrian  Lamo  and 
search  for  WlklLeaks  and  Julian  Assange  on  the

that.  PFC  Manning  moved  these  files,   the  names  and  the 
e-mall  text  files,  to  his  personal  computer.     As  you 
heard  from  Mr.   Johnson  he  found  thousands  of  exchange 
formatted  names  and  e— malls  In  unallocated  space . 

This  act  was  precisely  the  same  process  PFC 
Manning  followed  each  time  he  found  a  disclosed 
classified  material .     He  would  use  the  US  Government 
system  to  manipulate  the  data,   download  the  Information 
from  the  Government  system,   transfer  the  data  to  his 
personal  computer  either  by  CD  or  In  this  case  because 
It's  unclassified  through  e— mall  and  then  package  It, 
transmit  the  Information  to  WlklLeaks  and  then  delete 
the  Information . 

The  Information  doesn't  appear.   Your  Honor, 
In  the  unallocated  space  of  the  computer  unless  PFC 
Manning  took  the  additional  step  of  deleting  It  out  of 
his  recycle  bin  or  trying  to  permanently  delete  It  off 
of  the  computer . 

He  took  all  the  same  steps  with  the  Global 
Address  List  Information  as  he  had  previously  done  with 
each  disclosure.     Each  of  these  clrciimstantlal  pieces

of  evidence  corroborat.es  the  manner,   timeline  and 
Impetus  behind  his  actions  and  proven  forenslcally. 

You  recall  that  Chief  Royer  and  Nixon 
testified  that  the  purposes  of  the  US  forces  Iraq 
Global  Address  List  was  to  facilitate  official 
communications . 

Nixon  testified  that  user  granted 
permissions  to  search  for  e— mall  addresses  but  not  mass 
download  them.     Microsoft  Outlook  or  NIPKNET  computers 
had  a  function  —  did  not  have  a  function  to  export  or 
download  the  e— malls   (Inaudible)   even  In  Iraq  who  had 
an  e— mall  account  used  and  was  listed  In  the  Global 
Address  List  directory. 

Your  Honor ,   we  know  that  PFC  Manning ' s 
conduct  violated  AR25— 2  by  using  an  Information  system 
In  a  manner  other  than  Intended  purpose . 

PFC  Manning  downloaded  the  U.S.  Government 
Information  from  an  Army  Information  system  to  his  user 
account  but  to  another  user ' s  account  that  belonged  to 
a  supervisor.   Sergeant  Blgelow.

his  supervisor  to  do  this,   nor  did  he  have  permission 
from  the  Army  or  Individuals  whose  private  Information 
he  took. 

He  had  no  additional  or  legitimate  reason 
for  this  action. 

PFC  Manning  took  the  Information  out  of  the 
safe  confines  that  protected  the  United  States 
Government  Information  system  and  the  network  for  his 
own  personal  desires  by  e— mailing  through  his  either 
Gmall  account  or  burning  It  onto  a  CD . 

The  Global  Address  List  Information 
ultimately  ended  up  on  his  unsecure  personal  computer 
on  the  Internet  that  his  —  well  on  his  personal 
computer  connected  to  the  Internet . 

PFC  Manning  exposed  the  sensitive  personal 
Information  of  his  brothers  and  sisters  In  arms. 
Including  all  the  civilians  deployed  In  Iraq  within  the 
74,000  names. 

Exposed  all  that  Information  to  foreign 
Intelligence  collection  as  well  as  spear  phlshers  and 
other  electronic  Invasion  schemes .

PFC  Manning  told  each  Adrian  Lamo  that, 
after  adversaries  used  spear  phlshlng^^   he  used  the  word 
spear  phlshlng,   to  attack  the  United  States. 

PFC  Manning  noted  that  the  adversaries  are 
not  successful  typically  because  they  can't  penetrate 
the  air  gap . 

Instead,   It  was  PFC  Manning,   Your  Honor, 
who  penetrated  the  air  gap,  meaning  the  connection 
between  the  US  Government  systems  and  the  rest  of  the 
Internet .     PFC  Manning ' s  actions  likely  exposed  the 
system  relied  upon  by  these  service  members  to 
electronic  Intrusion  as  he  knew  this  from  his  lA 
training. 

Chief  Nixon  and  Chief  Royer  testified  there 
would  be  no  reason.   Your  Honor,  no  reason  to  download 
the  Global  Address  List  because  without  access  to  an 
exchange  server  a  person  couldn't  even  send  an  official 
e— mall .     When  you  have  access  to  the  exchange  server, 
you  automatically  have  access  to  the  Global  Address 
List .

contained  the  Global  Address  List .     The  value  of  the 
information  established  is  by  the  independent  pieces  of 
evidence . 

Your  Honor,  the  issue  here  is  whether  the 
74,000  e— mails  were  more  than  the  statutory  limit  for 
the  641  offense. 

Chief  Nixon  testified  that  dozens  of 
service  members  worked  on  creating  and  entering  the 
information  for  each  user  that  goes  onto  the  Global 
Address  List. 

Every  time  a  new  user  soldier  entered  that 
information.   Chief  Royer  testified  they  would  take  at 
least  10  minutes  to  create  a  new  account  in  the  Global 
Address  List.     For  74,000  e-mails  that  is  740,000 
minutes,   or  over  12,000  hours  or  over  51  days  straight 
with  no  sleep  for  one  soldier  to  create  every  Global 
Address  List  entry  that  PFC  Manning  stole. 

Chief  Royer  testified  that  soldiers  ranking 
from  Specialist  to  Chief  Warrant  Officer  4  created 
Global  Address  List  entries . 

In  2010  a  soldier  at  the  rank  or  grade  of

E4  rank  the  Specialist,  earned  approximately  $1,800  per 
month,   which  also  Is  approximately  $11  per  hour 
assuming  a  40— hour  work  week. 

At  a  rate  of  $11  per  hour  for  1233  hours  It 
would  cost  over  $145,000  to  create  the  entries  for  the 
GAL.     Thus,  the  salary  for  a  Specialist  to  create  each 
e— mall  address  and  associated  Information  that  PFC 
Manning  took  when  he  stole  the  GAL  would  well  exceed 
$1, 000. 

Your  Honor,   overall  the  portion  of  the  GAL 
that  PFC  Manning  took,   he  stole,   consists  of  74,000 
users.     It  Is  clear  that  —  excuse  me.   Your  Honor, 
Mr.  Lewis  testified  that  the  foreign  Intelligence 
services  of  multiple  countries  actively  seek 
Information  In  the  GAL  and  would  pay  for  the  GAL . 

Your  Honor,   for  the  last  time,   the  United 
States  requests  that  the  Defense  relocate  to  the 
witness  box  and  I'm  going  to  hand  Appellate  Exhibit  617 
to  the  court  and  the  accused.

Individuals  and  assoc±at.ed  organization  information  as 
detailed  and  Classified  Reason  Number  9 . 

Mr.   Lewis  emphasized  that  a  block  of 
information  is  more  valuable  to  foreign  intelligence 
services.     The  GAL  reveals  unit  strength  and  can  be 
associated  with  other  intelligence  to  increase 
adversarial  understanding  of  the  United  States  TTPs 
because  the  GAL  states  duty  positions  and  units . 

Thus,   Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  country  5 
and  their  intelligence  services  would  pay  over  $3,000 
on  the  low  end  for  the  records  in  the  GAL  as  set  forth 
in  Classified  Reason  Niomber  10 . 

Your  Honor,   the  United  States  is  —  or  I 
will  retrieve  Appellate  Exhibit  617  from  the  Court  and 
the  witness. 

In  this  case.   Your  Honor,   as  PFC  Manning 
took  the  deliberate  actions  I  previously  described  to 
target,   extract,   and  transfer  and  then  hide  US 
Government  information,    all  for  the  unofficial  purpose 
of  transferring  this  information  to  WikiLeaks  because 
they  asked  for  it,   in  doing  so.   Your  Honor,   you  heard

testimony  that.  PFC  Manning  deliberately  placed  all  US 
Government  employees  and  soldiers  In  Iraq  at  personal 
risk  by  removing  their  PI  from  the  NIPRNET  protected 
system.     This  PI,  by  Army  regulation  25—2,   Is  sensitive 
Information  that  shouldn ' t  be  placed  on  a  personal 
computer . 

When  PFC  Manning  extracted  the  GAL  to  his 
personal  computer  he  completed  his  theft  of  those 
records .     The  GAL  was  stored  on  an  unclassified  system 
where  only  unauthorized  or  where  only  authorized 
personnel  could  access  them. 

At  no  time  was  PFC  Manning  authorized  to 
house  the  GAL  on  his  personal  laptop. 

Mr.   Lewis  testified  that  foreign 
Intelligence  services  will  pay  for  this  type  of 
Information  precisely  because  Its  exclusive  possession 
by  the  United  States  Government,   provides  a  significant 
benefit . 

Your  Honor,   at  this  time  the  United  States 
recommends  we  go  In  one  final  recess  and  then  finish 
the  closing.

THE  COURT:     All  right. 

MR.   FEIN:     Or  keep  going.   Your  Honor. 

THE  COURT:     No.     This  is  a  good  time  to 
take  a  15-minute  recess. 

I ' d  like  to  see  counsel  in  my  chambers  to 
talk  about  the  way  ahead  during  that  recess. 

(Court  in  recess.) 

THE  COURT:     Court  is  called  to  order. 

Let  the  record  reflected  all  parties

Before  we  proceed  with  the  remainder  of  the 
Prosecution's  closing  argioment,   counsel  and  I  met  in 
chambers  over  the  recess  to  look  at  the  way  ahead. 

First  of  all,   we  discussed  the  Court 
granted  three  amendments  to  the  charge  sheet  and  the 
Government  has  not  made  those  yet  so  the  Government 
will  do  that  in  recess,   Xerox  copy  of  the  original 
charge  sheet  that  has  the  charges  at  arraignment . 

And  secondly,    in  light  of  the  time,   what  we 
are  going  to  do  is  finish  the  Government ' s  closing

We'll  start  at  0930  with  the  defense 
closing  argrunent  and  rebuttal  by  the  Government  if  they 
have  any . 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   Specification  1  of 
Charge  2 .     In  total  PFC  Manning  compromised  more  than 
700,000  classified  documents  to  WikiLeaks  and 
unquestionably  knew  that  anything  he  compromised  to 
WikiLeaks  would  be  released  to  the  pijblic  on  the 
Internet.     And  how  did  he  know  that.   Your  Honor? 

THE  COURT:     Are  you  doing  Specification  1, 
Charge  1  or  Specification  1  of  Charge  2? 

MR.   FEIN:     Your  Honor,   Specification  1  of 

Charge  2 . 

How  do  we  know  that,    that  PFC  Manning 
unquestionably  knew  that  anything  he  compromised  to 
WikiLeaks  would  be  released  to  the  pijblic  on  the 
internet? 

First,   he  repeatedly  reviewed  intelligence 
reports  discussing  the  WikiLeaks '   mission  and  its 
operations  no  later  than  1  December  2009.  This 
included  the  ACIC  report,    IRR  and  C3  docTunent,  which

all  of  them  explicitly  told  PFC  Manning  anything  that 
he  provided  to  WikiLeaks  would  be  released  to  the 
pijblic . 

Second,   his  chat  to  Julian  Assange.  While 
committing  his  reckless  disclosures,   PFC  Manning 
contemporaneously  engaged  in  online  chats  with  Julian 
Assange  and  urged  him  to  release  the  documents 
previously  provided  by  him  to  the  ones  that  were  not 
released. 

Third,   his  constant  research  of  the  world 
reaction  when  the  documents  he  compromised  to  WikiLeaks 
were  released  to  the  public. 

And,    fourth,   his  chats  with  Julian  Assange 
where  he  released  his  criminal  acts.     Your  Honor,  PFC 
Manning  chose  to  compromise  the  documents  to  WikiLeaks 
because  he  knew  that  WikiLeaks  would  release  them  on 
the  internet . 

So  what  did  PFC  Manning  cause  to  be 
pioblished  by  the  internet? 

The  Court  took  judicial  notice  of  the

the  ACIC  report,   an  actual  intel  report  measuring  the 
threat  caused  by  WiklLeaks . 

On  5  April  2010  WiklLeaks  released  the 
Apache  video  of  a  military  operation . 

On  25  July  2010  WiklLeaks  released  more 
than  75,000  SIGACTS  from  the  CIDNE-A  database. 

THE  COURT:     What  was  the  date  of  that?

Your  Honor,    25  April  2011  WikiLeaks 
receives  more  than  700  GTMO  DABs,   detainee  assessment 
briefs,   that  were  actual  reports  containing 
intelligence  relating  to  the  particular  detainees . 
Each  of  these  records,  were  produced  by  United  States 
Government,   stored  on  the  SIPRNET,   and  were  integral  to 
the  war  against  terrorism  or  US  foreign  policy  and 
diplomacy . 

Witnesses  testified  that  the  ACIC  report. 
Apache  video,   SIGACT  database,  NCD  database,  SOUTHCOM 
database,   all  contained  actual  and  true  information 
thus  intelligence.     This  intelligence  was  accessible  to 
PFC  Manning  and  PFC  Manning  made  this  intelligence 
accessible  to  the  world  on  the  internet  through

PFC  Manning  knew  he  was  not  authorized  to  transmit 
these  classified  dociiments  to  WikiLeaks  and  WikiLeaks 
was  not  authorized  to  receive  classified  information. 
It  did  not  meet  the  three  criteria  that  PFC  Manning 
knew  too  well .

You  have  also  heard,   well  —  an 
overwhelming  amount  of  evidence  that  PFC  Manning  knew 
that  the  enemy  uses  the  Internet  to  gather 
Intelligence . 

Specification  1  of  Charge  2  requires  the 
United  States  to  prove  that  PFC  Manning  acted  wantonly 
when  he  caused  this  Intelligence  to  be  piobllshed  on  the 
Internet,   whether  all  the   (Inaudible)   clrcTimstances  his 
conduct  was  that  he,   that  a  type  of  heedless  nature 
that  made  It  actually  or  eminently  dangerous  to  others . 

The  evidence  without  question  Is 
overwhelming  to  prove,   at  the  very  least  Is  utter 
recklessness . 

PFC  Manning  compromised  more  than  700,000 
classified  dociiments  during  the  7— month  deployment. 
That's  100,000  documents  per  month,   3,300  documents  per 
day,    138  documents  per  hour  and  more  than  two  docioments 
every  minute . 

Your  Honor,   there  Is  absolutely  no  way  he 
even  knew  what  he  was  giving  to  WlklLeaks  as  far  as  the 
entire  large  databases .     Instead,  he  learned  the  exact

details  of  what,  he  compromised  the  same  time  as  the 
pijbllc  and  the  enemy. 

The  Individual  details,   PFC  Manning, 
without  question,   understood  this  risk.     He  told  Adrian 
Lamo  that  Hillary  Clinton  and  several  thousand 
diplomats  around  the  world  were  going  to  have  a  heart 
attack  when  they  woke  up  one  morning  and  found  an 
entire  repository  of  classified  foreign  policies 
available  In  searchable  format  to  the  public.  He 
recognized  that  and  even  acknowledged  that  his  actions 
will  affect  everybody  on  earth  In  the  same  chats. 

Lastly,   Your  Honor,   the  United  States 
proved  that  PFC  Manning's  misconduct  was  prejudicial  to 
good  order  discipline  and  service  for  all  of  the 
Specification  of  Charge  2 . 

Colonel  Miller,   Colonel  Miller  testified 
that  the  last  thing  he  expected  was  an  Internal 
security  breach  from  one  of  his  own,   an  Insider  threat 
from  within  his  ranks . 

According  to  Colonel  Miller,   when  he 
briefed  the  staff  about  PFC  Manning's  actions,  a

funeral— like  atmosphere  fell  over  the  crowd.     They  were 
angry,    sad,   grieved  and  frustrated  all  at  the  same 
time . 

Colonel  Miller  testified  that  before  the 
scope  of  PFC  Manning's  misconduct  was  revealed,  the 
unit  morale  was  at  an  all— time  high.     As  they  had  just 
completed  their  mission  requirements,   everything  was 
going  well  with  the  Iraqi  security  forces  and  they  were 
beginning  to  do  draw— down  in  order  to  redeploy  to 
Ft .   Drum . 

Soldiers  that  had  been  on  nxomerous  prior 
deployments  within,   as  he  testified,   the  most  deployed 
brigade  in  the  United  States  Army,   were  finally  seeing 
the  fruits  of  their  labors  over  the  past  10  years  come 
to  fruition . 

And  then,   PFC  Manning's  covert  actions  came 
to  light.     His  misconduct  completely  shook  the  entire 
brigade,   according  to  Colonel  Miller.     Colonel  Miller 
testified  that  the  morale  took  a  hit .      It  took  a  hit  as 
a  result  of  PFC  Manning's  actions.     The  unit 
collectively  felt  it  was  a  blemish  on  its  otherwise

stellar  record. 

PFC  Manning's  recklessness  negatively 
Impacted  the  trusted  formation .     Colonel  Miller 
testified  that  trusted  Information  Is  the  foundation 
for  everything  we  do  In  the  military.     Every  soldier 
has  to  know  that  every  other  soldier  Is  doing  their  job 
and  they  have  to  trust  each  other  In  order  to  stay 
focused  on  their  mission.     Every  soldier  has  to  rely  on 
each  other  and  know  that  they  have  each  other ' s  backs . 

Those  are  the  words  of  Colonel  Miller,  Your 

Honor . 

If  there's  a  distraction  and  the  soldier 
has  to  look  to  his  left  and  right  when  he ' s  supposed  to 
be  looking  In  front  of  him,   that  his  eyes  are  off  his 
job  and  the  foundation  of  the  military  starts  to 
criunble . 

Your  Honor,   according  to  Colonel  Miller, 
the  US  Army  relies  on  the  trust  of   (Inaudible)  PFC 
Manning's  actions  caused  the  morale  of  the  unit  to  take 
a  hit  to  create  the   (Inaudible) .     Thus,   Your  Honor,  It 
was  prejudice   (Inaudible)   and  service  discrediting.

Your  Honor,    104  aiding  the  enemy  by  giving 
intelligence.     Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  deliberately 
transmitted  the  Apache  video,   certain  Department  of 
State  cables  information,   and  the  CIDNE-A  SIGACTS  to 
WikiLeaks .     He  did  this  with  the  knowledge  and  intent 
that  it  would  be  released  to  the  world  and  he  did  this 
knowing  that  the  enemy  would  retrieve  this  valuable 
information  from  WikiLeaks. 

Your  Honor,   for  Article  104  purposes,  who 
are  the  enemies  of  the  United  States .     You  heard 
evidence  from  multiple  sources,  multiple  witnesses 
regarding  enemies  of  the  United  States  and  specifically 
al— Qaeda  and  al-Qaeda  of  the  Arabian  Peninsula. 

One  of  those  sources  of  evidence  is  your 
ruling  on  judicial  notice .     You  took  judicial  notice 
that  facts  establishing   (inaudible)   and  Adam  Gadahn  are 
members  off  al-Qaeda  and  enemies  of  the  United  States, 
al— Qaeda  and  Arabian  Peninsula  are  also  an  enemy  of  the 
United  States .

And  you  have  Prosecution  Exhibit  182 .  The 
stipulation  of  fact  for  Adam  Gadahn.     You  have  those 
for  your  reference.   Your  Honor. 

Commander  Aboul— Enein,   through  a 
stipulation  of  expected  testimony,   explained  the 
historical  background  of  al— Qaeda  and  the  Arabian 
Peninsula  and  how  they  operate  as  an  enemy  of  the 
United  States.     None  of  these  facts  for  dispute. 

What ' s  specifically  contested,   but  not  in 
dispute,   is  PFC  Manning's  knowledge. 

PFC  Manning  had  actual  knowledge  that  these 
enemies , al-Qaeda  and  al— Qaeda  Arabian  Peninsula  used 
WikiLeaks  to  gather  intelligence  on  the  United  States . 
And,   therefore,   by  giving  intelligence  to  WikiLeaks  he 
was  giving  intelligence  to  the  enemy. 

PFC  Manning  had  the  general  evil  intent 
necessary  to  aid  the  enemy  and  evidence  shows  that  he 
acted  voluntarily  and  deliberately  with  his 
disclosures .

reasonable  doubt  that  PFC  Manning ' s  voluntary  and 
deliberate  actions  to  disclose  over  700,000  documents 
to  the  world  and  public  through  WlklLeaks  were  In  the 
actual  hands  of  the  enemy  and  PFC  Manning  knew  this 
would  occur  when  he  released  that  Information . 

The  evidence  showed  that  PFC  Manning  was  a 
trained  Intelligence  analyst.     His  dally  work  product 
as  an  Intelligence  analyst  In  Garrison  and  In  theater 
established  his  knowledge  of  the  enemy  threat .  His 
research  of  Intelligence  reports  related  to  WlklLeaks 
warned  him  repeatedly  of  the  enemy's  use  of  WlklLeaks. 

In  his  own  statements  he  established  that 
he  knew,   he  knew  through  his  own  words  that  the 
Information  would  be  made  available  to  the  world 
without  alteration . 

First,   Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning's  military 
training.     He  was  an  all— source  Intelligence  analyst  at 
35  fox.     No  other  MOS  In  the  entire  United  States  Army 
receive  such  detail  level  of  Instruction  on  the  enemies 
of  the  United  States,  what  they're  capable  of,   and  why 
we  keep  classified  Information  from  their  possession.

Your  Honor,   what,  did  PFC  Manning  learn  at 
AIT  about  the  need  to  safeguard  classified  and 
sensitive  information?     The  dangers  of  putting  such 
information  on  the  internet  and  the  enemy ' s  use  of  the 
internet.     He  learned  the  lesson  of  INFOSEC. 
Prosecution  Exhibit  52 .     The  PowerPoint  slide  show  he 
received.     The  lessons  on  the  identity  of  terrorist 
groups  including  al— Qaeda  and  Osama  bin  Laden.  Lessons

value  to  the  adversaries  because  soldiers  have  to 
always  assume,  he  was  taught,   always  assume  that  that 
adversary  Is  reading  their  material  on  the  Internet . 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  knew  and  understood 
the  different  types  of  recruiting  utilized  by  terrorist 
organizations.   In  particular  al— Qaeda.     And  the  number 
of  terrorist  web  sites  have  jumped  from  less  than  100 
to  as  many  as  4,000  over  the  past  10  years. 

He  also  learned  about  non— disclosure 
agreements.     In  2008  he  signed  two  of  them,  two 
non— disclosure  agreements  accepting  responsibility  for 
having  knowledge  of  the  potential  effects  of 
unauthorized  disclosure  of  classified  Information.  He 
declared  his  understanding  of  being  reposed  trust  and 
confidence  to  protect  our  nation ' s  secrets . 

Based  on  his  training  and  assigning  of  two 
non— disclosure  agreements,  PFC  Manning  had  actual 
knowledge  that  terrorist  organizations  would  use 
WlklLeaks  as  a  source  for  their  Intelligence 
collection .

When  disclosing  all  the  classified

the  consequences  of  his  actions  and  knew,   without  any

because  one  must  use  common  sense  because  there  are 
many  enemies  and  It's  a  free  and  open  society.

about.  PFC  Manning,   what:  did  he  know  based  on  the  actual 
analytic  work  product  that  he  was  required  to  perform? 

He  had  extensive  experience  studying  enemy 
TTP,   both  pre— deployment  and  during  his  deployment. 

At  Ft .   Drum  he  conducted  weekly  briefings 
to  his  superiors  on  worldwide  threats  and  specific 
threats  In  Afghanistan  and  Iraq. 

He  was  very  good  at  computers .     One  of  his 
strengths  was  data  mining . 

Data  mining  was  critical  to  the  enemy 
predictive  analysis  that  you've  heard  about,  that  study 
of  an  enemy  trend  to  be  able  to  predict  their  future 
activities . 

Mr.   Hall  testified  as  an  expert,    said  that 
PFC  Manning  would  have  been  aware,  he  would  have  been 
aware  that  the  enemy  engaged  In  similar  pattern

PFC  Manning  acknowledges  his  own 
understanding  of  the  value  of  the  Information  that  he

and  Afghanistan  are,    "possibly  one  of  the  most  — "  or

excuse  me  —  "one  of  the  more  significant  docioments  of 
our  time .     Removing  the  fog  of  war  and  revealing  the 
true  nature  of  21st  century  asymmetric  warfare." 
Prosecution  Exhibit  42 . 

Your  Honor in  addition  to  his  training  and 
work  product,   PFC  Manning  kept  different  military 
pioblications  on  external  hard  drive  that  showed  he  was 
not  naive  or  an  ignorant  soldier  but  one  who 
methodically  kept  track  of  information,    including  the 
information  regarding  the  use  as  weapons  of 
pro— insurgent  web  sites  by  the  enemy. 

The  methodology  the  enemy  uses  on  the 
internet  to  further  the  anti-US  causes,   including  cyber 
mining  for  intelligence .      Information  warfare  in  the 
form  of  propaganda  is  a  well— known  enemy  tactic. 

His  possession  of  all  the  above  data 
information  is  additional  circiomstantial  evidence  that 
PFC  Manning  had  actual  knowledge  leading  to  the  only 
reasonable  inference  that  he  knew  by  disclosing  this 
information  to  WikiLeaks,   an  organization  he  knew  would

specifically  al-Qaeda  and  the  al-Qaeda  at  the  Arabian 
Peninsula . 

PFC  Manning's  knowledge  of  the  enemy  using 
the  internet  was  further  developed;^   Your  Honor,   in  his 
own  searching  for  repeated  reading  and  habitual 
compromising  of  the  classified  information  pertaining 
to  WikiLeaks  website . 

He  read  three  different  intellectual 
reports  that  explicitly  told  him  that  the  enemy  will 
read  anything  posted  on  WikiLeaks . 

First,   Your  Honor,   the  ACIC  report.     As  I 
already  discussed,   PFC  Manning  first  accessed  this 
basic  website  on  19  November  2009  and  then  viewed  the 
document,   the  dociiment  being  Prosecution  Exhibit  45  and 
46,   on  1  December  2009. 

So  what  did  PFC  Manning  learn  from  that 
document?     That  WikiLeaks  represented  a  potential  force 
protection,   counterintelligence,   OPSEC  and  INFOSEC 
threat .

PFC  Manning  also  appreciated  the  value  of 
the  ACIC  document  In  cyber  Intelligence  reporting.

WlklLeaks . 

Second;^   Your  Honor,  NCIRR.     As  I  already 
discussed.     PFC  Manning  first  PE99  after  conducting  a 
search  for  WikiLeaks  on  Intelink  on  1  December  2009. 
On  14  February  2010  he  downloaded  the  report  and 
disclosed  it  to  WikiLeaks . 

So  what  did  he  learn  from  this  IRR.  That 
WikiLeaks  self —described  uncensorable  Wikipedia  for 
untracable  mass  docioment  leading  and  analysis . 

WikiLeaks  in  2008  had  garnered  the 
attention  of  major  news  media  outlets  but  not 
intelligence  reporting  within  the  United  States  because 
it  was  largely  north. 

Interesting  enough.   Your  Honor,   the  IRR 
also  included  contact  information  for  the  NCIS  cyber 
security  office. 

If  PFC  Manning  had  any  questions  about  the 
threat  WikiLeaks  posed  to  our  National  Security  he 
could  have  reached  out  for  clarification  which  he 
clearly  did  not  do. 

However,   Your  Honor,   we  do  know  what  he

he  reached  out  to  them  In  November  of  2009  Instead  of 
seeking  clarification  If  he  actually  doTjbted  what  he 
read. 

Third,   Your  Honor,   the  C3  trip  report.  As 
I  already  discussed,  PFC  Manning's  first  would  have 
viewed  the  C3  report.   Prosecution  Exhibit  43,  after 
conducting  a  search  for  WlklLeaks  on  Intellnk  or  after 
January  2010.     On  14  February  2010  he  downloaded  the 
report  and  disclosed  It  to  WlklLeaks . 

So  what  did  he  learn  from  the  C3  report. 
Your  Honor?     On  page  2,   quote,   the  Internet  Is  an 
essential  communication  tool  for  terrorists,   end  quote. 
That  WlklLeaks  Is  a  publicly  accessible  Internet 
website  where  Individuals  svibmlt  leaked  Information  and 
have  It  published  to  the  public  anonymously  without 
fear  of  being  held  legally  liable . 

Information  that  can  be  disclosed  Includes, 
but  not  limited,    classified  Information  and  then  on 
page  3,   Your  Honor,   on  page  3  of  the  C3  report, 
WlklLeaks  poses  a  large  threat  not  only  from  the  actual

external  disclosure,   but.  from  the  insider,   the  insider 
would  be  able  to  easily  leak  information  without  fear 
of  any  direct  individual  repercussions. 

PFC  Manning  read  these  three  different 
reports  on  multiple  occasions  during  his  deployment  and 
he  chose  to  compromise  those  reports . 

By  reading  and  disclosing  these  three 
documents  he  knew  at  a  minimiun  that  WikiLeaks  had  a 
self —admitted  reputation  for  encouraging  leaks  of 
classified  information  for  the  United  States  Government 
and  releasing  that  information . 

By  reading  and  disclosing  these  three 
documents  PFC  Manning  knew  at  a  minimvim  that  any 
website  that  posts  anything  it  received  would  be  used 
by  the  enemy. 

These  documents,   coupled  with  his 
intelligence  training  on  the  means  and  methods  that 
al— Qaeda  and  the  Arabian  Peninsula  employ,   PFC  Manning 
knew  the  exact  type  of  information  he  chose  to  disclose 
would  be  useful  to  the  enemy. 

PFC  Manning  knew  the  informations  existence

on  the  internet  would  actively  encourage  our  nation ' s 
enemy  to  gather  and  data  mine  the  information  just  like 
he  had  to  do  for  his  country  as  an  intelligence 
analyst . 

This  is  particularly  true.   Your  Honor,  in 
light  of  PFC  Manning's  specific  training  on  al— Qaeda  at 
ART,   210  Mountain,   JRTC  rotations  and  in— theater. 

His  own  words  informed  his  actual 
knowledge.   Your  Honor,   deliberate  acts  of  disclosure  to 
WikiLeaks  would  inevitably  result  in  our  nation ' s  enemy 
possessing  the  compromised  materials .     His  own 
statements  document  knowledge.     By  giving  the 
information  to  WikiLeaks    (inaudible) ,   PFC  Manning  knew 
the  information  had  a  global  scope  and  he  was  creating 
worldwide  anarchy  and  that  was  a  beautiful  and 
horrifying  thing  to  him.     Global  scope  worldwide 
anarchy  and  that  was  a  beautiful  and  horrifying  thing. 

That's  page  9,   Your  Honor,   of  the  Lamo 

chats . 

These  are  not  the  words  of  a  hiomanist,  but 
these  are  the  words  of  an  anarchist.

PFC  Manning  knew  how  WlklLeaks  held 
themselves  out  to  the  world,   quote,   like  you're  the 
first  Intelligence  agency  for  the  general  pijbllc,  end 
quote.     Page  9,   Assange  chats. 

On  page  10  of  the  Assange  chats,  Julian 
Assange  specifically  states  to  PFC  Manning  that,  quote, 
WlklLeaks  described  Itself  as  the  first  Intelligence 
agency  of  the  people.     Better  principle  and  less 
parochial  than  any  Government  Intelligence  agencies . 
It  Is  able  to  be  more  accurate  and  relevant.     It  has  no 
commercial  or  national  Interests  at  heart.     It  Is  only 
Interested  In  the  revelation  of  the  truth.     Unlike  the 
covert  activities  at  state  Intelligence  agencies, 
WlklLeaks  relies  upon  the  power  of  overt  fact . 

Your  Honor ,   PFC  Manning ' s  work  with  an 
Intelligence  agency  of  the  people  Is  not  an  act  of  a 
person  trying  to  spark  a  national  debate  but  rather  an 
act  of  a  soldier,   a  soldier  of  the  United  States  Army 
that  has  no  longer  loyalty  to  his  country  because  he 
had  no,   no  national  Interest  at  heart.

whatever  he  disclosed  t.o  them  on  the  Internet. . 

Additionally;^   PFC  Manning's  chats  with 
Adrian  Lamo  informed  his  knowledge  of  WikiLeaks  and  the 
effects  of  his  actions . 

He  called  WikiLeaks  a  group  of  FOI 
activists,  he  knew  the  compromise  of  Department  of 
State  cables  would  affect  everybody  on  earth. 

He  noted,   again.   Your  Honor,   that  Hillary 
Clinton  and  several  thousand  diplomats  around  the  world 
are  going  to  have  a  heart  attack  when  they  wake  up  one 
morning  and  find  an  entire  repository  of  classified 
foreign  policies  available  and  in  searchable  format  for 
the  pijblic. 

He  created  the  searchable  format  for  the 
pijblic,   the  pijblic  included  the  enemy  and  he  knew  that. 
Your  Honor,   as  an  intelligence  analyst. 

He  even  acknowledged  that,   quote,  could 
have  sold  the  information  to  Russia  and  China  but  chose 
not  to  because  it ' s  public  data .     And  because  another 
state  would  take  advantage  of  the  information  and  try 
to  get  some  edge .

This  isn't  public  data.    Your  Honor.  This 
is  United  States  Government  classified  information  he 
was  trained  to  use  to  protect  our  soldiers  and  knew  the 
effects  of  his  actions . 

Your  Honor,   this  simple  acknowledgement  by 
PFC  Manning  shows  that  he  understood  the  utility  and 
financial  value  of  this  information  and  how  foreign 
entities  desired  the  information. 

Your  Honor,   the  defense  would  like  you  to 
believe  that  PFC  Manning  actually  wanted  to  spark 
change  and  reform.     However,   PFC  Manning  never  once 
mentioned  protecting  the  American  public  or  the  United 
States  as  being  any  sort  of  motivation  for  his  crimes 
in  any  of  his  chats  or  e-mails . 

Simply  put,   if  PFC  Manning  had  given  the 
information  to  Russia  or  China,   he  would  have  made  an 
incredible  amount  of  money  according  to  him.  If 
nothing  else,   he  was  skilled  in  constructing  post 
justifications  to  his  acts  that  were  not  based  in 
facts,   actual  actions  themselves,  the  actions  that 
we're  discussing  here.     This  is  true  for  the  evidence

Based  on  his  actions.   Your  Honor,   admissions  to  Assange 
and  Lamo,   his  predeployment  admission  to  Ms.  Showman, 
PFC  Manning  had  no  allegiance  to  the  United  States  and 
the  flag  it  stands  for. 

You  heard  the  testimony  from  Ms .  Shovmian 
that  during  a  predeployment  counseling  session  she 
pointed  to  the  American  flag  on  her  shoulder  and  asked 
PFC  Manning  what  that  flag  meant  to  him. 

His  answer,   that  flag  meant  nothing  to  him. 
He  had  no  allegiance  to  any  people.     Similar  words  to 
one  who  is  an  anarchist . 

Ms.   Showman  testified  that  after  this 
incident  she  notified  Sergeant  Mitchell  and  Master 
Sergeant  Adkins . 

And,   Your  Honor,   you  heard,  although 
suffering  from  memory  problems,   that  Master  Sergeant 
Adkins  testified  that  he  remembered  signing  his 
administrative  reduction  board  appeal,   that  document 
which  occurred  two  years  ago,   and  on  that  appeal  he

him  reporting  that.  Incident  to  Major  Clawson,   his  boss 
at  the  time . 

PFC  Manning  did  have  a  general  evil  Intent, 
Your  Honor,   which  was  manifested  through  his  deliberate 
and  repeated  compromise  of  classified  Information.  His 
wholesale  disclosure  of  Information  from  databases  that 
he  could  not  have  even  read  all  the  Information  then. 
Based  on  the  general  evil  Intent  PFC  Manning  knowingly 
gave  through  WlklLeaks  al— Qaeda  and  the  al— Qaeda 
Arabian  Peninsula  specific  Intelligence  which  was  found 
In  their  possession. 

Your  Honor,   there's  no  dispute  that 
Information  from  the  CIDNE— A  database,   specifically  the 
SIGACTS,    certain  Department  of  State  cables  and  the 
Apache  video  are  Intelligence .     And  that  Intelligence 
was  received  by  al-Qaeda  and  the  al-Qaeda  In  the 
Arabian  Peninsula. 

As  the  Court  Is  aware.   Intelligence  means 
any  Information  which  Is  helpful  to  the  enemy  and  true,

officials  raided  UBL's  compound  located  in  Pakistan  and

al-Qaeda  requesting  that  member  gather  Department  of

The  SIGACTS  from  CIDNE-A  details  whether 
the  enemy  was  successful  in  the  attacks  against  US 
forces,   if  a  specific  lED  did  or  did  not  work. 

The  enemy  can  now  use  the  factual 
information  from  the  reports  to  develop  their  own  TTP 
to  better  employ  lEDs  against  the  United  States . 

This  is  the  exact  same  process.  Your  Honor, 
that  PFC  Manning  was  trained  and  used  when  he 
determined  the  safest  route  or  the  highest  density  of 
lED ' s  for  his  commander. 

You  heard  from  Commander  Aboul— Enein  that 
acknowledgement  of  successful  attacks  against  US  forces 
boosts  the  morale  within  al-Qaeda  and  may  lead  to 
increase  in  attacks.     This,   too.   Your  Honor,  applies

received  it .

The  edited  and  released  version  of  the

in  propaganda. 

Terrorist  organizations  now  have  it,  proven 
by  Adam  Gadahn  calling  on  all  Jihadists  to  view  the 
video  and  war  against  United  States . 

PFC  Manning  knew  this  would  happen  from  his

Your  Honor,  that  within  the  last  10  years  the  number  of

potential  to  create  the  type  of  hostile  environment . 

Even  PFC  Manning  himself  recognized  this  in 
his  chat  with  Adrian  Lamo  when  he  stated  that  line 
about  Hillary  Clinton  and  the  several  thousand 
diplomats . 

This  was  even  obvious  to  Osama  bin  Laden,

received  it,   asked  for  this  type  of  material  and 
received  it,   and  he  was  in  the  most  isolated  regions

ability  to  data  mine  for  information . 

As  Mr.   Hall  testified,   all  junior  analysts 
know  that  enemy  conducts  particular  analysis  based  on 
data  it  can  access  and  the  enemy  does  this  through  data 
mining . 

PFC  Manning  knew  this  when  he  decided  to 
make  the  information  available  to  the  enemy  in  the 
format  he  made  it  available .

Peninsula.      Inspire  magazine  serves  as  a  propaganda 
tool . 

On  16  January  2010,   Inspire  magazine 
piobllshed  Issue  No.   4,   Winter  2010  edition  on  the 
Internet.     On  pages  44  and  45  of  that  Issue,  the 
magazine  lists  activities  In  western  Jlhadlst  to  wage 
Jihad  against  the  United  States  and  the  west . 

Specifically,  the  magazine  pointed  out  that 
archiving  large  amounts  of  Information  Is  helpful  to 
AQAP  and  It  further  lists,    "anything  useful  from 
WlklLeaks  Is  useful  for  archiving." 

Al— Qaeda  In  the  Arabian  Peninsula 
recognized  the  value  that  PFC  Manning  made  available  to 
them  through  WlklLeaks  and  directed  Its  followers  to 
perform  essentially  the  same  function  that  PFC  Manning 
did  for  the  United  States,   data  mine  for  Information 
they  could  use. 

Your  Honor,   the  CIDNE— A  SIGACTS,  Department 
of  State  cables  Information,   the  Apache  video  are  all 
Information  that  Is  of  value  to  the  enemy  and  thus 
Intelligence .

PFC  Manning  knew  who  the  enemy  was  and  what, 
type  of  information  they  sought,  specifically 
classified  information  and  tactical  information. 

He  knew  that  the  enemy  used  the  internet 
and  that  WikiLeaks  was  helpful  to  our  enemies . 

He  knew  that  WikiLeaks  website  commonly 
contained  classified  official  US  Government  information 
and  for  that  reason  was  commonly  visited  by  the  enemy 
like  any  other  website  like  that . 

PFC  Manning  was  well— informed  of  how 
WikiLeaks  operated.     He  searched  for  WikiLeaks  more 
than  ICQ  times  on  Intelink  during  his  deployment  or,^  as 
you  heard  earlier,   roughly  four  searches  for  every  five 
days  in  theater. 

He  knew  that  anything  that  he  disclosed  to 
WikiLeaks  would  be  posted  on  the  internet  and  he  knew 
that  foreign  adversaries  will  review  and  access  DoD 
sensitive  or  classified  information  posted  to  the 
WikiLeaks  website . 

PFC  Manning  posed  that  question.  Your 
Honor,   to  Adrian  Lamo  in  his  chats:     If  you  had

unprecedented  access  to  classified  networks  14  hours  a 
day;^    7  days  a  week  for  8  plus  months  what  would  you  do? 

PFC  Manning  asked  that  question  six  months 
after  he  starting  exflltratlng  Information  from  the 
SIPRNET.     He  asked  that  question  six  months  after  he 
knowingly  provided  Intelligence  leaks  about  the  United 
States  through  WlklLeaks.      (Inaudible) .     He  asked  that 
question  six  months  after  researching  WlklLeaks  on 
Intellnk  and  other  classified  databases  and  watching 
the  effects  of  previous  disclosures  yet  continuing  to 
disclose . 

PFC  Manning  provided  his  answer  to  Adrian 
Lamo  on  page  8,   Your  Honor,   of  his  chat:     "Let's  just 
say  someone  I  know  Intimately  well  has  been  penetrating 
US  classified  networks,  mining  data  like  the  ones 
described,   and  then  transferring  that  data  from  the 
classified  networks  over  the  air  gap  onto  a  commercial 
network  computer,   sorting  the  data,  compressing, 
encrypting  It,    and  uploading  It  to  a  crazy  white  haired 
aussle  who  can't  seem  to  stay  In  one  country  very 
long . "

What  you  did  not  see.    Your  Honor,    in  those 
chats  with  Julian  Assange  or  Lauren  McNamara  is  that  he 
had  a  duty  to  his  country  and  a  specific  duty  to 
protect  classified  information  and  other  sensitive 
information  and  with  this  access  that  he  work  hard  to 
assist  his  fellow  soldiers  that  are  in  enemy  sites. 

PFC  Manning  never  took  pause  when  divulging 
to  Adrian  Lamo  that  he  had  created  a  massive  mess  and 
no  one,    his  own  words.   Your  Honor,   no  one  had  a  clue 
because  95  percent  of  the  efforts  are  on  physical 
security  of  classified  networks  and  managing 
operational  security  on  unclassified  networks . 

That's  on  Lamo  page  8  of  his  charts. 

PFC  Manning  was  an  anarchist  whose  agenda 
was  made  abundantly  clear  almost  immediately  after  he 
deployed  to  Iraq.     He  was  not  naive. 

Each  time  he  downloaded  and  transmitted 
closely— held  information  he  made  deliberate  decisions 
to  break  ranks  with  his  nation  throwing  all  his 
training  and  experience  aside  and  releasing  that 
information  to  the  world.

He  used  his  access  to  classified  networks 
that  Julian  Assange  claimed  held  the  alleged  covert 
activities  of  state  Intelligence  agencies  and  made 
those  secrets  overt  fact  for  the  world  to  view,   all  the 
while  knowing  the  world  Included  progressive  and 
technologically  savvy  enemies  that  used  any  US 
Government  Information  against  our  nation. 

Your  Honor,   In  the  Assange  chats,  page  5, 
page  5,   PFC  Manning  boasts  on  his  knowledge  that,  "the 
more  the  Government  controls  Information,   the  harder 
the  Government  tries,   the  more  violently  the 
Information  wants  to  get  out." 

Your  Honor,   the  Information  did  not  just 
ooze  from  the  SIPRNET  onto  the  World  Wide  Web  for  the 
enemy  to  access,  but  was  the  precise  outcome  that  PFC 
Manning  desired  when  he  took  the  deliberate  steps  to 
disclose  over  700,000  docioments  by  moving  that 
Information  one  disk  at  a  time  from  SIPRNET  to  his 
personal  Mac  bridging  that  air  gap . 

Your  Honor,   rather  than  focusing  on  his  war 
fighting  mission,  he  made  the  decision  to  disclose  the

700,000  from  SIPRNET  knowing  that  once  WikiLeaks 
received  the  information  they  would  release  it  for  the 
world  to  access  and  he  knew  the  world  included  the 
enemies  of  the  United  States . 

He  was  not  a  naive  or  wellOintentioned 

soldier . 

Your  Honor,   a  well-intentioned  soldier  does 
not  claim  that:      "The  State  Department  fucked  itself. 
Placed  voliomes  and  voliomes  of  information  in  a  single 
spot  with  no  security . " 

Lamo  chats.  Your  Honor,  page  41. 

Or,  have  a  conversation  recognizing  that 
the  only  people  you  trust  can  fuck  you,  info— wise  at 
least . 

Lamo  chats.  Your  Honor,  page  41. 

This  recognition  of  system  weaknesses  and 
the  active  and  deliberate  exploitation  of  those 
weaknesses  are  not  the  acts  of  the  naive  and 
well-intentioned  soldier,   but  one  who  acts  in  a 
calculated  manner  and  for  his  own  purposes .

Honor,   throughout  his  entire  endeavor  was  that  despite 
admitting  to  his  crimes  and  multiple  chats,  making 
admissions  of  e— mails,   keeping  trophies  of  his  handy 
work  and  not  forensically  wiping  his  machine  daily,  he 
actually  thought  he  would  get  away  with  what  he  did  and 
he  wouldn ' t  get  caught . 

PFC  Manning  is  a  United  States  Army 
intelligence  analyst  that  the  United  States  trained  and 
trusted  to  use  multiple  intelligence  systems  to  provide 
real  time  information  to  leaders  on  the  battlefield  and 
he  used  that  training  to  defy  our  trust  and 
indiscriminately  and  systematically  harvested  over 
700,000  docTunents  from  the  SIPRNET  during  a  time  of  war 
and  while  deployed  in  Iraq  in  support  of  that  war. 

Showing  no  loyalty  to  this  nation,  PFC 
Manning  knowingly  gave  the  enemies  of  the  United  States 
unfettered  access  to  these  Government  documents  and  we 
now  know  today.   Your  Honor,   as  part  of  this  court 
martial  that  at  least  two  enemies,   at  least  two  enemies

own  common  sense  knowledge  of  hiiman  nature  and  the  ways

PFC  Manning's  own  words  in  his  chats  that  you  will  find 
him  guilty  beyond  a  reasonable  doTjbt  of  all  the  charges 
and  their  specifications. 

Your  Honor,   PFC  Manning  was  not  a  humanist; 
he  was  a  hacker.     A  hacker  who  described  his  fellow 
soldiers  as  dikes,   a  bunch  of  hyper— masculine,

war  effort.     And,   Your  Honor,    he  was  not  a
