Pushpalatha  and  Mallaiah  (2009)  executed  a  study  named  “Use  of  Information  Resources  in  Chemistry: 
A  Study  of  Mangalore  University  Library”  to  know  the  users’  opinions  about  the  adequacy  of  library  resources.  It  was 
found  that  the  majority  of  the  users  was  visiting  libraries  to  borrow  books  followed  by  consulting  the  periodicals.

University  library  by  students  under  title  “Use  of  Text  Book  Section  in  Andhra  University  Library:  A  Case  Study”.  The 
survey  revealed  that  most  of  users  visited  library  to  use  textbooks  and  very  few  to  spend  leisure  time.  Feldman  (2000)

district.  It  was  titled  “Use  of  Gram  Panchayat  Libraries  in  Gulbarga  District:  A  Study”.  In  addition  to  building  up  the 
functionality  and  sound  libraries,  the  findings  also  emphasized  on  the  user  education  programs  for  their  optimum 
utilization.

SUGGESTIONS 

•  Sufficient  grant  should  be  allocated  by  Government  for  the  development  and  improvement  of  the  collection 
development. 

•  The  library  should  investigate  to  find  out  a  strong  and  weak  area  of  the  collection.  The  library  must  take  a  clear 
policy  to  select  a  document. 

•  Immediately  internet  facility  for  users  should  be  introduced. 

•  Reference  book,  magazine,  textbook,  career  guidance  documents  should  be  increased  from  time  to  time.
