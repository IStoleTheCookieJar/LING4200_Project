our own conclusions! 

In Beijing we visited BY1PK and, as this station 
is in the national capital, the fact that it seems 
the best equipped is no coincidence. The station is 
on the top floor of a four story building with the _ 
antennae on the roof. here are two HF stations: : 
with associated beams.. one - “Station is dedicated to 
packet. A satellite station (Mode B) and the 2 
meter repeater (BRIPK) are also installed. 

The 6m equipment consists of a T8-670 feeding a 
manually rotatable 6-element yagi about 3 meters 
above the roof. It was noted that when the beam is

not aware of the 50.110 calling frequency or the 
28.885 liason frequency. I did note in the 6m log- 
book contacts with 3D2P0 and VK8ZLX on July 26. 

About 150km. further east we visited BY482 in 
Suzhou where Kang, BZ4SAA, is the Director. Kang is 
well known in VK as he has supplied most of us with 
China on 6m. He has acquired some nice equipment 
for the club: an FT-ONE was feeding a TL-922 linear 
on HF; a Henry 2K4 linear and a 5 KVA mains power 


stabilizer looked very impressive. The station also 


has a small HF rig which has been used on DXpedi- 
tions. A TS-600 or an FT-726 and a 5 element yagi 
are used on 6m and Kang is expecting, from a JA8 
friend, a 500 watt amplifier due next year. QSL'ing 
may be av‘little slow from this «station .as Kang 
explained: that the post office ‘is quite a distance 
away, 80 they only clear. it once per. month. 
for) Kang .go to Wu Zhi Yuan, P.O.Box-. 51, 
China.;..The phone number. is 221063. 

, 80 ithe club is the center of amateur radio activ- 
ity in China and it is pleasing to note the emphasis 
on getting the young people involved. Actually, the 
clubs. are under the control of the "Chinese Radio 
Sports Association" (CRSA) with the club Directors 
being paid by, and the clubs operating within, a 
budget provided by the CRSA. Nevertheless, most 
Glub equipment has apparently been donated by Japa- 
nese sources, and a little from American sources. 

Regarding the accessibility of China on 6m, 
particularly. from North America and a lot of the 
Pacific, I was thinking that the area around. Guang- 
zhou , (Canton) could be the most practical. ‘This 
area as well as being fairly well south, is close to 
the well established paths to Hong Kong and Manila. 
However, from what I could learn, there is no 6m 
activity and, indeed, no club activity, in that 
area. Possibly this could be followed up with some 
of the V86 amateurs, some of whom may have contacts 
in. that area. 


Suzhou, 


{Editor's comments: I believe no contacts have 
yet been made on 6m between China and any of the 50 
States or Canada. This is mostly because of inac- 
tivity at the right times, rather than lack of 
propagation. All of China is well-situated for 6m 
DX in general, as the geomagnetic equator runs about 
10 degrees north of the geodetic equator in those 
longitudes. 

For North Americans, the great-circle path would 
be shortest to the northeast sector of China, and to 
Mongolia. These distances are similar to those for 
Guam, southern Japan, and Korea. By contrast, 
Manila, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and southeastern China 
are all considerably farther away, so the propaga- 
tion’-is less likely to those areas via short path. 
However, long path is a real possibility in the 
period around 1400-1900z beaming southeast from the 
US. Watch 49.73-.77 MHz for video carriers which 
should be conspicuous during any kind of 6m opening 
to'the Orient. 

Here are some Chinese callsigns which have been 
reported active on 6m at least once during Cycle 22: 
BYLPK, BZLFB, BZ1FK, BZlWH, BY4AA, BY4RB, BZ4AA, 
BZ4CBC, BZ4COP, BZ4DAE, BZ4DDL, B2Z4SAA,  BYSRA, 
BYSRB, BY5TS, BT5TS, BY5TS, and BZ58W. The BY4RB 
QSL address is P.0.Box 413, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 
China. Another China tour narrative, by KM2X, 
appeared in the September QST on pages 14-17.]

NEW 6-METER BAND PLAN IN U.S. 


As a result of the FCC's action extending the re- 
peater subband down to 51 MHz last year, the ARRL

This plan was adopted by the ARRL Board

agenda, and without participation by weak-signal 
operators) in July, and published in September QST.

Note that FM is now sanctioned down to 50.3, 

formerly held to 51.1 and*above. Also note that the 
52 Miz Pacific [VK) DX window has been dropped, and 
that the 51 MHz (ZL) window covers 51.0 to 51.1. 
This conflicts with the current practice of ZL 
DXerf, who have been using 51.11 as their primary 
calling frequency. The obvious solution to this 
conflict is for ARRL to change the band plan, but it 
might make more sense to shift the (rare) 2L DX 
operations to below 51.1, where the probability of 
ionospheric propagation would be slightly higher. 


PROPAGATION HIGHLIGHTS for 1991 August 26 to September 30 


LONG PATHS: Several weeks ahead of expectations, 
long-path propagation showed up prior to the equi- 
nox. The festivities began on September 18 in the 
period 0927-1019z with the Cyprus and Greece beacons 
being heard, and I2ADN/IA5 in the Tuscan archipelago 
(JN43) being worked, by your editor via the Antarc- 
tic. On the 22nd between 2211 and 0020, the 9L1 
beacon was heard on the L-P via North America into 
central and southern Queensland. The same path 
opened again on the 23rd from 2212 to 2242, and on 
the 24th from 2251 to 2400. Earlier on the 24th, 
JAl-4 had L-P via Africa to YV4AB/b, HI8A, and KP4; 
N7JJ8/5 in Louisiana copied a JR6 at 1447 during 
this opening. Also on the 24th, the JA-9H L-P 
pipeline via South America opened around 2120-2323. 
That recurred on the 28th at about 2336-2400, and on 
the 29th at 2230-2320 the JA's had 2B2E0 and 9H5EE. 


ANTIPODAL PATHS: The South America-to-Far East 
route has opened at least thrice. On Setember 8 at 
0150-0240, Japan worked PY, LU, and CE. On the 23rd 
at 2325-30 Japan worked PY. Then on the 28>29th at 
2350-0040 PY5's worked JA and VS6 (indeed during 
that period PY5CC casually made 6m WAC in less than 
an hour---to which K6QXY commented: "disgusting!"). 


SHORT PATHS: Worldwide, the paths which are closest 
to being straight north-south are now opening almost 
daily. Examples include JA-to-VK, W5-LU/PY, and 
Europe-to-Africa & South America. Some of: this is 
what we've grown accustomed to calling F2, and some 
is TEP; many openings of both types involve Es 
extensions. The VHF world lacks clear definitions 
of F2 and TEP; sometimes one mode metamorphoses 
seamlessly into the other, as on September 17 when 
3D2PO0 copied K6FV/b almost continuously from 0041 
past 0800! The old rule that TEP always has a 
flutter effect is clearly wrong, as anyone in the 
tropics can testify (at least on 6m), as is the rule 
that TEP paths must cross the geomagnetic equator. 
But labels needn't overly concern us; a new catch is 
welcomed regardless of how it propagates. Another 
old rule that needs to be tossed out is that (for 
mid-latitude stations) the band is useless for long- 
haul DX after sundown. Recent propagation'from the 
south Pacific into W5, for example, has been worked 
as late as 0315z, long past local sunset in W5, and 
I believe it can occur even later than that. . 

The closely-watched North America-to-south Pacif- 
ic path has been open almost daily since late Au- 
gust. Usually this involves some of W5-6-7-XE2 into 
some of FO-2K1-3D2-Z2L-FK-VK4-VK2. The earliest time 
for the overall path was 1925 (it may get earlier 
in October), and the latest was 1022! On two 
occasions it extended east of the Mississippi River. 
The first was mentioned in the previous Bulletin, 


3 


on 6m. 


but here it is in the words of a participant: 

"I'd like to réport working my best DX ever on 6m. | 
On August ::26,°1991 at 01282 from my FM18 QTH ine 
Maryland. I worked VK4BRG»in.QG48 on ‘-50.120:: MHz. 
The mode of. propagation appeared to be F2: with we 
layer enhancement for the final hop(s):.’ Ron’: VK4BRG} 
was being heard in the Washington, DC area ‘about 15: 
minutes before I even got on. Everybody was calling 
but no one was having any luck. When I..got into the’! 
pileup I decided to see if Ron was monitoring 28885." 
Fortunately he was, and we set up a calling sequence » 
I was running about 200w CW and VK4BRG © was;:: 
on SSB. We successfully exchanged calls and reports’! 
on the first try! What a thrill!!"---Rich K1HTV/3..« 

The other occasion of this sort was on September 4 
when 3D2PO0 was heard in Ohio, Virginia, and North* 
Carolina (at least) around 0115-0141. Unfortunate- 
ly, Ian cannot listen on both bands simultaneously: 
and the kind of liaison described above by Rich. was’ 
not possible. So the W5's and 6's, 1-2 hops ‘closer 
and louder, made all the contacts with 3D2P0 (of: 
course that situation is reversed with trans-' 
Atlantic DX). ams tT 

The season's first reported VK-Europe opening. 
took place on September 21 at 0755 when VK4FP. in. 
Townsville worked IK2GS0. A bigger opening occurred 
on the 28th, starting with a VK4FP-DL7QY contact. at. 
0715, followed by VK8ZLX to PA3EUI at 0749. Then 
from 0910-1045 on the same day, VK4FP worked one F, 
one DF, and two ON stations. 

The Japan-to-Africa short-path produced ,, FR5SIX/b 
into JA6 from 0540 to 0830 on August 29, followed ar 
few hours later by 7Q7RM into JR6WPT at 1121. | On; 
September 8, V51VHF/b was copied in JR6 at 1140-, 
1205. FRSSIX/b was into JA4/6 on the llth at 0635- 
0800, and there is an uncertain report of V51VHF/b 
into JR6 again at 1100-1300 on that date. On _ the. 
24th at 1630, 9J2HN was into JR6. And on the 29th 
at 0700, 7Q7RM was reported into Japan again. 
Nearby in the Philippines, KG6UH/DU1 had his first 
ZD8VHF/b reception of the season on the l6th at 
1545-1615, and again on the 29th around 1500. 


The last paths to open as the season progresses: 
are the east-west high-latitude ones. So as yet,, 
nothing on 6m has taken place between Asia and North, 
America, or Europe to Asia or North America, and: 
Alaska is still in the "black hole." But the video, 
indicators (48.25 and 49.75) are beginning to show; 
up on all three of those paths. The intermediate- 
latitude Hawaii to 2D8-FY7-W4-5-6-7 and to JA-VS6, 
paths are’ showing results in the final days of 
September, initially via sidescatter off the equato-. 
rial zone, then straightening and strengthening. In 
the southern hemisphere, similar paths have opened 
such as PY5/2P6 to 286 and to FO5. 


NEWS OF OCEANIA 


Aostralian Beacons: The Darwin A.R.C. sent current 
details on their beacons. All use the same equip- 
ment (25 watts of cw to verticals 15 meters above 
ground), and message: "VKOVF QTH DARWIN PH57 Kk." 
A period (.-.-.-) will be added if there is a prob- 
lem with any of the beacons. Nominal frequencies 
are: 28.268 (actual zero-beat is 28.2690), 50.056 
(actual zero-beat is 50.0572), 144.480, and 432.480 
MHz. Reports go to Henry Andersson VK8HA, Box 619, 
Humpty Doo, N.T. 0836, Australia (which is also the 
VK8 QSL bureau address). ‘These beacons, at least 
the 10m and 6m ones, get out very nicely and the 6m 
one has been the most reliable indicator of VK 
propagation at my QTH. Meanwhile, Ron VK4BRG is 
working on a low-power beacon for central Queens- 
land. The frequency will tentatively be 50.077. 
And Moss VK7IK reports that he has secured an allo- 
cation for 50.057 for his new VK7RSB beacon. ‘This 
frequency if followed literally would be just 200 
Hertz lower than VK8VF/b, an undesirable situation. 
Moss will try to change the allocation to 50.059, 
although about 400 Hertz lower than that would be 
best (thus bisecting the gap between the Darwin and 
Brazil beacons). It will operate with 100 watts 
into 6 elements aimed northeast, when Moss is not 
otherwise using 6m. The message will be "VVV DE 
VK7RSB QE37" repeated twice followed by a 10-20 
second pause. The Australian government is said to 
be establishing the 50.050-.060 sector as beacon- 


Specific, but some VK DXers are requesting a wider 
sector. 
Brunei: Brian O'Connor V85EB (from VK2) has been 


active on HF for several months. On September a2; 
around 1130z, he got on 6m with an F?T690R, and 
worked VK4JH and numerous JA's. ‘Tnx KG6DX. A later 
report states that VJ5EB was to go QRT about Septem- 
ber 27. ‘Tnx ZLAAAA. 


Fiji: Ian 3D2P0, for whose QSLs many have been 
patiently waiting, has arranged with VK30T to be his 
manager tor all contacts beginning September 4. Ian 
says he will attempt to clear the backlog of previ- 
ous QSL requests as soon as possible. He recently 
upgraded to an 1(726, a converted ‘L922 amplifier 
driven with a brick, and a 6-element yagi-uda on a 
5.3 meter boom, 50 he should now have moze ERP than 
any other south Pacific islander. He may pick up a 
T-E Systems 400w amp in October. Ian is very eager- 
ly watching the short path to Europe around 0700- 
1100z las are we all}; the only previous 6m contact 
between Fiji and Rurope was 3D2RR to Greece, but 
Ian's location in Lautoka has a lower horizon toward 
Europe than 3D2ER's in Suva. Jan has also con- 
structed a 3-element beam for 28885 liaison. Anoth- 
er operator is now active: Aisea Aisake, JD2AA, Box 


4 x 


4696, Lautoka, using a Yaesu transverter and 4 
elements. ‘The Fijians alert each other via landline 
about hot 6m DX, so a significant pileup of 3D2's 
can be expected if Ruropeans are heard. As with 
most Pacific DXers, Fijian operation usually starts 
on 50.110 and then, if appropriate, moves elsewhere 
within the 50.100-.130 sector. A DXpedition has 
just been announced for "3D2," presumably Fiji 
rather than Conway or Rotuma, on October 4-9. ‘The 
operators will be JIINJC, JJIARB, JNIBMX, and 
JNIGAG, and operation will be on 80m through 6m. 
Tnx JALVOK. 


Fijian Beacon: The 3D2FJ beacon will be hand-car- 
ried to Fiji by Ian himself, arriving around October 
12. It was displayed, along with the CU3 beacon, at 
WOJKV's 6m party on September 21. Hats off to Pat 
Hunn N4LTA for the handiwork! 


Hawaiian Beacons: The KH6HI beacon was shut down 
temporarily on about September 7 until further 
notice. ‘This beacon has been maintained by KH6HH, 
but Ken no longer has access to the mountaintop 
site. The (expletive deleted) KH6HME beacon contin- 
ues on 50.0617 MHz zero beat. Its antenna is a 
sloping wire dipole, not a quad as earlier listed. 


Kermadec Islands: Word was received on the HF nets 
that the callsign 2L8GBS has been issued to an 
operator for use at the Kermadecs. He was expected 
to arrive sometime in September, when the weather 
Station staff will be changed. ZLIANJ and your 
editor are hoping for information so that somehow. a 
6m rig can be included in this operation, but it 
doesn't seem likely at this point. An 1C575H is on 
hand at KH6JEB for use on Pacific island DXpedi- 
tions. Readers may recall that the Kermadecs are 
now a restricted nature preserve; 2L2TPY was denied 
access for a 6m DXpedition there last year. 


Lord Howe and Morfolk Islands: VK9YQS has completed 
his stay on Norfolk, where he only managed contacts 
with VK and ZL. He will now shift to Lord Howe for 
3 months, but is unsure whether his situation will 
permit much operating on 6m. ‘Tnx VK30T. 


Micronesia: 63YL is on from Yap, and will be there 
for some 2 years. He is active on HF (esp. 21260) 
and if hoping to put together a 6m station. QSL 
info is P.0.Box 687, Yap, P.3.M. 96943. ‘Tnx ZL4AAA. 


Morth Cook Islands: Too late for last issue, the 
news was been received from many sources that Mako 
JALOEM was to be QRV on 6m from beautiful Manihiki 
atoll (grid AH99) from September 24 to October 4. 
The callsign was 2K1XP, and a 5-element beam was 
used; ‘ig unknown. It is believed that he worked 
JA, W6, VI3A'T, KH6, KG6DX, and VK4. QSLs go to his 


rte te, 


home call. He also operated at a stopover in Raro- 
tonga (South Cooks) on Sept. 19-22, and October 5-8. 


Papua-New Guinea Beacon News: On September 28, Paul 
P29PL put his beacon on the air on its new low-end 
frequency, and it was immediately copied in KH6 and 


V73. The zero-beat is 50.019.9, with a bit of 
chirp. The message is simply "P29BPL" in fast cw. 
Paul is temporarily running it from his home, so ~ 


operation will be intermittent until he has time to 
move it to a remote site. 


NEWS OF ASIA 


Hong Kong: Steve VS6XMQ recently completed the

COMMENTS ON WORLD DX RECORDS 


In Six News #30 there is a banner headline, ‘New 
World Record,’ accompanied by an article describing 
a Q80 on 1991 April 29 15362 between GM3WOJ and 
CX8BE. Quoting the last sentence, ‘Our Q80 was 
probably due to F2 or TE propagation carrying the 
CX8BE signals to the Auroral curtain, but as both 


Signals were tone-A, with no direct path signal [at 
the Scotland end], I claim this as a new distance 
record for Auroral working.’ This is an interesting 
propagation report, but it raises several points. 

First of all, as 80-90% of the path was spanned 
by ordinary, non-auroral propagation, it is quite a 
stretch to label the entire event an auroral one. 
By this reasoning, one could win a marathon by 
hitching a ride 90% of the way, then getting out and 
running to the finish line. Secondly, similar 6m 
DX events have occurred previously elsewhere. Just 
a few months ago, some 6m contacts were made between 
Alaska and Australia, with the same auroral link on 
the northern end, at a distance considerably in 
excess of the GM-CX path. It caused some interest, 
but nobody was heard to proclaim a World Record. 

Let me take this opportunity to discuss World 
Distance Records in general. By the time 6m was a 
decade old, it was clear that propagation could 
easily span the distance between stations at each 
others' antipodes. As discussed in  K.Davies' 
"ITonospheric Radio Propagation," there is a focuss- 


. ing effect at the antipodes, and this is being con- 


firmed by amateur work at 50 MHz. Starting with a 
QSO between JA6FR and LUIMA on 1956 March 24, antip- 
odal paths have been worked thousands of times. 
Thus, the limiting factor for the (short-path) World 
6m Distance Record is not propagation, but the 
random luck of having someone exactly on the oppo- 
site side of the planet. The world short-path 
record exists between JA-HL and LU-CX simply because 
that happens to be where two regions of high-density 
6m activity are situated opposite each other. 

For these reasons, the competition for 6m short- 
path records has ceased, just as surely as on HP. 
Instead, let us turn our attention to pushing sig- 
nals beyond the antipodes, i.e., long-path. This is 
not only a wide-open race, but can also be very 
revealing of 6m propagation modes (more on that in 
the future). It is the only correct way to measure 
a path which demonstrably exists. Think of the 
marathon analogy again. Do we measure the mara- 
thon's length as the crow flies or do we measure it 
on the actual route taken by the runner? Well, 
let's do the same with 6m DX, at least in the cases 
where the path is a straight great-circle one, as 
Clearly indicated by antenna bearings at both ends. 
Additional proof can be taken from time-of-day 
information, which, on 6m, is showing itself to be 
rather tightly constrained. In contrast to HF, 
round-the-world echoes, or simultaneous long- and 
short-path propagation, are not seen on 6m. Perhaps 
the most reasonable approach for the record-keepers 
would be to satisfy everyone by keeping both kinds 
of records, 


BEACON NOTES Part 1 


Ever since the 1940's, 6m DXers have come to rely 
on beacons. Each passing year brings a few more 
beacon startups around the world. 

Occasionally we hear of a DXer who doesn't like 
beacons. One reason given is that they don't want 
to hear a beacon in a country they haven't worked, 
if their CQs don't bring an immediate response from 
that country. Let's take the FY7THF beacon as an 
example. Now it's true that there is hardly any 6m 
amateur activity from FY, 50 it is not surprising 
that we hear that beacon often without being able to 
work French Guiana. However, with 6m propagation 
footprints being larqe at times, the FY? beacon 
makes an excellent indicator for adjoining countries 
which may have more ham activity, but no beacon. 
Secondly, we can use the FY? beacon as an intermedi- 
ate waypoint on a more lengthy path. ‘Thirdly, the 
dedicated DXer can keep a log of dates and times 
when the beacon is heard, and put this log to qood 
use a5 a predictive tool whenever there is a DXpedi- 
tion to, or new operator in, that region. 

For me personally, FY/THF/b is the 
from the Americas that I have ever copied via long 
path. Rather than complaining about not having made 
any contacts during those openings, I rejoice in the 
knowledge that the path exists. Armed with that 
knowledge, I will put extra effort into wringing out 
the path, which will surely pay off in the long run. 

The other objection occasionally heard to the 
proliferation of beacons is that they remove some of 
the mystery of the band. This is a strange view; 
the 6m band is the only amateur allocation that was 
created specifically for the study of ionospheric 
propagation (see QST 1945 August, page 12). And 
despite our best efforts, there is no prospect that, 
within our lifetimes, 6m propagation prediction will 
become cut-and-dried as it is at HF. But if someone 
wants to reduce his information about propagation, 
he is free to avoid listening below 50.095. 

The choice of location, frequency, and other 


parameters for a beacon, if poorly made, can be 
detrimental. As the worldwide number cf beacons 
increases, the need for coordination becomes more 


acute. In the discussion of beacons which took 
place at W6JKV's party, several people expressed 
Concern about the chaotic beacon situation in some 
parts of the world. If anyone can come up with a 
workable proposal to tackle this problem, and will 
volunteer to accept the responsibility to make it 
happen, I will gladly offer whatever support I can. 


Location: Probably the worst problem is when some- 
one, rarely a real 6m DXer, decides, withiut consul- 
tation, to run a beacon without consideration of 
nearby 6m listeners. If not carefully ciordinated, 
such action can actually be deleteriois to the

only signal 


global study of propagation. For example, in the 
pristine RF environment on this island of Hawaii, 
there are two Six Maniacs who are among the few in 
the world who monitor 6m closely on a _ full-time 
basis; we don't iniss much. Such a location should 
be the last place to put a beacon on the air. In 
1989, I was able to continuously run a sweeping 
receiver from the DX window right down to the bottom 
of the band. Any signal picked up in that sweep was 
ipso facto a DX signal. With that method I routine- 
ly caught openings of less than 5 minutes’ duration. 
Then a local, experienced 144-&-up tropo DXer but 
one with no knowledge of 6m or the ionosphere, 
decided that what's good tor 144~é-up must also be 
good for 6m. So he set up a surplus transmitter as 
a beacon, and it's been on the air for 2 years now, 
Causing unwanted QRM to this writer (4 miles away), 
despite diplomatic approaches to the operator. This 
is a unusually acute situation, but it is not 
unique, as I have also heard stories of other unco- 
ordinated 6m beacons which QRM serious listeners. 


Mode: Both CW and FSK have their 
pending on the situation. CW uses less spectrum, is 
easier to implement, has lower power consumption, 
and is familiar to all listeners. FSK stands out 
Slightly more in noise, makes it more obvious that 
it is a beacon and not an operator, and probably is 
less objectionable (and identifiable) in 'TVI/RFI 
Situations. It appears that FSK is favored more in 
Europe, while CW is favored more on the remaining 
J8% of the planet. It FSK is chosen, the spacing 
needs to be selected carefully: too narrow (9L1US) 
is difficult to aurally decipher; too wide 
(VKARBM/RIK) and it wastes spectrum and causes 
confusion. I would sugyest 300 fz as a compromise. 


advantages, de- 


Message: Some beacons transmit "everything but the 
operator's birthdate," and you have to wait quite 
awhile to hear the callsign. While this approach 
may have its merits on HF where the band is open all 
day, 6m DXers do not usually have the luxury of 
lingering that long. ‘Thanks to KA3B's detailed 
beacon lists, we can easily look up the particulars 
if we want them. $80 the qeneral view is that the 
message should contain, at most, the callsign and 
the grid locator. A string of V's and the like just 
forces the listener to wait longer. In cases where 
the beacon is solar-powered, it may be necessary to 
reduce the overall duty cycle, and this can be done 
with a string of spaced dots, as done by WD72/b. 


Power: We've all experienced openings where a watt 
into a wet noodle will work fine. So the question 
becomes one of marginal paths. It is my . opinion 


that about 1000 watts RRP is the minimuw for the. 


average ‘ong-distance P-layer scatter path on 6m, 
Occasionaily it gets more efficient than that, 


perhaps being usable down to about the 100w ERP 
point. Below that level, and all beacons are oper- 
ated below it, the difference between 5 and 50 watts 
ERP may add 20% to the amount of observable propaga- 
tion. ZP5AA/b, with 5 watts ERP, has been repeated- 
ly heard via antipodal and long-path. XE2HWB/b with 
just over 1 watt has been reported on 1-hop E, at 89 
levels. Still, I should add that some DXperts feel 
that 50-100 watt levels should be mandatory, and 
this space is available for a rebuttal. 


Antenna: I believe that beacons should be omnidi- 
rectional in the horizontal plane. 6m openings 
occur in all directions, often in more than one at a 
time, and we never know which azimuth will produce 
the next hot catch. A beam allows close inspection 
of one path, but only at the expense of all other 
paths. Does anyone outside of Europe feel that 
UL8GCC/b is doing the right thing by beaming north- 
west? The other factor is polarization; if local 
QRM is an issue, it may be worth using a vertical 
even though verticals are widely held to be somewhat 
less effective than horizontals for 6m F2. ‘The 
bottom line is that local listeners' RF reception 
should take priority over beacon effectiveness. 


Frequency: There are now roughly a hundred 6m _ bea- 
cons worldwide, and most of them are in the sector 
50.005-.087. This means the spectral density is 
tighter than one beacon per kHz, and thus, if bea- 
cons were equally spaced, the accuracy and stability 
of their frequency specification must be better than 
500 Hz if they are to avoid transmitting atop each 
other. If 2L4AAA's proposal for 100 new "smart" 
beacons comes to fruition, then the frequency toler- 
ance will need to be reduced to about 200 Hz, It 
will also be helpful if future beacon circuits 
include a trimmer so that a crystal can be tweaked 
onto a specified frequency. Early this year, the 
Radio Club Paraguayo volunteered to operate a 6m 
beacon, and sought advice as to the best frequency. 
Careful consideration produced the recommendation of 
50.0245 MHz, and N4LTA began construction. | Mean- 
while, with no coordination, a new Venezuelan beacon 
appeared, nominally on 50.025. ZP5AA/b, when it 
Commenced operation, turned out to be on 50.0251; 
luckily YV4AB/b also turned out to be 600 Hertz 
higher than its nominal frequency. 

This raises the issue of precision frequency 
measurement. Most amateur transceivers read fre- 
quency directly in the $3B, AM, and FM modes. But 
in CW mode, the display is offset by 500-1000 Hertz 
in the receive state (for more on this, see W12's 
two-part article "What Your Frequency Display Really 
Tells You" in August and September QST). The cor- 
rect way to measure beacon frequencies with the rig 
in CW mode is to match the signal's pitch /to the 
pitch of your sidetone. Or you can switch to 33B 


9 


mode, tune for zero beat, and read the frequency. 
Either way, the result will be the same as if we 
connected a frequency counter directly to the beacon 
transmitter. The wrong way is to tune for zero beat 
in the CW mode. ‘The frequency display may not be 
perfectly accurate, of course; for mine I have made 
a correction table using an external counter. 

The next step is to unify the nominal frequency 
of beacons with the actual frequency. In some cases 
this has already been done: FOSDR/b is nominally and 
actually on 50.0500, for example. Other beacons are 
far off the mark: JA2IGY/b is nominally on 50.012 
and actually on 50.0100, and in Australia, as men- 


tioned in the News section, the 1.2 kHz error of the 


Darwin beacon is presenting a problen. 

The first thing 1 do when hearing a beacon for 
the first time is to record the exact frequency. 
Then on future occasions I know exactly where to 
park the VFO (with an appropriate offset to yield my 
favorite pitch), and listen deep into the noise for 
any trace of that beacon. Of course, a few beacons 
drift more than 100 Hertz, so it is useful to re- 


-measure them from time to time until we find the 


highest and lowest frequency extremes. The nominal 
frequency should be the center of the drift range. 

If a few key operators around the world will take 
a few seconds to measure the frequency of each 
beacon they hear and send them to me, we can quickly 
build a complete database. This in turn can be used 
to recommend frequencies for new beacons. Here, as 
a beginning, is my own list of recent (1991) meas- 
urements. In the case of FSK beacons, I measure the 
lower component. An asterisk means operation is 
known to be less than continuous.

Using the 10-meter Liaison Frequency 

26885 kHz is the global 6m “intercom." Its 
primary purpose is for announcements of current 6m 
propagation and DX activity. There is no need to 
call any specific station--~it is not a net with an 
emcee-~-just grab the mic and blurt out your call- 
Sign and your information. Emulate Peter's style: 
"This is PY5CC reporting 5V7JG on 50.105 ssb." Keep 
in mind that some 6m DXers listen but cannot trans- 
mit here, and others are "listening from a 
distance," so assume your announcements are useful 
even if unacknowledged. 

For non-report types of traffic, especially 
regional chats, please QSY up or down. And if you 
must chat right on 28885, please at least use VOX so 
that you can be broken for hot propagation flashes. 

If you have a question that can be answered by 
more than one person on the frequincy, such as the 
ever-popular "what'd I iniss today, ' don't call NI6E; 
[ am using photovoltaics and must conserve battery 
power for essential traffic. It would be nice if 
more of the listeners would take some responsibility 
for answering questions and relaying significant 
announcements (to fill in the 10m ikip zones), not 
just when relays are recuested. Also, nobedy ought 
to hesitate in answering B2Z4SAA 0: other rare D¥X 
stations if they show up, and verbally "hold their 
hand" for a couple of minutes to keep them motivat- 
ed, even if you've already worked them on 6m; some- 
one will return the favor with a country you need. 

Finally, set yourseli up to monitor both 6m and 
28885 simultaneously. So often we hear someone make 
an announcement on 28885, then disappear to 6m, 
missing out on major traffic like “you're being 
heard in Europe." Get a separate receivir; the low- 
cost l0m rigs are fine for this application. Stereo 
headphones will let you keep track of beth at once.

The 6~Meter Party at Jim Treybig's 
On September 21, I had the pleasure to meet some of 
you at the 6-Meter Barbecue and DX Party at the home 
of Jim ‘Treybig, WOJKV, in Los Altos Hills, Calitor- 
nla. Guests included a veritable who's-who of 
western US 6m DXers, quite a diverse and interesting 
group. Lots of time was spent in far-reaching 
informal hobnobbing about every 6m subject under 
(and on) the sun. ODXpedition announcements were 
made, check-ins were made on 28885, sumptious meals 
and exotic northern California beverages were con- 
sumed, and, of course, the DX Window was monitored 
(but how did we did miss that VK4 opening?). 

-In the evening, Some talks were given, with Joel 
N6AMG moderating. ‘The main feature was a discussion 
of TRP by Victor K6FV, with emphasis on the Califor- 
nia~to-south Pacific path. A spirited discussion of 
the future of Gm beacons was followed by a presenta 
tion of Kerrville, Texas as the site of a VHF IJono- 
spheric Propagation Symposium and CSVHF Conference 
next year on Ju-y 16-19. We watched videos of N6CA 
and friends moutaintopping arvund Baja California. 
A Yeal highligh: was the "tales of the one that got 
awoy" session at bedtime. My thanks to Jimny, Joel, 
Bob, and all the other participants who made this 
party so enjoyable and productive, and for making it 
possible for ine to attend. 


Publishing assistance requesied. Hilo, Hawaii is 
turing out to be a poor place to print a publica- 
tiop, with a bid mix of high cost and low quality. 
Accardingly, I request that cone or more readers on 
the mainland ake on the reproduction and circula- 
tion. of this Bulletin. ! will continue as 
writer/editor, and could transfer manuscripts either 
on tloppy disk (3.5", Wordstar 5.5) or camera-ready. 
Please contact me ASAP if you can help. Mahalo!
