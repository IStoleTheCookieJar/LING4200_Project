on  said  land,  necessary  or  useful  in  Lessee's  operations  in  exploring,  dnlling  for,  producing,  treating,  storing  and  transporting  minerals  produced 
from  the  land  covered  hereby  or  any  other  land  adjacent  thereto.  The  land  covered  hereby,  nerein  called  said  land,  is  located  in  the  County  of 
Tarrant,  State  of  Texas,  and  is  described  as  follows: 

0.158  acres,  more  or  less,  out  of  the  Tandy  K.  Martin  Survey,  Abstract  No.  A-1055,  and  being  Lot  71R  and  Block  3,  of  Stonybrooke 
South  Addition,  an  Addition  to  the  City  of  North  Richland  Hills,  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  according  to  Plat  thereof  recorded  in  Volume 
388-21 3,  Page  51 ,  of  the  Plat  Records,  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  and  being  those  same  lands  more  particularly  described  in  a  General 
Warranty  Deed  with  Vendor's  Lien  dated  April  26, 2000  from  Martha  L.  West,  a  single  person  to  William  Stan  Wylie,  husband  and 
Margaret  H.  Wylie,  wife  recorded  in  Volume  14317  Page  53,  Deed  Records,  Tarrant  County,  Texas  and  amendments  thereof,  including 
streets,  easements  and  alleyways  adjacent  thereto,  and  any  riparian  rights. 

This  is  a  non-development  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease,  whereby  Lessee,  its  successors  or  assigns,  shall  not  conduct  any  operations,  as  defined 
herein,  on  the  surface  of  said  lands.  However,  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  pool  or  unitize  said  lands,  or  part  thereof,  with  other  lands  to  comprise 
an  oil  and/or  gas  development  unit.  It  Is  the  intention  of  Lessor  to  allow  Lessee  to  explore  for  oil  and/or  gas  without  using  the  surface  of  Lessor  s 
land  for  any  operations.  This  clause  shall  take  precedence  over  any  references  to  surface  operations  contained  within  the  preprinted  portion  of  this 
lease. 

This  lease  also  covers  and  includes,  in  addition  to  that  above  described,  all  land,  if  any,  contiguous  or  adjacent  to  or  adjoining  the  land  above 
described  and  (a)  owned  or  claimed  by  Lessor  by  limitation,  prescription,  possession,  reversion,  after-acquired  title  or  unrecorded  instrument  or  (b) 
as  to  which  Lessor  has  a  preference  right  of  acquisition.  Lessor  agrees  to  execute  any  supplemental  instrument  requested  by  Lessee  for  a  more 
complete  or  accurate  description  of  said  land.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount  of  any  bonus  or  other  payment  hereunder,  said  land  shall 
be  deemed  to  contain  0.158  acres,  whether  actually  containing  more  or  less,  and  the  above  recital  of  acreage  in  any  tract  shall  be  deemed  to  be 
the  true  acreage  thereof.  Lessor  accepts  the  bonus  as  lump  sum  consideration  for  this  lease  and  all  rights  and  options  hereunder. 

2.  Unless  sooner  terminated  or  longer  kept  in  force  under  other  provisions  hereof,  this  lease  shall  remain  in  force  for  a  term  of  3  years 
from  the  date  hereof,  hereinafter  called  "primary  term,"  and  as  long  thereafter  as  operations,  as  hereinafter  defined,  are  conducted  upon  said  land 
with  no  cessation  for  more  than  ninety  (90)  consecutive  days. 

3.  As  royalty,  Lessee  covenants  and  agrees:  (a)  To  deliver  to  the  credit  of  Lessor,  in  the  pipe  line  to  which  Lessee  may  connect  its  wells,  the 
equal  25%  part  of  all  oil  produced  and  saved  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  or  from  time  to  time,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  to  pay  Lessor  the  average 
posted  market  price  of  such  25%  part  of  such  oil  at  the  wells  as  of  the  day  it  is  run  to  the  pipe  line  or  storage  tanks,  Lessor's  interest,  in  either 
case,  to  bear  25%  of  the  cost  of  treating  oil  to  render  it  marketable  pipe  line  oil;  (b)  To  pay  Lessor  on  gas  and  casinghead  gas  produced  from 
said  land  (1 )  when  sold  by  Lessee  25%  of  the  amount  realized  by  Lessee,  computed  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  or  (2)  when  used  by  Lessee  off 
said  land  or  in  the  manufacture  of  gasoline  or  other  products,  the  market  value,  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  of  25%  of  such  gas  and  casinghead  gas: 
(c)  To  pay  Lessor  on  all  other  minerals  mined  and  marketed  or  utilized  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  one-tenth  either  in  kind  or  value  at  the  well  or  mine  at 
Lessee's  election,  except  that  on  sulphur  mined  and  marketed  the  royalty  shail  be  one  dollar  ($1 .00)  per  long  ton.  If,  at  the  expiration  of  the 
primary  term  or  at  any  time  or  times  thereafter,  there  is  any  well  on  said  land  or  on  lands  with  which  said  land  or  any  portion  thereof  has  been 
pooled,  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas,  and  all  such  wells  are  shut-In,  this  lease  shall,  nevertheless,  continue  in  force  as  though  operations 
were  being  conducted  on  said  land  for  so  long  as  said  wells  are  shut-in,  and  thereafter  this  lease  may  be  continued  in  force  as  if  no  shut-in  had 
occurred,  lessee  covenants  and  agrees  to  use  reasonable  diligence  to  produce,  utilize,  or  market  the  minerals  capable  of  being  produced  from 
said  wens,  but  in  the  exercise  of  such  diligence,  Lessee  shall  nofbe  obligated  to  install  or  lurnish  facifities  other  than  well  facilities  and  ordinary  lease 
facilities  of  flow  lines,  separator,  and  lease  tank,  and  shall  not  be  required  to  settle  labor  trouble  or  to  market  gas  upon  terms  unacceptable  to 
Lessee.  If,  at  any  time  or  times  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  all  such  wells  are  shut-in  for  a  period  of  ninety  consecutive  days,  and 
during  such  time  there  are  no  operations  on  said  land,  then  at  or  before  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period,  Lessee  shall  pay  or  tender,  by 
check  or  draft  of  Lessee,  as  royalty,  a  sum  equal  to  one  dollar  ($1 .00)  for  each  acre  of  land  then  covered  hereby.  Lessee  shaH  make  like  payments 
or  tenders  at  or  before  the  end  of  each  anniversary  of  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period  if  upon  such  anniversary  this  lease  is  being 
continued  in  force  solely  by  reason  of  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  Each  such  payment  or  tender  shall  be  made  to  the  parties  who  at  the  time 
of  payment  would  be  entitled  to  receive  the  royalties  which  would  be  paid  under  this  lease  if  the  wells  were  producing,  and  may  be  deposited  in 
such  bank  as  directed  by  Lessor,  or  its  successors,  which  shall  continue  as  the  depositories,  regardless  of  changes  in  the  ownership  of  shut-in 
royalty.  If  at  any  time  that  Lessee  pays  or  tenders  shut-in  royalty,  two  or  more  parties  are,  or  claim  to  be,  entitled  to  receive  same.  Lessee  may, 
inlieu  of  any  other  method  of  payment  herein  provided,  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalty,  In  the  manner  above  specified,  either  jointly  to  sucn 
parties  or  separately  to  each  in  accordance  wrth  their  respective  ownerships  thereof,  as  Lessee  may  elect  Any  payment  hereunder  may  be  made 
by  check  or  draft  of  lessee  deposited  in  the  mail  or  delivered  to  the  party  entitled  to  receive  payment  or  to  a  depository  bank  provided  for  above  on 
or  before  the  last  date  for  payment.  Nothing  herein  shall  impair  Lessee's  right  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof.  In  the  event  of 
assignment  of  this  lease  in  whole  or  in  part,  liability  for  payment  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  on  the  then  owner  or  owners  of  this  lease,  severally 
as  to  acreage  owned  by  each. 

4.  Lessee  is  hereby  granted  the  right,  at  its  option,  to  pool  or  unitize  any  land  covered  by  this  lease  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  lease, 
and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  all  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80  surface  acres, 
plus  10%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  units  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be  enlarged  as  to 
any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance,  if  limited  to  one  or  more  of  the  following: 
(1 )  gas,  other  than  casingnead  gas,  (2)  liquid  hydrocarbons  (condensate)  which  are  not  liquids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir,  (3)  minerals  produced 
from  wells  classified  as  gas  wells  by  the  conservation  agency  having  jurisdiction.  If  larger  units  than  any  of  those  herein  permitted,  either  at  the 
time  established,  or  after  enlargement,  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  governmental  rule  or  order,  for  the  drilling  or  operation  of  a  well  at  a 
regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drilling,  or  already  drilled,  any  such  unit  may  be  established  or 
enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said  option  as  to  each  desired  unit 
by  executing  an  instrument  identifying  such  unit  and  filing  ft  for  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  this  lease  is  recorded.  Such  unit  shall  become 
effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  if  said  instrument  or  instruments  make  no  such  provision,  then  such  unit 
shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said  options  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any 
time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or  production  has  Deen  established  either  on  said 
land,  or  on  the  portion  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unitized  therewith.  A  unit  established  hereunder  shall  be  valid  and  effective 
for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  there  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold  interests  In  lands  within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively 
pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  land  shall  be  considered,  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of 
royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  Tease.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  land  covered  by  mis  lease  within  each  such  unit  (or 
to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  proportion  of  the  total  production  of  unitized 
minerals  from  the  unit,  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the  number  of  surface  acres  in  such  land  (or  in  each  such 
separate  tract)  covered  by  this  lease  within  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres  in  the  unit,  and  the  production  so  allocated  shall  be 
considered  for  all  purposes,  including  payment  or  delivery  of  royalty,  overriding  royalty  and  any  other  payments  out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire 
production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  land  to  which  allocated  in  trie  same  manner  as  though  produced  therefrom  under  the  terms  of  this  lease. 
The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees  that  the  accrual  of  royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of 
shut-in  royalties  from  a  well  on  the  unit  shad  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requiring  production  of  oil  or  gas.  The  formation  of  any  unitnereunder 
which  includes  land  not  covered  by  this  lease  shall  not  have  the  effect  of  exchanging  or  transferring  any  interest  under  this  lease  (Including,  without 
limitation,  any  shut-in  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  lease)  between  parties  owning  interests  in  land  covered  by  this  lease  and 
parties  owning  interests  in  land  not  covered  by  this  lease.  Neither  shall  it  impair  the  right  of  Lessee  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof, 
except  that  Lessee  may  not  so  release  as  to  lands  within  a  unit  while  there  are  operations  thereon  for  unitized  minerals  unless  alTpooled  leases 
are  released  as  to  lands  within  the  unit.  At  any  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force  Lessee  may  dissolve  any  unit  established  hereunder  by  filing  for 
record  in  the  public  office  where  this  lease  is  recorded  a  declaration  to  that  effect,  if  at  that  time  there  is  no  unitized  minerals  being  produced  from 
such  unit.  Any  unit  formed  may  be  amended,  re-formed,  reduced  or  enlarged  by  Lessee  at  its  election  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time  after  the 
original  forming  thereof  by  filing  an  appropriate  instrument  of  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  the  pooled  acreage  is  located.  Subject  to  the 
provisions  of  this  paragraph  4,  a  unit  once  established  hereunder  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  lease  subject  thereto  shall  remain  in  force.  If
